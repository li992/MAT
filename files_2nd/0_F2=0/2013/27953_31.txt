Notes to the IFRS consolidated financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 1 Segmental analysis The operating segments reflect the level within the Group at which key strategic and resource allocation decisions are made and the way in which operating performance is reported internally to the chief operating decision makers in the Group, being the Board.
Information is provided to the Board, which identifies operating profit split between that achieved on new business written in the period, that which derives from in-force policies and that relating to the long-term expected return on surplus assets, and therefore this split forms the reportable operating segments in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
New business revenue is reported as Single Premium Equivalent SPE, being the actual single premium plus ten times the annual regular premium for new contracts written during the year.
These revenue measures are monitored by the Board separately for each core target market.
a Segmental analysis of profit The table below shows operating profit for each year, together with a reconciliation to profit before tax: 2013 2012 For the year ended 31 December 000's 000's New business operating profit 85,678 93,871 In-force operating profit 34,278 14,263 Long-term expected return on surplus assets 11,435 3,997 Operating profit 131,391 112,131 Investment variances 8,643 3,289 Non-recurring expenditure 30,769 5,735 Other 1,201 1,156 Interest on borrowings 25,403 34,472 Profit from continuing operations before tax 82,661 67,479 Investment variances reflect: a the difference between actual performance on investment assets e. g. cash, gilts, corporate bonds and equity release over the reporting period and the investment yield allowed for in the calculation of in-force liabilities at the start of the reporting period: b the difference between the yield on investment assets allowed for in the calculation of new business profits and the actual investment performance including differences arising from investing at different yields and asset allocations than those expected when pricing new business: c the difference between actual performance on investment assets and long-term assumed return on surplus assets: and d the impact of changes in the best-estimate credit default allowance made against the Groups invested assets.
Non-recurring expenditure comprises: 15.8m expenses in respect of the Groups restructuring and IPO 2012: 2.3m : 9.8m charge related to the Groups staff share option plan which vested in full as a result of the IPO 2012: 1.5m : 4.1m of costs relating to regulatory projects Solvency II and re-engineering of financial processes 2012: 1.9m : and 1.1m of other costs including redundancy, office relocation costs and other professional fees 2012: nil.
Other losses relate to the Groups interest in distribution subsidiaries and holding company expenses.
Partnership Assurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 87 Notes to the IFRS consolidated financial statements continued 1 Segmental analysis continued The profit measure used by the Board to monitor performance is operating profit before tax, analysed between new business operating profit, in-force operating profit and the long-term expected return on surplus assets.
Each component of operating profit is explained as: New business operating profit is profit generated from new business completed in the period, calculated using actuarial assumptions applicable at the time the new business was written, and utilising a discount rate based upon investment yields on investment assets e. g. cash, gilts, corporate bonds and loans secured by mortgages used to generate the annuity quotation, net of expenses allocated against new business.
In-force operating profit is generated from the actual experience measured against the assumed experience in the actuarial basis.
The actuarial basis includes a number of assumptions, the most material of which are mortality levels, levels of default on investments, expense levels to maintain the business in-force, levels of inflation, and lapse rates for regular premium business.
In-force operating profit also includes the effect recognised in the IFRS profit arising from changes to the reported value of insurance and associated financial liabilities resulting from changes to the actuarial assumptions, valuation methods, or underlying data, made subsequent to the point-of-sale.
Return on surplus assets is the long-term, risk-adjusted, expected return on investments that are surplus to those investments that are used to back insurance liabilities.
The long-term expected return is derived from applying an average expected yield appropriate to the category of surplus assets held, and is adjusted for the best-estimate expected level of defaults on those investments.
The risk-adjusted annual yields applied to surplus assets during the period were: 2013 2012 For the year ended 31 December % p. a.

Single premium retirement policies commence at the point that the policyholder accepts a quote.
Other policies commence on the date set out in the individual policy contracts.
Premiums which have been received and for which no contract is yet in-force are classified as payables arising from insurance contracts and are included within insurance and other payables in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Where a contract has been issued but premiums have not yet been received, a debtor arising out of direct insurance operations is recognised for the expected premiums due.
Reinsurance premiums and recoveries are accounted for in the accounting period in accordance with the contractual terms of the reinsurance treaties.
Premiums exclude any taxes or duties based on premiums.
Partnership Assurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 88 New business revenue by target market reconciles to gross premiums as follows: 2013 2012 For the year ended 31 December 000's 000's Total single premium equivalent 1,228,859 1,264,637 Adjustment in respect of regular premium business 5 Premiums received in respect of equity release longevity insurance 2,522 Premiums arising from change to contract terms in 2012 69,335 109,580 Reinsurance premiums received 43 91,269 Gross premiums written 1,159,562 1,468,008 Premiums are written at the point an insurance contract comes into force.
In November 2012, the Group changed the terms of its offer to potential retirement policyholders such that an insurance contract would come into force at the point of their acceptance of the offered terms.
Previously a contract only came into force when all funds had been received from the policyholder.
For management purposes SPE continues to be recorded when all funds have been received from the policyholder.
109.6m of premium recognised in 2012 would otherwise have been recognised in 2013 and 40.3m of the premium recognised in 2013 would otherwise have been recognised in 2014 so that total premium recognised in 2013 was 69.3m lower than would otherwise have been recognised.
This also gives rise to amounts due from policyholders for premiums not yet received, as shown in note 15. d Product revenue information The following table illustrates revenue by product as required by IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
All revenues from external customers are derived from business originated in the UK, and as such no geographical information is disclosed.
The Board consider the Groups external customers to be the individual policyholders.
As such, the Group is not reliant on any individual customer.
An analysis of gross premiums written by product is set out below: 2013 2012 For the year ended 31 December 2013 000's 000's Retirement annuity 1,090,282 1,277,177 Care annuity 65,979 94,508 Protection life assurance 3,258 3,433 Other 43 92,950 Total gross premiums written 1,159,562 1,468,008 2 Basis of preparation and adoption of new and revised standards Basis of preparation Partnership Assurance Group PAG plc the Company was incorporated and registered in England and Wales on 26 February 2013 as a public company limited by shares.
The Companys registered office address is Heron Tower, 110 Bishopsgate, London, EC2N 4AY.
The principal activity of the Company is that of a holding company.
The Company and the entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries are collectively the Group.
On incorporation, the share capital of the Company was 50,000 divided into 50,000 ordinary shares of 100 pence each.
The 50,000 subscriber shares of 100 pence each were issued in consideration for an undertaking by funds managed or advised by Cinven Partners LLP Cinven to pay cash at par.
On 12 June 2013, at admission on the London Stock Exchange, the 50,000 ordinary shares of 100 pence each were subdivided into 500,000 ordinary of 10 pence shares each.
During the year, prior to admission, the Company acquired a 100% shareholding in Partnership Assurance Group Holdings PAGH and completed a number of steps as part of a reorganisation of the Group.
In addition, the Company also successfully completed the issue of new ordinary shares to raise approximately 125m through its admission via a Premium Listing on the London Stock Exchange, collectively, the Global Offer.
Details of these transactions are detailed in note 32.
Partnership Assurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 89 Notes to the IFRS consolidated financial statements continued 2 Basis of preparation and adoption of new and revised standards continued The Strategic Report on pages 1 to 37, 79, 81, 83, 86 and 87 outlines the activities, performance and future outlook of the Group.
Note 30 to the financial statements sets out the Groups policies and procedures for managing insurance and financial risk, and note 31 sets out how the Group manages its capital resources.
These financial statements comprise the consolidated annual financial statements of the Group and the individual annual financial statements of the Company made up to 31 December 2013.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included from or up to the effective date of acquisition or disposal.
Non-controlling interest in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity therein.
Control is achieved where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The presentation currency of the Group is sterling.
Unless otherwise stated, the amounts shown in the consolidated financial statements are in thousands of pounds sterling 000.
The consolidated financial statements and those of the Company have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and as endorsed by the European Union EU, and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Group has applied all IFRS standards and interpretations adopted by the EU effective for the year ended 31 December 2013.
These are the first annual consolidated financial statements of the Group and are prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted for use in the EU.
IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards requires an explanation to be presented of how the transition to IFRS has affected the reported financial position and the financial performance of the Group.
As these are the Groups first full year financial statements no transitional disclosures are necessary.
The Group in its current structure was formed on 12 June 2013 when the Company acquired PAGH from the Cinven funds, certain Directors, certain members of Senior Management and other individuals see note 32.
Whilst legally the Company is the acquirer and PAGH the acquiree, IFRS 3, Business Combinations, requires consideration as to which entitys shareholder has majority control after the combination.
The majority of shares in both entities are held by the Cinven Funds, but after the restructure the majority of the share holdings in the Company are owned by virtue of holdings that had existed in PAGH before they were swapped for share holdings in the Company.
Given this, for the purposes of IFRS 3, PAGH is treated as the accounting acquirer and the Company as the accounting acquiree.
At the point of the acquisition, the Company did not meet the test of being a business.
As the accounting acquiree is not a business, the acquisition falls outside of the scope of IFRS 3.
Accordingly, as permitted by IAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, in the absence of specific guidance in IFRS for entities involved in common control transactions, the group has elected to account for the acquisition as a group reconstruction as described under the UK GAAP accounting standard, Financial Reporting Standard 6, Acquisitions and Mergers.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared as if the transaction that gave rise to the formation of the Group had taken place at the beginning of the comparative period.
Under these principles, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared as if the Company were the holding company of PAGH from 1 January 2012, the date of the beginning of the comparative period.
The information for the year ended 31 December 2012 does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 434 of the Companies Act 2006.
As the predecessor holding company of the Group, PAGH is a Jersey company.
A copy of the statutory accounts for that year has not been delivered to the Registrar of Companies.
Deloitte LLP the auditor reported on those accounts: their report was unqualified, did not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis and by virtue of the PAGH being a Jersey company, did not contain a statement under section 498 2 or 3 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Directors have undertaken a going concern assessment in accordance with Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for UK directors of UK Companies 2009, published by the Financial Reporting Council in October 2009 as described on page 54 of the Directors Report.
Partnership Assurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 90 Significant accounting policies applied to the preparation of these financial statements are presented in the notes below, aligning disclosure of accounting policies to the item which is most directly relevant to the policy.
Adoption of new and revised standards The Group has adopted the following new standards and changes to existing standards which are relevant to the Groups operations, and became effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2013: Amendments to IFRS 7 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities these amendments require disclosure about rights to setoff financial instruments and related arrangements.
These disclosures are set out in note 30.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements.
IFRS 13 does not change when the entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under IFRS when fair value is required or permitted.
The standard is applied prospectively.
The application of IFRS 13 has not materially impacted the fair value measurements carried out by the Group.
IFRS 13 also requires specific disclosures on fair values which are set out in note 26.
Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income the amendments to IAS 1 require items of other comprehensive income to be grouped by those items that will be reclassified subsequently to profit and loss and those that will never be reclassified, together with their associated income tax.
During the period the Group had no items reported within Other Comprehensive Income, and therefore the adoption of this amendment has not affected these financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes These amendments provide a presumption that recovery of the carrying amount of an asset measured using the fair value model in IAS 40 Investment Property will, normally, be through sale.
The Group has held no investment property measured using the fair value model during the year, and therefore the adoption of this amendment has not affected these financial statements.
Annual Improvements 20092011 cycle Amendments to five standards, IFRS 1 First Time Adoption, IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, IAS 32, Financial Instruments Presentation, and IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting.
The amendments clarify existing guidance and have no impact on these financial statements.
Partnership Assurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 91 Notes to the IFRS consolidated financial statements continued 2 Basis of preparation and adoption of new and revised standards continued The following new or revised or amended standards, in issue, were not yet effective, or in some cases not yet endorsed by the EU.
The Group has not early adopted any of these standards.
Standard Applicable for financial periods Interpretation Content amendment beginning on or after IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements 1 January 2014 IFRS 10 establishes a new definition of control to be applied when determining which entities must be consolidated.
This definition is based on the concept of power, exposure or rights to variable returns and their linkage.
This differs from the current definition in IAS 27 which is based on the power to determine financial and operating policies.
The standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Groups profit before tax for the year or equity.
The standard has been endorsed by the EU.
IFRS 11 Joint arrangements 1 January 2014 IFRS 11 defines two types of joint arrangements joint ventures and joint operations based on how rights and obligations are shared by parties to the arrangements.
The standard sets out the required accounting treatment for each type of joint arrangement.
IFRS 12 Disclosures of interests in other entities 1 January 2014 IFRS 12 requires additional disclosure for investments, in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and structured entities.
The standard is expected to have a significant impact on the level of disclosure in respect of subsidiaries and joint arrangements.
IAS 27 Separate financial statements 1 January 2014 Removes requirements superseded by IFRS 10.
IAS 28 Associates and joint ventures 1 January 2014 Amendment to bring joint ventures into the scope of IAS 28 and to require equity accounting for these entities.
The amendment is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group financial statements.
The amendment has been endorsed by the EU.
IFRS 10, Investment Entities 1 January 2014 IFRS 12 Amendments to provide investment entities an exemption from the consolidation of particular and IAS 27 subsidiaries.
The Group is not an investment entity, as defined in the amendments, and therefore the amendment is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group financial statements.
IAS 32 Financial Instruments Presentation 1 January 2014 This amendment clarifies the requirements for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities on the statement of financial position.
The amendment is not expected to have significant implications for the Group financial statements.
IAS 36 Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets 1 January 2014 Amendments which reduce the circumstances in which the recoverable amount of assets is required to be disclosed and clarification and amendments to the disclosures required.
IAS 39 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting 1 January 2014 Amendment to clarify the circumstances in which hedge accounting can be continued if derivatives are novated, to facilitate the novation of derivatives to a central counterparty.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018 IFRS 9 will replace IAS 39: Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement.
The impact of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the Group will depend on the finalisation of the standard and the interaction of the requirements of IFRS 9 with the IASBs on-going insurance contracts accounting project.
The standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU.
Partnership Assurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 92 3 Net investment income Investment income comprises interest received on financial investments, realised investment gains and losses and movements in unrealised gains and losses.
Expenses and charges are included on an accruals basis.
Realised gains and losses on investments are calculated as the difference between net sales proceeds less costs of sale and original cost.
Unrealised gains and losses on investments represent the difference between the valuation at the balance sheet date and their purchase price or, if they have been previously valued, their valuation at the last balance sheet date.
The movement in unrealised gains and losses recognised in the year also includes the reversal of unrealised gains and losses recognised in earlier accounting periods in respect of investment disposals in the current period.

They are allocated to particular categories of business based on available information.
Acquisition expenses are not deferred as they are largely recovered at inception through profit margins.

7 Income tax Income tax comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to other comprehensive income.
Similarly, income tax is charged or credited to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged directly to equity.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Provision is made for taxation on taxable profits for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date together with adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences arising, which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Temporary differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements except for differences arising from the initial recognition of goodwill and the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that it will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset, only if a legally enforceable right exists to set-off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxation authority and that authority permits the Group to make a single net payment.

This change has little impact on the tax arrangements of the Group as it has treated all insurance profits as pension business rather than Basic Life Assurance and General Annuity Business, BLAGAB, or any other tax category in its corporation tax calculations since 2007.
Under this new regime, 14.1m of carried forward unutilised tax losses which arose in PLACL, the main life subsidiary of the Group, on BLAGAB business as a result of excess management expenses, cannot be utilised after 31 December 2013 since taxable BLAGAB profits will not arise.
The remaining 7.3m of carried forward unutilised tax losses related to a Group entity which became dormant in 2013 so that future taxable profits will not arise.
No deferred tax asset is recognised for any of these losses because the Group does not expect to be able to utilise them.
Partnership Assurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 95 Notes to the IFRS consolidated financial statements continued 8 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated using the earnings attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares, including share options.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is based on the following data: 2013 2012 For the year ended 31 December 000's 000's Profit for the year 59,421 50,206 Less non-controlling interests 44 13 Profit attributable to equity holders of the Parent 59,465 50,193 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares: Share options Diluted profit attributable to equity holders of the Parent 59,465 50,193 All of PAGHs A, B and C shares see note 32 were exchanged for PAG plc shares on 12 June 2013.
For the purpose of the earnings per share calculation, the weighted average number of share shown below has been calculated as if the exchange of these PAGH shares had occurred at the beginning of the comparative period.
2013 2012 Number of Number of For the year ended 31 December shares shares Basic weighted average number of shares 346,138,910 279,527,196 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares: Share options 1,276,243 2,133,025 Diluted weighted average number of shares 347,415,153 281,660,221 The options granted by the PAGH trust in respect of the ESOP scheme have a dilutive effect, up to the date of the IPO when these options vested.
As detailed in note 19, the Group implemented a number of new employee share-based plans following admission on the London Stock Exchange.
The Share Incentive Plan SIP has a potential dilutive effect.
No decisions have been made as to the method of settlement of the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP or the share element of the Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP.
The weighted average number of shares calculation above has been derived on the assumption that the vesting of shares in respect of the LTIP and DSBP awards will be settled with shares bought externally from the market and hence will not be dilutive.
Partnership Assurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 96 9 Property, plant and equipment Assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of tangible assets over their estimated useful life on a straight-line basis.
The principal rates used for this purpose are as follows: For the year ended 31 December 2013 2012 Computer equipment 33% 33% Fixtures and fittings 10% to 20% 20% Office refit 10% to 50% 20% to 50% The range of principal rates used changed during 2013 as new assets came into use.

Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to each of the cash-generating units CGU that are expected to benefit from the combination.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, or when circumstances or events indicate there may be uncertainty over this value.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU to which the goodwill relates.
When the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and is not subsequently reversed.
2013 2012 000's 000's At 1 January 126,207 126,207 At 31 December 126,207 126,207 The goodwill arose on acquisition of the PLACL operations and the value represented the potential of this business to generate value from future sales.
Therefore the goodwill is allocated to the new business cash generating unit, the scope of which is identical to the new business operating segment described in note 1.
The carrying value of goodwill has been tested for impairment at the balance sheet date.
Value in use has been determined as the present value of expected future cash flows associated with new business.
The cash flows used in this calculation are consistent with those monitored by management.
Expected future new business cash flows are based on financial plans approved by management, covering a period of three years from the balance sheet date.
A rate of 10% has been applied to discount cash flows to a present value.
No impairment has been recognised in 2013 or 2012.
Partnership Assurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 97 Notes to the IFRS consolidated financial statements continued 11 Other intangible assets Other intangible assets comprise intellectual property and software development costs.
The intellectual property asset comprises of specific mortality tables derived from data collected over an extended period and are deemed to have an indefinite life.
Consequently no amortisation is charged against its carrying value.
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable software products, controlled by the Group, are recognised as intangible assets when it can be demonstrated that it is technically feasible to complete the product so that it is available for use and will generate probable future economic benefits.
Software development costs have a finite useful life and are amortised using the straight-line method over three to five years.
Impairment review of other intangible assets The carrying amounts of intangible assets with finite expected useful economic lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
A review for indicators of impairment is conducted annually.
The carrying amounts of intangible assets with indefinite expected useful economic lives are tested for impairment at least annually, or when circumstances or events indicate there may be uncertainty over this value.
An impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its net selling price fair value less selling costs and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit, or company of units, to which the asset belongs.
2013 2012 000's 000's Intellectual property cost and carrying amount: At 1 January 3,100 3,100 At 31 December 3,100 3,100 Software development cost: At 1 January 11,750 4,365 Additions at cost 7,696 7,385 Assets written off 1,641 At 31 December 17,805 11,750 Software development accumulated amortisation: At 1 January 2,507 1,244 Charge for the year 1,997 1,263 At 31 December 4,504 2,507 Total intangible assets at 1 January 12,343 6,221 Total intangible assets at 31 December 16,401 12,343 The value of intellectual property has been determined based upon an estimate of the costs to employ adequately skilled individuals over an appropriate period of time to develop intellectual property of a similar nature sufficient to enable the Group to replicate the estimated future cash flows and profits deriving from that intellectual property.
The intellectual property is continually updated through the collection of further data, updated analyses, and conversion into new and more detailed underwriting manuals and mortality tables.
For this reason, the intangible asset is deemed to have an indefinite life, and consequently, no amortisation is provided against the value of the intangible asset.
The carrying value of the intangible asset is tested for impairment at each reporting date, and is allocated to the new business cash-generating unit, the scope of which is identical to the new business operating segment described in note 1.
The method and assumptions used in this test are identical to those applied in the goodwill impairment test, as set out in note 10.
No impairment of intellectual property has been recognised in 2012 or 2013.
The amortisation period for software development costs is three to five years.
During the year the intangible assets relating to software development were reviewed for impairment.
As a result of this certain software assets were identified as no longer being expected to generate economic benefits for the Group.
No other indicators of impairment existed in respect of software development costs as at the balance sheet date.
Partnership Assurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 98 12 Financial assets Financial assets classification The Group classifies its financial assets as financial investments, loans secured by mortgages and derivative financial assets at fair value through profit and loss.
The category of fair value through profit and loss has two sub-categories: those that meet the definition as being held for trading: and those that the Group chooses to designate as fair value.
The fair value through profit and loss is selected as the Groups strategy is to manage its financial assets, as a portfolio, on a fair value basis.
Financial investments Purchases and sales of debt securities and other fixed income securities are recognised on the trade date, which is the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the assets, at their fair values.
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.
These investments are derecognised when the contractual rights to receive cash flows from the investments expire, or where the investments have been transferred, together with substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
Debt securities and other fixed income securities are subsequently carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
The fair values of debt securities are based on quoted bid prices, or based on modelled prices using observable market inputs where quoted bid-prices are not available.
Investments in Commodity Trade Finance loans are carried at fair value on initial recognition and are recognised when the cash is advanced for the trade.
Commodity Trade Finance loans are subsequently carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
The fair value of these investments is not based on observable market data.
Loans secured by mortgages Loans secured by mortgages are recognised when the cash is advanced to borrowers at their fair values.
These loans are derecognised when the contractual rights to receive cash flows from the investments expire, or where the investments have been transferred, together with substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
Loans secured by mortgages are subsequently carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
The fair value of loans secured by mortgages is initially deemed to be the transaction price and subsequently marked to model.
The underlying model follows the methodology used to establish transaction prices.
It uses longevity assumptions to derive expected cash flows and the Black-Scholes option pricing methodology to establish the value of the no-negative equity guarantee that is embedded in the product.
The discount rates that are applied to cash flows to produce fair value are based on long dated swaps adjusted so that they would produce transaction date prices on the date of transaction.
Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rates, inflation, credit default and foreign exchange rate risk, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps, credit default swaps and inflation swaps.
Derivative contracts are traded either through an exchange or over-the-counter OTC.
OTC derivative contracts are individually negotiated between contracting parties and can include options, swaps, caps and floors.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date that a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The fair values are obtained from quoted market prices or, if these are not available, by using standard valuation techniques based on discounted cash flow models or option pricing models.
All derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and liabilities when the fair values are negative.
Premiums paid for derivatives are recorded as an asset in the consolidated statement of financial position at the date of purchase representing their fair value at that date.

13 Principal Group undertakings Foreign currencies Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The functional currency of each of the Groups material entities is sterling.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Groups presentation currency.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial period.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in net investment income in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Set out below are the principal subsidiary and joint venture undertakings of Partnership Assurance Group plc.
All of the companies are incorporated in England and Wales unless otherwise indicated.

Pension Annuity Limited On 3 June 2011 the Group entered into a joint venture agreement with Digitalis Retail 1 Limited.
As a result of this agreement, the Group acquired 49 shares in Pension Annuity Limited the joint venture entity representing 49% of its issued share capital, for a total consideration of 150,000.
On 9 March 2012, the Group acquired the remaining 51 shares in Pension Annuity Limited from Digitalis Retail 1 Limited for a total consideration of 30,000, at which time Pension Annuity Limited became a wholly owned subsidiary.
The operations of Pension Annuity Limited were discontinued during 2012 and on 29 January 2013, the Company was dissolved and removed from the register of companies.
15 Insurance and other receivables Insurance and reinsurance debtors represent amounts receivable after commencement of the contract which have not been settled at the balance sheet date.

18 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits held on call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less.
Bank overdrafts are included in cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement.
2013 2012 As at 31 December 000's 000's Short-term bank deposits 94,723 151,529 Cash at bank and in hand 18,018 14,744 Total cash and cash equivalents 112,741 166,273 19 Share-based payments Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing services are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date.
The fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest.
At each period end, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Where the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair value of those instruments, measured immediately before and after the modification, is also charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the remaining vesting period.
The share-based payment expense recognised for employee services receivable during the year is as follows: 2013 2012 For the year ended 31 December 000's 000's Employee Share Option Plan 8,378 1,500 Long Term Incentive Plan 432 Deferred Share Bonus Plan 374 Share Incentive Plan 65 Save as you earn Plan 75 Total expense 9,324 1,500 Partnership Assurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 102 i Employee Share Option Plan ESOP In 2009, the Group implemented an Employee Share Option Plan ESOP to retain and motivate its employees.
Awards under this plan were in the form of options to acquire shares of PAGH, the top holding company of the Group at that point in time, for an exercise price equivalent to the market value of those shares at the grant date.
The expense recognised in other operating expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the period to 31 December 2013 is 8.4m 6.9m net of tax 31 December 2012: 1.5m.
As shares awarded under the plan were unlisted at the grant date as their fair value could not be measured reliably, therefore the value, and expense, relating to this scheme was measured at its intrinsic value, remeasured at each reporting date.
2013 2012 Number of Number of For the year ended 31 December share options share options Outstanding at the beginning of the year 23,953 26,285 Granted during the year 7,910 Forfeited during the year 2,332 Exercised during the year 31,863 Outstanding at the end of the year 23,953 During the year the terms of the ESOP were modified such that the options to acquire shares of PAGH were exchanged for options to acquire shares in PAG plc of equal value at the date of the modification.
No incremental fair value arose as a result of this modification.
Following admission on the London Stock Exchange, the awards under the ESOP vested in full and were exercised immediately.
The settlement of these ESOPs was funded by the sale of 2,706,399 shares from the PAGH EBT.
The weighted average exercise price for the awards exercised in the year was 0.20.
The share price at the date of exercise was 3.85.
There are no outstanding options under the ESOP as at 31 December 2013.
Following admission, the Group has implemented the following employee share-based payment plans: ii Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The Group made awards under the LTIP to Executive Directors and other senior executives in June 2013.
The LTIP awards will be subject to the satisfaction of the following performance conditions which will determine the proportion if any of the LTIP award to vest at the end of the performance period.
50% of these LTIP awards are subject to a performance condition relating to the growth in the Groups operating profit over a performance period of three financial years.
If operating profit for the financial year ending 31 December 2015 exceeds operating profit for the financial year ended 31 December 2012 by 33.1%, 10% of the LTIP award will vest.
The maximum 50% will vest if operating profit for the financial year ending 31 December 2015 exceeds operating profit for the financial year ended 31 December 2012 by at least 64.3%.
Payment will be on a sliding scale in between these points.
The remaining 50% of these LTIP awards will be subject to a condition measuring the Companys total shareholder return TSR performance relative to the constituent companies of the FTSE 250 index excluding investment trusts, mining companies and oil and gas producers over the period from admission to 31 December 2015.
Vesting of 10% of the LTIP award will occur for median performance and the maximum 50% at upper quartile performance or above, with straight line vesting in between these points.
The awards are accounted for as equity-settled schemes.
The total value of these schemes is measured at each award date based upon the number of shares expected to vest awarded and the expense charge is recognised over the course of the vesting period.
At 31 December 2013 there were 1,248,636 awards in issue and a charge of 431,848 has been recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income with a corresponding increase in equity in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The weighted average fair value of awards made during the year was 2.67.
The fair value of the award was measured with reference to the quoted share price of PAG plc at the measurement date.
The performance condition relating to total shareholder return was incorporated into the measure of fair value through a stochastic model incorporating the historical TSR volatility of comparable listed entities.
The performance condition relating to operating profit over performance and other non-market vesting conditions are incorporated into the estimate of the total number of awards expected to vest.
This expectation is reviewed and, if necessary, revised at each reporting date.
iii Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP Effective from June 2013, one-third of the bonuses earned by Executive Directors and certain other senior executives in respect of the Companys annual bonus arrangements are deferred into shares in PAG plc.
The remaining two-thirds of the awards will continue to be paid in cash.
The share element of the bonus awards will vest on the third anniversary of the date of the determination of the bonus in respect of which they were granted.
Partnership Assurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 103 Notes to the IFRS consolidated financial statements continued 19 Share-based payments continued The share element of the bonus awards are accounted for as equity-settled schemes.
The fair value of the awards are calculated at each award date based on one-third of the estimated annual bonus payout and the expense charge is recognised over the course of the vesting period.
A charge of 374,072 has been recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in respect of these schemes for the year to 31 December 2013 with a corresponding increase in equity in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The weighted average fair value of awards made during the year was 3.85.
Non-market vesting conditions are incorporated into the estimate of the total number of awards expected to vest.
iv Share Incentive Plan SIP The Company has made a one-off award of 1,000 of free shares immediately after admission to all eligible employees under a new all-employee share plan, known as the Share Incentive Plan SIP.
These shares will be forfeited if the employees cease employment except in good leaver circumstances within the first three years from the date of the award.
Awards made under this plan entitle these employees to: a conditional right to acquire shares in PAG plc at no cost: an option to acquire shares in PAG plc at no cost: or a right to receive a cash amount which relates to the value of certain number of notional ordinary shares.
These awards are accounted for as equity-settled schemes.
The fair value of these schemes is calculated at each award date based upon the number of shares awarded multiplied by the share price at grant date and expensed over the vesting period.
A charge of 65,277 has been recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in respect of this scheme for the year to 31 December 2013 with a corresponding increase in equity in the consolidated statement of financial position.
v Save As You Earn SAYE share option plan In July 2013, the Group introduced a SAYE scheme.
Under this plan, employees may elect to save up to 250 per month over a three or five year period.
The amount of ordinary shares of PAG plc over which the option is granted will be determined at the grant date to reflect the amount that each employee has agreed to save under the Share Save contract.
A charge of 74,734 has been recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in respect of this scheme for the year to 31 December 2013 with a corresponding increase in equity in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The weighted average fair value of the awards made during the year was 18,546.
The fair value of the awards has been determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model.
Key assumptions within this valuation model were: expected share price volatility 43%, expected dividend yield 1%, risk-free interest rate 2%, expected option life three years and five years, exercise price 3.57, and share price at the measurement date 4.45.
Partnership Assurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 104 20 Insurance liabilities and reinsurance assets Insurance liabilities Insurance contracts are defined as those containing significant insurance risk if, and only if, an insured event would cause an insurer to pay significant additional benefits in any scenario, excluding scenarios that lack commercial substance, at the inception of the contract.
Such contracts remain insurance contracts until all rights and obligations are extinguished or expire.
The Groups long-term insurance contracts include annuities to fund retirement income, annuities to fund care fees immediate needs and deferred, long-term care insurance and whole of life and term protection insurance.
These contracts are expected to remain in force for an extended period of time, and insure events associated with human life.
One of the purposes of insurance is to enable policyholders to protect themselves against future uncertain events such as death or specific types of illness.
Insurance companies accept the transfer of uncertainty from policyholders and seek to add value through the aggregation and management of these risks.
As a consequence of this uncertainty, estimation techniques are employed by suitably qualified personnel in computing the levels of provisions held against such uncertainty.
The insurance liabilities, which are also referred to as the long-term business provision and policyholder reserves elsewhere in this report, are determined by the Partnership Board on the advice of the Group's Actuarial Function Holder on the modified statutory basis using recognised actuarial methods with due regard to the actuarial principles set out in the PRAs formerly the FSAs Insurance Prudential Sourcebook.
In particular, a prospective gross premium valuation method has been adopted for major classes of business.
Although the process for the establishment of insurance liabilities follows specified rules and guidelines, the provisions that result from the process remain uncertain.
As a consequence of this uncertainty, the eventual value of claims could vary from the amounts provided to cover future claims.
The Group seeks to provide for appropriate levels of contract liabilities taking known facts and experiences into account but nevertheless such provisions remain uncertain.
The estimation process used in determining insurance liabilities involves projecting future annuity payments and the costs of maintaining the contracts.
For non-annuity contracts, the long-term business provision is determined as the sum of the discounted value of future benefit payments and future administration expenses less the expected value of premiums payable under the contract.
The key sensitivities are the assumed level of interest rates and the mortality experience.
At the balance sheet date, provision is made for all notified claims plus an estimate for those claims that have been incurred but not reported.
The principal assumptions underlying the calculation of insurance liabilities are set out below.
Reinsurance assets Long-term business is ceded to reinsurers under contracts to transfer part or all of one or more of the following risks: mortality, morbidity, investment, persistency and expenses.
The benefits to which the Group are entitled under its reinsurance contracts held are recognised as reinsurance assets.
These assets consist of short-term balances due from reinsurers classified within Insurance and other receivables as well as longer-term receivables that are dependent on the expected benefits arising under the related re-insured contracts.
Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a consistent manner with insurance liabilities, and are classified as reinsurance assets.
Some contracts, which provide for the transfer of significant risk, are also structured to provide financing.
When, under such contracts, financing components are to be repaid in future accounting periods, the amount outstanding under the contract at the balance sheet date are classified as payables arising from reinsurance contracts and included within insurance and other payables in the consolidated statement of financial position.
If the reinsurance asset were impaired, the Group would adjust the carrying amount accordingly and recognise that impairment loss in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
A reinsurance asset is impaired if there is objective evidence, as a result of an event that occurred after initial recognition of the reinsurance asset, that the Group may not receive all amounts due to it under the terms of the contract, and the event has a reliably measurable impact on the amounts that the Group will receive from the reinsurer.
Liability adequacy test At the end of each reporting period, liability adequacy tests are performed to ensure the adequacy of the insurance liabilities.
In performing these tests, current best-estimates of future contractual cash flows and claims handling and administration expenses, as well as investment income from assets backing such liabilities, are used.
Any deficiency is immediately charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Claims Maturity claims and annuities are charged against revenue when due for payment.
Death claims and all other claims are accounted for when notified.
Claims reinsurance recoveries are accounted for in the same period as the related claim.
Where reinsurance treaties are recaptured, amounts received to compensate for the transfer of risk from the reinsurer are accounted for when received or, if earlier, on the date the treaty ceases to be included within the calculation of the reinsurers share of long-term business provision.

An allowance for risk is included by making an explicit deduction from the yields on debt and other fixed income securities based on historical default experience and expected experience of each asset class.
The allowance for credit risk has been set at 47% 2012: 37% of the spread on the yield of the corporate bonds over the yield on gilts.
The changes in the valuation discount rates at each period end reflect changes in yields on the supporting assets and changes made to the allowance for risk.
The mortality tables used have been adjusted to reflect additional mortality based on the proprietary data held by the Group developed from actual experience incurred.
The valuation basis used to calculate the long-term business provisions includes an allowance for future expenses.
b Movements Movements in the carrying amount of insurance liabilities and reinsurance assets are explained as follows: Gross Reinsurance Net For the year ended 31 December 2013 000's 000's 000's At 1 January 2013 3,723,298 2,412,551 1,310,747 Increase in liability from new business 1,038,011 678,827 359,184 Release of in-force liability 111,110 75,012 36,098 Release of liability due to recorded deaths 69,967 31,040 38,927 Economic changes 209,299 144,164 65,135 Non-economic changes 25,847 1,609 24,238 Other 2,502 1,196 1,306 At 31 December 2013 4,347,588 2,840,749 1,506,839 Partnership Assurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 106 Gross Reinsurance Net For the year ended 31 December 2012 000's 000's 000's At 1 January 2012 2,158,537 1,352,886 805,651 Increase in liability from new business 1,324,979 532,265 792,714 Release of in-force liability 48,465 30,083 18,382 Release of liability due to recorded deaths 61,815 36,098 25,717 Recapture and restructure of reinsurance treaties 396,213 396,213 Economic changes 335,573 200,464 135,109 Non-economic changes 11,266 11,266 Other 3,223 3,096 6,319 At 31 December 2012 3,723,298 2,412,551 1,310,747 The impact of the recapture and restructure of reinsurance treaties has been calculated as if both transactions occurred on 31 December 2012 before the impact of year end basis changes.

Sensitivity analysis is provided below to illustrate the impact of changes in key assumptions.
Sensitivity factor Description of sensitivity factor applied Interest rate & investment return The impact of a change in the market interest rates by 1% e. g. if a current interest rate is 5%, the impact of an immediate change to 4% and 6% respectively.
The test allows consistently for similar changes to investment returns and movements in the market backing fixed interest securities.
Credit spreads The impact of credit spreads widening by 50bps with a corresponding pro-rated change to defaults.
Expenses The impact of an increase in maintenance expenses by 10%.
Mortality rates The impact of a decrease in mortality rates by 5%.
Property values The impact of an immediate decrease in the value of properties by 10%.
The test allows for the impact on the annuity liabilities arising from any change in yield on the equity release assets used to back the liabilities.
Voluntary redemptions The impact of an increase in voluntary redemption rates on equity release loans by 10%.
Partnership Assurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 107 Notes to the IFRS consolidated financial statements continued 20 Insurance liabilities and reinsurance assets continued The table below demonstrates the effect of a change in a key assumption whilst other assumptions remain unchanged.
In reality, such an occurrence is unlikely due to correlation between the assumptions and other factors.
It should also be noted that these sensitivities are nonlinear, and larger or smaller impacts should not be interpolated or extrapolated from these results.
The sensitivity analyses do not take into consideration that the Group's assets and liabilities are actively managed and may vary at the time that any actual market movement occurs.

22 Financial liabilities As well as derivative financial liabilities, the Group carries financial liabilities where assets under specific reinsurance treaties are legally and physically deposited back to the Group by reinsurers.
Financial liabilities are classified as at fair value through profit and loss.
As such, financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value on the same date that the value of underlying deposited assets is recognised and are subsequently remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date.
The net gain or loss recognised incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability.
Fair value is determined as the amount payable discounted from the first date that the amount is required to be paid.
A financial liability including subordinated debt and external borrowings is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it, is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.

Partnership Assurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 108 23 External borrowings External borrowings are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Issue costs are capitalised and charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the life of the loan using the effective interest method.
Interest payable is accounted for on an accruals basis in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Gains and losses on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of external borrowings are recognised respectively in the income and interest expenses and charges.

The interest rate on these notes was 12% p. a. and was payable at six monthly intervals starting on 30 June 2009 at the discretion of the Group.
In the event that interest payments were not made, the amounts due accrued interest at the same rate from the date payment was due.
Additional loan notes totalling 6.9m were issued during the period 31 December 2012: 25.6m in settlement of interest accrued.
On 21 August 2012, C loan notes totalling 50m were issued by the Group to the Fourth Cinven Funds.
The interest rate was fixed at 22% p. a. and was payable at six monthly intervals starting 30 June 2013.
In the event that interest payments were not made, the amounts due began to accrue interest at the same rate from the date payment was due.
Vendor loan notes totalling 5m were issued by the Group on 5 August 2008 in connection with the acquisition of the former Group by the Cinven funds.
The interest rate was fixed at 9% p. a. and was payable at six monthly intervals starting 30 June 2009.
A bank loan of 70m was taken out on 21 August 2012.
The bank loan carried a fixed interest rate at LIBOR plus 4% p. a.
Debt issuance costs of 1,925,000 were capitalised, of which 1,491,000 was amortised in the period 2012: 160,000.
As set out in note 32, as a result of the reorganisation steps undertaken before the admission of the Company to the London Stock Exchange, the A, B, C and Vendor loan notes, the bank loan and accrued interest were settled in the period.
The Group hedged its exposure to LIBOR, using an interest rate swap, whereby LIBOR payments were swapped for a fixed interest payment of 0.7% p. a. for two years from the date the loan was taken.
Interest was payable at three monthly instalments, in advance, starting 21 November 2012.
Effective 21 June 2013, this interest rate swap arrangement was terminated.

26 Financial instruments fair value methodology All financial instruments, with the exception of external borrowings are classified at fair value through profit and loss.
In accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value measurement, financial instruments at fair value have been classified into three categories.
Level 1: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices : and Level 3: Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs.
Partnership Assurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 110 An analysis of financial assets and liabilities held at fair value in accordance with the fair value hierarchy is set out below.
All these financial assets and liabilities relate to recurring fair value measurements.
There are no non-recurring fair value measurements as at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012.

During 2012, all the financial investments, with the exception of Commodity Trade Finance CTF loans were reclassified from Level 2 to Level 1.
Since the financial crisis in 2008, there has been a continual improvement in the level of liquidity in the fixed and variable rate securities markets, and having considered this during 2012, the Directors considered that the market is sufficiently active to allow classification of these financial investments as Level 1.
There are no transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3 during the period to 31 December 2013.

Partnership Assurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 112 a Financial investments All financial investments are designated at fair value through profit and loss.
All financial investments excluding commodity trade finance are listed.
In assessing the fair value of the debt securities and other fixed income securities, the Directors have relied upon values provided by an independent third party which specialises in providing such values to companies.
The third party provides prices based upon quoted market prices, or where not available, modelled prices using observable market inputs.
At 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012, 100% of the values provided were based on quoted market prices that are observable for the asset or liability.
Due to the short-term nature of the commodity trade finance CTF loans, the fair value of these instruments is estimated as the principal amount borrowed plus accrued interest from the date of acquisition, adjusted for incurred and expected defaults.
These CTF loans are considered to be Level 3 within the valuation category prescribed by IFRS 13 as the inputs to the fair value calculation are not based on observable market data, and includes the Companys own assumptions.
The change in the fair value of Level 3 financial instruments from period to period is analysed into loans advanced, loans repaid redemptions, and interest accrued, with the remaining balance representing fair value measurement gains and losses recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Interest rate: The interest rate used in estimating the fair value of the CTF loans as at 31 December 2013 was 12.0% p. a.
b Loans secured by mortgages The fair value recognised in the financial statements for loans secured by mortgages is determined using a marked to model valuation technique where a significant proportion of inputs are not based on observable market data and so these assets are considered to be Level 3 within the valuation category prescribed by IFRS 13.
The valuation model discounts the expected future cash flows using an interest rate swap curve with an additional spread or yield factor minus the cost of the no-negative equity guarantee.
The no-negative equity guarantee represents an embedded guarantee that the repayment of the loan cannot exceed the value of the property at the time of repayment.
Although such valuations are sensitive to various estimates, it is considered that only the discount rate and no-negative equity guarantee assumptions would have significant impact the fair value.
Discount rate: Loans secured by mortgages are valued using the swap rate appropriate to the term of each contract with adjustment to reflect the credit and liquidity risk associated with such long dated contracts.
The risk adjusted swap rate for the portfolio weighted by average value at 31 December 2013 was 6.24% 31 December 2012: 5.89%.
No-negative equity guarantee: The fair value of loans secured by mortgages takes into account an explicit provision in respect of the nonegative equity guarantee which is calculated using a variant of the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The key assumptions used to derive the value of the no-negative equity guarantee include property growth, volatility and over-valuation.
The property growth and volatility assumed at 31 December 2013 were 5.5% 31 December 2012: 5.5% and 13% 31 December 2012: 13% respectively.
The over-valuation assumption used as at 31 December 2013 was 22% 31 December 2012: 17%.
The value of the no-negative equity guarantee as at 31 December 2013 was 67.3m 31 December 2012: 27.6m.
The valuation technique that the Group uses to assess the fair value of loans secured by mortgages is consistent with that used to derive the prices applied at the initial transaction.
As such, there is no difference between the fair value of loans secured by equity release mortgages at initial recognition and the amount that would have been determined at that date using the valuation technique.
c Derivative assets and liabilities The estimated fair value of derivative instruments reflects the estimated amount the Group would receive or pay in an arm's length transaction.
All the derivatives held at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 were purchased over-the-counter.
The Groups derivative assets and liabilities largely relate to forward currency positions, interest rate swaps and inflation swaps.
Forward currency positions: Forward currency exchange contracts are priced from independent third parties.
Interest rate swaps: The fair value of the interest rate swaps is derived using an interest rate swap pricing model, using a time series of historical LIBOR rates, an applicable zero coupon interest rate swap curve to derive future cash flows forward curve and an applicable zero coupon interest rate swap curve to discount future cash flows discount curve as inputs.
The forward curve is used by the pricing model to determine the future LIBOR rates to be applied in the calculation of the floating leg cash flow s. The discount curve is used to calculate the present value of the future cash flow s of both the fixed and floating legs of the swap and its composition is driven by the terms of the Credit Support Annex under which the swap is traded.
Partnership Assurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 113 Notes to the IFRS consolidated financial statements continued 26 Financial instruments fair value methodology continued Inflation swaps: The fair value of the inflation swaps is derived using the inflation swap pricing model, using a time series of historical inflation index levels, a zero coupon swap inflation expectation curve, an inflation seasonality model and a zero coupon interest rate swap curve as inputs.
The inflation swap pricing model generates a future cash flow for both the fixed and inflation legs of a swap for which a present value is determined using zero coupon interest rate swap curve.
The derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis in the consolidated statement of financial position.
All over-the-counter derivative transactions are conducted under standardised ISDA International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc master agreements and the Group has collateral agreements between the individual Group entities and relevant counterparties in place under each of these market master agreements.
As at 31 December 2013, the Group had pledged 10.1m 31 December 2012: 13.8m and held collateral of 0.9m 31 December 2012: 0.5m in respect of over-the-counter derivative transactions.
d Payables arising from reinsurance contracts The fair value recognised in the financial statements is determined using a marked to model valuation technique where not all inputs are based on observable market data and so these liabilities are considered to be Level 3 within the valuation category prescribed by IFRS 13.
The valuation model discounts the expected future cash flows using a discount rate, derived from the assets hypothecated to back these liabilities at a product level.
As payables arising from reinsurance contracts do not have a single fixed maturity date it is not possible to determine an amount that would be contractually required to pay at maturity.
Discount rate: The key inputs to the derivation of the discount rate include market observable gross redemption yields, contractual investment expenses and an allowance for credit risk on a best-estimate basis.
The discount rate used as at 31 December 2013 for Retirement and Care was 4.95% and 1.97% respectively 31 December 2012: 4.53% and 2.45% respectively.

No amounts are outstanding in respect of these contributions at the end of the year.
The Group is a Participating Employer for a money purchase group personal pension plan.
The assets of the plan are held separately from those of the Group.
The Group does not provide a final salary plan.
29 Deposits received from reinsurers Financial assets arising from the payment of reinsurance premiums, less the repayment of claims, to certain reinsurers in relation to specific treaties are legally and physically deposited back with the Group.
Although the funds are managed by the Group as the Group controls the investment of the asset, no future benefits accrue to the Group as any returns on the deposits are paid to reinsurers.
Consequently the deposits are not recognised as assets of the Group and the investment income they produce does not accrue to the Group.
In addition, the Group has trust agreements with two reinsurers 2012: two whereby the assets are held in trust in order to fully fund the reinsurers obligations under the reinsurance treaty.
As the Group has no control over these funds and does not accrue any future benefit these funds are not recognised as assets of the Group.
2013 2012 As at 31 December 000's 000's Deposits managed by the Group 272,493 330,012 Deposits held in trust 241,699 192,781 Total deposits received from reinsurers 514,192 522,793 30 Management of insurance and financial risk The Group issues contracts that accept insurance risk in return for a premium.
In addition the Group is exposed to financial risk through its financial assets, financial liabilities, reinsurance assets and insurance liabilities.
In particular, the key financial risk is that the proceeds from financial assets are not sufficient to fund the obligations arising from contracts with policyholders.
The most important components of this financial risk are interest rate risk and credit risk.
The Group is not exposed to any equity price risk and to currency risk only to an immaterial extent.
a Insurance risk a1 Underwriting, pricing and reserving risk Underwriting and pricing risk is the risk that inappropriate business will be written, or an inappropriate premium will be charged for that business.
Reserving risk is the risk that the insurance liabilities have been calculated incorrectly, or the assumptions used in the calculations are incorrect.
As the Group's insurance business is specifically targeted at people with medical conditions affecting their life expectancy, or people seeking to fund domiciliary or residential care, the underwriting risk is managed through the use of highly trained, and qualified underwriting staff, together with tailored underwriting manuals designed to specifically cover a large array of medical conditions.
The Group has developed its own proprietary underwriting manuals for retirement annuity business and those seeking care funding, based on industry standard mortality tables modified to take account of experience data recorded by the Group and its predecessor organisations.
The assumptions used in the reserving for future policyholder payments are set based on available market and experience data, on the advice of the Actuarial Function Holder.
The assumptions are approved by the Partnership Board.
The insurance liabilities are calculated using recognised actuarial methods with due regard to the actuarial principles set out in the Prudential Regulation Authoritys Prudential sourcebooks.
a2 Specific insurance risk Insurance risk on the annuity contracts arises through longevity risk and through the risk that operating factors, such as administration expenses, are worse than expected.
Insurance risk on the protection policies arises through higher than expected mortality levels.
Longevity and mortality experience is monitored on a regular basis and compared to the underlying assumptions used to reserve for future insurance payments.
The exposure to longevity and mortality risk is also reduced significantly through the use of reinsurance.
Expense risk is managed through regular assessment of expenses incurred against budgets and overall impact on profitability of the insurance contracts.
a3 Concentration of insurance risk The Group writes annuity contracts for the provision of retirement income or care fees and protection insurance contracts, primarily for individuals in the UK with one or more medical conditions or lifestyle factors that are likely to reduce their overall life expectancy.
The Group's insurance risk is therefore concentrated on longevity and mortality risk.
These risks are significantly reduced through the Group's use of external reinsurance arrangements.
Partnership Assurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 115 Notes to the IFRS consolidated financial statements continued 30 Management of insurance and financial risk continued b Interest rate and other market risk Interest rate risk arises from open positions in fixed and variable rate stock issued by government and corporate bodies that are exposed to general and specific market movements.
The Group is exposed to the market movements in interest rates to the extent that the asset value movement is different to the accompanying movement in the value of insurance liabilities.
The Group manages its interest rate risk within an asset liability management ALM framework that has been developed to achieve long-term investment returns in excess of its obligations under insurance and investment contracts.
The principal technique of the Groups ALM framework is to match assets to the liabilities arising from insurance contracts by reference to the type of benefits payable to policyholders.
The Group monitors interest rate risk by calculating the mean duration and cash flow profile of the investment portfolio and the liabilities.
The mean duration is an indicator of the sensitivity of the assets and insurance liabilities to changes in current interest rates but is not sufficient in isolation.
The mean duration of the liabilities is determined by means of projecting expected cash flows from the contracts using best-estimates of mortality and voluntary terminations.
No future discretionary supplemental benefits are assumed to accrue.
The mean duration of the assets is calculated in a consistent manner.
Any gap between the mean duration of the assets and the mean duration of the liabilities is minimised by means of buying and selling fixed interest securities of different durations or purchasing interest rate swap derivatives to alter the effective mean duration of the assets.
Periodically the cash flow matching is reviewed and rebalanced.
At 31 December 2013, the mean duration of the assets was 7.5 years 2012: 7.7 years measured with reference to a gross redemption yield and the mean duration of the liabilities was at 9.0 years 2012: 8.9 years measured with reference to the valuation interest rate.
The Group has reinsurance arrangements in place which provide for fixed payments to the reinsurer over future periods.
In assessing the fair value of this liability, the Directors have used a discount rate derived from current market yields earned on assets held to fund the future cash outflows, adjusted for the risk of default on those assets.
No further adjustment to the discount rate to reflect any risk of the Group defaulting on those payments to the reinsurer was deemed appropriate.
c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due.
Key areas where the Group is exposed to credit risk are exposure to: the issuer of corporate bonds: counterparties in derivative contracts: reinsurers in respect of their share of insurance liabilities: and reinsurers in respect of claims already paid.
The Group places limits on its exposures to a single counterparty, or groups of connected counterparties.
With respect to its investment in corporate bonds, the credit rating is derived from the Standard & Poors, Moody and Fitch ratings for each individual stock, if two or more ratings are available the second highest rating is used otherwise the single available rating is used.
The Group places limits on the exposure to bond issuers with different credit ratings.
Credit default swaps are also used to manage exposure to single issuers.
Current restrictions do not allow investment in any corporate bond with a rating below BBB or equivalent.
Where investments already held are subsequently downgraded, the Directors will review each holding to determine whether to retain that exposure.
At 31 December 2013, 0.5m of collateral 2012: 8.6m had been pledged to the Group to mitigate the credit risk exposure associated with the derivative assets held at that time.
Reinsurance is used to manage insurance risk.
This does not, however, discharge the Groups liability as primary insurer, and consequently, if a reinsurer fails to pay a claim, the Group remains liable for the payment to the policyholder.
As a result, the Group is exposed to credit risk in relation to the reinsurers ability to fulfil its obligations to the Group.
The creditworthiness of reinsurers is considered by reviewing their financial strength prior to finalisation of any contract and then subsequently at least on an annual basis.
We seek to place new business with reinsurers with a minimum credit rating of A.
For certain reinsurance treaties, the reinsurers share of annuity insurance liabilities is backed by investments deposited back with the Group, or held in trust for the beneficial ownership of the Group.
In this way, the Groups exposure to the credit risk relating to the reinsurer is significantly reduced.
The investment risk on investments deposited back with the Group, or held in trust for the beneficial ownership of the Group, is borne by the reinsurers.
Partnership Assurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 116 The following table analyses the credit exposure of the Group by type of asset and includes the credit risk arising out of reinsurance exposures, based on the credit ratings of the reinsurer, as published by Standard & Poors, or an equivalent rating from another recognised rating agency.

The Partnership Board sets limits on the minimum amount of highly liquid assets to be available to meet such obligations.
Short-term cash requirements are monitored on a daily basis to ensure sufficient funds are available to meet immediate payments.
The nature of the Group's business means that, in general, cash flows into the Group through up-front premium payments before annuity payments become due.
Annuity payments are substantially fixed in nature, and consequently the cash requirements are not subject to excessive uncertainty.
In accordance with PRA formerly the FSA regulations, the Groups assets are reviewed to ensure they are of sufficient amount and of an appropriate currency and term to ensure that the cash inflows from those assets will meet the expected cash outflows from the Groups insurance and other financial liabilities.
In the following table expected cash outflows for: net insurance liabilities have been modelled with reference to underlying mortality and longevity assumptions: payables arising from reinsurance include interest and payments due under the terms of reinsurance treaties: derivative liabilities have been modelled with reference to the yield curves that existed at the balance sheet date and assumed to be held to maturity: and subordinated debt is assumed to be repaid in accordance with the terms set out in the loan agreement.

e Property risk Property risk is the risk that property values do not rise sufficiently to recover the full value of equity release loans made plus accrued interest.
The initial loan value is restricted to a maximum loan to value ratio that limits the risk exposure for the Group.
Loans backed by mortgages represent little credit risk as the debt is ultimately repayable from the proceeds of the sale of the property on death of the policyholder or on their transfer to long-term care.
31 Available capital resources The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities within the Group will be able to continue to operate as going concerns, and to ensure that where a subsidiary is subject to regulatory capital requirements, that entity maintains an adequate capital surplus to ensure compliance with those requirements.
The Group's capital consists of equity attributable to equity holders of the Parent Company.
For the purposes of regulatory capital requirements, certain assets are restricted, or are inadmissible.
One subsidiary, Partnership Life Assurance Company Limited, is required to comply with minimum capital requirements calculated at the level of its EEA Parent Company level, as well as its own single entity level.
It must also calculate its available capital at the ultimate Parent Company level, but as failure to cover the minimum capital requirement at this level has no consequence for the entity, or the Group, it is not a measure used to manage capital and hence is not disclosed in this note.
The table below shows the available capital resources at the level of the EEA Parent Company as this is the number by which we assess the Groups capital adequacy.
These capital requirements are determined in accordance with the PRA regulations and the EU directives, for insurance and other PRA regulated business.
Any changes or release of capital from long-term funds is subject to there being an established surplus shown by an actuarial investigation.

Throughout the year, each regulated subsidiary has maintained capital resources in excess of the minimum required by the PRA regulations and the EU directives.
32 Reorganisation As part of the Global Offer and admission of the Company to the London Stock Exchange on the 12 June 2013, the Group has undertaken certain reorganisation steps as detailed below.
Immediately prior to admission on 12 June 2013: the A and B loan notes, previously issued by PAG Finance Limited PAGF, a Group company, together with accrued but unpaid interest, were exchanged on a pound-for-pound basis for the allotment and issue of 69,212,294 ordinary shares in the Company which had a value of 266.5m note 33 : the C loan notes, previously issued by PAGH, together with accrued but unpaid interest, were exchanged on a pound-for-pound basis for the allotment and issue of 15,397,726 ordinary shares in the Company which had a value of 59.3m note 33 : and the A, B, and C ordinary shares in PAGH were exchanged for the allotment and issue of 282,358,446 ordinary shares in the Company.
A merger reserve of 24.5 m arose on consolidation as a result of this share exchange to maintain parity of the consolidated net assets of the Group before and after these share exchanges.
As a result of the above steps the Company obtained control of PAGH and its subsidiaries.
The accounting treatment of this is set out in note 2.
Also as a result of the above steps Cinven Funds, certain Directors, certain members of Senior Management and other individuals hold ordinary shares in each case in proportion to the value of the shareholder instruments in the Group held by them immediately prior to the reorganisation.
Pursuant to the Global Offer and following admission on 12 June 2013: the Company issued 32,467,532 new ordinary shares raising gross proceeds of 125.0m: 7.7m of these proceeds were used to repay in full the Vendor loan notes VLN, together with accrued unpaid interest note 23 : the remainder of these proceeds were used in part to fund transaction costs, to repay the 70m external borrowing facility on 21 August 2013 note 23 and for general corporate purposes: and the Company also issued 51,948 new ordinary shares to certain of the independent non-executive Directors and 12,025 new ordinary shares to the employee benefit trust raising 246,000.
The transaction costs relating to the Global Offer in the six months period to 30 June 2013 amounted to 19.6m.
4.0m of these costs are directly associated with the issue of new shares and have therefore been set-off against the share premium associated with those shares.
3.8m of these costs have been paid during the period to 30 June 2013.
Partnership Assurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 119 Notes to the IFRS consolidated financial statements continued 33 Share capital The Group has issued ordinary shares which are classified as equity.
Incremental external costs that are directly attributable to the issue of the ordinary shares are recognised in equity, net of tax.
On 12 June 2013, immediately prior to admission on the London Stock Exchange, the Company acquired a 100% shareholding in PAGH, the top holding company of the Group at that point in time.
"The allocated and issued share capital of PAGH and PAG plc, the top holding companies of the Group as at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2013 respectively are detailed below: Share capital Share premium At 31 December 2012 000's 000's The authorised share capital of the Company is: A"" ordinary shares of 0.01 each 25 B"" ordinary shares of 0.01 each 3 C"" ordinary shares of 0.01 each 5 182 D"" ordinary shares of 1 each 3 Total 36 182 In the year to 31 December 2012: 2,834 ordinary D shares of PAGH of 1 each were issued at par for cash: the A, B and C ordinary shares of PAGH were converted into new A, B and C ordinary shares of 0.01 each and new deferred shares of 0.99 each: PAGH repurchased the deferred DEF shares of 0.99 each, for a total consideration of 1: and a Capital Redemption Reserve of 3,296,860 was created on repurchase of the deferred shares."
As detailed in note 32, immediately prior to admission on 12 June 2013, all of the A, B and C ordinary shares in PAGH were transferred to the Company in exchange for the allotment and issue of ordinary shares in the Company of 0.10 each.
This resulted in the creation of the Merger Reserve as a result of the Group electing to account for the acquisition of its 100% shareholding in PAGH as a Group reconstruction as described under the UK GAAP accounting standard, Financial Reporting Standard 6, Acquisitions and Mergers.
In addition, the Capital Redemption Reserve was transferred to this Merger Reserve as part of the same transaction.

On 12 June 2013, the 50,000 ordinary shares of 100 pence each were subdivided into 500,000 ordinary shares of 10 pence each.
Immediately following the completion of the Global Offer, and as a result of a number of steps undertaken prior to admission described in note 32 below, the issued share capital of the Company was increased to 39,999,997, comprising 399,999,971 ordinary shares of 10 pence each, all of which will be fully paid or credited as fully paid.
The ordinary share entitles the holder to dividends declared by the Board which are not cumulative.
The ordinary share entitles the holder to one vote for every share held.
