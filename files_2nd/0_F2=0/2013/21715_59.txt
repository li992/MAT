Audit Committee Report NON-AUDIT SERVICES To further safeguard the objectivity and independence of the external auditor from becoming compromised, we have a formal policy governing the engagement of the external auditor to provide non-audit services.
No changes have been made to this policy during the year.
This policy specifies that EY should only be engaged for non-audit services where there is considered very low threat to auditor independence.
EY is prohibited from providing all other services without our prior approval.
In reaching such a determination we will take into consideration whether it is the best interests of the Company that should services should be supplied by the Companys external auditor rather than another service provider and, if so whether any safeguards regarding auditor objectivity and independence in the conduct of the audit should be put in place, whether these would be effective and how such safeguards should be disclosed.
During 2013 EY and its related entities charged 5,200 2012: 5,824: 2011: 5,824 for nonaudited related services.
COMMITTEE EVALUATION Our activities formed part of the external review of Board effectiveness performed in [2011].
An internal evaluation of our effectiveness was carried out in 2013 and 2012.
Yours faithfully Jonathan Hooley Chairman of Audit Committee 56 BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited
