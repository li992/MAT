112 IMI plc SECTION 4 CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING COSTS What you will find in this section This section outlines how the Group manages its capital and related financing costs.
The directors determine the appropriate capital structure for the Group, specifically, how much cash is raised from shareholders equity and how much is borrowed from financial institutions debt in order to finance the Groups activities both now and in the future.
The directors consider the Groups capital structure and dividend policy at least twice a year ahead of announcing results in the context of its ability to continue as a going concern and deliver its business plan.
In March 2013 the Group announced a share buyback programme to maintain an efficient level of debt on the balance sheet throughout the year.
The disposal of the Retail Dispense businesses created an exposure to movements in the sterling-US dollar exchange rate on a value of US$1,100m between 15 October, when contracts were exchanged, and the return of cash to shareholders in sterling, in late February 2014.
To provide certainty over the sterling equivalent value of the US dollar proceeds prior to completion of the sale a deal-contingent forward was entered into which managed the value and timing risk by making the delivery under the forward foreign exchange contract contingent on the completion of the disposal.
This instrument had a net positive fair value of 11.2m at 31 December 2013, reflecting the successful management of this transactional risk.
The Board is mindful that equity capital cannot be easily flexed and in particular raising new equity would normally be likely only in the context of an acquisition.
Debt can be issued and repurchased more easily but frequent adjustments lead to high transaction costs and debt holders are under no obligation to accept repurchase offers.
4.1 Net cash debt Net cash debt is the Groups key measure used to evaluate total outstanding debt, net of the current cash resources.
Some of the Groups borrowings and cash is held in foreign currencies.
