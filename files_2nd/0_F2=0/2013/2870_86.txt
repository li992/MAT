Details of the schemes are as follows: Deferred Annual Bonus Plan This scheme is applicable to Executive Directors and Divisional Executive Directors.
Under this scheme awards are made annually consisting of Deferred Shares, which are linked to the payout under the Annual Bonus Scheme details of which are contained in the Directors remuneration report on pages 78 to 92 and Matching Shares.
The value of Deferred Shares is determined by the payout under the Annual Bonus Scheme: half of the annual bonus is paid in cash and the remainder is compulsorily deferred on a gross basis into Deferred Shares.
Directors have the option to defer up to 100% of their annual bonus into Deferred Shares.
The Deferred Shares are held for a period of 3 years from the date of award during which they are not forfeitable, except in the case of dismissal for gross misconduct.
A conditional award of Matching Shares is made at the same time as the award of Deferred Shares.
Participants will be eligible to receive up to 2 Matching Shares for every Deferred Share.
Prior to 2010 Matching Shares will vest after the 3 year holding period to the extent to which performance conditions have been met.
33.3% of the Matching Shares will vest if growth in the Companys earnings per share EPS is equal to growth in the UK Retail Price Index RPI plus 6% per annum, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting if growth in the Companys EPS is equal to or greater than growth in the RPI plus 16% per annum.
The performance condition attached to the awards may be amended by the Remuneration Committee, a sub-committee of the Group Board, from time to time, subject to the new condition being no less demanding than the original condition.
The vesting conditions for matching awards made in 2010 were such that 33% of the Matching Shares will vest if growth in the Companys earnings per share EPS is equal to growth in the UK Retail Price Index RPI plus 4% per annum, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting if growth in the Companys EPS is equal to or greater than growth in the RPI plus 14% per annum.
The vesting conditions for matching awards made in 2011 were such that 33% of the Matching Shares will vest if growth in the Companys earnings per share EPS is equal to growth in the UK Retail Price Index RPI plus 4% per annum, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting if growth in the Companys EPS is equal to or greater than growth in the RPI plus 12% per annum.
There were no issues under the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan in 2012.
The vesting conditions for matching awards made in 2013 were such that 33% of the Matching Shares will vest if growth in the Companys earnings per share EPS is equal to growth in the UK Retail Price Index RPI plus 4% per annum, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting if growth in the Companys EPS is equal to or greater than growth in the RPI plus 12% per annum.
Long Term Incentive Plan 2008 LTIP The 2008 LTIP was approved and adopted at the AGM on 6 May 2008.
The vesting of awards will depend on share price growth and EPS growth targets measured over a 3 year period.
An award will not vest if Capitas average share price at the date of vesting is below the average share price at the date of grant.
This scheme is open to all senior employees and shares will vest according to performance criteria.
The number of shares which will vest is dependent upon the Companys EPS growth exceeding RPI growth by 4% and on banding within the scheme.
128 | Capita plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 28 Share based payment plans continued Long Term Indexed Share Appreciation Scheme LTISAS The LTISAS was only open to the Executive Directors and the Divisional Executive Directors.
Under the scheme, participants were provided with 2 equal tranches of 600,000 options.
The criteria were the same for each of these grants and therefore both tranches had performance periods that ended on 31 December 2006.
The exercise price of the option was restated in line with the FTSE All Share Index from the date of grant to 25 November 2007.
The restated exercise prices were 3.48 for the 2002 award and 4.74 for the 2004 award.
This feature ensured that participants only gained if the share price outperformed the index.
Options became exercisable, over the performance period, subject to the growth in the Companys EPS exceeding certain targets.
As growth in the Companys EPS over the 3 year period to 31 December 2006 exceeded RPI growth by 17.6%, 100% of the options vested representing 1,200,000 shares per participant and became exercisable on 25 November 2007.
The last award under the LTISAS was made in November 2004 and vested in full on 31 December 2006 and no further awards will be made under this plan.
All shares in this plan have now been exercised.
1997 Executive Share Option Scheme This scheme is open to senior employees other than Executive Directors and Divisional Executive Directors.
The exercise price of the options is equal to the market price of the shares on the date of grant.
Options granted under this scheme become exercisable if the growth in the Companys EPS exceeds the growth in RPI by 8% over the 3 year vesting period from the date of grant.
The contractual life of each option granted is 7 years.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.
Capita Sharesave Scheme This is an employee Save As You Earn scheme open to all Capita employees.
Under this scheme, employees are granted share options at the market price at the date of grant.
The options become exercisable for a 6 month period following completion of a 3 year savings period.
There are no performance conditions attached to these options.
2011 Co-Investment Plan The Co-Investment Plan was approved at the AGM on 10 May 2011 and provides for a grant of three times the number of Company shares pledged by Chief Executive Paul Pindar the sole participant before the end of 2011, up to a maximum limit of 1.0m in total market value of shares pledged.
The number of matching shares vesting is determined on the basis of Total Shareholder Return TSR as compared to the increase in the TSR of the FTSE 100 over the 4-year performance period from the date of grant.
No shares will vest if over the performance period the Companys TSR is lower than the median: 33.33% will vest if it is equal to median and 100% will vest if ranked in the upper quartile when compared against the FTSE 100 TSR.
Between median TSR and top quartile the number of shares vesting will be on a straight-line basis in proportion to the position achieved by the Company.
No plan shares will vest if the EPS of Capita plc has not grown over the performance period.
During the year ended 31 December 2011 the total number of shares pledged was 137,362 with a market value of 1.0m.
The maximum matching shares under the plan amounted to 412,087 with a market value of 4.3m at 31 December 2013.
Following Paul Pindars retirement on 28 February 2014, awards outstanding under the Long Term Incentive Plans and the Co-Investment Plan at the date of his retirement will continue until their maturity.
Such awards will vest subject to the existing performance conditions and will be pro rata reduced for the vesting time period post retirement.
The Deferred Annual Bonus Plan matching award made in 2013 will lapse.
