The group makes awards available to staff members via the underlying share trusts.
The particular instrument used varies from time to time depending on taxation legislation and factors affecting the group structure.
Nevertheless, whatever the instrument chosen, its underlying value depends solely on the performance of the groups share price.
At present, the practice of the group is to give all permanent staff members a share allocation based on their annual package after completing six months of employment.
In line with the objective of providing a long-term incentive for staff, these share awards vest over periods varying from four to five years.
After the initial allocation referred to above, additional allocations are made to staff members at the discretion of group management and depending on the individual performance and contribution made by the respective staff members.
The extent of the directors and staff interest in the incentive schemes is detailed on pages 130, 133 and 134 in volume one.
