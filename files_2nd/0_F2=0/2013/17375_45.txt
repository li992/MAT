About the artist Diego Rivera iego Rivera 1886-1957 is considered by many to be the greatest Mexican painter ofthe 20th century, whose skills as master D muralist had a profound influence on the international art world.
A social realist, with a keen political conscience, Rivera sought to bring art to the people and reflect the lives and struggles of working people in his native 1 front cover 2 page 47 Mexico.
His murals are theatrical, ambitious and epic, blending elements of Italian fresco with his native Mexicos culture and history.
Farm and industrial workers take centre stage.
Lushly colouredand stylised figures, reminiscent of Mayan and Aztec sculptures, dominate his paintings.
He worked prolifically in the US.
In 1932, at the height of the Great Depression, he was commissioned byHenry Ford to create 27 fresco panels, entitled Detroit Industry, depicting the industrial life of theAmerican worker.
Rivera was the catalyst for President Roosevelts public art project, which 3 page 9 4 page 15 sponsored jobless artists to make murals on public buildings, including the White House.
In 1931 2, record numbers attended his specially constructed portable mural show for the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
The works were brought back together for a show in 2012.
When Rivera returned to his homeland, he set about making outspoken pieces in oil, paper and fresco.
He also painted his great loves, including hiswife, thepainter Frida Kahlo.
One of Mexicos topattractions isRiveras mural depicting thehistory of the nation 5 page 166 6 page 92 at the National Palace inMexico City.
Rivera put art back on walls.
He is the grandfather of everything that followed in murals, including monumental graffiti and even the work ofBanksy.
Democratisation of art is one of Diego Riveras greatest legacies.
