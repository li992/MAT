The cash flow hedge reserve on interest rate swap contracts will be continuously transferred to the income statement until the borrowings are repaid.
The amount due to be released from reserves to the income statement next year is 7m, and the remainder released with the same maturity profile as borrowings due after more than one year.
Other reserves comprise the capital redemption reserve arising from the refinancing and restructuring of the Lattice Group in 1999.
It represents the amount of the reduction in the share capital of the Company as a consequence of that restructuring.
As the amounts included in other reserves are not attributable to any of the other classes of equity presented, they have been disclosed as a separate classification of equity.
