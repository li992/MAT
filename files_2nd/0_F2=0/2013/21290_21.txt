38 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Report & Financial Statements 2013 Notes to the Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies a Basis of preparation The financial statements for the year ended 31 October 2013 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRSs.
IFRSs comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, together with interpretations of the International Accounting Standards and Standing Interpretations Committee approved by the International Accounting Standards Committee IASC that remain in effect, to the extent that IFRSs have been adopted by the European Union.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below and have been applied consistently throughout the year.
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice the SORP for investment trusts issued by the Association of Investment Companies the AIC in January 2009 is consistent with the requirements of IFRSs, the directors have sought to prepare the financial statements on a basis consistent with the recommendations of the SORP.
Accounting Standards i New and amended standards adopted by the Company IAS 1 amendment, Presentation of Financial Statements amendments regarding other comprehensive income.
No impact on financial statements.
ii N ew standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the current financial year and not early adopted by the Company: IFRS 7 amendment, Financial Instruments Disclosures effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 amendments enhancing disclosures about offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities.
IAS 32 amendment, Financial Instruments Presentation effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 amendment that updates the application guidance in IAS 32, Financial instruments: Presentation, to clarify some of the requirements for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities on the balance sheet.
IAS 39 amendment, Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 amendments allow hedge accounting to continue in a situation where a derivative, which has been designated as a hedging instrument, is novated to effect clearing with a central counterparty as a result of laws or regulation, if specific conditions are met in this context, a novation indicates that parties to a contract agree to replace their original counterparty with a new one.
IFRS 9, Financial Instruments effective for financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015 - addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities.
IFRS 9 was issued in November 2009 and October 2010.
It replaces the parts of IAS 39 that relate to the classification and measurement of financial instruments.
IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into two measurement categories: those measured as at fair value and those measured at amortised cost.
The determination is made at initial recognition.
The classification depends on the entitys business model for managing its financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument.
For financial liabilities, the standard retains most of the IAS 39 requirements.
The main change is that, in cases where the fair value option is taken for financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entitys own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch.
The Company is yet to assess IFRS 9s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 9 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2013, subject to endorsement by the EU.
indd 38 15 01 2014 15:35 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Report & Financial Statements 2013 39 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued IFRS 13, Fair value measurement effective for financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 - aims to improve consistency and reduce complexity by providing a precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for use across IFRSs.
The requirements, which are largely aligned between IFRSs and US GAAP, do not extend the use of fair value accounting but provide guidance on how it should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards within IFRSs or US GAAP.
The Company is yet to assess IFRS 13s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 13 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2013. iii N ew standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the current financial year and not relevant to the Companys operations: IFRS 1 amendments, First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS 10, Consolidated financial statements IFRS 11, Joint arrangements IFRS 12, Disclosure of interest in other entities IAS 12 amendment, Income taxes IAS 19, Employee benefits IAS 27, Separate financial statements IAS 28, Associates and joint ventures b Basis of consolidation The accounts of the Company have not been consolidated as the wholly owned subsidiary undertaking, The Army and Navy Investment Company Limited was put into liquidation during the year.
Therefore for 2013 and 2012 the accounts are prepared on a Company only basis.
c Investments held at fair value through profit or loss All investments are designated upon initial recognition as held at fair value through profit or loss.
Investment transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis.
Assets are fide-recognised at the trade date of the disposal.
Proceeds are measured at fair value, which are regarded as the proceeds of sale less any transaction costs.
The fair value of the financial instruments in the balance sheet is based on their quoted bid price at the balance sheet date, without deduction of the estimated future selling costs.
Unquoted investments are valued by the directors using primary valuation techniques such as earnings multiples, recent transactions and net assets.
Where fair value cannot be reliably measured, the investment will be carried at the previous reporting date value unless there is evidence that the investment has since been impaired, in which case the value will be reduced.
Changes in the fair value of investments held at fair value through profit or loss and gains and losses on disposal are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as Gains or losses on investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
Also included within this caption are transaction costs in relation to the purchase or sale of investments, including the difference between the purchase price of an investment and its bid price at the date of purchase.
d Presentation of Statement of Comprehensive Income In accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Statement of Comprehensive Income between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
In accordance with the Companys status as a UK investment company under section 833 of the Companies Act 2006, net capital returns may not be distributed by way of dividend.
Additionally, the net revenue is the measure the directors believe appropriate in assessing the Companys compliance with certain requirements set out in section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
indd 39 15 01 2014 15:35 40 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Report & Financial Statements 2013 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued e Income Dividends receivable on equity shares are recognised as revenue for the year on an ex-dividend basis.
Special dividends are treated as revenue return or as capital return, depending on the facts of each individual case.
Income from fixed interest debt securities is recognised using the effective interest rate method.
Bank deposit interest and stock lending income are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Where the Company enters into a commitment to underwrite an issue of securities in exchange for the receipt of commission, a derivative financial instrument is recognised initially at fair value.
The derivative is re-measured subsequently at fair value, with the related gains and losses being reflected in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Net losses arising from these derivatives, where actual or expected loss from taking up the securities underwritten exceeds the commission income, are allocated to the capital return.
Net gains are allocated to the revenue return.
f Expenses All expenses and interest payable are accounted for on an accruals basis.
On the basis of the Boards expected longterm split of total returns in the form of capital and revenue returns of 70% and 30%, respectively, the Company charges 70% of its finance costs and investment management fees to capital.
Expenses which are incidental to the purchase or sale of an investment are charged to the capital return column of the Statement of Comprehensive Income and allocated to other capital reserves.
All other operating expenses are charged to the revenue return column of the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
g Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The liability for current tax is calculated using the effective tax rate of corporation tax for the accounting period.
In line with the recommendations of the SORP, the allocation method used to calculate tax relief on expenses presented against capital returns in the supplementary information in the Statement of Comprehensive Income is the marginal basis.
Under this basis, if taxable income is capable of being offset entirely by expenses presented in the revenue return column of the Statement of Comprehensive Income, then no tax relief is transferred to the capital return column.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Investment trusts which have approval as such under section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 are not liable for taxation on capital gains.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
indd 40 15 01 2014 15:35 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Report & Financial Statements 2013 41 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued h Dividends payable to shareholders Dividends payable to shareholders are recognised in the financial statements when they are paid or, in the case of final dividends, when they are approved by shareholders.
Dividends paid are disclosed in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
i Foreign currency For the purposes of the financial statements, the results and financial position is expressed in pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency of the Company.
Sterling is the functional currency because it is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates.
Transactions recorded in overseas currencies during the year are translated into Sterling at the appropriate daily exchange rates.
Monetary assets and liabilities and equity investments held at fair value through profit or loss that are denominated in overseas currencies at the balance sheet date, are translated into Sterling at the exchange rates ruling at that date.
Exchange gains and losses on investments held at fair value through profit or loss are included within Gains or losses on investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
j Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and on demand deposits.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
k Borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans, overdrafts and debentures are recorded initially at fair value, being the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
They are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the Statement of Comprehensive Income using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
l Repurchase of ordinary shares The cost of repurchasing ordinary shares including related stamp duty and transaction costs are taken directly to equity and disclosed in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
Share repurchase transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis.
The nominal value of ordinary share capital repurchased and cancelled is transferred out of called-up share capital and into the capital redemption reserve.
m Capital reserves The following are accounted for in the Capital reserve arising on investments sold: expenses and finance costs charged to capital net of tax relief: gains and losses on the disposals of investments: realised foreign exchange differences of a capital nature: and costs of repurchasing ordinary share capital.
The following are accounted for in the Capital reserve arising on investments held: increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end: and unrealised foreign exchange differences of a capital nature.
n Key estimates and assumptions Estimates and assumptions used in preparing the financial statements are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The results of these estimates and assumptions form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
There are no estimates and assumptions that may cause material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities.
indd 41 15 01 2014 15:35 42 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Report & Financial Statements 2013 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued o Receivables Receivables are amounts due from securities sold for future settlement, withholding tax recoverable, prepayments and accrued income in the ordinary course of business.
If collection is expected in one year or less or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer, they are classified as current assets.
If not, they are presented as non-current assets.
Receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
p Payables Trade payables are obligations to pay for securities purchased for future settlement, accruals and deferred income that have been acquired incurred in the ordinary course of business.
Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer.
If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
q Policy on operating segments Under IFRS 8, operating segments are considered to be the components of an entity, about which separate financial information is available, that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker the Manager, with oversight from the Board in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
The directors meet regularly to consider investment strategy and to monitor the Companys performance.
The Portfolio Manager, who has been appointed to manage the Companys investments, attends all Board meetings at which investment strategy and performance are discussed.
The directors consider that the Company has one operating segment: which invests in shares and securities primarily for capital appreciation and dividend growth in accordance with the Companys published investment objectives.
The business is not managed on a geographical basis.
However, for the convenience of investors, disclosure by geographical segment has been provided in note 3 and in the Portfolio Review on pages 5 to 17.
Further analyses of expenses, investment gains or losses, profit and other assets and liabilities by country have not been given as either it is not possible to prepare such information in a meaningful way or the results are not considered to be significant.

The Company has not provided for deferred tax on capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments as it is exempt from tax on these items because of its status as an investment trust company, which it intends to maintain for the foreseeable future.
d Factors that may affect future tax charges The Company has not recognised a deferred tax asset totalling 4,362,000 2012: 3,976,000 arising as a result of having unutilised non trade loan relationship deficits with a tax value of 2,997,000 2012: 2,910,000, excess management expenses with a tax value of 1,365,000 2012: 1,066,000 and a deferred tax liability of nil 2012: nil on non-reporting offshore funds.
These expenses will only be utilised if the Company has profits chargeable to corporation tax in the future.
The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 24% to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013.
Accordingly, the Companys profits for this accounting period are taxed at the effective rate of tax of 23.42%.

17 Risk management policies and procedures As an investment trust the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to secure its investment objectives as stated on the inside front cover and in the strategic review.
In pursuing its investment objectives, the Company is exposed to a variety of financial risks that could result in either a reduction in its net assets or a reduction in the profits available for distribution by way of dividends.
These financial risks comprising market price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit and counterparty risk, and the directors approach to the management of these risks, are set out below.
The Board of directors and the Manager coordinate the Companys risk management.
The Board determines the objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks, and these are set out below under the relevant risk category.
The policies for the management of risk have not changed from the previous accounting period.
17.1 Market risk The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
indd 48 15 01 2014 15:35 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Report & Financial Statements 2013 49 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 17 Risk management policies and procedures continued 17.1.
1 Market price risk Market price risk ie changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the fair value of the quoted and unquoted investments.
Management of the risk The Board of directors manages the risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely reporting of relevant information from the Manager.
Investment performance is reviewed at each Board meeting.
The Board monitors the Managers compliance with the Companys objectives, and is directly responsible for investment strategy and asset allocation, including as between countries and economies.
The Companys exposure to changes in market prices on its investments was as follows: 31 October 31 October 2013 2012 000 000 Equities 654,933 546,832 Fixed interest 75 83 655,008 546,915 Market price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and the Companys net assets to an increase or decrease of 20% 2012: 20% in the fair values of the Companys equity investments at each balance sheet date.
This level of change is considered to be reasonable based on observation of current market conditions.

2 Currency risk A significant proportion of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than Sterling the Companys functional currency and presentational currency.
As a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the Sterling value of those items.
Management of the risk The Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a regular basis and reports to the Board at each Board meeting.
The Manager measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and total return of a movement in the exchange rate to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Foreign currency borrowings may be used to limit the Companys exposure to future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
These borrowings are limited to 30% of the adjusted net asset value.

2 Currency risk continued Investment income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into Sterling on receipt.
The Company did not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
During the year, derivative contracts were not used to hedge against exposure to currency risk.
Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31 October are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are denominated in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
US Japanese Hong Kong $ Euro Yen $ Other 2013 000 000 000 000 000 Other receivables 87 14 378 1,911 Cash and cash equivalents 2 Current liabilities 331 Total foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 242 14 378 1,911 Investments at fair value through profit or loss that are equities 165,793 46,191 60,791 23,917 66,914 Total net foreign currency exposure 165,551 46,205 61,169 23,917 68,825 US Japanese Hong Kong $ Euro Yen $ Other 2012 000 000 000 000 000 Other receivables 144 54 510 374 Cash and cash equivalents 1 246 Current liabilities 578 256 Total foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 145 524 254 620 Investments at fair value through profit or loss that are equities 137,723 34,592 45,862 23,827 60,143 Total net foreign currency exposure 137,868 34,068 46,116 23,827 60,763 The above amounts are not necessarily representative of the exposure to risk during each year, as levels of monetary foreign currency exposure change significantly throughout the year.
Foreign currency sensitivity The table opposite illustrates the sensitivity of the total profit after tax for the year and the net assets in regard to movements in the Companys foreign currency financial assets and financial liabilities caused by changes in the exchange rates for the US Dollar Sterling, Euro Sterling, Japanese Yen Sterling and Hong Kong Dollar Sterling.
It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: US Dollar Sterling - 10% 2012: 10%.

2 Currency risk continued These percentages are deemed reasonable based on the average market volatility in exchange rates in recent years.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys foreign currency financial assets and financial liabilities held at each balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.
The impact on the total profit after tax and the year end net assets of a depreciation of 10% in the year end exchange rate for Sterling against the currencies shown would have been as follows: 2013 2012 US Japanese Hong Kong US Japanese Hong Kong $ Euro Yen $ $ Euro Yen $ 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 363 124 104 105 326 126 112 85 Capital return 18,392 5,124 6,744 2,653 15,286 3,676 5,090 2,645 Change to profit after tax for the year and net assets 18,755 5,248 6,848 2,758 15,612 3,802 5,202 2,730 The impact on the total profit after tax and the year end net assets of an appreciation of 10% in the year end exchange rate for Sterling against the currencies shown would have been as follows: 2013 2012 US Japanese Hong Kong US Japanese Hong Kong $ Euro Yen $ $ Euro Yen $ 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 297 102 85 86 266 103 92 70 Capital return 15,048 4,192 5,518 2,171 12,507 3,008 4,165 2,164 Change to profit after tax for the year and net assets 15,345 4,294 5,603 2,257 12,773 3,111 4,257 2,234 In the opinion of the directors, the above sensitivity analyses are not representative of the year as a whole, since the level of exposure changes frequently as part of the currency risk management process used to meet the Companys objectives.
3 Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of interest receivable from cash at bank, the current asset investment and the value of the fixed interest investments.
Management of the risk The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at levels approved and monitored by the Board.
Derivative contracts are not used to hedge against the exposure to interest rate risk.

3 Interest rate risk continued Interest rate exposure The exposure at 31 October of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown below.
For floating interest rates exposure is by reference to when the interest rate is due to be re-set.
2013 2012 Within More than Within More than one year one year Total one year one year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Cash and cash equivalents 14,130 14,130 2,825 2,825 Current asset investment 21 21 1,301 1,301 Exposure to fixed interest rates: Fixed interest investments 75 75 83 83 Bank loans 1,000 1,000 Debentures 25,000 25,000 25,000 25,000 14,151 24,925 10,774 3,126 24,917 21,791 The above amounts are not necessarily representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year, as the level of exposure changes as investments are made, and borrowings are drawn down and repaid.
Interest receivable and finance costs are at the following rates: Interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts, is at a margin over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent 2012: same.
Interest paid on debentures is set out in note 16.
Interest rate sensitivity The Company is primarily exposed to interest rate risk through its cash balances, its current asset investment and its fixed income investment portfolio.
The sensitivity of each exposure is as follows: Cash Cash balances vary throughout the year.
Cash balances at the year end were 14,130,000 2012: 2,825,000 and, if that level of cash was maintained for a full year, a 100 basis points change in LIBOR up or down would increase or decrease total net return on ordinary activities after taxation by approximately 141,000 2012: 28,000.
Current asset investment sensitivity The Companys interest bearing current asset investment at the year end was 21,000 2012: 1,301,000 and, if that level of investment was maintained for a full year, a 100 basis points change in interest rates up or down would increase or decrease total net return on ordinary activities after taxation by approximately 210 2012: 13,000.
Fixed income investment sensitivity The Companys fixed income portfolio at the year end was valued at 75,000 2012: 83,000, and is not currently paying interest and therefore there is no modified duration interest rate sensitivity 2012: no modified duration.
indd 52 15 01 2014 15:35 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Report & Financial Statements 2013 53 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 17 Risk management policies and procedures continued 17.2 Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted securities that are readily realisable.
The Company has a multi-currency loan facility of 30,000,000 with Commonwealth Bank of Australia 2012: 30,000,000 and an overdraft facility with the custodian, the extent of which is determined by the custodian on a regular basis by reference to the value of the securities held by it on behalf of the Company.
The facilities are subject to regular review.
The Company also has two debentures, details of which can be found in note 16 on page 48.
The Board gives guidance to the Manager as to the maximum amount of the Companys resources that should be invested in any one company.
The policy is that the Company should generally remain fully invested and that short-term borrowings be used to manage short-term cash requirements.
Liquidity risk exposure The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at 31 October, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required was as follows: 2013 2012 Due between Due between Due within three months Due after Due within three months Due after three months and one year one year three months and one year one year 000 000 000 000 000 000 Debenture stocks 2,250 37,900 2,250 40,150 Bank loans 1,001 Other payables 8,398 1,078 8,398 2,250 37,900 2,079 2,250 40,150 17.3 Credit and counterparty risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
Management of the risk Credit risk is managed as follows: transactions involving derivatives are entered into only with investment banks, the credit rating of which is taken into account so as to minimise the risk to the Company of default.
investment transactions are carried out with a large number of approved brokers, whose credit-standard is reviewed periodically by the Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker.
cash at bank is held only with reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings and is subject to continual review.
Stock lending transactions are carried out with a number of approved counterparties, whose credit-standard is reviewed by the Manager and limits are set on the amount that may be lent to any one counterparty.

Stock lending revenue is received for making the investments available to the borrower which increases the returns on the portfolio.
In all cases securities lent continue to be recognised on the balance sheet.
Details of the value of the securities on loan at the year end, and the collateral held can be found in note 4 on page 43.
Other than stock lending transactions, none of the Companys financial assets or liabilities is secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.
Outstanding settlements are subject to credit risk.
Credit risk is mitigated by the Company through its decision to transact with counterparties of high credit quality.
The Company only buys and sells investments through brokers which are approved counterparties, thus minimising the risk of default during settlement.
The credit ratings of brokers are reviewed periodically by the Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker.
The Company is also exposed to credit risk through the use of banks for its cash position.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of banks may cause the Companys rights with respect to cash held by banks to be delayed or limited.
The Companys cash balances are held by our custodian, BNP Paribas Securities Services.
The directors believe the counterparty is of high credit quality, therefore the Company has minimal exposure to credit risk.
Credit risk exposure The table opposite summarises the maximum credit risk exposure of the Company as at year end: 2013 2012 000 000 Fixed interest securities 75 83 Cash and cash equivalents 14,130 2,825 Receivables: Securities sold for future settlement 16,297 150 30,502 3,058 17.4 Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets and financial liabilities are either carried in the balance sheet at their fair value investments and derivatives or the balance sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value due from brokers, dividends and interest receivable, due to brokers, accruals, cash at bank, bank overdrafts and amounts due under the multi-currency loan facility.
The par value of the debenture stocks can be found in note 16.
The fair values are calculated using prices quoted on the exchange on which the instruments trade.
17.5 Fair value hierarchy disclosures The table opposite sets out the fair value measurements using the IFRS 7 fair value hierarchy.
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset as follows: 79709 HGI Bankers Text V2.

Level 2 valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1.
Level 3 valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The table below sets out the fair value measurements using the IFRS 7 fair value hierarchy.
There have been no transfers during the year between any of the levels.
A reconciliation of fair value movements within Level 3 is set out below.

The total carrying value of loans and receivables, as stated in note 14, is a reasonable approximation of their fair value as at the year end date.
The total carrying value of financial liabilities measured at amortised cost as disclosed in note 15, is a reasonable approximation of their fair value as at the year end date.
17.6 Capital management policies and procedures The Companys capital management objectives are: to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern, and to generate total return to its equity shareholders in accordance with its objectives through an appropriate balance of equity capital and debt.
The portfolio includes unquoted investments which represent 0.011% 2012: 0.033% of the total portfolio and which are held at directors fair valuations.
The Companys capital at 31 October 2013 comprises its equity share capital, reserves and debt that are shown in the balance sheet at a total of 678,561,000 2012: 552,214,000.

This review includes: the need to buy back equity shares for cancellation, which takes account of the difference between the net asset value per share and the share price ie the level of share price discount or premium : the need for new issues of equity shares: the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
The Companys policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding accounting period.
The Company is subject to several externally imposed capital requirements: under the multi-currency facility total borrowings not to exceed 30% of net asset value and net asset value not to fall below 150,000,000.
These are measured in accordance with the policies used in the annual financial statements.
as a public company, the Company has a minimum share capital of 50,000. in order to be able to pay dividends out of profits available for distribution by way of dividends, the Company has to be able to meet one of the capital restriction tests imposed on investment companies by law and its articles of association.
the terms of the debenture trust deeds have various covenants which prescribe that moneys borrowed should not exceed 20% to 100% of the adjusted total of capital and reserves as defined in the debenture trust deeds.
These requirements are unchanged since last year, and the Company has complied with them throughout the year.
18 Net asset value per ordinary share The net asset value per ordinary share is based on net assets attributable to ordinary shares of 653,561,000 2012: 526,214,000 and on the 111,256,839 ordinary shares in issue at 31 October 2013 2012: 110,906,839.
The Company has no securities in issue that could dilute the net asset value per ordinary share.
The movements during the year in net assets attributable to the ordinary shares were as follows: 2013 2012 000 000 Net assets attributable to ordinary shares at start of year 526,214 496,331 Total net profit on ordinary activities after taxation 140,509 44,848 Dividends paid 15,149 14,371 Issue buy back of ordinary shares 1,987 594 Net assets attributable to ordinary shares at end of year 653,561 526,214 79709 HGI Bankers Text V2.

24 Transactions with the Manager Under the terms of an agreement dated 23 June 2006 the Company has appointed wholly owned subsidiary companies of Henderson Group plc Henderson to provide investment management, accounting, secretarial and administrative services.
Details of the management fee arrangements for these services are given in the Strategic Report on page 19.
The total fees paid or payable under this agreement to Henderson in respect of the year ended 31 October 2013 were 1,972,000 2012: 1,578,000, of which 170,000 is included in accruals at 31 October 2013 2012: 263,000.
No performance fee was payable to Henderson for the year ended 31 October 2013 2012: nil.
In addition to the above services, Henderson has provided the Company with marketing services during the year.
The total fees paid or payable for these services for the year ended 31 October 2013 amounted to a charge of 90,000 2012: 66,000, of which 32,000 was outstanding at 31 October 2013 2012: 5,000.
25 Operating segments The directors consider that the Company has one operating segment, which invests in shares and securities primarily for capital appreciation in accordance with the Companys published investment objective.
