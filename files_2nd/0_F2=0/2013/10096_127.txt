The agreement allowed for additional shares to be issued at par to the shareholder should a listing or sale of the Group not take place before 31 August 2012.

Capital reserve Balances have arisen in the capital reserve when the Groups previous parent company, Merlin Entertainments S. r. l. arranged its own acquisition by Merlin Entertainments plc, a new legal parent.
The balances arising represent the difference between the value of the equity structure of the previous and new parent companies.
When the capital position of the parent company is rearranged, such as for the bonus issue in the year, the capital reserve is adjusted appropriately such that the equity balances presented in the Group accounts best reflect the underlying structure of the Groups capital base.

5.8 Share-based payment transactions Accounting policy The fair value of equity-settled share-based payments is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and charged as the employees become unconditionally entitled to the rights.
The Groups equity-settled share plans are settled either by the issue of shares by Merlin Entertainments plc or by the purchase of shares in the market.
The fair value of the share plans is recognised as an expense over the expected vesting period net of deferred tax with a corresponding entry to retained earnings.
The fair value of the share plans is determined at the date of grant.
Non-market based vesting conditions i. e. earnings per share and return on capital employed targets are taken into account in estimating the number of awards likely to vest.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each accounting date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual awards issued.
No adjustment is made after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or are not exercised.
The Group operates cash-settled versions of the employee incentive schemes for employees in certain territories.
The issues and resulting charges of these schemes are not material to the financial statements.
