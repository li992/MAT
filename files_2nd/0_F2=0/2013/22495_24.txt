Significant accounting policies a Reporting entity Close Brothers Group plc the company, a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK, together with its subsidiaries collectively, the group, operates through three divisions: Banking, Securities and Asset Management, and is primarily located within the UK.
The company financial statements the company accounts have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with Section 395 of the Companies Act 2006, the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 and with applicable UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its company income statement and related notes.
b Compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards The consolidated financial statements the consolidated accounts have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with all relevant IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, and interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee, endorsed by the European Union EU.
At the balance sheet date the group adopted IAS 1 Presentation of items of other comprehensive income, requiring entities to distinguish between those items that may be reclassified to profit or loss and those items that may not be reclassified to profit and loss, which had become effective during the year.
The adoption of this amendment did not have a material impact on the financial statements of the group.
The following standards and amendments have been issued by the IASB with effective dates, subject to EU endorsement in some cases, which do not impact on these financial statements: Effective for annual periods beginning on or after IAS 19 Employee benefits 1 January 2013 IFRS 7 Disclosures: Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities 1 January 2013 IFRS 13 Fair value measurement 1 January 2013 IFRS Annual improvements 2009 2011 1 January 2013 IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements 1 January 2014 IFRS 11 Joint arrangements 1 January 2014 IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in other entities 1 January 2014 IAS 27 Separate financial statements 1 January 2014 IAS 28 Investments in associates 1 January 2014 IAS 32 Presentation: Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities 1 January 2014 IFRS 9 Financial instruments 1 January 2015 The impact of the revised IAS 19 Employee benefits on the groups financial statements is discussed in note 30, all other future standards and amendments are still under review.
c Basis of preparation The consolidated and company accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss, available for sale financial assets and all derivative financial instruments derivatives.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as disclosed in Corporate Governance.
d Consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities over which the group has the power to directly or indirectly govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the group effectively obtains control.
They are fide-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
Special purpose entities SPEs are consolidated when the substance of the relationship between the group and its entity indicates control by the group.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries.
Under the acquisition method of accounting, with some limited exceptions, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any non-controlling interest is measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportion of the net assets acquired.
Acquisition related costs are accounted for as expenses when incurred, unless directly related to the issue of debt or equity securities.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over net assets is capitalised as goodwill.
All intra group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated.
Close Brothers Group plc 69 Annual Report 2013 Associates The consolidated accounts also incorporate the financial statements of entities that are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures but over which the company has significant influence associates, using the equity method of accounting.
This applies where the company and the group hold 20% or more of an entitys voting rights, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that no significant influence exists.
The groups share of an associates results is included in the consolidated income statement from the date it becomes an associate to the date it stops being so.
Under the equity method of accounting, the investment in an associate is initially recognised at cost.
This carrying amount subsequently increases for the groups share of any profit and decreases for the groups share of any losses or distributions received.
The carrying amount is reviewed annually for impairment.
e Assets held for sale Assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable.
They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are shown separately on the face of the consolidated balance sheet.
f Foreign currency translation For the company and those subsidiaries whose balance sheets are denominated in sterling which is the companys functional and presentation currency, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the closing rates of exchange at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into sterling at the average rates of exchange over the year and exchange differences arising are taken to the consolidated income statement.
The balance sheets of subsidiaries and an associate denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the closing rates.
The income statements for these subsidiaries and associate are translated at the average rates and exchange differences arising are taken to equity.
Such exchange differences are reclassified to the consolidated income statement in the period in which the subsidiary or associate is disposed of.
g Revenue recognition Interest Interest on loans and advances made by the group, and fee income and expense and other direct costs relating to loan origination, restructuring or commitments are recognised in the consolidated income statement using the effective interest rate method.
The effective interest rate method applies a rate that discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts relating to a financial instrument to its net carrying amount.
The cash flows take into account all contractual terms of the financial instrument including transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts but not future credit losses.
Fees and commissions Where fees that have not been included within the effective interest rate method are earned on the execution of a significant act, such as fees arising from negotiating or arranging a transaction for a third party, they are recognised as revenue when that act has been completed.
Fees and corresponding expenses in respect of other services are recognised in the consolidated income statement as the right to consideration or payment accrues through performance of services.
In particular, upfront commissions paid in respect of managing, as opposed to originating fund products are initially included within accruals and deferred income and then recognised as revenue as the services are provided.
To the extent that fees and commissions are recognised in advance of billing they are included as accrued income or expense.
Dividends Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Gains less losses arising from dealing in securities This includes the net gains arising from both buying and selling securities and from positions held in securities, including related interest income and dividends.
h Exceptional items Items of income and expense that are material by size and or nature and are non-recurring are classified as exceptional items on the face of the consolidated income statement.
The separate reporting of these items helps give an indication of the groups underlying performance.
Close Brothers Group plc 70 Annual Report 2013 Financial Statements The Notes 1.
Significant accounting policies continued i Financial assets and liabilities excluding derivatives Classification The group classifies its financial assets into the following measurement categories: i financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss: ii loans and receivables: and iii available for sale.
Financial liabilities are classified as either held at fair value through profit or loss, or at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Management determines the classification of its financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition.
Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss This category has two sub-categories: financial assets and liabilities held for trading, and those designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception.
A financial asset or liability is classified as trading if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term, which for the group relates to the securities trading businesses.
Financial assets and liabilities may be designated at fair value through profit or loss when: The designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities on a different basis: A group of financial assets and or liabilities is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis: or The assets or liabilities include embedded derivatives and such derivatives are required to be recognised separately.
Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value taken directly to the consolidated income statement.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and it is expected that substantially all of the initial investment will be recovered, other than because of credit deterioration.
Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method and recorded net of provisions for impairment losses.
Available for sale Available for sale assets are those non-derivative financial assets intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, which may be sold in response to liquidity requirements or changes in interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices.
Available for sale financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value taken to a separate component of equity until the asset is sold, or is impaired, when the cumulative gain or loss is transferred to the consolidated income statement.
The fair values of quoted financial assets or financial liabilities in active markets are based on current prices.
If the market for a financial asset or financial liability is not active, or they relate to unlisted securities, the group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques.
These include the use of recent arms length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.
Derecognition Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
If substantially all the risks and rewards have been neither retained nor transferred and the group has retained control, the assets continue to be recognised to the extent of the groups continuing involvement.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished.
j Impairment of financial assets The group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets classified as available for sale or loans and receivables is impaired.
A financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired and an impairment loss incurred if there is objective evidence that an event or events since initial recognition of the asset have adversely affected the amount or timing of future cash flows from the asset.
Financial assets at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on a financial asset or group of financial assets classified as loans and receivables has been incurred, the group measures the amount of the loss as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets and the present value of estimated future cash flows from the asset or group of assets discounted at the effective interest rate of the instrument at initial recognition.
Impairment losses are assessed individually for financial assets that are individually significant and individually or collectively for assets that are not individually significant.
In making collective assessment of impairment, financial assets are grouped into portfolios on the basis of similar risk characteristics.
For loans and receivables, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the loans carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
As the loan amortises over its life, the impairment loss may amortise.
All impairment losses are reviewed at least at each reporting date.
If subsequently the amount of the loss decreases as a result of a new event, the relevant element of the outstanding Close Brothers Group plc 71 Annual Report 2013 impairment loss is reversed.
Interest on impaired financial assets is recognised at the original effective interest rate applied to the carrying amount as reduced by an allowance for impairment.
For loans that are not considered individually significant, the group adopts a formulaic approach which allocates a loss rate dependent on the overdue period.
Loss rates are based on the discounted expected future cash flows and are regularly benchmarked against actual outcomes to ensure they remain appropriate.
Financial assets carried at fair value When a decline in the fair value of a financial asset classified as available for sale has been recognised directly in equity and there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss is removed from equity and recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The loss is measured as the difference between the amortised cost of the financial asset and its current fair value.
Impairment losses on available for sale equity instruments are not reversed through the consolidated income statement, but those on available for sale debt instruments are reversed, if there is an increase in fair value that is objectively related to a subsequent event.
k Settlement accounts Settlement balance debtors and creditors are the amounts due to and from counterparties in respect of the groups market-making activities, and are carried at amortised cost.
The balances are short term in nature, do not earn interest and are recorded at the amount receivable or payable.
l Loans to and from money brokers against stock advanced Loans to money brokers against stock advanced is the cash collateral provided to these institutions for stock borrowing by the groups market-making activities, and is carried at amortised cost.
Interest is paid on the stock borrowed and earned on the cash deposits held.
The stock borrowing to which the cash deposits relate is short term in nature and is recorded at the amount receivable.
Loans from money brokers against stock collateral provided is recorded at the amount payable.
Interest is paid on the loans payable.
m Finance leases, operating leases and hire purchase contracts A finance lease is a lease or hire purchase contract that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset to the lessee.
Finance leases are recognised as loans at an amount equal to the gross investment in the lease discounted at its implicit interest rate.
Finance charges on finance leases are taken to income in proportion to the net funds invested.
Rental costs under operating leases and hire purchase contracts are charged to the consolidated income statement in equal annual amounts over the period of the leases.
n Sale and repurchase agreements and other secured lending and borrowings Securities may be sold subject to a commitment to repurchase them.
Such securities are retained on the consolidated balance sheet when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership remain with the group.
The transactions are treated as collateralised borrowing and the counterparty liability is included within loans and overdrafts from banks.
Similar secured borrowing transactions including securities lending transactions and collateralised short-term notes are treated and presented in the same way.
These secured financing transactions are initially recognised at fair value, and subsequently valued at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
o Securitisation transactions Where the group securitises its own financial assets, this is achieved via the sale of these assets to an SPE, which in turn issues securities to investors.
All financial assets continue to be held on the groups consolidated balance sheet and debt securities in issue are recognised for the proceeds of the funding transaction.
p Offsetting financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented on the consolidated balance sheet if, and only if, there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise an asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
q Derivatives and hedge accounting In general, derivatives are used to minimise the impact of interest, currency rate and equity price changes to the groups financial instruments.
They are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value which is obtained from quoted market prices in active markets, including recent market transactions and discounted cash flow models.
On acquisition, certain derivatives are designated as a hedge and the group formally documents the relationship between these derivatives and the hedged item.
The group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
If a hedge was deemed partially ineffective but continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the amount of the ineffectiveness, taking into account the timing of the expected cash flows where relevant, would be recorded in the consolidated income statement.
If the hedge is not, or has ceased to be, highly effective the group discontinues hedge accounting.
Close Brothers Group plc 72 Annual Report 2013 Financial Statements The Notes 1.
Significant accounting policies continued For fair value hedges, changes in the fair value are recognised in the consolidated income statement, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged item.
For cash flow hedges, the fair value gain or loss associated with the effective proportion of the cash flow hedge is recognised initially directly in equity and recycled to the consolidated income statement in the period when the hedged item affects income.
Some contracts hybrid contracts contain both a derivative embedded derivative and a non-derivative host contract.
Where the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivatives are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract itself is not carried at fair value through profit or loss, the embedded derivative is bifurcated and reported at fair value and gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
r Intangible assets Computer software and intangible assets on acquisition excluding goodwill are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and provisions for impairment.
Amortisation is calculated to write off their cost on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives as follows: Computer software 3 to 5 years Intangible assets on acquisition 8 to 20 years Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill is assessed annually for impairment and carried at cost less any accumulated impairment.
s Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and provisions for impairment.
Depreciation is calculated to write off their cost on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Long leasehold property 40 years Short leasehold property Over the length of the lease Fixtures, fittings and equipment 3 to 5 years Assets held under operating leases 5 to 15 years Motor vehicles 5 years t Share capital Share issue costs Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options including those issued on the acquisition of a business are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Dividends on ordinary shares Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in equity in the period in which they are paid or, if earlier, approved by shareholders.
Treasury shares Where the company or any member of the group purchases the companys share capital, the consideration paid is deducted from shareholders equity as treasury shares until they are cancelled.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in shareholders equity.
u Employee benefits The group operates defined contribution pension schemes and a defined benefit pension scheme for eligible employees.
Under the defined contribution scheme the group pays fixed contributions into a fund separate from the groups assets.
Contributions are charged in the consolidated income statement when they become payable.
Under the defined benefit scheme eligible employees retirement receipts are defined by factors such as salary, length of service and age.
The liabilities of the groups defined benefit scheme, which was closed to new entrants in 1996 and to future accrual in 2012, are measured using the projected unit credit method and discounted at a rate that reflects the current rate of return on high quality corporate bonds with a term that matches that of the liabilities.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the consolidated income statement over the members expected average remaining working lives.
The net deficit or surplus on the plan, comprising the present value of the defined benefit obligations less the fair value of plan assets and any unrecognised actuarial gains and losses, is carried on the consolidated balance sheet.
Under the revised IAS 19 Employee benefits which will be effective for our 2014 financial year, actuarial gains and losses remeasurements can no longer be deferred using the corridor method and must be recognised immediately in other comprehensive income.
Close Brothers Group plc 73 Annual Report 2013 v Share-based payments to employees The group operates five share-based award schemes, an annual bonus plan and four long-term incentive schemes Incentive Schemes : the Share Matching Plan SMP, the 2009 Long Term Incentive Plan which replaced the 2004 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS and the Inland Revenue approved Save As You Earn SAYE scheme.
The costs of the awards granted under the annual bonus plan are based on the salary of the individual at the time the award is made.
The value of the share award at the grant date is charged to the groups consolidated income statement in the year to which the award relates.
The cost of the Incentive Schemes is based on the fair value of awards on the date of grant.
Fair values for market based performance conditions are determined using a stochastic Monte Carlo simulation pricing model for the SMP and LTIP and the Black-Scholes pricing model for the other schemes.
Both models take into account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk free interest rate, the expected volatility of the companys share price over the life of the option award and other relevant factors.
For non-market based performance conditions, vesting conditions are not taken into account when measuring fair value, but are reflected by adjusting the number of shares in each award such that the amount recognised reflects the number that are expected to, and then actually do, vest.
The fair value is expensed in the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding credit to the share-based payments reserve.
At the end of the vesting period, or upon exercise, lapse or forfeit if earlier, this credit is transferred to retained earnings.
Further information on the groups schemes is provided in note 31 and in the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration.
w Provisions and contingent liabilities Provisions are recognised in respect of present obligations arising from past events where it is probable that outflows of resources will be required to settle the obligations and they can be reliably estimated.
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence depends on the outcome of uncertain future events or those present obligations where the outflows of resources are uncertain or cannot be measured reliably.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless they are remote.
x Taxes, including deferred taxes Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the consolidated income statement because it excludes items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible.
The groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
To enable the tax charge to be based on the profit for the year, deferred tax is provided in full on temporary timing differences, at the rates of tax expected to apply when these differences crystallise.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which temporary differences can be set.
All deferred tax liabilities are offset against deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of IAS 12 Income taxes.
y Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprises cash and demand deposits with banks together with short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
z Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Executive Committee which is considered the groups chief operating decision maker.
All transactions between business segments are conducted on an arms length basis, with intra-segment revenue and costs being eliminated on consolidation.
Income and expenses directly associated with each segment are included in determining business segment performance.
Close Brothers Group plc 74 Annual Report 2013 Financial Statements The Notes 2.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The reported results of the group are sensitive to the accounting policies, assumptions and estimates that underlie the preparation of its financial statements.
UK company law and IFRS require the directors, in preparing the groups financial statements, to select suitable accounting policies, apply them consistently and make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
The groups estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and expectation of future events and are reviewed periodically.
The actual outcome may be materially different from that anticipated.
The judgements and assumptions involved in the groups accounting policies that are considered by the board to be the most important to the portrayal of its financial condition are as follows: a Impairment of loans and advances Allowances for loan impairment represent managements estimate of the losses incurred in the loan portfolios at the balance sheet date.
Changes to the allowances for loan impairment are reported in the consolidated income statement as impairment losses on loans and advances.
Impairment provisions are made if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more subsequent events regarding a significant loan or a portfolio of loans and its impact can be reliably estimated.
Individual impairment losses are determined as the difference between the carrying value and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the loans original effective interest rate.
Impairment losses determined on a portfolio basis are calculated using a formulaic approach which allocates a loss rate dependent on the overdue period.
Estimating the amount and timing of future recoveries involves significant judgement, and considers the level of arrears as well as the assessment of matters such as future economic conditions and the value of collateral.
All impairment losses are reviewed at least annually.
b Fair value of financial instruments Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arms length transaction.
Some of the groups financial instruments are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value either reported within the consolidated income statement or within equity until the instrument is sold or becomes impaired.
An analysis of financial instruments carried at fair value by valuation hierarchy and particulars of valuation techniques used is included in note 33 and the accounting policy set out in note 1 i.
The fair values of quoted financial instruments in active markets are based on current prices.
If the market for a financial instrument, and for unlisted securities, is not active, the group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques.
c Effective interest rate The effective interest rate method applies a rate that discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts relating to a financial instrument to its net carrying amount.
The estimated future cash flows take into account all contractual terms of the financial instrument including transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts but not future credit losses.
Models are reviewed at least annually to assess expected lives of groups of assets based upon actual repayment profiles.
d Goodwill impairment The directors review goodwill for impairment at least annually or when events or changes in economic circumstances indicate that impairment may have taken place.
The recoverable amounts of relevant cash generating units CGUs are based on value in use calculations using managements best estimate of future cash flows and performance, discounted at an appropriate rate which the directors estimate to be the return appropriate to the business.
e Share-based awards The cost of the groups long-term equity based incentive schemes are determined using commonly accepted valuation techniques.
Fair values for market-based performance conditions use models which take into account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk free interest rate, the expected volatility of the companys share price over the life of the option award and other relevant factors.
For non-market based performance conditions, vesting conditions are not taken into account when measuring fair value, but are reflected by adjusting the number of shares in each award such that the amount recognised reflects the number that are expected to, and then actually vest.
Details of the above variables can be found in note 31.
Close Brothers Group plc 75 Annual Report 2013 3.
Segmental analysis The Executive Committee, which is considered to be the groups chief operating decision maker, manages the group by class of business as determined by the products and services offered and presents the segmental analysis on that basis.
The groups activities are organised in three primary operating divisions: Banking, Securities and Asset Management.
A description of the activities, including products and services offered by these divisions is given in the Corporate Overview.
The Group segment includes the groups central functions which comprise Group Executive, Finance, Investor Relations, Legal, Human Resources, Audit, Compliance, Corporate Development, Company Secretariat and Risk.
Group administrative expenses include staff costs, legal and professional fees and property costs attributable to the central functions which support and assist the development of the divisions.
Income within Group is typically immaterial and will include interest on cash balances at Group.
In the segmental reporting information which follows, Group consists of the central functions described above as well as various non-trading head office companies and consolidation adjustments, in order that the information presented reconciles to the consolidated income statement and balance sheet.
Divisions charge market prices for services rendered to other parts of the group.
Funding charges between segments are determined by the Banking divisions Treasury operation taking into account commercial demands.
More than 90% of all the groups activities, revenue and assets are located in the UK.

Exceptional income On 16 September 2011, the group announced the phased sale of its then 49.9% investment in Mako to the Mako management team.
On 30 April 2013, a third phase of the disposal completed reducing our shareholding from 27.3% to 21.3%, with a further disposal in August 2013 reducing our shareholding to 16.3%.
The 1.6 million exceptional income in the year principally reflects realised foreign exchange gains offset by a revaluation on reclassification of Mako from an associate to an available for sale equity investment.
The 5.6 million exceptional income in the year to 31 July 2012 principally reflects realised foreign exchange gains on the second phase of disposal.

Acquisitions 2012 acquisitions On 31 October 2011, the group acquired 100% of Scott-Moncrieff Wealth Management Limited, a Scottish Independent Financial Adviser with 278 million of client assets, for cash consideration of 4.1 million for the equity of the business and 0.6 million for cash on the balance sheet.
This acquisition is not regarded as material in the context of the groups financial statements and therefore the information that would be required for material acquisitions by IFRS 3 has not been disclosed.
Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit attributable to shareholders and the number of basic weighted average shares.

Derivative financial instruments The group enters into derivative contracts with a number of financial institutions as a principal only to minimise the impact of interest and currency rate changes to its financial instruments.

The notional amounts of equity and associated embedded derivatives with a residual maturity of more than one year total 128.9 million 2012: 300.8 million.
Included in the derivatives above are the following IAS 39 cash flow hedges and IAS 39 fair value hedges: 31 July 2013 31 July 2012 Notional Notional value Assets Liabilities value Assets Liabilities million million million million million million Cash flow hedges Interest rate contracts 1,560.6 1.3 3.3 1,256.8 0.4 7.5 Fair value hedges Interest rate contracts 1,268.9 10.5 1.8 1,038.4 16.9 4.1 The cash flow hedges relate to exposure to future interest payments or receipts on recognised financial instruments and on forecast transactions for periods of up to seven 2012: seven years: there was immaterial ineffectiveness.
The cash flow hedge amounts that were removed from equity and included in the consolidated income statement for the years ended 31 July 2013 and 2012 were immaterial.
The amount recognised in equity for cash flow hedges during the year was a 3.6 million gain 2012: 2.3 million loss.
The fair value hedges hedge the interest rate risk in recognised financial instruments: the gain on the hedged items was 4.6million 2012: 3.8 million loss which was largely offset by the 4.3 million loss 2012: 3.7 million gain on the hedging instrument.

The increase of 3.3 million in 2012 primarily relates to the acquisition of Scott-Moncrieff Wealth Management Limited.
In the 2013 financial year, 5.0 million 2012: 4.9 million of the amortisation charge is included in amortisation of intangible assets on acquisition and 6.5 million 2012: 4.3 million of the amortisation charge is included in administrative expenses shown in the consolidated income statement.
Impairment tests for goodwill At 31 July 2013, goodwill has been allocated to 10 individual CGUs.
Seven of these CGUs are within the Banking division, two are within the Securities division and the remaining one is within the Asset Management division.
Goodwill impairment reviews are carried out annually by assessing the recoverable amount of the groups CGUs, which is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
The recoverable amounts for all CGUs were measured based on value in use.
A value in use calculation uses discounted cash flow projections based on the most recent board approved budgets and three year plans to determine the recoverable amount of each CGU.
For cash flows beyond the groups three year planning horizon, a terminal value was calculated using a prudent annual growth rate of 0% 2012: 0%, except for the Close Brothers Asset Management CGU where a growth rate of 2% 2012: 2% is considered more appropriate as the business is expected to grow at a steady rate as it develops and in line with GDP growth rates.
These cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax estimated weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market rates appropriate to the CGU as set out in the table below.
The inputs used in the value in use calculations are sensitive, primarily to the impact of changes in the assumptions for future cash flows, discount rates, and long-term growth rates.
At 31 July 2013, the results of our review indicate there is no goodwill impairment.
Having performed stress tested value in use calculations, the group believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions which have been used would not lead the carrying value of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.

Capital management The groups policy is to be well capitalised and its approach to capital management is driven by strategic and organisational requirements, while also taking into account the regulatory and commercial environments in which it operates.
The PRA supervises the group on a consolidated basis and receives information on the capital adequacy of, and sets capital requirements for, the group as a whole.
In addition, a number of subsidiaries are regulated for prudential purposes by either the PRA or the FCA.
The aim of the capital adequacy regime is to promote safety and soundness in the financial system.
It is structured around three pillars: Pillar 1 on minimum capital requirements: Pillar 2 on the supervisory review process: and Pillar 3 on market discipline.
The groups Pillar 1 information is presented in the following table.
Under Pillar 2, the group completes an annual self assessment of risks known as the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP.
The ICAAP is reviewed by the PRA which culminates in the PRA setting Individual Capital Guidance ICG on the level of capital the group and its regulated subsidiaries are required to hold.
Pillar 3 requires firms to publish a set of disclosures which allow market participants to assess information on that firms capital, risk exposures and risk assessment process.
The groups Pillar 3 disclosures can be found on the groups website www.
The group maintains a strong capital base to support the development of the business and to ensure the group meets the Pillar 1 capital requirements and ICG at all times.
As a result, the group maintains capital adequacy ratios comfortably above minimum regulatory requirements.
Accordingly, the groups individual regulated entities and the group as a whole complied with all of the externally imposed capital requirements to which they are subject for the years ended 31 July 2013 and 2012.
A full analysis of the composition of regulatory capital and Pillar 1 risk weighted assets is shown in the following table, including a reconciliation between equity and core tier 1 capital after deductions.
The groups capital ratios remained strong with a core tier 1 capital ratio of 13.3% 31 July 2012: 12.8% and a total capital ratio of 14.7% 31July 2012: 14.5%.
The capital ratios increased reflecting an increase in regulatory capital with a more modest increase in risk weighted assets.
Core tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital and total regulatory capital increased during the year due to an increase in retained earnings and other reserves.
Risk weighted assets increased largely as a result of growth in the loan book which was partly offset by a reduction in notional risk weighted assets for operational risk reflecting lower trading activity in Securities in recent years.
The composition of capital remained stable with 90.6% 31 July 2012: 88.3% of the total capital consisting of core tier 1 capital.

On 31 January 2013, Mako fulfilled the requirements of IFRS 5 to be classified as held for sale as it was considered highly probable that within the next year Mako would no longer meet the significant influence criteria under IAS 28.
As a result, the group ceased to report its share of profit from associate from 1 February 2013.
On 30 April 2013, the third phase of disposal completed reducing our shareholding from 27.3% to 21.3% resulting in the loss of significant influence as the group was deemed to no longer actively participate in Makos policy decisions.
This disposal resulted in the reclassification of Mako to an available for sale equity investment.
On reclassification the group recorded exceptional income of 1.6 million, reflecting 7.4 million realised foreign exchange gains and 2.5 million dividend income offset by an 8.3 million revaluation adjustment.
In August 2013 a further disposal reduced the groups shareholding to 16.3%.
See notes 5 and 14 for further details.
Makos year end is 31 December which is different to that of the group, therefore the unaudited management accounts of Mako have formed the basis of the financial information used in determining the groups share of the profits to 31 January 2013.
At 31 July 2013 Mako owes nil 31 July 2012: nil to the group.
The groups share of Makos revenue in the period to 31 January 2013, while an associate, amounted to 6.0 million 2012: 18.0 million.
The groups share of Makos assets and liabilities at 31 July 2013 amounted to nil 31July 2012: 31.0 million and nil 31 July 2012: 17.3 million respectively, following Makos reclassification to an available for sale equity investment.

Contingent liabilities and commitments Contingent liabilities Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS A principal subsidiary of the group, CBL, by virtue of being a regulated deposit taker, contributes to the FSCS which provides compensation to customers of financial institutions in the event that an institution is unable, or is likely to be unable, to pay claims against it.
The FSCS raises levies on UK licensed deposit taking institutions to meet such claims based on their share of UK deposits on 31 December of the year preceding the scheme year which runs from 1 April to 31 March.
At 31 July 2013, the group has accrued 1.6 million 2012: 0.4 million for its share of levies that will be raised by the FSCS.
Compensation has previously been paid out by the FSCS funded by loan facilities provided by HM Treasury to FSCS in support of FSCSs obligations to the depositors of banks declared in default.
In April 2012, the FSCS agreed revised terms on the loan facilities including a 70 basis points increase in the interest rate payable to 12 month LIBOR plus 100 basis points.
The facilities are expected to be repaid wholly from recoveries from the failed deposit takers, except for an estimated shortfall of 0.8 billion which the FSCS has announced it intends to collect in three equal instalments beginning in 2013 2014, in addition to the ongoing interest charges on the outstanding loans.
The ultimate FSCS levy to the industry as a result of the collapse of certain financial services firms is dependent on various uncertain factors including the potential recoveries of assets by the FSCS.
The groups share of the ultimate FSCS levy will also depend on the level of protected deposits and the population of FSCS members at the time.

Pensions The group operates defined contribution pension schemes and a defined benefit pension scheme for eligible employees.
Assets of the defined contribution pension schemes are held separately from those of the group.
The charge to the consolidated income statement for the group pension schemes was 8.3 million 2012: 5.2 million and is included within administrative expenses.
Defined benefit pension scheme The groups only defined benefit pension scheme the scheme was closed to new entrants in August 1996 and closed to further accrual during 2012.
At 31 July 2013 this scheme had 69 2012: 75 deferred members and 32 2012: 27 pensioners and dependants.
The remainder of this note relates exclusively to the scheme.
The schemes most recent triennial valuation at 31 July 2012 identified a 6.0 million funding deficit.
The group contributed 3.3 million towards this deficit during the year and has agreed to fund the remaining 2.7 million deficit over the next five years to 31 July 2017.
This recovery plan is subject to a funding update to be performed at 31 May 2015 by the schemes actuary.
Contributions to the scheme in the year to 31 July 2012 were determined by an independent qualified actuary based on triennial valuations at 31 July 2009 using the attained age method.
The IAS19 valuation at 31 July 2013 was based upon the following main actuarial assumptions: 2013 2012 % % Inflation rate Retail Price Index 3.3 2.7 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 4.6 4.8 Expected interest expected long-term return on plan assets 4.6 6.1 1 Mortality assumptions : Existing pensioners from age 65, life expectancy years : Men 24.5 23.8 Women 25.8 25.4 Non-retired members currently aged 50, life expectancy from age 65 years : Men 25.1 26.0 Women 27.9 27.6 1 Based on standard tables SAPS S1 Light produced by the CMI Bureau of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, together with projected future improvements in line with the Medium Cohort subject to a 1.5% per annum underpin.
Under the revised IAS 19 Employee benefits which will be effective for our 2014 financial year, with 2013 comparatives restated, actuarial gains and losses remeasurements can no longer be deferred using the corridor method and must be recognised immediately in other comprehensive income.
On adoption, the groups opening balance sheet will be restated with the current plan surplus, including total unrecognised losses of 5.0million.
Additionally, the expected return on assets assumption is no longer applied, and interest applied on assets will be in line with the discount rate applied to plan liabilities.
Since the revised standard is being adopted in the year to 31July 2014 the return on plan assets assumption used to calculate the expense for these disclosures has been adopted in line with the revised standard.
At 31 July 2012 the expected return on equities was determined by reference to Towers Watsons Global Investment Committees 10 year outlook at 30 June 2012 as adjusted for the inflation assumption disclosed above.
Expected return on fixed interest gilts of 2.0% was based on the 15 year FTSE fixed interest gilt yield at 31 July 2012.
Expected return on index-linked gilts of 2.6% was based on the over five year FTSE index-linked gilts yield adjusted for the inflation assumption disclosed above.
The expected return on corporate bonds of 3.4% was based on the iBoxx over 15 year AA corporate bond index yields of 3.9% reduced by 0.5% for default risk.
Expected return on cash was determined by reference to Towers Watsons Global Investment Committees 10 year outlook at 30 June 2012 as adjusted for the inflation assumption disclosed above.

Financial risk management As a diversified group of financial services businesses, financial instruments are central to the groups activities.
The risk associated with financial instruments represents a significant component of those faced by the group and is analysed in more detail below.
The groups financial risk management objectives are summarised within the Risk and Control Framework in Corporate Governance on page37.
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 1. a Classification The following tables analyse the groups assets and liabilities in accordance with the categories of financial instruments in IAS 39.

Each instrument has been categorised within one of three levels using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
These levels are based on the degree to which the fair value is observable and are defined as follows: Valuation hierarchy Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities where prices are readily available and represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient frequency to provide ongoing pricing information.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly as prices or indirectly derived from prices: and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
Investments classified as Level 1 predominantly comprise UK government securities and listed equity shares.
Investments classified as Level 2 predominantly comprise investment grade corporate bonds, less liquid listed equities and over the counter derivatives.
Investments classified as Level 3 predominantly comprise investments in unlisted equity shares including an entity offering post trade services in securities, a property fund and the groups residual shareholding in Mako.
The valuations of these investments are determined using generally accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models and net asset values.
The group believes that there is no reasonably possible change to the inputs used in the valuation of these positions which would have a material effect on the groups consolidated income statement.

2 At 30 April 2013, Mako was reclassified from an investment in an associate to an available for sale equity share.
The gains recognised in the consolidated income statement relating to instruments held at the year end amounted to 0.3 million 2012: 0.3 million.
c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of a reduction in earnings and or value, as a result of the failure of a counterparty or associated party with whom the group has contracted to meet its obligations in a timely manner and arises mainly from the lending and treasury activities of the Banking division.
The groups lending activities are generally short-term in nature with low average loan size.
In addition the group applies consistent and prudent lending criteria mitigating credit risk.
The credit quality of counterparties with whom the group deposits or whose debt securities are held is monitored within approved limits.
Loans and advances are spread across asset classes, short-term and with a low average loan size in order to control concentration risk in the loan book and associated collateral.
The Banking division monitors the credit quality of the counterparties with whom the group places deposits, enters into derivative contracts or whose debt securities are held against established limits.
Whilst these amounts may be material, the counterparties are all regulated institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies and fall within the large exposure limits set by the regulatory requirements.
Credit risk in the Securities division is limited as the businesses in that division trade in the cash markets with regulated counterparties on a delivery versus payment basis such that any credit exposure is limited to price movements in the underlying securities.
Counterparty exposure and settlement failure monitoring controls are in place.
Credit and counterparty risk, and the measures taken to mitigate or manage these risks, are disclosed within the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section of the Business Review on pages 24 to 27.

Financial risk management continued Maximum exposure to credit risk The table below presents the groups maximum exposure to credit risk, before taking account of any collateral and credit risk mitigation, arising from its on balance sheet and off balance sheet financial instruments at 31 July 2013.
For off balance sheet instruments, the maximum exposure to credit risk represents the contractual nominal amounts.
31 July 31 July 2013 2012 million million On balance sheet Cash and balances at central banks 935.4 706.8 Settlement balances 471.0 442.0 Loans and advances to banks 89.8 110.0 Loans and advances to customers 4,645.6 4,125.9 Debt securities 124.9 406.4 Loans to money brokers against stock advanced 52.1 68.7 Derivative financial instruments 56.8 50.6 6,375.6 5,910.4 Off balance sheet Undrawn commitments 1,036.4 817.6 Total maximum exposure to credit risk 7,412.0 6,728.0 Sovereign and banking sector exposure The group has limited exposure outside the UK.
However, given increased focus on such exposures, particularly in relation to Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, the group considers it appropriate to provide the following disclosure.
The group has no direct exposures to debt issued by sovereign or financial institutions in any of the countries listed above.
At 31 July 2013, the group has loans and advances to customers in Ireland 31 July 2012: Ireland and Spain.
These relate to loans in the groups Retail and Commercial businesses and are issued with the same approach to lending as applied within the UK.
31 July 31 July 2013 2012 million million Loans and advances to customers Ireland 176.4 103.9 Spain 2.2 176.4 106.1 The group has no other material exposure to these economies.
Assets pledged and received as collateral The group pledges assets for repurchase agreements and securities borrowing agreements which are generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary to standard securitised borrowing contracts.
The group has securitised without recourse and restrictions 1,112.7 million 31 July 2012: 1,038.2 million of its insurance premium and motor loan receivables in return for debt securities in issue of 850.0 million 31 July 2012: 835.0 million.
As the group has retained exposure to substantially all the credit risk and rewards of the residual benefit of the underlying assets it continues to recognise these assets in loans and advances to customers in its consolidated balance sheet.
The group has entered into a repurchase agreement whereby FRNs to the value of 21.9 million 31 July 2012: 98.2 million have been lent in exchange for cash of 18.3 million 31 July 2012: 78.8 million which is included within loans and overdrafts from banks.
These FRNs remain on the groups consolidated balance sheet as the group retains the risks and rewards of ownership.
The vast majority of loans and advances to customers are secured against specific assets.
The security will correspond to the type of lending as detailed in the segmental loan book analysis on page 19 of the Business Review.
Consistent and prudent lending criteria is applied across the whole loan book with emphasis on the quality of the security provided.
Loans to money brokers against stock advanced is the cash collateral provided to these institutions for stock borrowing by the groups market-making activities.
The stock borrowing to which the cash deposits relate is short term in nature and is recorded at the amount payable.
Close Brothers Group plc 107 Annual Report 2013 Financial assets: Loans and advances to customers Credit risk management and monitoring Within the Banking division the overall credit risk appetite is set by the CBL board.
The monitoring of credit policy is the responsibility of the Banking divisions risk and compliance committees.
All large loans are subject to approval by the Banking divisions Credit Committees.
Retail, Commercial and Property each use credit underwriting and monitoring measures appropriate to the diverse and specialised nature of their lending.
Retail is typically high volume secured lending with a small average loan size.
Credit issues are identified early via predominantly automated tracking processes.
Remedial actions are implemented promptly to restore customers to a performing status or recovery methods are applied to minimise potential loss.
Commercial is a combination of several niche lending businesses with a diverse mix of loans in terms of assets financed, and average loan size and loan to valuation LTV percentage.
Credit quality is assessed on an individual loan by loan basis.
Recovery activity is executed promptly by experts in the specialised assets.
This approach allows remedial action to be implemented at the appropriate time to minimise potential loss.
Property is a portfolio of higher value, low volume lending.
Loans are continually monitored to determine whether they are performing satisfactorily.
Performing loans with elevated levels of credit risk may be placed on watch lists depending on the perceived severity of the credit risk.
The Banking division has a dual approach to mitigate credit risk by: Lending on a secured basis with significant emphasis on the quality of the underlying security to minimise any loss should the customer not be able to repay: and Where the security collateralising a loan is less tangible, or in cases of higher LTVs, greater scrutiny is applied both analytically and in terms of escalation of sanctioning authority.
Much of the Banking divisions lending is short term and average loan size is small with the result that few individual loans have the capacity to materially impact the groups earnings.
Credit risk reporting Loans and advances to customers within the Banking division, as disclosed in note 12, are analysed between the following categories for credit risk reporting: i Neither past due nor impaired These loans and advances to customers reflect the application of consistent and conservative lending criteria on inception and the quality and level of security held.
The contractual repayments are monitored to ensure that classification as neither past due nor impaired remains appropriate.
It also demonstrates the short-term nature of the lending, with 2.5 billion 2012: 2.2 billion having a contractual maturity of less than 12 months.
The following table shows the ageing of loans and advances to customers split by credit assessment method which are neither past due nor impaired.

Financial risk management continued ii Past due but not impaired Loans and advances to customers are classified as past due but not impaired when the customer has failed to make a payment when contractually due but there is no evidence of impairment.
This includes loans which are individually assessed for impairment but where the value of security is sufficient to meet the required repayments.
This also includes loans to customers which are past due for technical reasons such as delays in payment processing or rescheduling of payment terms.
The following table shows the ageing of loans and advances to customers split by credit assessment method which are past due but for which no impairment provision has been raised.
31 July 2013 31 July 2012 Loans and advances to customers Loans and advances to customers Individually Collectively Individually Collectively assessed assessed Total assessed assessed Total million million million million million million Within one month 65.2 25.5 90.7 72.9 20.6 93.5 Between one and three months 48.1 7.7 55.8 35.4 4.3 39.7 Between three months and one year 32.1 16.2 48.3 39.7 15.4 55.1 Over one year 10.3 38.8 49.1 16.3 33.7 50.0 155.7 88.2 243.9 164.3 74.0 238.3 iii Impaired The factors considered in determining whether assets are impaired are outlined in the accounting policies in note 1 j.
Impaired loans and advances to customers are analysed according to whether the impairment provisions are individually or collectively assessed.
Individually assessed provisions are determined on a case by case basis, taking into account the financial condition of the customer and an estimate of potential recovery from the realisation of security.
Typically this methodology is applied by the Property business and by the invoice finance business within Commercial.
Collectively assessed provisions are considered on a portfolio basis, to reflect the homogeneous nature of the assets.
A percentage of the portfolio is impaired by evaluating the ageing of missed payments combined with the historical recovery rates for that particular portfolio.
Typically this methodology is applied by the Retail businesses and the asset finance business within Commercial.
The gross impaired loans are quoted without taking account of any collateral or security held, which could reduce the potential loss.
The application of conservative loan to value ratios on inception and the emphasis on the quality of the security provided, are reflected in the low provision to gross impaired balance ratio coverage ratio of 31% 2012: 30%.
The following table shows gross impaired loans and advances to customers and the provision thereon split by assessment method.
31 July 2013 31 July 2012 Loans and advances to customers Loans and advances to customers Individually Collectively Individually Collectively assessed assessed Total assessed assessed Total million million million million million million Gross impaired loans 120.6 80.4 201.0 147.8 85.8 233.6 Provisions 43.4 18.5 61.9 46.6 23.7 70.3 Net impaired loans 77.2 61.9 139.1 101.2 62.1 163.3 The amount of interest income accrued on impaired loans and advances to customers was 19.9 million 31 July 2012: 21.5 million.
Whilst collateral is reviewed on a regular basis in accordance with credit policy, this varies according to the type of lending, collateral involved and the status of the loan.
It is therefore impracticable to estimate and aggregate current fair values for collateral.
Financial assets: Settlement balances Credit risk management and monitoring The credit risk presented by settlement balances in the Securities division is limited as such balances represent delivery versus payment transactions where delivery of securities occurs simultaneously with payment.
The credit risk is therefore limited to the change in market price of a security between trade date and settlement date and not the absolute value of the trade.
The Securities businesses are market-makers and they trade on a principal only basis.
The Securities businesses trade only with regulated counterparties including stockbrokers, wealth managers, institutions and hedge funds who are either authorised and regulated by the PRA and or FCA or equivalent regulator in the respective country.
Close Brothers Group plc 109 Annual Report 2013 Credit risk reporting Settlement balances are classified as neither past due nor impaired when the respective trades have not yet reached their settlement date.
Settlement balances are classified as past due but not impaired when trades fail to be settled on their contractual settlement date.
The credit risk presented by settlement balances which are past due is mitigated by the delivery versus payment mechanism, as well as by the Securities businesses trading only with regulated counterparties.
Counterparty exposure and settlement failure monitoring controls are in place as part of an overall risk management framework and settlement balances past due are actively managed.
The following table shows the ageing of settlement balances: 31 July 2013 31 July 2012 Neither past Past due Neither past Past due due nor but not due nor but not impaired impaired Total impaired impaired Total million million million million million million Within one month 447.7 16.6 464.3 419.2 17.9 437.1 Between one and three months 4.2 4.2 2.3 2.3 Between three months and one year 1.3 1.3 1.2 1.2 Over one year 1.2 1.2 1.4 1.4 447.7 23.3 471.0 419.2 22.8 442.0 d Market risk Market risk is the risk that a change in the value of an underlying market variable, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, will give rise to an adverse movement in the value of the groups assets and arises primarily in the Securities division.
Interest rate risk The groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations relates primarily to the returns from its capital and reserves which, as a matter of policy, are not hedged.
The groups policy is to match fixed and variable interest rate liabilities and assets utilising interest rate swaps where necessary to secure the margin on its loans and advances to customers.
These interest rate swaps are disclosed in note 15.
The sensitivities below are based upon reasonably possible changes in interest rate scenarios, including parallel shifts in the yield curve.
At 31 July 2013 changes in interest rates compared to actual rates would increase decrease the groups annual net interest income by the following amounts: 2013 2012 million million 1.0% increase 2012: 1.0% increase 2.7 2.5 0.5% decrease 2012: 0.5% decrease 1.4 1.3 At 31 July 2013 changes in interest rates compared to actual rates would increase decrease the groups equity by the following amounts: 2013 2012 million million 1.0% increase 2012: 1.0% increase 11.7 8.6 0.5% decrease 2012: 0.5% decrease 5.8 4.3 Foreign currency risk The group has a number of currency investments in subsidiaries and has chosen not to hedge these exposures.
These investments are predominantly in US dollars and euros.
Foreign exchange differences which arise from the translation of these operations are recognised directly in equity.
At 31 July 2013 changes in exchange rates would decrease the groups equity by the following amounts: 2013 2012 million million 20% strengthening of sterling against the US dollar 2012: 20% strengthening 3.7 20% strengthening of sterling against the euro 2012: 20% strengthening 5.7 4.4 The group has additional material currency assets and liabilities primarily as a result of treasury operations in the Banking division.
These assets and liabilities are matched by currency, using exchange rate derivative contracts where necessary.
Details of these contracts are disclosed in note 15.
Other potential group exposures arise from share trading settled in foreign currency in the Securities division, and foreign currency equity investments.
The group has policies and processes in place to manage foreign currency risk, and as such the impact of any reasonably expected exchange rate fluctuations would not be material.

The average exposure has been calculated on a daily basis.
The highest and lowest exposures occurred on different dates and therefore a net position of these exposures does not reflect a spread of the trading book.
Based upon the trading book exposure given above, a hypothetical fall of 10% in market prices would result in a 2.9 million decrease 2012: 1.5 million decrease in the groups income and net assets on the equity trading book and a 0.7 million decrease 2012: 0.3 million increase on the debt securities trading book.
However, the groups trading activity is mainly market-making where positions are managed throughout the day on a continuous basis.
Accordingly the sensitivity referred to above is purely hypothetical.
Non-trading financial instruments Net gains and losses on non-trading financial instruments are disclosed in notes 13 and 14.
Close Brothers Group plc 111 Annual Report 2013 e Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that liabilities cannot be met when they fall due or can only be met at an uneconomic price and arises mainly in the Banking division.
The group has a prudent liquidity position with total available funding at 31 July 2013 of 6.3 billion 31 July 2012: 5.9 billion.
This funding is significantly in excess of its loans and advances to customers at 31 July 2013 of 4.6 billion 31 July 2012: 4.1 billion.
The group has a large portfolio of high quality liquid assets including cash placed on deposit with the Bank of England and gilts.
