The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these calculations are long term growth rates and pre-tax discount rates and use cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and forecasts approved by management covering a five year period.
Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates based on local expected economic conditions and do not exceed the long term average growth rate for that country.
The pre-tax discount rates are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks relating to the country in which the CGU operates.

The impairment charge was primarily driven by an increase in the discount rate applied as a result of increases in UK gilt rates and reflecting the normal year end review of long term growth expectations.
Given the current economic climate, a sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing recoverable amounts of goodwill for all CGUs.
This has been based on changes in key assumptions considered to be reasonably possible by management.
There are no other CGUs that are sensitive to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions.
The changes set out below to the assumptions used in the impairment review would, in isolation, lead to an increase decrease to the impairment loss recognised in the year ended 30 September 2013: 2013 Increase Decrease by 0.2pp by 0.2pp Growth and discount rates m m Pre-tax discount rate 34 35 Residual growth rates 26 24 In 2012, for the UK, to which goodwill of 1,803 million was allocated, an increase in the discount rate of 0.2 percentage points pp or a decrease in the long term growth rate of 0.2pp would have eliminated the headroom of approximately 46 million under each scenario.
