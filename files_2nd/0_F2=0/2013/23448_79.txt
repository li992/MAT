In November 2007, Electra entered into a co-investment agreement with Electra Partners Club 2007 LP Club, a fund managed by Electra Partners LLP.
The co-investment agreement requires Electra to coinvest at the ratio of 2:1 in all Electra Partners investments in private equity opportunities in Western Europe where the combined investment of Electra and the Club would represent a controlling stake and where the combined equity investment is between 25 million to 75 million.
Both parties will invest on the same terms and conditions.
The agreement allows for variations to these arrangements in certain prescribed circumstances.
For example, where investment would compromise Electras ability to qualify as an Investment Trust or where the Club would exceed certain concentration ratios.
Investments that arise from interests that Electra already held prior to the establishment of the Club are unaffected by these sharing arrangements.
These arrangements expired in May 2013.
