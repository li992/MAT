Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows relevant to the acquisition generating the goodwill.
The recoverable amount is based on value in use calculations using pre-tax discounted cash flow projections based on the Groups current year results and a future growth rate of 3% per annum 2012: 3%, for 25 years.
The goodwill relates predominantly to the value in the commercial and other synergies arising from the combination of acquired businesses, or the specific technologies or products acquired, with Crodas established global sales, marketing and R&D networks.
Unless the risk profile of a particular acquisition dictates otherwise, the cash flows are discounted using the Groups weighted average cost of capital, which for these purposes has been calculated to be approximately 6.4% pre-tax 2012: 6.8%.
The key assumptions underpinning the forecasts employed in the value in use calculation reflect a prudent view of past experience and are that market share will not change significantly and that gross and operating margins will remain broadly constant.
In respect of brought-forward goodwill, the directors believe there are no reasonably probable significant changes in assumptions which would give rise to an impairment charge in the year.
Goodwill arising in the year will be subject to the same assumptions and review process commencing the year after initial recognition.
Reclassifications represent amounts transferred from plant and equipment upon completion of asset construction projects.
Whilst these projects remain in progress, all capital expenditure is disclosed within plant and equipment.
