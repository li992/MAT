The carrying value was compared to the recoverable amount which was determined by value in use.
Although cash flows have been identified for certain individual plants for the purposes of assessing the recoverable amounts, the business is principally managed as a network in the United States and Europe, with a large amount of interdependency between plants, with plants servicing both the Speciality Food Ingredients and Bulk Ingredients segments.
As a result, except as noted, it is not possible to allocate goodwill to either the Bulk Ingredients or the Speciality Food Ingredients segments.
Therefore, goodwill is tested for impairment on a geographical basis except where goodwill can be allocated to an identifiable separate cash-generating unit CGU.
Unless otherwise stated, impairment reviews are carried out in accordance with the methodology set out in Notes 2 and 3 using cash flows based on the latest Board approved management projections with management determined budgeted gross margin based on past performance and its expectations of market development.
The discount rates used are pre-tax and are based on the Groups WACC adjusted to reflect specific risks relating to the relevant operating segments.
The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.
The terminal value is based on the long-term growth rate for the relevant geographical markets and is approximately 2% or lower per year.
a Goodwill within the Speciality Food Ingredients segment includes amounts relating to the acquisition of G. C. Hahn & Company in June 2007 and the acquisition of the Cesalpinia Foods group in December 2005 which are all within the Food Systems division, which totals 63 million 2012 62 million.
These businesses have been tested for impairment as one CGU following sufficient integration between the businesses.
A pre-tax discount rate of 10.1% 2012 10.4% has been used with cash flow projections based on the five-year business plan.
A 2% growth was assumed in perpetuity based on the long-term national average growth rates for the geographic markets in which these businesses operate.
Management has concluded that no impairment is required.
The remaining goodwill relates to a number of smaller acquisitions, each of which has been tested for impairment using management projections for five years, pre-tax discount rates of 10.1% 2012 10.4% and 2% growth assumed in perpetuity based on long-term national average growth rate for these markets.
Significant headroom exists and management has concluded that no impairment is required.
