Remuneration Responsibilities The Board have resolved that a remuneration committee is not appropriate for a company of this size and nature.
Remuneration responsibilities are part of the Boards responsibilities, to be addressed regularly by the Board as a whole.
All Directors are non-executive and all participate in meetings of the Board at which Directors remuneration is considered.
Individual Directors are not involved in discussions relating to their own remuneration.
The Board seeks advice, inter alia, from the Company Secretary, Invesco Asset Management Limited, when considering the level of Directors fees.
Policy on Directors Remuneration The Boards policy is that the remuneration of non-executive Directors should be fair and reasonable in relation to the time commitment and responsibilities of the Director.
It is intended that this policy will continue for the year ended 31 March 2013 and subsequent years.
During the year, the Board has reviewed Directors remuneration taking into consideration the increasing demands and accountability of the current corporate governance and regulatory environment.
They concluded that the current level of Directors remuneration continues to be appropriate for the time being.
Since 1 April 2010, Directors remuneration per annum has been as follows: 30,000 Chairman: 25,000 Audit Committee Chairman: and 20,000 other Directors.
Prior to this increase, the last Directors remuneration increase was in July 2006.
Fees for the Directors are determined by the Board within the limits stated in the Companys Articles of Association.
As at 31 March 2013, the maximum dictated by the Companys Articles of Association was 200,000 in aggregate per annum.
The Directors are not eligible for bonuses, pension benefits, share options or other incentives or benefits.
Directors Service Contracts All Directors have letters of appointment which are available for inspection at the Registered Office of the Company and on the Managers website.
Under the Articles of Association of the Company, the terms of the Directors appointments provide that a Director shall retire and be subject to election at the first AGM after appointment and re-election at least every three years thereafter.
In accordance with the 2010 AIC Code of Corporate Governance, all the Directors will be subject to annual re-election.
The terms also provide that a Director may be removed from office without notice and that no compensation will be due on leaving office.
