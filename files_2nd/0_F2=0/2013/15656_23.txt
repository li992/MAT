Thomas Cook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 99 Notes to the financial statements 1 General information Thomas Cook Group plc is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006 and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The address of the registered office is 3rd Floor, South Building, 200 Aldersgate, London EC1A 4HD.
The principal activities of the Group are discussed in the Directors Report Business Review on pages 17 to 19.
These consolidated financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 27 November 2013.
1 1 1 2 Accounting policies These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to groups reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, except for revaluation of certain financial instruments, investment property, share-based payments and defined benefit pension obligations.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial information presented in this document are set out below.
These policies have been applied consistently to the periods presented unless otherwise stated.
Comparative amounts have been restated to include North America within discontinued operations.
In addition, following changes in management responsibilities, the former West Europe and Central Europe segments have been combined into one segment, Continental Europe.
The comparative segmental information for the year ended 30 September 2012 has been restated.
The Groups policy on separately disclosed items has been expanded to include the interest income and charges arising on the Groups 2 defined benefit pension schemes as well as the interest charges arising on the unwind of discount on exceptional provisions and deferred consideration.
Basis of preparation Adoption of new or amended standards and interpretations in the current year In the current year, the following new or amended standards have been adopted.
Their adoption has not had a significant impact on the amounts reported or the disclosure and presentation in these financial statements, but may impact the accounting or the disclosure and presentation for the future transactions and arrangements.
IAS 1 Amendment Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income is effective for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 July 2012.
The amendment requires disclosure of items that may be reclassified to profit or loss and items that will not be reclassified to profit or loss.
3 Financial statements Directors report Strategic report 100 Thomas Cook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 Transformation the first 365 days Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Accounting policies continued New or amended standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective and not EU endorsed The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that are expected to impact the Group, which have not been applied in these financial statements, with the exception of IAS 19 R Employee Benefits EU endorsed, were in issue, but are not yet effective: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is effective for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2015.
The standard will eventually replace IAS 39 but currently only details the requirements for recognition and measurement of financial assets.
IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
This standard builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 11 Joint arrangements is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
This standard provides for a more realistic reflection of joint arrangements by focusing on the rights and obligations of the arrangement, rather than its legal form.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in other entities is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
This standard includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off balance sheet vehicles.
IFRS 13 Fair value measurement is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
This standard applies to IFRSs that require or permit fair value measurements or disclosures and provides a single IFRS framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurement.
IAS 27 revised Separate financial statements is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
This standard includes the provisions on separate financial statements that are left after the control provisions of IAS 27 have been included in the new IFRS 10.
IAS 28 revised Investments in associates and joint ventures is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
This standard includes the requirements for joint ventures, as well as associates, to be equity accounted following the issue of IFRS 11.
IFRS 7 amendment Financial instruments: disclosures is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, and amends the disclosures required where certain items have been offset.
IAS 32 Offsetting financial assets and liabilities is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, and provides clarification on the application of offsetting rules.
The Group continues to assess the impact of adopting the above new or amended standards and interpretations in future accounting periods.
IAS 19 revised 2011 Employee benefits is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
The most significant change that will impact the Group is that both the expected returns on pension plan assets currently based on expected returns and the finance charge currently based on the unwinding of the discount rate on scheme liabilities will be replaced with a single net interest expense or income, calculated by applying the discount rate used in determining the present value of scheme liabilities to the net defined benefit asset or liability.
Had the Standard been applied in the current financial year, the Groups profit before tax would have been reduced by approximately 5m.
Basis of consolidation The Groups financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
The results of subsidiaries acquired, or disposed of, are consolidated for the periods from, or to, the date on which control passed.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method.
Where a transaction is a business combination amongst entities under common control, the requirements of IFRS 3 R are applied.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured at fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued, contingent consideration arrangements entered into, and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
Directly attributable transaction costs are expensed as incurred.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
When the ownership of an acquired company is less than 100%, the non-controlling interest is measured as the proportion of the recognised net assets attributable to the non-controlling interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Where audited financial accounts are not coterminous with those of the Group, the financial information is derived from the last audited accounts available and unaudited management accounts for the period up to the Companys balance sheet date.
Thomas Cook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 101 2 Accounting policies continued All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Interpretation guidance included within SIC Interpretation 12 Consolidation special purpose entities, indicates that certain special purpose entities SPEs, which are involved in aircraft leasing arrangements with the Group, should be interpreted as being controlled by the Group, and therefore subject to consolidation, even though the Group has no direct or indirect equity interest in those entities.
1 1 1 As a consequence, the Group has consolidated three 2012: three SPEs that own four 2012: four aircraft operated by the Group on operating leases.
In addition, during 2009 the operations of the German airline were placed in a holding company in which the Group owns a 50.0023% direct interest.
All risks and rewards continue to be held by the Group and, in accordance with accounting standards, the entity has been treated as being 100% controlled and fully consolidated by the Group.
Associates and joint ventures Entities, other than subsidiaries, over which the Group exerts significant influence, but not control or joint control, are associates.
Entities which the Group jointly controls with one or more other party under a contractual arrangement are joint ventures.
The Groups share of the results of associates and joint ventures is included in the Group income statement using the equity accounting method.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are included in the Group balance sheet at cost, as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the entity, and including any goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment loss.
When the Groups shares of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate or joint venture, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the associates.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provided evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Intangible assets goodwill 2 Goodwill arising on an acquisition represents any excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset, and is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Groups income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units.
The allocation of goodwill is made to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
The Group allocates goodwill to each segment in which it operates.
On disposal of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets other Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are carried on the Groups balance sheet at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised.
For all other intangible assets, amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the assets useful life, as follows: Brands 10 years to indefinite life Customer relationships 1 to 15 years Computer software 3 to 10 years Other acquired intangible assets are assessed separately and useful lives established according to the particular circumstances.
3 Indefinite-lived intangible assets principally comprise those trademarks for which there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which they are expected to generate net cash inflows.
These are considered to have an indefinite life, given the strength and durability of our brands and the level of marketing support.
The nature of the industry we operate in is such that brand obsolescence is not common, if appropriately supported by advertising and marketing spend.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually at the CGU level by comparing their carrying amount to their recoverable amount.
All other intangible assets are assessed at each reporting date for indications of impairment.
If such indications exist, the recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying amount.
If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount and the impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Financial statements Directors report Strategic report 102 Thomas Cook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 Transformation the first 365 days Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of straight-line depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Where costs are incurred as part of the start-up or commissioning of an item of property, plant or equipment, and that item is available for use but incapable of operating in the manner intended by management without such a start-up or commissioning period, then such costs are included within the cost of the item.
Costs that are not directly attributable to bringing an asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land, upon which no depreciation is provided, is calculated on a straight-line basis and aims to write down their cost to their estimated residual value over their expected useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings 40 to 50 years Leasehold properties Shorter of remaining lease period and 40 years Aircraft 18 years or remaining lease period if shorter Aircraft spares 5 to 15 years or remaining lease period if shorter Other fixed assets 3 to 15 years Estimated residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually.
Investment property comprises land and buildings which are held for long-term rental yields and capital growth.
It is carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Investment property is valued annually by external qualified professional valuers in the countries concerned.
In the event of a material change in market conditions between the valuation date and balance sheet date, an internal valuation is performed and adjustments made to reflect any material changes in fair value.
Non-current assets held for sale The Group classifies non-current assets as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
To be classified as held for sale, the assets must be available for immediate sale in their present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for the sale of such assets, and their sale must be highly probable.
Sale is considered to be highly probable when management is committed to a plan to sell the assets and an active programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan has been initiated at a price that is reasonable in relation to their current fair value, and there is an expectation that the sale will be completed within one year from the date of classification.
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are carried on the Groups balance sheet at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Aircraft overhaul and maintenance costs The cost of major overhauls of owned and finance leased engines, auxiliary power units and airframes is capitalised and then amortised over between two and ten years until the next scheduled major overhaul, except where the maintenance of engines and auxiliary power units is carried out under fixed rate contracts, in which case the cost is spread over the period of the contract.
Provision is made for the future costs of major overhauls of operating leased engines, auxiliary power units and airframes by making appropriate charges to the income statement, calculated by reference to hours flown and or the expired lease period, as a consequence of obligations placed upon the Group under the terms of certain operating leases.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Revenue recognition and associated costs Revenue represents the aggregate amount of gross revenue receivable from inclusive tours, travel agency commissions receivable and other services supplied to customers in the ordinary course of business.
Revenue and direct expenses relating to inclusive tours arranged by the Groups leisure travel providers, including travel agency commission, insurance and other incentives, are taken to the income statement on holiday departure.
Revenue relating to travel agency commission on third-party leisure travel products is also recognised on holiday departure.
The costs attributable to producing brochures are expensed when the brochures are available to be sent to customers or retail outlets.
Other revenue and associated expenses are taken to the income statement as earned or incurred.
Revenue and expenses exclude intra-group transactions.
Thomas Cook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 103 2 Accounting policies continued Income statement presentation and separately disclosed items Profit or loss from operations includes the results from operating activities of the Group, before its share of the results of associates and joint ventures.
The Group separately discloses in the income statement: exceptional items: impairment of goodwill and amortisation of business 1 1 1 combination intangibles: and IAS 39 fair value re-measurement.
Exceptional items, namely items that are material either because of their size or their nature, and which are non-recurring, are presented within their relevant income statement category, but highlighted through separate disclosure.
The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide a full understanding of the Groups underlying performance.
Items which are included within the exceptional category include: profits losses on disposal of assets or businesses and costs of acquisitions: costs of integration of significant acquisitions and other major restructuring programmes: significant goodwill or other asset impairments: material write-down of assets reassessment of accruals, reflecting a more cautious evaluation in light of current trading and economic conditions excluding errors or prior year items : other individually material items that are unusual because of their size, nature or incidence.
Material business combination intangible assets were acquired as a result of the merger between Thomas Cook AG and MyTravel Group plc and other business combinations made in subsequent years.
The amortisation of these intangible assets is significant and the Groups management consider that it should be disclosed separately to enable a full understanding of the Groups results.
IAS 39 fair value re-measurement includes movements in forward points related to foreign exchange forward contracts and time value of options in cash flow hedging relationships.
Both items are subject to market fluctuations and unwind when the options or forward 2 contracts mature and therefore are not considered to be part of the Groups underlying performance.
Interest income and charges arising on the Groups defined benefit pension schemes and interest charges arising on the unwind of discount on exceptional provisions and deferred consideration are not considered to be part of the Groups underlying performance.
The Groups management consider that these items should be disclosed separately to enable a full understanding of the Groups results.
Finance income and costs Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested, expected return on pension plan assets and changes in the fair value of held for trading interest-related derivatives, and fair value adjustments to hedged items in a designated fair value hedge.
Finance costs comprise interest costs on borrowings and finance leases, unwind of the discount on provisions, interest cost on pension plan liabilities, changes in the fair value of held for trading interest-related derivatives, movement in forward points on outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts in cash flow hedging relationships and changes in fair value of derivatives designated in a fair value hedge relationship.
The movement in forward points on outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts in cash flow hedging relationships is included as a separately disclosed item in the income statement under the description IAS 39 fair value re-measurement.
The changes in fair value on derivatives designated in a fair value hedge relationship and the fair value adjustment on hedged items in a fair value hedge relationship are separately disclosed in Note 8 under the description IAS 39 fair value re-measurement.
3 Tax Tax represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement unless it relates to an item recognised directly in equity, in which case the associated tax is recognised directly in other comprehensive income or equity respectively.
Tax currently payable is provided on taxable profits based on the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Provision is made for deferred tax so as to recognise all temporary differences which have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date that result in an obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, in the future, except as set out below.
This is calculated on a non-discounted basis by reference to the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the relevant jurisdictions and for the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.
The deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction does not affect either accounting or taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets are assessed at each balance sheet date and are only recognised to the extent that their recovery against future taxable profits is probable.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for the temporary differences of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates unless the Group is able to control the timing of the distribution of those earnings and it is probable that they will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.
Financial statements Directors report Strategic report 104 Thomas Cook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 Transformation the first 365 days Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Accounting policies continued Pensions Pension costs charged against profits in respect of the Groups defined contribution schemes represent the amount of the contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the accounting period.
The Group also operates a number of defined benefit schemes.
The pension liabilities recognised on the balance sheet in respect of these schemes represent the difference between the present value of the Groups obligations under the schemes calculated using the projected unit credit method and the fair value of those schemes assets.
Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in the period in which they arise within the statement of comprehensive income and expense.
The current service cost, representing benefits accruing over the year, is included in the income statement as a personnel expense.
The unwinding of the discount rate on the scheme liabilities and the expected return on scheme assets are presented as finance costs and finance income respectively.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement in personnel expenses.
Foreign currency Average exchange rates are used to translate the results of all subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures that have a functional currency other than Sterling.
The balance sheets of such entities are translated at period end exchange rates.
The resulting exchange differences are recorded through a separate component of equity.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of an entity are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities held at the period end are translated at period end exchange rates.
The resulting exchange gain or loss is recorded in the income statement.
When a foreign entity is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Leases Leases under which substantially all of the risk and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Group are finance leases.
All other leases are operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments within property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their expected useful lives.
The interest element of finance lease payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Income arising from operating leases where the Group acts as lessor is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term and included in operating income due to its operating nature.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange and fuel price risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and if so the nature of the item being hedged.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value, on derivatives not designated as a hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Derivatives are presented on the Balance Sheet on a gross basis.
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognized as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a noncurrent liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months.
The classification of derivatives between current and long-term assets and liabilities is presented in Note 23.
Hedge Accounting The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value on derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges of future cash flows is recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within net operating expenses.
Forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts and time value of options are not designated as part of the hedging relationship and therefore, are recorded in the income statement within finance costs and costs of providing tourism respectively.
Thomas Cook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 105 2 Accounting policies continued For cash flow hedges, changes in fair value deferred through the hedge reserve, are recognised in the income statement in the same period, or periods, in which the hedged highly probable forecast transactions are recognised in the income statement.
For fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated as fair value hedges are recognised in the income statement as part of finance income or cost line, where they offset the changes in fair value on the hedged item.
Where the 1 1 1 hedged item designated in a fair value hedge relationship is a financial liability held at amortised cost, the change in fair value in respect to the hedged risk is recorded as an IAS 39 fair value adjustment within finance income or cost.
Cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gains or losses on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income are retained until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement for the period.
Fair value hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time the changes in fair value on the hedging instrument will continue to be recognised immediately into the income statement, while the hedged item will no longer be adjusted for fair value changes.
Note 23 includes further information on the financial instruments designated as hedging instruments.
Non-derivative financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the Group transfers the financial asset or when the contractual rights expire.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires.
The measurement of particular financial assets and liabilities is set out below: 2 Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised at their fair value and subsequently recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method as reduced by allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
An allowance for irrecoverable amounts is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of allowance is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are recognised and subsequently recorded at their fair value.
Gains or losses except for impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised directly in equity until the financial asset is derecognised.
At this point, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement.
Any impairment losses, foreign exchange gains or losses or dividends receivable are recognised in the income statement.
Held for trading investments Short-term investments and derivatives that are not designated in a hedge relationship such as natural hedges of a balance sheet exposures, are classified as held for trading and are recognised and subsequently recorded at their fair value.
Gains or losses are recognised in the income statement.
Other non-current asset investments The fair value of investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market are measured using an appropriate valuation technique.
Where a fair value cannot be reliably measured, the investment is measured at cost.
Loans and 3 receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Any impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are initially recognised at their fair value and subsequently recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings Interest bearing borrowings are initially recognised at their fair value net of any directly attributable transaction costs.
They are subsequently recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings that are designated as hedged items in a fair value hedge relationship are adjusted for changes in their fair value in respect of the hedged risk.
The adjustment will be amortised to the income statement at the time when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the hedged risk.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, if it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Financial statements Directors report Strategic report 106 Thomas Cook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 Transformation the first 365 days Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Accounting policies continued Provisions are recognised at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the provision is discounted to its present value.
Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits.
The Group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to: either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal: or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share options to certain employees as part of their total remuneration.
The fair values of the share options are calculated at the date of grant, using an appropriate option pricing model.
These fair values are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected vesting period of the options, with a corresponding increase in equity.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital contribution.
The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.
Insurance contracts and reinsurance contracts Premiums written relate to business incepted during the year, together with any differences between the booked premiums for prior years and those previously accrued, less cancellations.
Premiums are recognised as revenue earned premiums proportionally over the period of coverage.
Premiums are shown after the deduction of commission and premium taxes where relevant.
Claims and loss adjustment expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred based on the estimated liability for compensation owed to policyholders or third parties damaged by policyholders.
The Group does not discount its liabilities for unpaid claims.
Liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated using the input of assessments for individual cases reported to the Group and statistical analysis for the claims incurred but not reported.
Contracts entered into by the Group with reinsurers, under which the Group is compensated for losses on one or more contracts issued by the Group, and that meet the classification requirements for insurance contracts, are classified as reinsurance contracts held.
The benefits to which the Group is entitled under its reinsurance contracts held are recognised as receivables from reinsurers.
The Group assesses its reinsurance assets for impairment on an annual basis.
Receivables and payables are recognised when due.
These include amounts due to and from insurance policyholders.
Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, described above, management has made the following judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements for revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities and accompanying disclosures.
Actual results may differ from estimates: a Judgements Residual values of tangible fixed assets Judgements have been made in respect of the residual values and useful economic lives of aircraft included in property, plant and equipment see note 14.
Those judgements determine the amount of depreciation charged in the income statement.
Recoverable amounts of goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life Judgements have been made in respect of the amounts of future operating cash flows to be generated by certain of the Groups businesses in order to assess whether there has been any impairment of the amounts included in the balance sheet for goodwill or intangible assets with an indefinite life in relation to those businesses.
Special purpose entities The nature of the relationship with certain special purpose entities involved in leasing aircraft to the Group shows that they should be interpreted as controlled by the Group, and therefore consolidated, even though the Group has no direct or indirect equity interest in those entities.
b Estimates Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below: Thomas Cook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 107 2 Accounting policies continued Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life Determining whether goodwill or intangible assets with an indefinite life are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit at a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
1 1 1 Recoverable amounts of deposits and prepayments Estimates have been made in respect of the volumes of future trading with hoteliers and the credit-worthiness of those hoteliers in order to assess the recoverable amounts of deposits and prepayments made to those hoteliers.
Aircraft maintenance provisions Provisions for the cost of maintaining leased aircraft and spares are based on forecast aircraft utilisation, estimates of future maintenance costs and planned rollover and renewal of the aircraft fleet.
Tax The Group operates in many tax regimes and the tax implications of its operations are complex.
It can take several years for tax liabilities to be agreed with the relevant authorities.
Tax assets and liabilities represent managements estimates of tax that will be payable or recoverable in the future and may be dependent on estimates of future profitability.
In addition, estimates have been made in respect of the probable future utilisation of tax losses, and deferred tax assets have been recognised as a result.
The recoverability of these assets is dependent on the agreement of the losses with the relevant authorities and the estimates of future profitability.
Share-based payments The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted.
Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires determination of the most 2 appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant.
This estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share option, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them.
The assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in note 34.
Retirement benefits The consolidated financial statements include costs in relation to, and provision for, retirement benefit obligations.
The costs and the present value of any related pension assets and liabilities depend on such factors as life expectancy of the members, the salary progression of current employees, the returns that plan assets generate and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the liabilities.
The Group uses previous experience and impartial actuarial advice to select the values of critical estimates.
The estimates, and the effect of variances in key estimates, are disclosed in note 35.
3 Segmental information For management purposes, the Group is organised into four geographic based operating divisions: UK, Continental Europe, Northern Europe and Airlines Germany.
These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
Certain residual businesses and corporate functions are not allocated to these divisions and are shown separately as Corporate.
On 1 May 2013, the Group finalised the sale of its businesses in North America and consequently the results of the North America segment are reported as discontinued operations.
In addition, following changes in management structure, the Belgian, French and 3 the Netherlands businesses have been transferred to from the former West segment to the Central Europe segment which has been renamed Continental Europe.
The prior year segmental analysis has been restated to reflect the current segmental reporting of continuing operations.
These reportable segments are consistent with how information is presented to the Group Chief Executive chief operating decision maker for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of performance.
The primary business of all of these operating divisions is the provision of leisure travel services and, accordingly, no separate secondary segmental information is provided.

Costs associated with refinancing represent those costs that could not be attributed to specific debt or equity elements of the May 2013 refinancing and have therefore not been capitalised or netted against share premium.
Of these costs 47m are directly attributable to cost out and profit improvement initiatives.
Impairment of goodwill and asset valuation reviews principally relate to the UK segment.
The Egyptian and Lebanese businesses have been written down to their recoverable amount and classified as held for sale.
A review of the carrying value in the Group's investment in the UK National Air Traffic Services NATS resulted in a write up to the disposal value giving rise to a gain of 29m.
A pre-disposal review of Neilson and its subsidiaries resulted in an impairment of 13m.
A revaluation of specific investments held by the UK pension fund, with a value guaranteed by the Group, resulted in an impairment of 8m.
Thomas Cook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 11 3 7 Separately disclosed items continued In the year the Group assessed its position in respect of certain onerous contracts and made adjustments to assets on the balance sheet and made provision for future losses under these contracts.
These contracts included certain UK service outsourcing contracts 10m, hotel leases 14m, sports marketing and related travel contracts 9m and foreign exchange and other commercial contracts 26m.
Provision for tax dispute resolution relates to a 14m provision in respect of an adverse third party sales tax judgement relating to the 1 1 1 TOMS.
The case is under appeal however the Group has taken a prudent view of the outcome and has no cash exposure.
The Group has recognised a number of separately disclosed items affecting financing income and cost.
During the year the Group has adopted industry practice of separately disclosing financing charges and income relating to defined benefit pension schemes.
Following the successful refinancing in May 2013, the unamortised facility fees relating to the previous facility were written off.
This resulted in a charge of 6.8m.
The unwind of discount on provisions, relating primarily to deferred acquisition consideration, have also been separately disclosed.

Financial statements Directors report Strategic report 11 8 Thomas Cook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 Transformation the first 365 days Notes to the financial statements continued 13 Intangible assets continued Impairment testing is performed by comparing the carrying value of each cash-generating unit CGU to the recoverable amount, determined on the basis of the CGUs value in use.
The value in use is based on the net present value of future cash flow projections discounted at pre-tax rates appropriate for each CGU.
The Groups CGUs are determined by geographical market and consist of UK, Continental Europe, Northern Europe and Airlines Germany.
See note 3 for details of changes to the Groups CGUs during the year.
The future cash flow projections used to determine the value in use are based on the most recent annual budgets and three-year plans for each of the CGUs.
The key assumptions used to determine the business budget and three-year plans relate to capacity and the pricing of accommodation and fuel inputs.
Capacity is based on managements view of market demand and the constraints to managing capacity such as aircraft lease commitments.
The accommodation pricing is primarily driven by the underlying bed rate and the foreign exchange hedges in place.
The former is based on the businesses ongoing dialogue with bed suppliers and local cost inflation.
The fuel pricing assumption is primarily driven by the fuel hedges in place and the forward fuel curve at the time that the budget is set.
The key assumptions used to determine the Independent business budget and three-year plans relate to passenger volumes and commission rates, and are based on the individual businesses view of the market conditions.
Cash flow forecasts for years beyond the three-year plan are extrapolated at an estimated average long-term nominal growth rate.
The other key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are as follows: a pre-tax discount rate of between 13.3% 14.1% reflecting the specific risks of each CGU a long-term nominal terminal growth rate of 2% for all CGUs The decision to sell the businesses in Egypt and Lebanon led to the reassessment of the carrying value of goodwill in the current year and, as a result, the goodwill relating to these businesses was impaired.
The cost and accumulated impairment of the Egyptian and Lebanese businesses has been classified as held for sale as at 30 September 2013.
In 2012 a total of 299.6m was impaired, which consisted of impairments in North America 109.2m, the former West Europe CGU, which is now included within the Continental Europe segment 94.4m and India 96.0m, which was sold in 2012 and was included in the UK segment.
The value in use calculations performed as at 30 September 2013 indicate that the UK CGU is no longer sensitive to reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions.
Sensitivity analysis for the remaining segments has not been disclosed as management believe that any reasonable change in assumptions would not cause the carrying value of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount.

Customer relationships are being amortised over periods of 1 to 15 years and computer software over a period of 3 to 10 years.
Order backlog has been amortised over the period from acquisition to departure.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets principally comprise those trademarks for which there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which 3 they are expected to generate net cash inflows.

No interest is charged on the receivables.
The credit risk in respect of direct receivables from customers is limited as payment is required in full before the services are provided.
In the case of travel services sold by third-party agents, the credit risk depends on the creditworthiness of those third parties, but this risk is also limited because of the relatively short period of credit.
Deposits and prepayments include amounts paid in advance to suppliers of hotel and other services in order to guarantee the provision of those supplies.
The Groups current policy is that deposits and prepayments will normally be made for periods of up to two years in advance.
There is a credit risk in respect of the continued operation of those suppliers during those periods.
Deposits and prepayments also include 31.6m 2012: 20.8m of deposits on aircraft lease arrangements which are primarily attributable to the UK airline.
Securities include money market securities amounting to 1.3m 2012: 1.7m purchased as collateral against liabilities arising from part-time retirement contracts at Thomas Cook AG, which are classified as available-for-sale financial assets.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
Allowances for doubtful debts in respect of trade receivable balances are managed in the business units where the debts arise and are based on local management experience.
Factors that are considered include the age of the debt, previous experience with the counterparty and local trading conditions.
Trade receivables arise from individual customers as well as businesses in the travel sector.
The Directors do not consider there to be significant concentration of credit risk relating to trade and other receivables.

The Directors consider that the fair value of the Groups borrowings with a carrying value of 1,290.3m is 1,349.9m 2012: carrying value 1,015.4m: fair value 739.4m.
The fair values quoted were determined on the basis of the interest rates for the corresponding terms to maturity or repayment as at the year end.
The fair value of the issued bonds has been derived using the quoted market price as at 30 September 2013.
For items maturing in less than one year, the Directors consider that the fair value is equal to the carrying amount.
During the year 6.5m 2012: 7.9m of capitalised transaction costs relating to banking facilities have been recognised within finance costs in the income statement.
In addition, following the agreement of the new financing package, 6.8m 2012: 22.3m of capitalised fees associated with the old debt facility have been written off and included within 'Separately disclosed items finance costs'.
Borrowing facilities As at 30 September 2013, the Group had undrawn committed debt facilities of 290.4m 2012: 793.3m and undrawn committed debt facilities plus cash available to repay revolving credit facility of 1,207m 2012: 980.8m.
Whilst these facilities have certain financial covenants they are not expected to prevent full utilisation of the facilities if required.
The Group has complied with its covenants throughout the year.
Covenant measures The covenant measures are tested on a quarterly rolling 12 month basis and consist of a leverage covenant and a fixed charge covenant.
The leverage covenant is a measure of pre-exceptional earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and aircraft operating lease rentals compared to net debt.
The fixed charge covenant is a measure of pre-exceptional earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and operating lease charges compared to net interest and aircraft operating lease rental plus retail rental charges.
The leverage and fixed charge covenant hurdles vary depending on the period that they relate to and range between 1.54x to 4.51x and 1.62x to 2.45x respectively.

Financial statements Directors report Strategic report 132 Thomas Cook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 Transformation the first 365 days Notes to the financial statements continued 24 Financial risk continued Liquidity risk The liquidity position of the Group is significantly influenced by the booking and payment pattern of customers.
As a result, liquidity is at its lowest in the winter months and at its highest in the summer months.
The Group manages the seasonal nature of its liquidity by making use of its banking facility, the terms of which, including the covenant measures, are detailed in the borrowings note refer to note 21.
The Group also uses liquidity swaps to manage short term currency positions.
These liquidity swaps are presented as held-for-trading financial instruments.
The undrawn committed debt facility plus cash available to repay revolving credit facility ranged between 217.8m and 1,233.8m during the current financial year 2012: 156m-981m.
Surplus short-term liquidity is invested in accordance with approved treasury policies.
Financial liabilities are analysed below based on the time between the year end and their contractual maturity.
The amounts shown are estimates of the undiscounted future cash flows and will differ from both carrying value and fair value.

Trade and other payables include non-financial liabilities of 170.1m 2012: 190.7m which have not been analysed above.
Counterparty credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk in relation to deposits, outstanding derivatives and trade and other receivables.
The maximum exposure in respect of each of these items at the balance sheet date is their carrying value.
The Group assesses its counterparty exposure in relation to the investment of surplus cash, fuel contracts, foreign exchange and interest rate hedging contracts and undrawn credit facilities.
The Group primarily uses published credit ratings to assess counterparty strength and therefore to define the credit limit for each counterparty in accordance with approved treasury policies.
The Groups approach to credit risk in respect of trade and other receivables is explained in note 18.
Thomas Cook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 133 25 Insurance Management of insurance risk Incidental to its main business, the Group, through its subsidiary White Horse Insurance Ireland Limited, issues contracts that transfer significant insurance risk and that are classified as insurance contracts.
As a general guideline, the Group defines as significant insurance risk the possibility of having to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event adversely affects the policyholder.
1 1 1 Business written includes standard commercial risks for the Group and travel insurance for both Group and non-Group customers.
The principal nature of travel insurance risks is one of short-term, low value and high volume.
Underwriting performance is monitored on an ongoing basis and pricing reviewed annually for each individual contract.
Exposure is capped by specific limits within the insurance policy and by using reinsurance contracts for any claims in excess of these retention limits.
Commercial policies with the Group are subject to policy excesses and single event and aggregate limits.
Insurance risk is spread across several European countries where the Group operates including the UK, Ireland and Continental Europe.
When estimating the cost of claims outstanding at the year end, the principal assumption underlying the estimates is the Groups past development pattern.
This includes assumptions in respect of historic claims costs, average claims handling expenses and market developments.
The Group also uses an independent actuary to review its liabilities to ensure that the carrying values are adequate.
Any changes to these variables are not expected to have a material effect on the Group financial statements.
The Group operates a reinsurance policy approved by the White Horse Insurance Ireland Ltd Board of Directors which ensures that reinsurers have a financial stability rating of B A M Best or above.
The Group has assessed these credit ratings as being satisfactory in diminishing the Groups exposure to the credit risk of its insurance receivables.

The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances for financial reporting purposes: 2013 2012 m m Deferred tax liabilities 52.8 89.7 Deferred tax assets 168.0 204.7 115.2 115.0 At the balance sheet date, the Group had unused tax losses of 2,624.6m 2012: 2,460.2m available for offset against future profits.
Deferred tax assets have only been recognised where there is sufficient probability that there will be future taxable profits against which the assets may be recovered.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of tax losses of 1,940.5m 2012: 1,933.9m due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Other temporary differences on which deferred tax has been provided primarily relate to the difference in book to tax value on qualifying tax assets, provisions for which tax relief was not originally available, and fair value accounting on properties acquired as part of the merger.
Thomas Cook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 135 26 Deferred tax continued In addition, the Group had unused other temporary differences in respect of which no deferred tax asset has been recognised amounting to 385.3m 2012: 253.5m, also due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Deferred tax liabilities were offset against the corresponding deferred tax assets where both items fell within the responsibility of the same tax authority.
1 1 1 The deferred tax assets and liabilities at the year end, without taking into consideration the offsetting balances within the same jurisdiction, are 252.1m and 136.9m respectively.
Finance Act 2012 reduced the main rate of UK corporation tax from 24% to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013, resulting in a UK current tax rate of 23.5% applicable to the year ended 30 September 2013.
Finance Act 2013 was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013 and included further UK rate reductions, with the main rate of UK corporation tax to reduce to 21% from 1 April 2014 and 20% from 1 April 2015.
The effect of this change on deferred tax balances is included in these financial statements and has resulted in a decrease in deferred tax assets of 14.1m.

35 Retirement benefit schemes Pension schemes for the employees of the Thomas Cook Group consist of defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, with the defined benefit plans being both funded and unfunded.
The obligations arising from defined contribution plans are satisfied by contribution payments to both private and state-run insurance providers.
Unfunded defined benefit pension obligations Unfunded defined benefit pension obligations primarily relate to the Groups employees in the German businesses of Thomas Cook AG and the Condor Group.
Provisions are established on the basis of commitments made to those employees for old-age and transitional pensions based on the legal, tax and economic circumstances of the individual countries and on the period of employment and level of remuneration of the respective employees.
Provisions for pensions and similar obligations totalling 251.9m 2012: 212.9m were attributable to the pension commitments of the Condor Group Condor Flugdienst GmbH, Condor Berlin GmbH and CF GmbH.
For employees who joined a Condor Group company prior to 1995, the total pension commitment of the pensions authority of the German federal government and regional states was adjusted and maintained in the form of a company pension scheme.
The flight crews were additionally entitled to a transitional provision for the period between the termination of their in-flight employment and the time they became eligible for a state-run or company pension.
In both cases, the benefit commitment depended on the final salaries of the employees concerned prior to the termination of their in-flight employment final salary plan.
Employees who joined a Condor Group company from 1995 onwards participate in a company pension scheme under which the pension entitlements are based on the average salaries of those employees average salary plan.
The Condor Group also has retirement obligations arising from individual commitments and transitional provisions.
In accordance with IAS 19, all these commitments are classified as unfunded defined benefit obligations and classified as such in these financial statements.
Thomas Cook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 143 35 Retirement benefit schemes continued The Condor Group defined benefit plans have been closed to new entrants with the exception of pilots since 2004.
There are additional unfunded defined benefit obligations comprising individual commitments to executive staff at Thomas Cook Group and obligations in respect of past service for employees in the Northern Europe and West Europe segments.
1 1 1 The unfunded pension schemes are accounted for as part of liabilities for retirement benefit obligations in the balance sheet.
The following weighted average actuarial assumptions were made for the purpose of determining the unfunded defined benefit obligations: 2013 2012 % % Discount rate for scheme liabilities 3.75% 4.14% Expected rate of salary increases 2.62% 2.58% Future pension increases 1.42% 1.51% The mortality tables 2005 G drawn up by Prof. Dr. Klaus Heubeck were used as the basis for the mortality assumptions used in arriving at the present value of the pension obligations at 30 September 2013.
These assume a life expectancy for members currently aged 65 of 19 years for men and 23 years for women.
Amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of these defined benefit schemes are as follows: 2013 2012 m m Current service cost 10.6 8.5 2 Past service cost 1.2 Gain on settlements 2.3 2.0 Curtailment gain 1.0 0.3 Interest cost on scheme liabilities 11.4 10.9 Total included in the income statement 19.9 17.1 Service costs, gains on settlement and curtailment gains have been included in personnel expenses in the income statement and the unwinding of the discount rate of the expected retirement benefit obligations has been included in finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in the statement of comprehensive income.
Changes in the present value of unfunded pension obligations were as follows: 2013 2012 m m At beginning of year 253.5 227.8 Current service cost 10.6 8.5 Past service cost 1.2 Interest cost 11.4 10.9 3 Benefits paid 6.8 6.1 Settlements 4.9 7.2 Curtailments 1.0 0.3 Actuarial losses 19.7 37.1 Exchange difference 12.1 17.2 At end of year 295.8 253.5 Financial statements Directors report Strategic report 144 Thomas Cook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 Transformation the first 365 days Notes to the financial statements continued 35 Retirement benefit schemes continued Funded defined benefit pension obligations The pension entitlements of employees of Thomas Cook UK and employees in Norway and the Netherlands are provided through funded defined benefit schemes, where pension contributions are paid over to the schemes and the assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries in each country.
The fair value of the pension assets in each scheme at the year end is compared with the present value of the retirement benefit obligations and the net difference reported as a pension asset or retirement benefit obligation as appropriate.
Pension assets are only recognised to the extent that they will result in reimbursements being made or future payments being reduced.
Funded defined benefit pension obligations have been determined on the basis of assumptions relevant to each country.
The weighted averages of these were: 2013 2012 % % Discount rate for scheme liabilities 4.41% 4.32% Inflation rate 3.14% 2.66% Expected return on scheme assets 5.03% 5.49% Expected rate of salary increases 0.02% 0.18% Future pension increases 0.25% 0.42% The Thomas Cook UK Pension Plan accounts for approximately 92% 2012: 86% of the total funded defined benefit obligations.
The mortality assumptions used in arriving at the present value of those obligations at 30 September 2013 are based on the PMA92 PFA92 tables with medium cohort improvements and a minimum future longevity improvement per year of 1%, adjusted for recent mortality experience.
The mortality assumptions adopted for the plan liabilities indicate a further life expectancy for members currently aged 65 of 23.2 years for men and 25.2 years for women.
On 31 March 2011, the UK defined benefit schemes closed to all active members who were given the option of joining Thomas Cooks defined contribution scheme.
The closure of the schemes resulted in a cessation of future pension benefit accrual and a consequent curtailment gain of 25.8m, which was recognised in the income statement for the year ended 30 September 2011.
Amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of these defined benefit schemes are as follows: 2013 2012 m m Current service cost 3.3 2.3 Expected return on scheme assets 41.2 41.4 Interest cost on scheme liabilities 38.8 43.7 Total loss included in the income statement 0.9 4.6 Service costs and curtailment gains have been included in personnel expenses in the income statement and the unwinding of the discount rate of the expected retirement benefit obligations has been included in finance costs.
