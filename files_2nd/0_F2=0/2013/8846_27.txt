Our business Strategic report Risks and uncertainties Governance Financial statements Notes to the Company financial statements 109 for the year to 31 December 2013 Accounting policies The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable Accounting Standards in the United Kingdom.
A summary of the principal accounting policies, which have been consistently applied, is set out below.
Reporting currency The Companys transactions are primarily US dollar denominated and the principal functional currency is the US dollar.
The following sterling to US dollar exchange rates have been used in the preparation of these accounts: 2013 2012 Average rate 1 $ 1.5673 1.5845 Closing rate 1 $ 1.6563 1.6255 Investments Investments in subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are included in the balance sheet of the Company at cost less any provision for impairment.
Impairment The Company performs impairment reviews in respect of fixed asset investments whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable amount of an asset, which is the higher of the assets net realisable value and its value in use, is less than its carrying amount.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction or, where forward contracts have been arranged, at the contractual rates.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet dates or at a contractual rate if applicable and any exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
The directors consider it appropriate to record sterling denominated equity share capital in the accounts of John Wood Group PLC at the exchange rate ruling on the date it was raised.
Financial instruments The accounting policy for financial instruments is consistent with the Group accounting policy as presented in the notes to the Group financial statements with the exception of the policy on net investment hedges which does not apply to the Company.
The Companys financial risk management policy is consistent with the Groups financial risk management policy outlined in note 17 to the Group financial statements.
Use of estimates The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Employee share trusts The Company is deemed to have control of the assets, liabilities, income and costs of its employee share trusts.
They have therefore been included in the financial statements of the Company.
Under UITF 38 the cost of shares held by the employee share trusts is deducted from shareholders funds.
Share based charges The Company has a number of share schemes as detailed in the Group accounting policies and note 20 to the Group financial statements.
Details relating to the calculation of share based charges are provided in note 20 to the Group financial statements.
In respect of the Company, the charge is shown as an increase in the Companys investments, as the employees to which the charge relates are employed by subsidiary companies.
Taxation The current tax charge is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profits differ from the profit reported in the profit and loss account due to timing differences and other items that require adjustment as set out in legislation.
The Companys liability for tax is calculated using rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the full liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
The deferred tax position is calculated using the rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
Tax losses are surrendered or claimed in the form of group relief with consideration being received or paid accordingly.
The group relief amount is recorded separately within the debtors and creditors amounts in the balance sheet, as applicable, and is calculated by applying the tax rate enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date to the loss amount.
Dividends Dividends to the Groups shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders.
Dividend income is credited to the profit and loss account when the dividend has been approved by the board of directors of the subsidiary company making the payment.

The Companys overall risk management strategy is to hedge exposures wherever practicable in order to minimise any potential adverse impact on the Companys financial performance.
Risk management is carried out by the Group Treasury department in line with the Groups Treasury policies which are approved by the Board of Directors.
Group Treasury identify, evaluate and where appropriate hedge financial risks.
The Group Treasury policies cover specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess cash.
a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currencies.
The Company hedges part of its net investment in non-US dollar subsidiaries by using foreign currency bank loans.
Where possible the Companys policy is to eliminate all significant currency exposures at the time of the transaction by using financial instruments such as forward currency contracts.
Changes in the forward contract fair values are booked through the profit and loss account.
ii Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
The company borrows in the desired currencies at floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the Companys exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
At 31 December 2013, approximately 30% 2012: 22% of the Companys borrowings were at fixed rates after taking account of interest rate swaps.
The Company is also exposed to interest rate risk on cash held on deposit.
The Companys policy is to maximise the return on cash deposits whilst ensuring that cash is deposited with a financial institution with a credit rating of A or better, where possible.
iii Price risk The Company is not exposed to any significant price risk in relation to its financial instruments.
b Credit risk The Companys credit risk primarily relates to its inter-company loans and inter-company receivables.
Management believe that no further risk provision is required in excess of the current provision for impairment.
The Company also has credit risk in relation to cash balances or cash held on deposit.
The Companys policy is to deposit cash at institutions with an A rating or better where possible.
There was no cash held on deposit at 31 December 2013.
