Governance 2013 Directors remuneration report continued 2014 PSP performance metrics: EPS Performance EPS growth in excess of 9% p. a.
metrics EPS growth between 5% and 9% p. a. straight-line vesting.
Methodology UBMs events business has a number of biennial shows, with odd-year biennials significantly larger and more profitable than even-year biennials.
The profit contribution from the odd-year biennials leads to an annual distortion in the reported growth rate and profitability of the events business, and an increase in EPS inodd years.
To give a fairer reflection of underlying performance, a two-year EPS average of odd and even years will be applied, with the two-year average prior to the performance period used as the base year, and the two-year average at the end of the performance period used to determine growth.
For PSP awards made in 2014 with a three-year performance period of 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2016 the two-year average for the base year is based on EPS for 2012 and 2013, and the two-year average at the end will be based on EPS for 2015 and 2016.
