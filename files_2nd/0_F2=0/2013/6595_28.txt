com 165 SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION CONTINUED Shareholder security We are aware that a small number of shareholders have received unsolicited telephone calls concerning their investment in GKN.
These calls are from overseas based organisations who offer to buy GKN shares for considerably more than the current market price.
In some cases the caller has suggested that there is currently a takeover offer for GKN.
There is no such offer and we suspect that the calls are bogus.
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited investment advice, offers to buy shares or offers of free company reports.
Operations, commonly known as boiler rooms, are targeting UK shareholders and callers can be very persistent and extremely persuasive.
We are aware that they attempt to persuade individuals to provide email addresses or other personal information: shareholders are strongly advised not to provide any such details.
The Financial Conduct Authority FCA provides the following guidance should you be contacted in this manner: obtain the name of the person calling and the organisation they represent: check that they are properly authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority by checking the FCA register of regulated firms at www.
uk firms systems-reporting register search: call the organisation back to verify their identity using the telephone number listed for them on the FCA register: search the FCA list of unauthorised firms and individuals to avoid doing business with at www.
If you deal with an unauthorised firm you will not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme: report any suspicions to the FCA either by calling 0845 606 1234 or completing the online form at www.
uk consumers scams investment-scams  reporting-form: and if the calls persist, hang up.
To reduce the risk of becoming a victim of fraud you should: ensure all your certificates are stored in a safe place, or hold your shares electronically in CREST electronic settlement system for UK and Irish securities via a nominee: reduce the number of cold calls you receive by registering with the Telephone Preference Service on 0845 070 0707 or by visiting www.
