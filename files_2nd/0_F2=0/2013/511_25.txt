SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY BACS Many Shareholders have already arranged for dividends to be paid by mandate directly to their bank or building society account.
The Company mandates dividends through the BACS Bankers Automated Clearing Services system.
The benefit to Shareholders of the BACS payment method is that the Registrar posts the tax vouchers directly to them, whilst the dividend is credited on the payment date to the Shareholders bank or building society account.
Shareholders who have not yet arranged for their dividends to be paid directly to their bank or building society account and wish to benefit from this service should request the Companys Registrar to send them a Dividend Interest mandate form or alternatively complete the mandate form accompanying their dividend warrant and tax voucher in May 2014.
OVERSEAS DIVIDEND PAYMENTS Capita Asset Services has partnered with Travelex, the worlds largest specialist provider of commercial international payment services, to provide you with a service that will convert your Sterling dividends into your local currency.
Your dividend will then be conveniently paid directly into your local bank account.

ONLINE SHAREHOLDER SERVICES AND SHARE DEALING Shareholders may wish to take advantage of the Online enquiry service offered by the Registrar.
This service allows a Shareholder to access his her own account to verify address details and the number of shares held.
The service can be obtained on http: shares.
The Registrar also offers a share dealing service to existing Shareholders.
SHAREGIFT We value all our Shareholders, no matter how many shares they own, but we do realise that some Shareholders hold on to small quantities of shares because they believe that the cost of selling them would make the transaction uneconomic.
A free service is available to enable Shareholders with small holdings, should they so wish, to donate their shares to charity, and gain the benefit of tax relief on this donation.
This scheme has been successfully adopted by several large quoted companies, and further details are available from the Secretary.

They may offer to sell shares that turn out to be worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in return for an upfront payment.
While high profits are promised, if you buy or sell shares in this way you will probably lose your money.
HOW TO AVOID SHARE FRAUD Keep in mind that firms authorised by the FCA are unlikely to contact you out of the blue with an offer to buy or sell shares.
Do not get into a conversation, note the name of the person and firm contacting you and then end the call.
Check the Financial Services Register from www.
uk to see if the person and firm contacting you is authorised by the FCA.
Beware of fraudsters claiming to be from an authorised firm, copying its website or giving you false contact details.
Use the firms contact details listed on the Register if you want to call it back.
Call the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if the firm does not have contact details on the Register or you are told they are out of date.
Search the list of unauthorised firms to avoid at www.
Consider that if you buy or sell shares from an unauthorised firm you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
Think about getting independent financial and professional advice before you hand over any money.
Remember: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!
5,000 people contact the Financial Conduct Authority about share fraud each year, with victims losing an average of 20,000.
REPORT A SCAM If you are approached by fraudsters please tell the FCA using the share fraud reporting form at www.
uk scams, where you can find out more about investment scams.
You can also call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.
If you have already paid money to share fraudsters you should contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.
