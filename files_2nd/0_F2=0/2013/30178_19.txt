Goodwill 2013 2012 m m At 1 January 278.5 396.6 Recognised on acquisitions 9.2 Impairment 123.0 Effect of movements in exchange rates 2.9 4.3 At 31 December 275.6 278.5 Goodwill arising through business combinations has been allocated to individual cash-generating units CGUs for impairment testing as follows: 2013 2012 m m CGU Europe and the Middle East 195.1 195.1 North America 50.4 51.5 Brazil 10.8 12.6 Asia Pacific 19.3 19.3 275.6 278.5 Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the recoverable amount of each CGU.
As at 31 December 2013 the recoverable amount of each of the CGUs has been based on value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding expected cash flows arising in future periods, regional growth rates and the discount rates.
Future cash flow projections are based on the most recent Board approved financial budgets for 2014 which are used to project cash flows for the next five years.
After this period a steady state cash flow is used to derive a terminal value for the CGU.
Goodwill has an indefinite life and this is reflected in the calculation of the CGUs terminal value.
Estimated average growth rates, based on each regions constituent country growth rates as published by the World Bank, are used to estimate cash flows after the budgeted period.
The growth rates used were 2% for Europe and the Middle East, 2.5% for North America, and 3% for Brazil and Asia.
Resultant cash flows for Europe and the Middle East, Asia and Brazil have been discounted at a pre-tax discount rate of 11.5% 2012: 11.5%, and for North America have been discounted at 13.5% 2012: 13.5% reflecting the higher level of uncertainty in the forecasts of that CGUs future cash flows.
The calculations of value in use have been subject to stress tests demonstrating that the impairment test results are tolerant to reasonably possible changes in assumptions as to discount rate and future cash flows.
In 2012, the estimated recoverable amount for the North America CGU was 123.0m less than the balance sheet carrying value, and was recognised as an impairment of the goodwill attributed to that CGU.
The recoverable amount attributable to the North America CGU remains sensitive to future changes in the key valuation assumptions.
A 1% increase in the discount rate would result in a reduction in the value in use of the CGU of around 11m.

The carrying value of financial assets recorded in the Financial Statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
None of the Groups financial assets are secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.
In respect of trade receivables, the Group is not exposed to significant credit risk to a single counterparty or any group of counterparties.
Matched Principal brokerage transactions, whereby securities are bought from one counterparty and sold to another counterparty, are settled on a delivery versus payment basis.
The above analysis reflects only the receivable side of such transactions, the other side being shown in trade and other payables.
Settlement of such transactions typically takes place within a few business days according to the relevant market rules and conventions and the credit risk is considered to be minimal.

Share-based payments As at 31 December 2013 the Group had one active equity-based long term incentive plan, the Tullett Prebon Long Term Incentive Plan, for the granting of non-transferable awards to certain employees and executives.
Option awards granted under the plan typically become exercisable three years after grant date.
The exercise of certain options is dependent on option holders meeting performance criteria.
The maximum life of the options is 10 years after grant date.
Options are settled in equity once exercised.
Outstanding awards at 31 December 2013 and their estimated fair values when granted are set out below: Awards Estimated fair outstanding value at 2013 grant date Awards 1 Long term incentive award 2009 302,148 199p 2 Long term incentive award 2011 44,761 309p 1 Long term incentive award 2012 714,649 139p 1,061,558 Notes: 1 Subject to total shareholder return and return on capital conditions.

Retirement benefits a Defined benefit schemes The Group operates one defined benefit pension scheme in the UK, the defined benefit section of the Tullett Prebon Pension Scheme the Scheme.
In addition, there are a small number of schemes operated in other countries which collectively are not significant in the context of the Group.
The Scheme is a final salary, funded pension scheme that is closed to new members and future accrual.
For members still in service there is a continuing link between benefits and pensionable pay.
The Principal Employer is Tullett Prebon Group Limited.
The assets of the Scheme are held separately from those of the Group, either in separate trustee administered funds or in contractbased policies of insurance.
The latest funding actuarial valuations of the Scheme was carried out as at 30 April 2013 by independent qualified actuaries.
The amounts included in the balance sheet arising from the Groups obligations in respect of the Scheme are as follows: 2013 2012 m m Fair value of Scheme assets 226.1 204.3 Present value of Scheme liabilities 175.6 162.9 Defined benefit pension Scheme surplus 50.5 41.4 Deferred tax liability Note 19 17.7 14.5 88 Tullett Prebon plc Annual Report 2013 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information The main financial assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries of the Scheme to calculate the liabilities under IAS 19 were: 2013 2012 % % Key assumptions Discount rate 4.40 4.40 Expected rate of salary increases 4.95 4.45 1 Rate of increase in LPI pensions in payment 2.60 2.50 Inflation assumption 2.70 2.50 Note: 1 This applies to pensions accrued from 6 April 1997.
The majority of current and future pensions receive fixed increases in payment of either 0% or 2.5%.
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables and allow for future mortality improvements and are the same as those adopted for the 2013 funding valuation.
Assumptions for the Scheme are that a member who retires in 15 years time at age 60 will live on average for a further 31.1 years 2012: 28.5 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 32.5 years 2012: 30.8 years after retirement if they are female.
Current pensioners are assumed to have a generally shorter life expectancy based on their current age.
The valuation of the Scheme liabilities is sensitive to changes in the assumptions used.
The effect of changes in the discount rate, inflation and mortality assumptions, assuming an independent change in one assumption with all others held constant, on the liabilities is shown below: Scheme assets Scheme liabilities Surplus deficit m m m As at 31 December 2013 226.1 175.6 50.5 Following a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate Change 0% 4.4% 15.2% New value 226.1 183.3 42.8 Following a 0.25% increase in the inflation assumption Change 0% 1.9% 6.7% New value 226.1 179.0 47.1 Life expectancy increases by 3 years Change 0% 6.9% 24.2% New value 226.1 187.8 38.3 Note: The above analysis does not reflect any inter-relationship between the assumptions.
Changes to the risks inherent in the Scheme would result in changes to the Schemes carrying value.
The most significant risks are: investment performance the liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set by reference to bond yields.
If assets underperform this yield, this would result in the carrying value of the Scheme reducing: changes in bond yields a decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the Schemes liabilities: inflation risk some of the Schemes liabilities are linked to inflation, and higher inflation would lead to higher liabilities mitigated by a cap on the level of inflationary increases which protects against extreme inflationary increases : and life expectancy the majority of the Schemes obligations are for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
