Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES PLATINUM GROUP METALS estimates as at 31 December 2013 ANGLO AMERICAN PLATINUM LIMITED The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates were compiled in compliance with The South African Code for the Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves The SAMREC Code, 2007 Edition as amended July 2009.
Operations and Projects outside South Africa were compiled in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves The JORC Code, 2012 as a minimum standard.
Details of the individual operations appear in Anglo American Platinums Annual Report.
Merensky Reef and UG2 Reef Mineral Resources are reported over an economic and mineable cut appropriate to the specific reef.
The figures reported represent 100% of the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves attributable to Anglo American Platinum Limited unless otherwise noted.
Rounding of figures may cause computational discrepancies.
Anglo American plcs interest in Anglo American Platinum Limited is 78.0%.
4E PGE is the sum of Platinum, Palladium, Rhodium and Gold grades in grammes per tonne g t. Contained Metal is presented in metric tonnes and million troy ounces Moz.
Concentrator recoveries for Merensky Reef range from 86% to 89%, UG2 Reef from 82% to 87%, Platreef from 70% to 80% and Main Sulphide Zone from 70% to 78%.
Tailings reprocessing recoveries range from 30 to 40%.
1 Merensky Reef and UG2 Reef: The pay limits built into the basic mining equation are directly linked to the 2014 Business plan.
The pay limit is based on Cost 4 which consists of Direct Cash Cost on and off mine, Other Indirect Costs and Stay in Business Capital on and off mine.
The reserve pay-limit varies across all operations between 2.5g t and 4.8g t 4E PGE.
The range is a function of various factors including depth of the orebody, geological complexity, infrastructure and economic parameters.
Changes associated with the strategic review resulted in a reallocation of reported Ore Reserves to Mineral Resources mainly in the Rustenburg area and the impact thereof are reflected in the 2013 figures.
2 Merensky Reef: The Ore Reserve tonnage and 4E ounce content decreased, mainly in response to economic assumptions resulting in reallocation of Ore Reserves to Mineral Resources at Rustenburgs Khomanani, Khuseleka and Thembelani mines.
These decreases were partially offset by the increase in Ore Reserves mainly from Dishaba, Union and Bokoni mines where additional Mineral Resources have been converted to Ore Reserves.
3 UG2 Reef: The Ore Reserve tonnage and 4E ounce content decreased largely due to economic assumptions and the resulting reallocation of Ore Reserves to Mineral Resources at the Rustenburg mines Khuseleka, Thembelani, Khomanani, Siphumelele 1 and Siphumelele 2 School of Mines as well as at Tumela and Union mines.
These decreases were partially offset by the increase in Ore Reserves mainly from Siphumelele 3, Dishaba and Bathopele mines where Mineral Resources have been converted to Ore Reserves.
4 Platreef: For Mogalakwena North, Central and South the 4E pay limit is 1.0 g t. For Zwartfontein South the pay limit is 1.7 g t. The Ore Reserves tonnage and 4E ounce content increased materially due to new drilling information allowing an upgrade in the resource confidence and hence conversion of more Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves as well as changes to the structural interpretation in the updated geological model.
A revised pit design was also introduced due to the Atlatsa refinancing transaction which now incorporates the southern portion of the Boikgantsho project and allows deeper Mogalakwena resources to be extracted with two additional benches.
5 Platreef stockpiles: Mined ore retained for future treatment and reported separately as Proved Ore Reserves but included in the Total Platreef Ore Reserves.
6 Alternative units All Reefs Total: Tonnage in million short tons Mton and associated grade in troy ounces per short ton oz ton for 2013 is: Total 2,331.7 Mton 2012: 1,774.3 Mton Total 0.089 oz ton 2012: 0.096 oz ton 7 Tailings: Operating tailings dams are not evaluated and therefore not reported as part of the Ore Reserves.
At Rustenburg mine and at Union mines, dormant tailings dams have been evaluated and are separately reported as tailings Ore Reserves.
8 Main Sulphide Zone: The Ore Reserve tonnage and 4E ounce content decreased mainly due to production.
Anglo American Platinum Limited currently has an effective 100% interest in Unki Mine, subject to the finalisation of the indigenisation agreement.
9 Alternative units Main Sulphide Zone: Tonnage in million short tons Mton and associated grade in troy ounces per short ton oz ton for 2013 is: Total 55.8 Mton 2012: 59.2 Mton Total 0.108 oz ton 2012: 0.110 oz ton Anglo American plc Annual Report 2013 241 ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES PLATINUM GROUP METALS estimates as at 31 December 2013 Tonnes Grade Contained Metal Contained Metal Platinum South Africa Operations MINERAL RESOURCES Classification 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 1 2 Merensky Reef Mt Mt 4E PGE 4E PGE 4E tonnes 4E tonnes 4E Moz 4E Moz Measured 238.5 189.3 5.47 5.63 1,305.2 1,065.1 42.0 34.2 Indicated 326.4 290.6 5.41 5.51 1,766.2 1,600.1 56.8 51.4 Measured and Indicated 564.9 479.9 5.44 5.55 3,071.4 2,665.2 98.8 85.7 Inferred in LOM Plan 6.6 9.8 6.47 6.33 43.0 62.1 1.4 2.0 Inferred ex.

Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to some Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will necessarily be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Resource after continued exploration.
1 Merensky Reef and UG2 Reef: The Mineral Resources are estimated over a practical minimum mining width suitable for the deposit known as the Resource Cut.
The Resource Cut width takes cognisance of the mining method and geotechnical aspects in the hanging wall or footwall of the reef.
The Mineral Resource tonnage and 4E ounce content increased due to the incorporation of the eastern part of the Ga-Phasha project 100% attributable to AAPL for 2013 into Twickenham Mine as a result of the execution of the Atlatsa refinancing transaction.
A decrease of Mineral Resources occurred at Magazynskraal due to disposal of this project.
2 Merensky Reef: Additionally at Twickenham an advanced Resource Cut evaluation strategy has been applied, together with new drilling information resulted in an increase in Mineral Resources.
Due to economic assumptions previously reported Ore Reserves at some Rustenburg mines Khuseleka, Thembelani, Khomanani have been reallocated back to Mineral Resources.
3 UG2 Reef: Due to economic assumptions previously reported Ore Reserves at the Rustenburg mines Khuseleka, Thembelani, Khomanani, Siphumelele 1 and Siphumelele 2 School of Mines as well as at Tumela and Union mines have been reallocated back to Mineral Resources.
4 Platreef: A 1.0g t 4E PGE cut-off is used to define Platreef Mineral Resources.
As a result of conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves, the Platreef Resources decreased.
No Mineral Resources applicable to underground mining have been included.
However, stockpile material is included which comprises calc-silicate and oxidised material with a cut-off grade of greater than 3g t 5.9 Mt 0.6 Moz.
Due to the successful execution of the Atlatsa refinancing transaction, 100% of Boikgantsho is now attributable to Anglo American Platinum Limited AAPL and the southern portion of the Boikgantsho project has now been incorporated into the latest Mogalakwena pit design.
Remaining Boikgantsho Mineral Resources are separately tabulated and reported under Platinum Other 3E Projects.
5 Alternative units All Reefs Measured and Indicated: Tonnage in million short tons Mton and associated grade in troy ounces per short ton oz ton for 2013 is: Measured and Indicated 3,085.2 Mton 2012: 2,759.5 Mton Measured and Indicated 0.125 oz ton 2012: 0.121 oz ton 6 Tailings: Operating tailings dams are not evaluated and therefore not reported as part of the Mineral Resources.
At Rustenburg, Amandelbult and Union mines, dormant dams have been evaluated and the tailing forms part of the Mineral Resource statement.
7 Main Sulphide Zone: The Mineral Resources tonnage and 4E ounce content decreases slightly due to new information.
Oxidised material is not considered.
Anglo American Platinum currently has an effective 100% interest in Southridge Limited, subject to the finalisation of the indigenisation agreement.
