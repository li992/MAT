this included uS$4.8 billion in Onshore uS drilling and development expenditure, with over 80 per cent of drilling activity directed towards the eagle Ford and Permian areas as planned.
Onshore uS capital expenditure is expected to decline to uS$3.9 billion in Fy2014 as we continue to optimise our drilling program.
this includes a forecast reduction in our operated rig count to approximately 25 for the period.
Petroleum exploration expenditure for Fy2013 was uS$675 million, of which uS$522 million was expensed.
A uS$600 million exploration program, largely focused on the Gulf of mexico and Western Australia, is planned for Fy2014.
Petroleum production is forecast to increase to 250 mmboe BHP Billiton share in Fy2014.
this includes 114 mmboe BHP Billiton share from Onshore uS, underpinned by an anticipated 75 per cent increase in liquids production.
Production from the conventional operations is expected to remain stable, with new volumes from macedon, Australia, and increased production at Atlantis, united States, offset by expected natural field decline and planned maintenance.
Potash underlying eBIt was largely unchanged from the prior period.
A reduction in global potash exploration activity was offset by higher costs associated with the establishment of our Potash Business in Saskatchewan, Canada.
We are investing uS$2.6 billion to finish the excavation and lining of the Jansen Potash Project production and service shafts, and to continue the installation of essential surface infrastructure and utilities.
Completion of both shafts is expected during Cy2016, while the associated works program will extend into Cy2017.
BHP BIllItOn SummARy RevIeW 2013 | 13 Copper Escondida copper production increased by 28 per cent.
Copper production increased by 10 per cent in Fy2013 to 1.2 million tonnes mt BHP Billiton share.
escondida copper production increased by 28 per cent to 1.1 mt 100 per cent basis, as the average copper grade mined rose to 1.4 per cent and US$ million 30 June 2013 milling rates improved.
Record annual copper production Revenue 11,991 at Antamina, Peru, also contributed to the strong result underlying eBIt 3,622 as volumes benefited from a full-year contribution from the Capital expenditure 2,120 recently expanded concentrator.
net operating assets 15,605 underlying eBIt for Fy2013 declined by uS$343 million to uS$3.6 billion.
Increased sales volumes and controllable cash cost savings associated with productivity gains and broader economies of scale increased underlying eBIt by uS$966 million.
In this context, strong production growth and a material reduction in controllable cash costs contributed to a 15 per cent reduction in unit cash costs at escondida.
In contrast, the external influences of lower prices, inflation and foreign exchange variations reduced underlying eBIt by uS$682 million.
Payments associated with the finalisation of collective labour agreements at each of our South American assets and major planned maintenance programs at escondida and Olympic Dam, Australia, reduced underlying eBIt by a further uS$321 million.
During the period, we signed a definitive agreement to sell our Pinto valley mining operation, united States, and the associated San manuel Arizona Railroad Company to Capstone mining Corp. for an aggregate cash consideration of uS$650 million.
the transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions, and is expected to be completed in the second half of Cy2013.
escondida production is forecast to remain steady at approximately 1.1 mt 100 per cent basis in Fy2014, before increasing to approximately 1.3 mt 100 per cent basis in Fy2015.
the escondida Organic Growth Project 1 and the Oxide leach Area Project are expected to maintain escondidas copper production at an elevated level for the remainder of this decade.
the recently announced uS$2.0 billion BHP Billiton share investment in a desalination facility will deliver sustainable water supply to escondida over the long term.
Copper production for Fy2014 is also forecast to remain largely unchanged at approximately 1.2 mt BHP Billiton share of production and excludes Pinto valley.
14 | BHP BIllItOn SummARy RevIeW 2013 Iron Ore Production increased by seven per cent.
Iron ore production increased by seven per cent in Fy2013 to 170 mt BHP Billiton share.
Western Australia Iron Ore WAIO production of 187 mt 100 per cent basis represented a thirteenth consecutive annual production record.
the delivery US$ million 30 June 2013 of WAIOs capital efficient growth program and continued Revenue 20,215 strong operating performance across the supply chain underlying eBIt 11,121 contributed to this record result.
Capital expenditure 6,255 net operating assets 23,786 underlying eBIt for Fy2013 declined by uS$3.1 billion to uS$11.1 billion.
Record sales volumes at WAIO increased underlying eBIt by uS$1.4 billion.
However, this was more than offset by a 17 per cent fall in the average realised iron ore price to uS$110 per tonne, which reduced underlying eBIt by uS$3.9 billion, net of price-linked costs.
Increased labour and contractor costs reduced underlying eBIt by uS$151 million during the period.
this largely reflected our decision to invest in operating capability prior to the full commissioning and ramp-up of expanded capacity at WAIO.
WAIO unit cash costs, including freight and royalty charges of uS$856 million and uS$1.2 billion, respectively, remained largely unchanged during Fy2013.
On 20 June 2013, we announced an extension of our long-term WAIO joint venture relationship with ItOCHu Corporation ItOCHu and mitsui & Co. ltd. mitsui.
this transaction was completed in July 2013 and has aligned interests across the WAIO supply chain.
under the terms of the agreement, ItOCHu and mitsui invested approximately uS$822 million and uS$720 million, respectively, in shares and loans of BHP Iron Ore Jimblebar Pty ltd, representing an eight per cent and seven per cent interest in the Jimblebar mining hub and resource.
the consideration included a share of capital costs associated with the Jimblebar mine expansion project.
Several major milestones were achieved at our WAIO operations during Fy2013.
this included an increase in port capacity to 220 million tonnes per annum mtpa 100 per cent basis following the successful installation of all major infrastructure associated with the Port Hedland Inner Harbour expansion project.
First production from the Jimblebar mine expansion, which will increase mine capacity to 220 mtpa 100 per cent basis, is expected in the December 2013 quarter, ahead of schedule.
WAIO production is expected to increase by 10 per cent to approximately 207 mt 100 per cent basis in Fy2014.
total Iron Ore production for Fy2014 is forecast to increase by 11 per cent to 188 mt BHP Billiton share.
BHP BIllItOn SummARy RevIeW 2013 | 15 Coal Metallurgical coal production increased by 13 per cent: metallurgical coal production increased by 13 per cent in Fy2013 Energy coal by three per cent.
A 19 per cent 100 per cent basis increase in production at Queensland Coal was underpinned by record annual performance at both Peak Downs and South US$ million 30 June 2013 Walker Creek.
this was achieved despite the indefinite closure of norwich Park and Gregory.
In addition, Illawarra Coal, Revenue 10,723 Australia, achieved record annual production in the period.
underlying eBIt 746 Capital expenditure 3,887 energy coal production increased by three per cent in Fy2013 net operating assets 14,050 to 73 mt BHP Billiton share, which included record annual production from new South Wales energy Coal, Australia, following the successful ramp-up of the RX1 project.
underlying eBIt for Fy2013 declined by uS$2.1 billion to uS$746 million.
A 34 per cent and 31 per cent fall in hard coking coal and weak coking coal prices, respectively, and an 18 per cent fall in thermal coal prices reduced underlying eBIt by uS$3.4 billion, net of price-linked costs.
In contrast, increased sales volumes and controllable cash cost savings increased underlying eBIt by uS$1.5 billion.
A strong focus on contractor usage and rates and a significant reduction in consumables expenditure contributed to a substantial reduction in operating costs at Queensland Coal during the period, as demonstrated by the 30 per cent decline in mine site unit cash costs at BHP Billiton mitsubishi Alliance.
During Fy2013, the Daunia and Broadmeadow life extension projects delivered first production, ahead of schedule.
First coal was also loaded from the newcastle third Port Stage 3 project.
the Caval Ridge, Cerrejn P40 and Appin Area 9 projects remain on schedule and budget.
Following a review of the Hay Point Stage three expansion project, we approved a uS$255 million increase to the original budget of uS$1.25 billion BHP Billiton share.
Shipments from the new facilities are now expected to commence in Cy2015.
the revised schedule and budget reflect the impact of significant weather interruptions and productivity issues that have affected the marine works.
the schedule delay is not expected to impact the growth profile of the broader Queensland Coal operations.
the continued ramp-up of Daunia and future commissioning of Caval Ridge will increase the capacity of our Queensland Coal business to 66 mtpa 100 per cent basis by the end of Cy2014.
metallurgical coal production for Cy2014 is expected to increase to approximately 41 mt BHP Billiton share while energy coal production is expected to remain steady at 73 mt BHP Billiton share.
16 | BHP BIllItOn SummARy RevIeW 2013 Aluminium, Manganese and Nickel Underlying EBIT for FY2013 increased by US$188 million Alumina production increased by 18 per cent in Fy2013 to US$164 million.
to a record 4.9 mt BHP Billiton share, underpinned by the ramp-up of the efficiency and Growth project at Worsley.
Aluminium production increased by two per cent to 1.2 mt US$ million 30 June 2013 BHP Billiton share as it benefited from improved performance at our southern African smelters.
Revenue 9,278 underlying eBIt 164 total manganese ore production increased by seven per cent Capital expenditure 758 in Fy2013 to a record 8.5 mt 100 per cent basis and reflected a net operating assets 8,622 substantial improvement in plant availability at GemCO, Australia.
total manganese alloy volumes were largely unchanged from Fy2012.
the recovery in temCO Australia production that followed the temporary suspension of operations in the prior period was offset by the permanent closure of energy-intensive silicomanganese production at metalloys, South Africa, in January 2012. nickel production in Fy2013 was largely unchanged from the prior period.
A strong operating performance at Cerro matoso, Colombia, was offset by planned maintenance at the nickel West Kalgoorlie smelter and Kwinana refinery.
underlying eBIt for Fy2013 increased by uS$188 million to uS$164 million.
the response of our teams to the persistent challenges faced by our Aluminium, manganese and nickel Business has delivered tangible results.
With productivity improvements already well advanced, substantial cost savings of uS$480 million were achieved during the period, while a stronger uS dollar increased underlying eBIt by a further uS$243 million.

In this context, lower average realised prices for aluminium down six per cent to uS$2,191 per tonne, alumina down nine per cent to uS$302 per tonne, nickel down 15 per cent to uS$16,319 per tonne and manganese alloy down 10 per cent to uS$1,051 per tonne were only partially offset by an increase in the average realised price of manganese ore up nine per cent to uS$4.83 per tonne.
