Notes to the Company Accounts 34.
Accounting Policies The separate Financial Statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
As permitted by that Act, the separate Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
In accordance with the exemption provided by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account.
The Company has taken the exemption available in respect of the requirements of FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared on the historical cost basis, except that derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value as described below.
Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge the Groups exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operating and financing activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, it does not hold or use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Financial guarantees Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rate ruling at that date with any exchange differences arising on retranslation being recognised in the profit and loss account.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Tangible fixed assets are stated at historic cost.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the difference between the cost or valuation of fixed assets and their residual value over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis.
Estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold property 20 to 40 years Office equipment 3 to 5 years Intangible fixed assets and amortisation Intangible fixed assets purchased by the Company are capitalised at their cost.
Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to administrative expenses in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Software 3 to 5 years Fixed asset investments Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at their amortised cost, reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.

Accounting Policies continued Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19 Deferred Tax.
Leasing Annual payments under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on an accruals basis.
Post-retirement benefits The Company participates in Group operated defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Company in independently administered funds.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the Group defined benefit schemes underlying assets and liabilities and therefore accounts for it as a defined contribution scheme.
The amounts charged against profits represent contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the accounting year.
Share-based payments The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no trueup for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries, it recognises an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in its subsidiarys Financial Statements with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.
In cases where a subsidiary is recharged for the share-based payment expense, no such increase in investment is recognised.
Cash flow statement The Company has not presented a separate cash flow statement in accordance with the exemption provided by FRS 1 Revised Cash Flow Statements, as its cash flows are included within the cash flows of the Group, as set out elsewhere in this Annual Report.
