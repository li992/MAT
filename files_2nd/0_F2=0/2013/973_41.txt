232 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2013 Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES COPPER estimates as at 31 December 2013 1 Copper Reserves: A minimum cut-off of 0.20% TCu, ICu or ASCu is applied to determine Ore Reserves on operations.
2 Collahuasi Oxide and Mixed: The decrease is due to reallocated of Ore Reserves to Mineral Resources due to changes in economic assumptions.
3 Collahuasi Low Grade Sulphide: The increase is primarily due to new information and changes in the economic assumptions.
4 El Soldado Sulphide Flotation : In addition to production, the decrease in Ore Reserves is due to a change in economic assumptions increase in operational costs and a refinement of the grade calculation methodology in the block model.
5 Mantos Blancos Sulphide Flotation : The increase in Ore Reserves is primarily due to conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves within the updated mine plan which now includes Phase 20 Argentina and uses a modified cut-off grade strategy.
6 Mantos Blancos Oxide Vat and Heap Leach : The increase in Ore Reserves is primarily due to the inclusion of Phase 21 in the mine plan and conversion of additional ore from Phases 13,14 and 17.
7 Mantoverde Oxide Heap Leach : The increase in Ore Reserves is due to the inclusion in the mine plan of Phase 4 of Mantoverde North and South pits, a new pit design at Franko North and the transfer of high-carbonate Dump Leach ore to the Heap Leach process.
8 Mantoverde Oxide Dump Leach : The decrease in Ore Reserves is primarily due to production and the transfer of high-carbonate Dump Leach ore to the Heap Leach process which is offset by the inclusion in the mine plan of Phase 4 of Mantoverde North and South pits and a new pit design at Franko North.
Audits related to the generation of the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates were carried out by independent consultants during 2013 at the following operations: Collahuasi, El Soldado, Los Bronces and Mantos Blancos.

Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to some Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will necessarily be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Resource after continued exploration.
1 Copper Resources: A test of reasonable eventual economic extraction is applied through consideration of an optimised pit shell.
Materials outside the optimised shell that have potential of eventual economic extraction via underground means are not included in the Mineral Resource statement.
Mineral Resources are quoted above a 0.2% TCu cut-off.
2 Collahuasi Oxide and Mixed, Sulphide and Low Grade Sulphide: The increase in Mineral Resources is primarily due to new drilling information which identified and delineated new resources.
3 El Soldado Sulphide Flotation : The increase in Mineral Resources is primarily due to reallocation from Ore Reserves as a result of a change in economic assumptions increase in operational costs as well as a refinement of the grade calculation methodology in the block model.
4 Los Bronces Sulphide Flotation : The increase in Mineral Resources is primarily due to a change in economic assumptions increase in long-term metal price.
5 Mantos Blancos Sulphide Flotation : The decrease in Mineral Resources is due to a conversion to Ore Reserves in Phase 20 Argentina following a change in economic assumptions and adoption of a revised open pit mine plan.
6 Mantos Blancos Oxide Vat and Heap Leach : The increase in Mineral Resources is due to new drilling information and a change in economic assumptions increase in long-term metal price.
7 Mantos Blancos Oxide Dump Leach : The Mineral Resources increase due to the inclusion of additional secondary leaching material from Dump Este, Old Concentrator Course Tailings and the Mercedes stockpile.
8 Mantoverde Oxide Heap Leach : The increase in Mineral Resources at Mantoverde North and South pits Phase 4 mine plan is a result of updated economic assumptions and new drilling information.
Mining method: OP Open Pit.
Los Sulfatos and San Enrique Monolito are part of Anglo American Sur.
Mantoverde Development Project is part of Anglo American Norte.
West Wall is a Joint Venture with GlencoreXstrata.
The Pebble project is not reported in 2013 as Anglo American has elected to withdraw from the project.
1 Quellaveco: Mineral Resources are quoted above a 0.2 %TCu cut-off within an optimised pit shell.
The slight change is due to updated economic assumptions used to define the resource shell.
2 Mantoverde Development Project: Mineral Resources are quoted above a 0.35 %TCu cut-off.
The increase in Mineral Resources is due to a change in economic assumptions increase in long-term metal price and pit optimisation parameters.
Reported as Mantoverde Sulphide Project in 2012.
Mineral Resource estimates for oxide material planned to be exposed during pre-stripping operations for the sulphides are as follows: Measured 48.0 Mt at 0.40 %ASCu: Indicated 5.7 Mt at 0.34 %ASCu: Inferred 3.4 Mt at 0.32 %ASCu.
3 Los Sulfatos: The reported resources include mineralisation inside a 1% nominal copper grade cut-off envelope down to the current drillhole depths of 1,000 metres below surface.
The test for reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction is based on an underground operation.
4 San Enrique Monolito: The test for reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction is based on an underground operation.
5 West Wall: Mineral Resources are quoted above a 0.3 %TCu cut-off within an optimised pit shell.
The increase in Mineral Resources is due to new drilling information leading to an update of the geological model.
Audits related to the generation of the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates were carried out by independent consultants during 2013 at the following projects: Los Sulfatos.
