Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2013 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the applicable UK Accounting Standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
They have also been prepared on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will continue to be granted.
b Income Dividends receivable on equity shares other than special dividends are treated as revenue for the year on an exdividend basis.
Where no ex-dividend date is available dividends receivable on or before the year end are treated as revenue for the year.
Where the Company has elected to receive dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as revenue.
Provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
Special dividends are credited to capital or revenue, according to the circumstances.
Dividend revenue is presented gross of any non-recoverable withholding taxes, which are disclosed separately with the Income Statement.
The fixed returns on debt securities are recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield on the debt securities and shares.
Interest receivable from cash and short-term deposits and interest payable is accrued to the end of the year.
c Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
All expenses are charged through the revenue column of the Income Statement except as follows: transaction costs on the acquisition or disposal of investments are recognised as a capital item in the Income Statement.
expenses are charged as a capital item in the Income Statement where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the investment management fee has been allocated 50% to revenue and 50% to capital to reflect the Companys investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.
d Taxation The tax payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expenditure that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The tax effect of different items of income gain and expenditure loss is allocated between the capital and revenue accounts on the same basis as the particular item to which it relates using the Companys effective rate of tax for the year.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the Balance Sheet date.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences arising between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Due to the Companys status as an investment trust company, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
Murray Income Trust PLC 41 Notes to the Financial Statements continued e Valuation of investments Investments have been designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss.
This is done because all investments are considered to form part of a group of financial assets which is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Companys documented investment strategy, and information about the grouping is provided internally on that basis.
Investments are recognised and fide-recognised at trade date where a purchase or sale is under a contract whose terms require delivery within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are measured initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investments are valued at fair value through profit or loss.
For listed investments, this is deemed to be bid market prices or closing prices for SETS London Stock Exchanges electronic trading service stocks sourced from the London Stock Exchange.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in the net return for the period as a capital item in the Income Statement and are ultimately recognised in the capital reserve.
f Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and that are subject to insignificant risk of change in value.
g Borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received, net of any issue expenses.
Subsequently, they continue to be valued at fair value, which is determined by aggregating the expected future cash flows for that loan or overdraft at a rate comprising the borrowers margin plus an average of market rates applicable to loans or overdrafts of a similar period of time and currency.
Finance charges are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method and are charged 50% to revenue and 50% to capital to reflect the Companys investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.
h Traded options The Company may enter into certain derivatives eg options to gain exposure to the market.
The option contracts are accounted for as separate derivative contracts and are therefore shown in other assets or other liabilities at their fair value ie market value.
The premium received on the open position is recognised in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Where the option is written for the maintenance or enhancement of the Companys investments then the change in fair value is recognised in the capital column of the Income Statement.
i Segmental reporting The Directors are of the opinion that the Company is engaged in a single segment of business activity, being investment business.
Consequently, no business segmental analysis is provided.
j Treasury shares When the Company purchases the Companys equity share capital as treasury shares, the amount of the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, is net of any tax effects, and is recognised as a deduction from equity.
When these shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity, and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is transferred to or from the capital reserve.
k Dividends payable Dividends are recognised in the financial statements in the period in which they are paid.

The proposed final dividend for 2013 is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
We set out below the total dividends paid and proposed in respect of the financial year, which is the basis on which the requirements of Section 11581159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 are considered.
The revenue available for distribution by way of dividend for the year is 20,582,000 2012 19,886,000.

The differences are explained as follows: 44 Murray Income Trust PLC 2013 2012 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Net profit on ordinary activities before 20,935 57,033 77,968 20,135 15,536 4,599 taxation Return on ordinary activities multiplied by 4,972 13,545 18,517 5,134 3,962 1,172 the effective rate of corporation tax of 23.75% 2012 25.5% Effects of: Non-taxable UK dividends 3,855 3,855 4,382 4,382 Non-taxable stock dividends 323 323 189 189 Non-taxable overseas dividends 985 985 619 619 Movement in income accruals taxable on 6 6 receipt Movement in unutilised loan relationships 167 86 253 97 117 214 Movement in unutilised management 24 295 319 236 236 expenses Tax relief from expenses charged to 47 47 capital Other capital returns 13,926 13,926 3,562 3,562 Overseas tax irrecoverable 353 353 249 249 Current tax charge 353 353 249 249 c Factors that may affect future tax charges No provision for deferred tax has been made in the current or prior accounting period.
The Company has not provided for deferred tax on capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments as it is exempt from tax on these items because of its status as an investment trust company.
At the year end, the Company has, for taxation purposes only, accumulated unrelieved management expenses and loan relationship deficits of 50,914,000 2012 48,506,000.
A deferred tax asset in respect of this has not been recognised and these expenses will only be utilised if the Company has profits chargeable to corporation tax in the future.
It is considered too uncertain that the Company will generate such profits and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised.

The carrying amount of financial assets pledged equated to 2,549,000 2012 2,954,000, all in the form of securities.
The collateral position is monitored on a daily basis, which then determines if further assets are required to be pledged over and above those already pledged.
Transaction costs During the year expenses were incurred in acquiring or disposing of investments classified at fair value through profit or loss.
These have been expensed through capital and are included within gains on investments in the Income Statement.

At 30 June 2013 the Company had drawn down 40,000,000 30 June 2012 40,000,000 of a 70,000,000 unsecured revolving bank credit facility with Scotiabank Ireland Limited.
Under the terms of the agreement, advances from the facility may be made for periods of up to six months or for such longer periods agreed by the lender.
Interest is charged at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a margin of 1.15% for the relevant period of the advance.
On 11 September 2013 the Company had drawn down 40,000,000 of the facility, at an all-in interest rate of 1.64188% until maturity on 27 September 2013.
Borrowing facilities of 70 million are committed to the Company until 29 September 2013.
The Company is in negotiation with its bankers in advance of renewal but at this stage has not received confirmation that the facility will be renewed.
If acceptable terms are available from the existing bankers, or any alternative, the Company would expect to continue to access the facility.
However, should these terms not be forthcoming, any outstanding borrowing would be repaid through the proceeds of equity sales.
Financial covenants contained within the loan agreement provide, inter alia, that the Adjusted Asset Coverage must exceed 3.5 to 1 and that net assets must exceed 185 million.
All financial covenants were met during the year and also during the period from the year end to the date of this report.

Derivatives and other financial instruments The Companys financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise securities and other investments, cash balances, liquid resources, loans and debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations: for example, in respect of sales and purchases awaiting settlement, and debtors for accrued income.
The Company also has the ability to enter into derivative transactions in the form of forward foreign currency contracts, futures and options, subject to Board approval, for the purpose of enhancing portfolio returns and for hedging purposes in a manner consistent with the Companys broader investment policy.
48 Murray Income Trust PLC The main risks the Company faces from these financial instruments are i market risk comprising interest rate, foreign currency and other price risk, ii liquidity risk and iii credit risk.
In order to mitigate risk, the investment strategy is to select investments for their fundamental value.
Stock selection is therefore based on disciplined accounting, market and sector analysis.
It is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular sector.
The Attribution Analysis, detailing the allocation of assets and the stock selection, is shown in the Performance Attribution table on page 7.
The Investment Manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board, which meets regularly in order to consider investment strategy.
Current strategy is detailed in the Chairmans Statement on pages 4 and 5 in the sections headed Performance, Dividends and Outlook and in the Investment Managers Review on pages 6 to 9 in the sections headed Background, Performance, Portfolio Activity, Structure, Income and Outlook.
The Board has agreed the parameters for gearing, which was 5.6% of net assets as at 30 June 2013 2012 4.7%.
The Managers policies for managing these risks are summarised below and have been applied throughout the current and previous year.
The numerical disclosures in the table listed below exclude short-term debtors and creditors.
Market risk The Companys investment portfolio is exposed to market price fluctuations, which are monitored by the Manager in pursuance of the investment objective as set out in the Corporate Summary on pages 2 and 3.
Adherence to investment guidelines and to investment and borrowing powers set out in the management agreement mitigates the risk of exposure to any particular security or issuer.
Further information on the investment portfolio is set out in the Investment Managers Review on pages 6 to 9.
Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys operations.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions as a consequence of price movements.
It is the Boards policy to hold equity investments in the portfolio in a broad spread of sectors in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular sector.
A summary of investment changes during the year under review is on page 16 and an analysis of the equity portfolio by industrial classification is on pages 14 and 15.
Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect: the fair value of the investments in fixed interest rate securities: the level of income receivable on cash deposits: and interest payable on the Companys variable rate borrowings.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment and borrowing decisions.
The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these on a regular basis.
Interest rate risk is the risk of movements in the value of financial instruments as a result of fluctuations in interest rates.
Financial assets The interest rate risk of the portfolio of financial assets at the Balance Sheet date was as follows: Murray Income Trust PLC 49 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Floating rate Non-interest bearing 2013 2012 2013 2012 000 000 000 000 Euro 142 610 41,809 26,789 Sterling 12,380 19,160 438,444 392,431 Swedish Krona 11,585 4,199 Swiss Francs 17 97 25,781 19,936 Total 12,539 19,867 517,619 443,355 The floating rate assets consist of cash deposits on call earning interest at prevailing market rates.
The non-interest bearing assets represent the equity element of the portfolio.
Financial liabilities The Company has borrowings by way of a loan facility, details of which are in note 11.
The fair value of the loan equates to the cost as the loans are rolled over on a regular basis.
All other financial assets and liabilities of the Company are included in the Balance Sheet at their book value which in the opinion of the Directors is not materially different from their fair value.
Maturity profile The maturity profile of the Companys financial assets and liabilities at 30 June was as follows: Within Within 1 year 1 year 2013 2012 Assets 000 000 Floating rate Cash 12,539 19,867 Within Within 1 year 1 year 2013 2012 Liabilities 000 000 Floating rate Revolving bank credit facility 40,000 40,000 All the other financial assets and liabilities do not have a maturity date.
Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and nonderivative instruments at the Balance Sheet date and the stipulated change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant in the case of instruments that have floating rates.
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Companys profit before tax for the year ended 30 June 2013 and net assets would decrease increase by 275,000 2012 decrease increase by 201,000.
This is mainly attributable to the Companys exposure to interest rates on its floating rate cash balances and borrowings.
50 Murray Income Trust PLC Foreign currency risk A proportion of the Companys investment portfolio is invested in overseas securities whose values are subject to fluctuation due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
In addition, the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates upon the profits of investee companies can result, indirectly, in changes in their valuations.
Consequently the Balance Sheet can be affected by movements in exchange rates.
The revenue account is subject to currency fluctuations arising on dividends receivable in foreign currencies and, indirectly, due to the impact of foreign exchange rates upon the profits of investee companies.
The Company does not hedge this currency risk.
Foreign currency risk exposure by currency of denomination excluding other debtors and receivables and other payables falling due within one year: 30 June 2013 30 June 2012 Net Total Net Total monetary currency monetary currency Investments liabilities exposure Investments liabilities exposure 000 000 000 000 000 000 Euro 41,809 142 41,951 26,789 610 27,399 Sterling 438,444 27,620 410,824 392,431 20,840 371,591 Swedish Krona 11,585 11,585 4,199 4,199 Swiss Francs 25,781 17 25,798 19,936 97 20,033 Total 517,619 27,461 490,158 443,355 20,133 423,222 Foreign currency sensitivity No sensitivity analysis has been included.
Where the Companys equity investments which are non-monetary items are priced in a foreign currency, they have been included within the other price risk sensitivity analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
Other price risk Other price risks ie changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate or currency risk may affect the value of the quoted investments.
It is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular country or sector.
The allocation of assets to international markets and the stock selection process, as detailed in the section Investment Policy on page 2, both act to reduce market risk.
The Manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board, which meets regularly in order to review investment strategy.
Other price risk sensitivity If market prices at the Balance Sheet date had been 10% higher or lower while all other variables remained constant, the return attributable to Ordinary shareholders and equity for the year ended 30 June 2013 would have increased decreased by 51,761,000 2012 44,336,000.
Liquidity risk The Companys assets comprise readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of committed loan and overdraft facilities.
As at 30 June 2013 the Company utilised 40,000,000 of a 70,000,000 2012 40,000,000 revolving bank credit facility, which is committed until 29 September 2013.
Interest is charged at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a margin of 1.15% 2012 margin 1.15% for the relevant period of the advance.
The aggregate of all future interest payments at the rate ruling at 30 June 2013 and the redemption of the loan amounted to 40,059,000 2012 40,062,000.
Murray Income Trust PLC 51 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss.
This is mitigated by the Investment Manager reviewing the credit ratings of broker counterparties.
The risk attached to dividend flows is mitigated by the Investment Managers research of potential investee companies.
The Companys custodian bank is responsible for the collection of income on behalf of the Company and its performance is reviewed by the Board on a regular basis.
It is the Managers policy to trade only with A and above Long Term rated and A1 P1 Short Term rated counterparties.
None of the Companys financial assets are past due or impaired 2012 nil.
Capital management policies and procedures The investment objective of the Company is to achieve a high and growing income combined with capital growth through investment in a portfolio of UK and overseas equities.
The capital of the Company consists of equity, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Company manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The Board monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: the planned level of gearing which takes into account the Investment Managers views on the market: the level of equity shares in issue: the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
The Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding accounting period.
