Further rate reductions to 21% from April 2014 and 20% from April 2015 were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013, therefore the deferred tax provision at the balance sheet date has been calculated at 20%.
This has resulted in a deferred tax credit in the income statement of 2.1m.

9 Intangible assets 000 Cost and carrying amount At 2 January 2012, 30 and 31 December 2012 and 29 December 2013 26,433 Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is subject to an impairment review annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
Therefore, goodwill arising on acquisition is monitored and an impairment test is carried out which compares the value in use of each cash generating unit CGU to its carrying value.
The intangible assets reported on the balance sheet represent goodwill arising on the acquisition of Blubeckers Limited and Brunning and Price Limited, which now trade as Pub restaurants.
Value in use calculations are based on cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and three year business plans approved by the Board.
Cash flows are then extrapolated in perpetuity with an annual growth rate of 2%.
Perpetuity is believed to be reasonable due to the significant proportion of freeholds in the estate and the nature of the leasehold properties.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 9.9% 2012: 8.6% which is the rate believed by the Directors to reflect the risks associated with the CGU.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis taking into consideration the impact on key impairment test assumptions arising from a range of possible trading and economic scenarios.
The scenarios have been performed separately with the sensitivities summarised as follows: An increase in the discount rate of 1% A decrease of 5% on forecast cashflows The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairment would result from either an increase in the discount rate or a decrease in forecast cashflows.
Since 1 January 1989 the cumulative amount of goodwill written off against realised reserves is 50.4m 2012: 50.4m.
Records for periods prior to this date are not readily available.

Long-Term Incentive Plan The Group operates the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, details of which are provided in the Directors remuneration report.
Awards under the LTIP are granted to executive Directors and senior management in the form of nil cost options.
Conditional Award share options and Matching Award share options are granted to Directors and selected employees.
In respect of the Matching Award share options, the respective Director or employee is required to acquire a number of shares by a specified date, known as deposited shares, and retain these shares until the Matching Award share options vest, for these Matching Award share options to be valid.
The table below summarises the dates of awards under the LTIP and the dates by which Directors and employees were required to acquire their deposited shares.
Date of Award Date by which Deposited Shares must be acquired 16 March 2011 30 June 2011 1 March 2012 30 June 2012 28 February 2013 30 June 2013 Vesting of share options under the LTIP is dependent on continuing employment or in accordance with good leaver properties as set out in the scheme rules.
In exceptional circumstances, employees may be permitted to exercise options before the normal period in which they are exercisable.
The Conditional and Matching Awards granted on 4 March 2010 became exercisable on the publication of the 2012 results.
The performance criteria was based on Total Shareholder Return TSR and Earnings Per Share EPS.
For the TSR element of the award, The Restaurant Group plc was the highest ranked company for TSR in its comparator group for the second year running and consequently the TSR element of the award vested in full.
In respect of the EPS element of the award, the growth in EPS was between RPI 4% and RPI 10% and 72% of this part of the award vested.
For those awards granted on 16 March 2011 that vest in 2014, the performance criteria were based on TSR and EPS.
For the TSR element of the award, The Restaurant Group plc was ranked in the upper quartile against its comparator group and consequently the TSR element of the award will vest in full.
In respect of the EPS element of the award the growth in EPS was between RPI 4% and RPI 10% and 88% of this part of the award will vest.
The options from the LTIP scheme will be satisfied through share purchases via a trust.
Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to 80% of the average market price of the shares for the five days prior to invitation.
Employees pay a fixed amount from their salary into a savings account each month for the three-year savings period.
At the end of the savings period, employees have six months in which to exercise their options using the funds saved.
If employees decide not to exercise their options, they may withdraw their funds saved and the options expire.
Exercise of options is subject to continued employment within the Group.
In exceptional circumstances, employees may be permitted to exercise these options before the end of the three-year savings period.
Options were valued using the Stochastic share pricing model.

In order to calculate volatility, the movement in the return index share price plus dividends re-invested over a period prior to the grant date equal in length to the remaining period over which the performance condition applies has been calculated.
For the discount for the TSR performance condition for the relevant Conditional and Matching Awards, the calculated volatility based on the movement in the return index over a period of 3 years prior to the grant has been used.

Interest is payable at floating interest rates which fluctuate and are dependent on LIBOR and base rate.
The average weighted year end interest rate for these borrowings was 1.74% 2012: 1.75%.
The Group has in place a five year 140m loan facility.
This facility provides the Group with medium-term security of funding, additional capacity to take advantage of business opportunities as they become available and the flexibility to optimise the Groups funding structure.
Interest is payable on the amount drawn down at LIBOR plus mandatory cost and the banks margin, which is dependent on the debt to EBITDA ratio.
The Group has a 10m overdraft facility, which is repayable on demand, on which interest is payable at the banks overdraft rate.
At 29 December 2013 the Group has 90.0m of committed borrowing facilities in excess of gross borrowings 30 December 2012: 90.0m and 10.0m of undrawn overdraft 30 December 2012: 10.0m of undrawn overdraft.

62 Annual Report 2013 The Restaurant Group plc Notes to the accounts continued 22 Financial instruments and derivatives continued b Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial losses to the Group.
Counterparties for cash and derivative balances are with large established financial institutions.
The Group is exposed to credit related losses in the event of non-performance by the financial institutions but does not expect them to fail to meet their obligations.
As a retail business with trading receipts settled either by cash or credit and debit cards, there is very limited exposure from customer transactions.
The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of retrospective discounts receivable from suppliers but the Directors believe adequate provision has been made in respect of doubtful debts and there are no material amounts past due that have not been provided against.
The Group has an outstanding long-term receivable of 10.4m plus interest due from BHR Finance Limited formerly LV Finance Limited, a subsidiary of the Groups associate company BH Restaurants Limited formerly Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited.
This debt is secured on the assets of BH Restaurants Limited, but is subject to a prior ranking behind BHR Finance Limiteds bank.
In 2007, following a detailed review of the carrying value of the business including the loan note receivable, the Board made full provision against the loan note due further details are provided in note 11.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowances for losses, represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
c Liquidity risk The Group has built an appropriate mechanism to manage liquidity risk of the short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
Liquidity risk is managed through the maintenance of adequate cash reserves and bank facility by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The Groups loan facility, which matures in October 2016 as set out in note a above ensures continuity of funding, provided the Group continues to meet its covenant requirements as detailed in the report of the Directors on page 21. d Foreign currency risk The Group is not materially exposed to changes in foreign currency rates and does not use foreign exchange forward contracts.
Following the closure of the Groups three restaurants in Spain in 2011, any transactional or translational exposure to changes in foreign exchange rate is marginal and relates to the outstanding transactions in relation to the termination of the Spanish business.
e Interest rate risk Exposure to interest rate movements has been controlled historically through the use of floating rate debt and interest rate swaps to achieve a balanced interest rate profile.
The Group does not currently have any interest rate swaps in place as the reduction in the level of debt combined with current market conditions results in a low level of exposure.
The Groups exposure will continue to be monitored and the use of interest rate swaps may be considered in the future.
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2013 63 23 Lease commitments Future lease payments in respect of finance leases are due as follows: Present value of minimum Minimum lease payments lease payments 2013 2012 2013 2012 000 000 000 000 Within one year 330 328 330 328 Within two to five years 1,318 1,310 1,010 1,004 After five years 11,597 11,651 1,875 1,840 13,245 13,289 Less: Future interest payments 10,030 10,117 Present value of lease obligations 3,215 3,172 3,215 3,172 Analysed as: Amount due for settlement within one year 330 328 Amount due for settlement after one year 2,885 2,844 Present value of lease obligations 3,215 3,172 Lease commitments are in respect of property leases where the initial term of the lease is in excess of 25 years and the conditions of the lease are in keeping with a finance lease.
There are no finance leases where the Group itself is the lessor.
The interest rate applied in calculating the present value of the payments is the incremental borrowing cost of the Group in relation to each lease.
The fair value of the lease payments is estimated as 3.2m 2012: 3.2m.
The total future minimum rentals payable and receivable under operating leases over the remaining lives of the leases are: Payable Receivable Payable Receivable 2013 2013 2012 2012 Payments due: 000 000 000 000 Within one year 55,923 2,866 53,695 3,101 Within two to five years 190,678 9,326 183,809 9,974 After five years 437,500 25,263 398,112 25,511 684,101 37,455 635,616 38,586 The Group has entered into a number of property leases on standard commercial terms, both as lessee and lessor.
There are no restrictions imposed by the Groups operating lease arrangements, either in the current or prior year.
Included within the minimum rentals are amounts payable on properties where the rental payment is based on turnover.
For these properties, primarily in the Groups Concession business, the amount included above is the minimum guaranteed rent as detailed in the concession agreement.
Where there is no minimum guaranteed rent, the amount included is based on the estimated amount payable.
24 Capital commitments 2013 2012 000 000 Authorised and contracted for: 40,053 27,015 25 Contingent liabilities The Group has assigned a number of leases to third parties that were originally completed prior to 1 January 1996 and are therefore unaffected by the Landlord and Tenant Covenants Act 1995 and also a number of leases completed after this date that were the subject of an Authorised Guarantee Agreement.
Consequently, should the current tenant default, the landlord has a right of recourse to The Restaurant Group plc, or its subsidiaries, for future rental payments.
As and when any liability arises, the Group will take whatever steps necessary to mitigate the costs.
