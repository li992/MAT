Strategic report Governance Financial statements Notes to the coNsolIdated accouNts For the year ended 30 september 2013 1 General information ITE Group plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom.
The address of the registered office is given on page 123.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 41 and innote 3.
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the accounting policies set out below.
Impact of new accounting standards New, revised or changes to existing standards which have been adopted by the Group in the year ending 30 September 2013 The following new standards and interpretations have been adopted in the current year but have not impacted the reported results or the financial position: Amendment to IAS 12 Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets: and Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income.
The adoption of these new standards and interpretation has not changed any previously reported figures.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not beenapplied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted bythe EU : Amendments to IAS 19, IFRS 7, IAS 32, IFRS 10, IFRS 11, IAS 27, IAS 28, IFRS 1, IAS 36 and IAS 39: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Classification and Measurement: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities: and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group, except for: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments This will introduce a number of changes in the presentation of financial instruments.
IFRS 10 13 were issued by the IASB on 12 May 2011 and which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1January 2013.
The Group has not completed its assessment of the impact of pronouncements on the consolidated results, financial position or cashflows of the Group.
2 Basis of accounting ITE Group plc the Company is a UK listed company and, together with its subsidiary operations, is hereafter referred to as the Group.
The Company is required to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
In addition, the Group has complied with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and income and expenses.
These estimates and associated assumptions are based on past experience and other factors considered applicable at the time and are used to make judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that cannot be readily determined from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Changes to estimates and assumptions arereflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are made.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will continue inoperational existence for the foreseeable future as disclosed in the Finance Directors Report on page 37.
The statements are presented in pounds Sterling and have been prepared under IFRS using the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 83 Financial statements Notes to the coNsolIdated accouNts coNtiNued For the year ended 30 september 2013 2 Basis of accounting continued Basis of consolidation The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of ITE Group plc and the subsidiary undertakings controlled by the Company drawn up to 30 September each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets is recognised as goodwill.
The interest of non controlling shareholders is stated at the non contolling interests proportion of the fair values of assets and liabilities recognised.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used inline with those used by the Group.
All intragroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non controlling interest in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries is identified separately from the Groups equity therein.
Non controlling interest consists of the amount of those interests as at the date of the original business combination and the noncontrolling interests share of changes in equity since the date of the combination.
Losses applicable to the non controlling interest in excess of their interest in the subsidiaries equity are allocated against non controlling interest even if this results inadeficit balance.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Any costs attributable to the business combination are expensed directly to the Income Statement.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 Noncurrent assets held for sale and discontinued operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of thebusiness combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisitiondate fair value.
Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments.
All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs.
Changes inthefair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured as the non controlling interests proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cashgenerating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cashgenerating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested forimpairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit is less than the carrying value of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the unit, prorata on the basisof the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 84 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 2 Basis of accounting continued On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss ondisposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill on acquisition of a foreign entity is treated as an asset of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Intangible assets Computer software is initially measured at purchase cost.
Customer relationships, trademarks and licences and visitor databases are measured at fair value.
Computer software, customer relationships, trademarks and licences and visitor databases have a definite useful life and are carried at cost or fair value less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost over their estimated useful life.
The estimated useful lives aretypically between three and ten years for customer relationships, for some trademarks up to twenty years and for visitor databases between five and eight years.
Computer software is amortised over four years.
Impairment of assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets are impaired.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of theasset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment if any.
Where the asset does not generate cashflows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cashflows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which estimates of future cashflows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cashgenerating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cashgenerating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment is recognised immediately as an expense.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cashgenerating unit is increased tothe revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cashgenerating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement immediately, unless the relevant asset iscarried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method, onthe following bases: Leasehold improvements term of lease Plant and equipment four toten years Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets, orwhere shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying value amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
associates and joint ventures An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control over those policies.
A joint venture is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise joint control.
Joint control exists when decisions about the activities of the entity require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 85 Financial statements Notes to the coNsolIdated accouNts coNtiNued For the year ended 30 september 2013 2 Basis of accounting continued The results and assets and liabilities of associates and joint ventures are incorporated in these financial statements usingthe equity method of accounting.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are carried in the balance sheet at costas adjusted by post acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate or joint venture, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of an associate or joint venture in excess of theGroups interest inthat entity which includes any longterm interests that, in substance, form part of the Groups net investment in the associate or joint venture are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations ormade payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate or joint venture of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to theextent of the Groups interest in the relevant associate or joint venture.
Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which case an appropriate provision is made for impairment.
Venue advances Venue advances arise where the Group has advanced funds to venue owners that can be repaid by either offsetting against future venue hire or by cash repayment.
Where the advance can be settled in cash, the loan balance is measured atamortised cost using the effective interest rate method where the impact of discounting is material.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that theasset is impaired.
Advances that are prepayments of future venue hire and do not permit the repayment of the principal in cash are recognised at cost as prepayments in venue advances and prepayments.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Financial Instruments classes of financial instruments The Group aggregates its financial instruments into classes based on their nature and characteristics.
The details of financial instruments by class are disclosed in note 21 to the accounts.
Financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: cash and cash equivalents, loans and receivables and derivative assets at fair value through profit or loss.
The classification is determined by management upon initial recognition, and is based on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Financial assets are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether its financial assets are to be impaired.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement where there is objective evidence of impairment.
Financial assets are derecognised infull or partly when the Groups rights to cashflows from the respective assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has neither exposure to the risks inherent in those assets nor entitlement to rewards from them.
investments Investments in unlisted shares that are not traded in an active market are classified as availableforsale financial assets andstated at fair value.
Fair value is determined in the manner described in note 21.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the investments revaluation reserve with the exception of impairment losses, interest calculated using the effective interest method and foreign exchange gainand losses on monetary assets which are recognised directly in profit or loss.
Where the investment is disposed of orisdetermined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the investments revaluation reserve isreclassified to the income statement.
Dividends on available for sale equity instruments are recognised in profit or loss when the Groups right to receive the dividends is established.
cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and on demand deposits, and other shortterm highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Cash and cash equivalents are measured at initial recognition at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value with all realised gains or losses recognised in the income statement.
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 86 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 2 Basis of accounting continued Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
This category includes the following classes of financial assets: trade and other receivables and venue advances.
Loans and receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement when there isobjective evidence that the asset is impaired.
The estimates are based on specific credit circumstances and the Groups historical bad receivables experience.
No interest is charged on the loans and receivables, due to either their shortterm nature or specific arrangements in place, and hence the effective interest rate method is not applied.
derivative assets A derivative is a financial instrument that changes its value in response to changes in underlying variable, requires no or little net initial investment and is settled at a future date.
Derivative assets are classified as at fair value through profit or loss.
Derivative assets are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value ateach balance date with the resulting gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
These derivatives are acquired in full compliance with the Groups risk management policies.
Financial liabilities The Group classifies its financial liabilities into the following categories: written put options, bank borrowings, trade and other payables held at amortised cost and derivative liabilities through profit or loss.
Financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Written put options Any contract with a single or multiple settlement option that contains an obligation for the Group to purchase equity in asubsidiary for cash gives rise to a financial liability for the present value of the repurchase price.
An amount equal to the liability is recorded in equity on initial recognition of a written put option.
The liability is subsequently remeasured through the income statement.
Where considered significant, the Groups written put options are discounted to their appropriate value.
The unwinding ofthe discount is charged through the income statement over the period to exercise.
Bank borrowings Interestbearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received.
Finance charges are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Where bank loans and overdrafts are deemed to be integral to the Groups cash management activities, they are presented within net cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement.
Loan and overdraft interest and associated costs that are considered to be financing in nature are presented as financing activities inthe cash flow statement.
trade and other payables Trade payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Tradepayables are derecognised in full when the Group is discharged from its obligation, it expires, is cancelled or replacedby anew liability with substantially modified terms.
Trade and other payables are shortterm and there is nointerest charged in connection with these, hence the effective interest method is not applied.
derivative liabilities A derivative is a financial instrument that changes its value in response to changes in an underlying variable, requires no orlittle net initial investment and is settled at a future date.
Derivative liabilities are classified as fair value through profit orloss.
Derivative liabilities are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance date with the resulting gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
These derivatives areacquired in full compliance with the Groups risk management policies.
Hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge these exposures.
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 87 Financial statements Notes to the coNsolIdated accouNts coNtiNued For the year ended 30 september 2013 2 Basis of accounting continued Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the income statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
The Group designates its derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges.
A derivative is presented as a noncurrent asset or a noncurrent liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more thantwelve months and it is not expected to be realised or settled withintwelve months.
Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and thehedged item, along with the risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions.
Atthe inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is usedin a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair values of cashflows of the hedged item.
Derivative instruments are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently measured to their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity.
The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement as investment revenue or finance costs respectively.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the income statement, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity atthat time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Groups use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups financial policies.
Further details on these policies can be found in the Strategic Report on page 36.
Fair values The fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value.
The Group determines the fair value of its financial instruments using market prices for quoted instruments and widely accepted valuation techniques for other instruments.
Valuation techniques include discounted cashflows, standard valuation models based on market parameters, dealer quotes for similar instruments and use of comparable arms length transactions.
Revenue Revenue represents the fair value of amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of business net of discounts, VAT and other salesrelated taxes.
Revenue is recognised on completion of an event.
Billings and cash received in advance, and directly attributable costs relating to future events are deferred.
The amounts so deferred are included in the balance sheet as deferred event income and prepaid event costs respectively.
Losses anticipated at the balance sheet date are provided in full.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rateapplicable.
Income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Barter transactions Where barter transactions occur between advertising and exhibition space and the revenue can be measured reliably, revenues and costs are recognised in the income statement.
operating profit Operating profit is stated after the share of results of associates & joint ventures and profit or loss on disposal of Group undertakings and before investment income and finance costs.
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 88 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 2 Basis of accounting continued headline pretax profit Headline pretax profit is a non statutory measure of performance used by the Group.
It is defined as profit or loss from operations before tax expense not including amortisation of acquired intangibles, impairment of goodwill, profits or losses arising on disposal of Group undertakings, revaluation of financial liabilities in relation to put options over non controlling interests, imputed interest charges on discounted put option liabilities, gains or losses on the settlement of contingent consideration, direct costs on completed and pending acquisitions and disposals and tax on income from associates and joint ventures.
taxation The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The current tax is based on the taxable profit for the year using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets andliabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and isaccounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that does not affect the tax profit or the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset isrealised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends tosettle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or their contractual rate where applicable.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date.
Non monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rateprevailing at the date the fair value was determined.
Non monetary items that are measured in terms of historical costin aforeign currency are not retranslated.
Gains and losses arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in income for the period.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation ofnon monetary items carried at fair value are included in income for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non monetary items in respect of which gains or losses are recognised directly in equity.
For such nonmonetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
Details of the Groups accounting policies for forward contracts and options are included in the policy on derivative financial instruments.
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during the period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transaction are used.
Exchange differences arising are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expense in the period in which theoperation is disposed of.
Under the exemption permitted from IAS 21 the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations prior to 1 October 2004 have been treated as zero.
Consequently, any gain or loss ondisposal will exclude translation differences that arose prior to 1 October 2004.
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 89 Financial statements Notes to the coNsolIdated accouNts coNtiNued For the year ended 30 september 2013 2 Basis of accounting continued Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
employee share trust The financial statements include the assets and liabilities of the Employee Share Trust ESOT.
Shares in the Company heldby the ESOT have been valued at cost and are held in equity.
The costs of administration of the ESOT are written offtoprofit or loss as incurred.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any net consideration received is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
share based payments The Group has applied IFRS 2 share based payment.
IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equitysettled share based payments to certain employees.
These are measured at fair value excluding the effect of nonmarketbased vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equitysettled share based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of nonmarketbased vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a BlackScholes model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, for the effects of nontransferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations based on managements best estimate.
leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Benefits received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.
critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, the following judgements and assumptions have been made by management and have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements or have the most risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year: impairment of goodwill and intangible assets Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of cashgenerating units to which goodwill or intangible assets have been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires an estimation of future cashflows expected from the cashgenerating unit to perpetuity and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The period used in the calculation is based on managements average expectation of the period over which the value will be derived from the cash generating units.
The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets at 30 September 2013 is 78.6 million and 43.7 million respectively.
Acquired intangible assets The valuation of acquired intangible assets requires management to estimate the net present value of the additional future cashflows arising from customer relationships, trademarks and licences and visitor databases to determine the value of those intangible assets.
The key assumptions used in estimating the net present value of the additional future cashflows are the discount rate, royalty rate, attrition rate and the period over which the intangible assets affect future cashflows.
intangible asset useful economic lives The life of an intangible asset is estimated by management based on the expected period over which cashflows generated from that asset will arise.
The amortisation charge reflected in the financial statements is directly impacted by the estimation of useful lives by management.
Share based payments The Group makes share based payments to certain employees.
These payments are measured at their estimated fair value at the date of grant, calculated using an appropriate option pricing model.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
The key assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the options are the discount rate, the Groups share price volatility, dividend yield, risk free rate of return, and expected option lives.
Management regularly performs a trueup of theestimate of the number of shares that are expected to vest: this is dependent on the anticipated number of leavers.
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 90 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 2 Basis of accounting continued taxation Being a multinational Group with tax affairs in many geographic locations inherently leads to a tax structure which makes the degree of estimation and judgement more challenging.
The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Group and is often dependent on the efficiency of legal processes.
Such issues can take several years to resolve.
The Group takes a considered view of unresolved issues, however the inherent uncertainty regarding these items means that the eventual resolution could differ significantly from the accounting estimates and therefore impact the Groups results and future cashflows.
3 segmental information IFRS 8 introduces the term Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The Senior Management Board comprising Russell Taylor Chief Executive Officer, Neil Jones Group Financial Director, Stephen Keen, Alexander Shtalenkov, Nik Rudge, Colette Tebbutt, Suzanne King and Jane Stables is considered to be the CODM.
ITEs reportable segments are strategic business units that are based in different geographic locations, predominantly inthe developing and emerging markets.
Each business unit is managed separately and has a different marketing strategy as determined by the local management.
The products and services offered by each business unit are identical across theGroup.
The Group evaluates the performance of its segments on the basis of headline pretax profit and operating profit.
See note 2 for more details.
The revenue and profit before taxation are attributable to the Groups one principal activity, the organisation of trade exhibitions, conferences and related activities and can be analysed by geographic segment as follows.
No individual customer amounts to more than 10% of Group revenues.

The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2013 2012 000 000 UK & Western Europe 7,662 7,692 Central Asia & Caucasus 7,968 6,680 Russia 41,015 41,446 Eastern & Southern Europe 15,976 18,296 Asia 5,954 2,195 78,575 76,309 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to cashflows during the period.
Management estimates discount rates that reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the cashgenerating units.
The growth rates are based on management forecasts.
The Group prepares cashflow forecasts based upon the most recent financial plans approved by the Board and extrapolates the planned cashflows.
Assumed growth rates based on GDP growth rates in the local markets and management judgements have been applied for the first three years beyond the detailed plans and a rate of between 2% and 7% is applied thereafter.
These rates do not exceed the average longterm growth rate for the businesses in the relevant markets.
The pretax discount rates applied to the cash generating units are between 13% and 15%.
The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the discount rate and growth rates used.
Management believes that noreasonable potential change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis taking into consideration the impact on key impairment test assumptions arising from a range of possible trading and economic scenarios.
The scenarios have been performed separately for each CGU with the sensitivities summarised as follows: An increase in the discount rate by 1%.
A decrease of 5% on forecast cashflows over the term for all CGUs.
The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairment would result from either an increase in the discount rate or a decrease inforecast cashflows.

Financial risk management In the course of its business, the Group is exposed to a number of financial risks: market risk including foreign currency and interest rate, credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk.
This note presents the Groups exposure to each of the above risks.
The Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risks can be found in the Strategic report on page 38.
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
TheBoard has established policies to identify and analyse risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk.
Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis.

These arrangements are designed to address significant exchange exposures for the next 36 months and are renewed on a revolving basis as required, subject to not committing the Group to less than six months or more than 36 months in the future.
At 30 September 2013, the fair value of these derivatives is estimated to be a net liability of approximately 0.4 million 2012: net asset of 4.2 million.
These amounts are based on market valuations.
The Group has taken out foreign currency overdrafts in Euros and US Dollars to act as a natural hedge against certain currency trade receivable balances.
These borrowings have not been designated as hedging instruments by management.
Allforeign exchange movements on these borrowings and trade receivables are recognised directly in the income statement.
Interest rate risk management As the Group has no significant interestbearing assets, other than cash, the Groups income and operating cashflows aresubstantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk through its borrowings at floating interest rates.
This risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate level of floating interest rate borrowings.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed inthe liquidity risk section of this note.

The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, venue advances and derivative financial instruments.
These represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.
The Group has adopted a policy of onlydealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
The Groups objective is to ensure all customers have paid before any service is provided to them.
The concentration of credit risk islimited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
The ageing profile of the Groups trade receivables and the details of the Groups allowances for doubtful receivables canbe seen below.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments arises due to where the liquid funds are held.
The territories in which ITE operates do not always have banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies such as Moodys and Fitch.
The Group aims to minimise the exposure to credit risk by minimising the level of cash held in such banks.
The Groups exposure and credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value oftransactions concluded is spread amongst approved financial institutions.

The Group raise invoices on events using stage payments.
Any overdue amounts, after the stage payment due date, are reviewed andchased.
Management also review the debts due based on when an event has taken place, as this is typically when theservice is provided.
Both measures are included in the table above as both are used by management to manage outstanding debts.
The trade receivables amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated bythe Groups management based on prior experience, specific credit issues and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across diverse industries and geographical areas and the Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including default risk of the industry and country, in which the customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk.
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 108 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 21 Financial instruments continued The Group establishes an allowance for doubtful debts that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade receivables when there is objective evidence that the debt will not be collected in full.
The allowance is recognised and measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of future cashflows.
Where material, itisdiscounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
The main component of this allowance is a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposure on shows which have taken place but the debt has not been collected in full.
This allowance is determined by reference to the specific circumstances of each show and past experience.
The details of the movement in the allowance for doubtful receivables are shown below.

liquidity risk management Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its obligations as they fall due.
Such risk may result from inadequate market depth or disruption or refinancing problems.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors.
They have built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and longterm funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by ensuring continuity of funding for operational needs through cash deposits and debt facilities as appropriate.
capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of theGroup consists of cash and cash equivalents, bank overdraft and bank loan which is disclosed in note 17 and note 18 and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 23 and in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.

No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses in either year due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
These losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 46.1 million 2012: 39.7 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
