Our assessment of risks of material misstatement In arriving at our audit opinion above, our strategy was to apply increasing audit procedures in proportion to increasing risk of material misstatement of the financial statements.
To conduct our risk assessment, we considered the inherent risks facing the Group and the parent company, including those arising from the respective business models, and how the Group controls those risks.
In doing so, we considered a number of factors including: the Groups ability to continue as a going concern: the risk of fraud: the design and implementation of the Groups control environment: and the risk of management override of key controls.
We revisited our risk assessment after testing the operating effectiveness of a number of the Groups key controls including internal controls over financial reporting and specific anti-fraud controls as well as testing the basis of the going concern assumption.
We also considered the inherent need for the directors to make and appropriately disclose judgements when preparing the financial statements.
