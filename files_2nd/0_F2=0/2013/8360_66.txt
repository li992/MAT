BAsIs oF prepArAtIon AnD ACCountInG polICIes BAsIs oF prepArAtIon The Interserve Plc consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and comply with the IFRS and related Interpretations SIC and IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the European Union.
Adoption of new and revised standards In the current year, the following new and revised standards and interpretations have been adopted and affected the amounts reported in these financial statements: Amendments to IAs 1 Presentation of financial statements The amendments to IAS 1 entitled Presentation of items of other comprehensive income have increased the required level of disclosure within the statement of comprehensive income, by separating items that will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss from those that could be reclassified.
The presentation of items of other comprehensive income has been restated.
There is no impact on profit or loss and total comprehensive income.
IAs 19 revised Employee benefits The key impact of IAS 19 Revised is the removal of the separate assumptions for expected return on plan assets and discounting of scheme liabilities, replacing them with one single discount rate for the net deficit.
These financial statements are the first in which the Group has adopted IAS 19 Revised, which has been applied retrospectively.
As the Group has always recognised actuarial gains and losses immediately, there is no effect on prior periods defined benefit obligation and balance sheet disclosure.
For the year ended 31 December 2013, the consolidated income statement is 4.1 million lower and the statement of comprehensive income is 4.1 million higher than it would have been prior to the adoption of IAS 19 Revised, and for the year ended 31 December 2012, the consolidated income statement is 2.5 million lower and the statement of comprehensive income is 2.5 million higher than it would have been prior to the adoption of IAS 19 Revised.
Earnings per share for 2013 and 2012 are 3.1p lower and 1.9p lower, respectively, than they would have been prior to adoption.
The following standards do not materially impact the Group: IFrs 7 amended Financial instruments: disclosures IFrs 13 Fair value measurement IAs 12 amended Deferred tax: recovery of underlying assets IFrs 1 amended Government loans IAs 36 amended Recoverable amount disclosures for non-financial assets At the date of authorisation of these Group financial statements, the following standards and interpretations were in issue but not yet effective, and therefore have not been applied in these Group financial statements: IFrs 9 Financial instruments IFrs 10 amended Consolidated financial statements IFrs 11 Joint arrangements IFrs 12 Disclosures of interests in other entities IAs 27 revised Separate financial statements IAs 28 revised Investments in associates and joint ventures IAs 32 amended Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities IFrs 10, IFrs 12 and IAs 27 amended Investment entities IFrs 10, IFrs 11 and IFrs 12 amended Consolidated financial statements, Joint arrangements and Disclosure of interests in other entities IAs 39 amended Novation of derivatives and continuation of hedge accounting The impact of the sections of IFRS 9 currently issued will result in the Groups project finance interests that are currently treated by the joint-venture companies as being available-for-sale, being treated as a debt carried at fair value through profit or loss or amortised cost.
As a result, movements in the fair value will no longer be taken to other comprehensive income.
Except for IFRS 9 above, the directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
