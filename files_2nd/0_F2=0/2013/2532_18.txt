ii We previously recognised the benefit arising from the zero rated VAT treatment on a small portion of customer revenue attributable to the Sky magazine.
Following closure of the magazine we have restated the comparatives to present on a like-for-like basis.
iii Following our decision to close the Sky customer magazine, a one-off timing upside was reversed which related to revenue recognition of the magazine element of subscription revenue.
This equated to a 7 reduction to ARPU in 2011.
