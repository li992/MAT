31 Financial risk management The company and Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including: market risk including foreign currency risk and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures.
Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis except for credit risk relating to accounts receivable balances which each entity is responsible for managing.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, as well as credit exposures to Wholesale and to a lesser extent Retail customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For Wholesale customers, management assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors.
For those sales considered higher risk, the Group operates a policy of cash in advance of sale.
Sales to Retail customers are settled in cash, major credit cards or by PayPal.
The Group regularly monitors its exposure to bad debts in order to minimise exposure.
Credit risk from cash and cash equivalents is managed via banking with well-established banks with a strong credit rating.

The Group is mainly exposed to US Dollar and Euro currency risks.
The exposure to foreign exchange risk within each company is monitored and managed at Group level.
The Groups policy is to economic hedge a portion of foreign exchange risk associated with forecast overseas transactions, and transactions and monetary items denominated in foreign currencies.
The Groups policy is to hedge the risk of changes in the relevant spot exchange rate.
The Group uses forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange risk.
As at 28 April 2013 and 29 April 2012, the Group had entered into a number of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge part of the aforementioned translation risk.
Any remaining amount remains unhedged.
Forward exchange contracts have not been formally designated as hedges and consequently no hedge accounting has been applied.
Forward exchange contracts are valued at fair value.
Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Groups foreign operations are not hedged.
At 28 April 2013 if the currency had weakened strengthened by 10% against both the US Dollar and Euro with all other variables held constant, profit for the period would have been 1.8m 2012: 1.6m higher lower, mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains losses on translation of US Dollar Euro trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and trade payables.
The Groups foreign currency exposure is as follows: Group 2013 2012 US Dollar Euro US Dollar Euro m m m m Financial assets Trade receivables 0.4 14.2 2.0 Cash and cash equivalents 5.7 6.3 8.6 9.0 Assets 6.1 20.5 8.6 11.0 Financial liabilities Trade payables 1.8 6.9 2.1 2.9 Liabilities 1.8 6.9 2.1 2.9 Net exposure 4.3 13.6 6.5 8.1 The US Dollar and Euro overdrafts form part of an offset arrangement and as such each currency is netted off against other cash balances in the same currency and is not recognised as an overdraft in its own right.
Cash flow interest rate risk The Group has financial assets and liabilities which are exposed to changes in market interest rates.
Changes in interest rates impact primarily on deposits, loans and borrowings by changing their future cash flows variable rate.
Management does not currently have a formal policy of determining how much of the Groups exposure should be at fixed or variable rates and the Group does not use hedging instruments to minimise its exposure.
However, at the time of taking new loans or borrowings management uses its judgement to determine whether it believes that a fixed or variable rate would be more favourable for the Group over the expected period until maturity.
Sensitivity analysis has not been provided due to the low level of loans and borrowings within the Group.
The Groups significant interest-bearing assets and liabilities are disclosed in notes 24 and 25.

Trading derivatives are classified as a current asset or liability.

Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders, and benefits for other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital employed.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including current and noncurrent borrowings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.
Total capital employed is calculated as equity as shown in the consolidated balance sheet plus net debt.
The Group is in a net cash position at 28 April 2013.
The Directors have concluded that the company is best served by retaining current cash reserves to support growth.
Consequentially, a recommendation will be made to the AGM that no dividend is payable for 2013 2012: nil.
