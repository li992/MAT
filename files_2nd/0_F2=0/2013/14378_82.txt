The Group has voluntarily disclosed to the US Veterans Administration and the US Department of Defense that a small percentage of the products sold to the US government in the past, primarily from the orthopaedics business, may have originated from countries that are not eligible for such sales except with government consent.
Government auditors subsequently conducted an on-site visit at the Groups orthopaedics business.
In December 2008, three months after Smith & Nephews initial voluntary disclosure, a whistle-blower suit was filed in the US district court for the Western District of Tennessee alleging these violations.
Smith & Nephews motion to dismiss the suit was denied in November 2010.
18 Retirement benefit obligations ACCOUNTING POLICY The Groups major pension plans are of the defined benefit type.
A defined benefit pension plan defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, which is dependent on various factors such as age, years of service and final salary.
The Groups obligation is calculated separately for each plan by discounting the estimated future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
The fair value of any plan assets is deducted to arrive at the net liability.
The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is performed annually by external actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Re-measurements arising from defined benefit plans comprise actuarial gains and losses and the return on the plan assets net of the costs of managing the plan assets.
The Group recognises these immediately in other comprehensive income OCI and all other expenses, such as service cost, net interest cost, administration costs and taxes, are recognised in the income statement.
A number of key assumptions are made when calculating the fair value of the Groups defined benefit pension plans.
These assumptions impact the balance sheet asset and liabilities, operating profit and finance income costs.
The most critical assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of inflation and mortality assumptions to be applied to future pension plan liabilities.
The discount rate is based on the yield at the reporting date on bonds that have a credit rating of AA, denominated in the currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid and have a maturity profile approximately the same as the Groups obligations.
In determining these assumptions management take into account the advice of professional external actuaries and benchmarks its assumptions against external data.
The Group determines the net interest expense income on the net defined benefit liability asset for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit liability asset.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution plans.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group and employees pay fixed contributions to a third party financial provider.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.

Funded plans are funded by the payment of contributions and the assets are held by separate trust funds or insurance companies.
In countries where there is no Company-sponsored pension plan, state benefits are considered by management to be adequate.
Employees retirement benefits are the subject of regular management review.
The Groups defined benefit plans provide employees with an entitlement to retirement benefits varying between 1.3% and 66.7% of final salary on attainment of retirement rage.
The level of entitlement is dependent on the year of service of the employee.
The Groups two major defined benefit pension plans are in the UK and US.
Both these plans were closed to new employees in 2003 and defined contribution plans are offered to new joiners.
The UK Plan operates under trust law and responsibility for its governance lies with a Board of Trustees.
This Board is composed of representatives of the Group, plan participants and an independent trustee who act on behalf of members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed and Rules and relevant legislation.
The UK Plans assets are held by the trust.
Annual increases on benefits in payment are dependent on inflation.
The main uncertainties affecting the level of benefits payable under the UK Plan are future inflation levels including the impact of inflation on future salary increase and the actual longevity of the membership.
Smith & Nephew ANNuAl report 2013 132 FiNANCiAl StAtemeNtS Notes to the Group accounts continued 18 Retirement benefit obligations continued The US Plan is governed by a US Pension Committee which is composed of both plan participants and representatives of the Group.
In the US, the Pension Protection Act 2006 established both a minimum required contribution and a maximum deductible contribution.
Failure to contribute at least the minimum required amount will subject the Company to significant penalties and contributions in excess of the maximum deductible have negative tax consequences.
The minimum funding requirement is intended to fully fund the present value of accrued benefits over seven years.

The US and UK plan assets are invested in a diversified range of industries across a broad range of geographies.
These assets include liability matching assets and annuity policies purchased by the trustees of each plan, which aim to match the benefits to be paid to certain members from the plan and therefore remove the investment, inflation and demographic risks in relation to those liabilities.
In January 2013, the UK Plan, in order to minimise longevity and interest risk, purchased an insurance contract with Rothesay Life covering a subset of the UK Plan pensioner liabilities.
The terms of this policy means that it exactly matches the amount and timing of the pensioner obligations covered by the contract.
In accordance with IAS19, the fair value of the insurance contract is deemed to be the present value of the related obligations which is discounted at the AA corporate bond rate.

Of this cost recognised for the year, $40 million 2012 $40m, 2011 $42m relates to the defined benefit plan and $32m 2012 $32m, 2011 $29m relates to defined contributions.
The cost charged in respect of the Groups defined contribution plans represents contributions payable to these plans by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
These were charged to operating profit in selling, general and administrative expenses.
There were $nil outstanding payments as at 31 December 2013 due to be paid over to the plans 2012 $nil, 2011 $nil.
Defined benefit plan costs comprise service cost which is charged to operating profit in selling, general and administrative expenses and net interest cost and administration costs and taxes which are reported as other finance costs.

The UK uses the S1NA with projections in line with the CMI 2011 table and the US uses the RP2000 table with scale AA.
The current longevities underlying the values of the obligations in the defined benefit plans are as follows: 2013 2012 2011 years years years Life expectancy at age 60 UK Plan: Males 29.3 28.7 28.6 Females 31.1 30.2 30.2 US Plan: Males 23.8 22.9 22.8 Females 25.5 25.0 25.0 Life expectancy at age 60 in 20 years time UK Plan: Males 32.2 31.2 31.0 Females 33.2 31.9 31.8 US Plan: Males 23.8 24.6 24.5 Females 25.5 25.0 25.0 18.6 Sensitivity analysis The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is sensitive to the assumptions used.
The following table summarises the increase decrease on the UK and US defined benefit obligation and pension costs as a result of reasonably possible changes in some of the assumptions while holding all other assumptions consistent.
The sensitivity to the inflation assumption change includes corresponding changes to the future salary increases and future pension increase assumptions.
The analysis does not take into account the full distribution of cash flows expected under the plan.

A decrease in the bond yield will increase the measure of plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by increases in the value of matching plan assets such as bonds and insurance contracts.
Inflation risk The UK Plan is linked to inflation.
A high rate of inflation will lead to a higher liability.
This risk is managed by holding inflation-linked bonds and an inflation-linked insurance contract in respect of some of the obligation.
Investment risk If the return on plan assets is below the discount rate, all else being equal, there will be an increase in the plan deficit.
In the UK, this risk is partially managed by holding bonds and a bulk annuity, together with a dynamic fide-risking policy to switch growth assets into bonds over time.
In 2013, the US Pension committee implemented a dynamic fide-risking policy to shift plan assets into longer term stable asset classes.
The policy established ten pre-determined funded status levels and when each trigger point is reached, the plan assets are re-balanced accordingly.
Longevity risk The present value of the plans defined benefit liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of the plan participants both during and after their employment.
An increase in the life expectancy of plan participants above that assumed will increase the benefit obligation.
The UK Plan, in order to minimise longevity risk, entered into an insurance contract which covers a portion of pensioner obligations.
Salary risk The calculation of the defined benefit obligation uses the future estimated salaries of plan participants.
Increases in the salary of plan participants above that assumed will increase the benefit obligation.
18.8 Funding A full valuation is performed by actuaries for the Trustees of each plan to determine the level of funding required.
Employer contributions rates, based on these full valuations, are agreed between the trustees of each plan and the Group.
The assumptions used in the funding actuarial valuations may differ from those assumptions above.
Employees are required to contribute to the plans.
UK Plan The most recent full actuarial valuation of the UK Plan was undertaken as at 30 September 2012.
These valuations are performed every two years with the next scheduled for 30 September 2014.
This included supplementary payments of $31m 2012 $30m, 2011 $29m.
The Group has agreed to pay the supplementary payments each year until 2017.
The agreed supplementary contributions for 2014 are $31m.
US Plan Full actuarial valuations are performed annually for the US Plan with the last undertaken as at 20 September 2013.
Contributions to the US Plan were $20m 2012 $27m, 2011 $30m which included supplementary payments of $17m.
The agreed contributions for 2014 are $26m.
18.9 Post balance sheet event On 7 February 2014, the Group announced its intention to close the US Pension Plan to future accrual with effect from 31 March 2014.
The Group expects to recognise a gain in 2014 as a result of the closure, but due to the member consultation period currently underway, is unable to calculate the precise past service cost adjustment.
However, it is estimated that the gain will not be material.
The effect of the closure has not been recognised as at 31 December 2013.
