Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements 1.
GENERAL INFORMATION G4S plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The consolidated fi financial statements incorporate the fi financial statements of the company and entities its subsidiaries controlled by the company collectively comprising the group and the groups interest in associates and jointly controlled entities made up to 31 December each year.
The group operates throughout the world and in a wide range of functional currencies, the most signifi cant being the euro, the US dollar and sterling.
The groups fi financial statements are presented in sterling, as the groups primary listing is in the UK.
The address of the registered offi ce is given on page 160.
STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE The consolidated fi financial statements of the group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union adopted IFRSs.
The company has elected to prepare its parent company fi financial statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
These are presented on pages 142 to 150.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Basis of preparation The consolidated fi financial statements of the group have been prepared under the going concern basis and using the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain non-current assets and fi financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Judgements made by the directors in the application of these accounting policies which have a signifi cant effect on the fi financial statements, and estimates with a signifi cant risk of material adjustment, are discussed in note 4.
The directors are confi dent that, after making enquiries and on the basis of current fi financial projections and available facilities, they have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Further information on the going concern assessment is given in note 32 on pages 124 to 127.
In preparing the fi financial statements the notes to the accounts have been presented with regard to the principles set out in the Financial Reporting Councils publication Cutting Clutter to make the fi financial statements easier to follow and more intuitive to provide readers with a clearer understanding of the fi financial performance of the group.
The comparative income statement for the year ended 31 December 2012 has been re-presented for operations qualifying as discontinued during the current year.
Revenue from continuing operations has been reduced by 273m and PBT has decreased by 7m compared to the fi gures published previously.
Further details of discontinued operations are presented within note 7.
In addition, the comparative consolidated statement of fi financial position as at 31 December 2012 has been restated to refl ect the completion during 2013 of the initial accounting in respect of acquisitions made during 2012.
Adjustments made to the provisional calculation of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired amount to 15m, with an equivalent decrease in the reported value of goodwill.
The impact of these adjustments on the net assets acquired is presented in note 17. b Changes in presentation of the income statement During the year the group has enhanced its presentation of business performance by separately disclosing underlying results.
Underlying results exclude specifi c items and for the prior year re-present the effect of one-off credits relating to fair value and other provision releases.
The groups income statement and segmental analysis note separately identify results before specifi c items.
Specifi c items are those that in managements judgement need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.
In determining whether an event or transaction is specifi c, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence.
Specifi c items include items relating to acquisitions and disposals including amortisation and impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets, discontinued operations, restructuring costs and impairments and other one-off items such as the review of the carrying value of assets and liabilities performed in 2013 or the impact of the Olympics contract in the prior year.
This is consistent with the way that fi financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board and assists in providing a meaningful analysis of the underlying results of the group.
The directors believe that presentation of the groups results in this way is relevant to an understanding of the groups fi financial performance, as specifi c items are identifi ed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.
Any reversal arising from a recovery of previously impaired assets will also fl ow through specifi c items such that the underlying results refl ect the ongoing recurring results of the business.
Specifi c items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Specifi c items for the current and prior years are disclosed in note 8. c Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the group.
Control is achieved where the group has the power to govern the fi financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefi ts from its activities, determined either by the groups ownership percentage, or by the terms of any shareholder agreement.
In the case of certain investments detailed analysis of the different contracts in place is required, together with a level of judgement, to ascertain whether there is control under the defi nition of IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements see note 4.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired business are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
The cost of acquisition is measured as the acquisition date fair value of the assets transferred as consideration to the vendor and does not include transaction costs.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifi able net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any defi ciency in the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifi able net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the year of acquisition.
98 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial statements The cost of acquisition includes the present value of deferred and contingent consideration payable, including that in respect of put options held by non-controlling shareholders, as estimated at the date of acquisition.
For acquisitions prior to 1 January 2010 subsequent changes to the present value of the estimate of contingent consideration and any difference upon fi final settlement of such a liability are recognised as adjustments to the cost of acquisition.
For acquisitions after 1 January 2010 such changes are recognised in the income statement with respect to contingent consideration and in other comprehensive income with respect to put options.
Non-controlling interests are stated at their proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
Profi ts and losses are applied in the proportion of their respective ownership to the interest of the parent and to the non-controlling interest.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of control or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Joint ventures A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control, in that strategic, fi financial and operating decisions require the unanimous consent of the parties.
The groups interest in joint ventures is accounted for using the proportionate consolidation method, whereby the groups share of the results and assets and liabilities of a jointly-controlled entity is combined line by line with similar items in the groups consolidated fi financial statements.
Associates An associate is an entity over which the group is in a position to exercise signifi cant infl uence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the fi financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the groups consolidated fi financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in associates are carried in the consolidated statement of fi financial position at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the groups share of the net assets of the associates, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of the associates in excess of the groups interest in those associates are not recognised.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Where a group company transacts with a joint venture or associate of the group, profi ts and losses are eliminated to the extent of the groups interest in the relevant joint venture or associate.
d Foreign currencies The fi financial statements of each of the groups businesses are prepared in the functional currency applicable to that business.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities which are denominated in other currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on that date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value which are denominated in other currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items measured at historical cost denominated in other currencies are not retranslated.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement for the period.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the groups overseas operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on their acquisition, are translated into sterling at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expenses are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for the period unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rate prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income, together with exchange differences arising on monetary items that are in substance a part of the groups net investment in foreign operations and on borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments where and to the extent that the hedges are deemed to be effective.
On disposal, translation differences are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
e Derivative fi financial instruments and hedge accounting In accordance with its treasury policy, the group only holds or issues derivative fi financial instruments to manage the groups exposure to fi financial risk, not for trading purposes.
Such fi financial risk includes the interest risk on the groups variable-rate borrowings, the fair value risk on the groups fi xed-rate borrowings, commodity risk in relation to its diesel consumption and foreign exchange risk on transactions, on the translation of the groups results and on the translation of the groups net assets measured in foreign currencies.
The group manages these risks through a range of derivative fi financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, fi xed rate agreements, commodity swaps, commodity options, forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps.
Derivative fi financial instruments are recognised in the consolidated statement of fi financial position as fi financial assets or liabilities at fair value.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the derivatives qualify for hedge accounting.
Where derivatives do qualify for hedge accounting, the treatment of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged as described below.
Fair value hedge The change in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the related portion of the hedged item is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Cash fl ow and net investment hedges The change in the fair value of the portion of the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity and subsequently recycled to the income statement when the hedged cash fl ow or hedged net investment impacts the income statement.
The ineffective portion of the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 G4S plc 99 Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements continued 3.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED f Intangible assets Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by the application of the acquisition method.
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the groups interest in the fair value of the identifi able assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly-controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
No goodwill arises on the acquisition of an additional interest from a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary as this is accounted for as an equity transaction.
Goodwill is stated at cost, less any accumulated impairment losses, and is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that amounts may be impaired.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profi t or loss on disposal.
Acquisition-related intangible assets Intangible assets on acquisitions that are either separable or arising from contractual rights are recognised at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Such acquisition-related intangible assets include trademarks, technology, customer contracts and customer relationships.
The fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets is determined by reference to market prices of similar assets, where such information is available, or by the use of appropriate valuation techniques, including the royalty relief method and the excess earnings method.
Acquisition-related intangible assets are amortised by equal annual instalments over their expected economic life.
The directors review acquisition-related intangible assets on an ongoing basis and, where appropriate, provide for any impairment in value.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Trademarks and technology up to a maximum of fi five years Customer contracts and customer relationships up to a maximum of ten years Other intangible assets Development expenditure represents expenditure incurred in establishing new services and products of the group.
Such expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only if the following can be demonstrated: the expenditure creates an identifi able asset, its cost can be measured reliably, it is probable that it will generate future economic benefi ts, it is technically and commercially feasible and the group has suffi cient resources to complete development.
In all other instances, the cost of such expenditure is taken directly to the income statement.
Capitalised development expenditure is amortised over the period during which the expenditure is expected to be revenue-producing, up to a maximum of ten years.
The directors review the capitalised development expenditure on an ongoing basis and, where appropriate, provide for any impairment in value.
Research expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
Capitalised computer software is stated at cost, net of amortisation and any provision for impairment.
Amortisation is charged on software so as to write off the cost of the assets to their estimated residual values by equal annual instalments over their expected useful economic lives up to a maximum of eight years.
g Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment other than freehold land.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of the assets to their estimated residual values by equal annual instalments over their expected useful economic lives as follows: Freehold and long leasehold buildings up to 50 years Short leasehold buildings under 50 years over the life of the lease Equipment and motor vehicles 2 to 10 years Assets held under fi finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the expected useful economic life and the term of the relevant lease.
Where signifi cant, the residual values and the useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment are re-assessed annually.
h Financial instruments Financial assets and fi financial liabilities are recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.
Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry interest and are stated initially at their fair value.
The carrying amount of trade receivables is reduced through the use of a bad debt allowance account.
The group provides for bad debts based upon an analysis of those that are past due, in accordance with local conditions and past default experience.
Service concession assets Under the terms of a Private Finance Initiative PFI or similar project, the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset remain largely with the purchaser of the associated services.
In such cases, the groups interest in the asset is classifi ed as a fi financial asset and included at its discounted value within trade and other receivables, to the extent to which the group has an unconditional right to receive cash from the grantor of the concession for the construction of the asset.
To the extent that the group has the right to charge for the use of such an asset, conditional upon the extent of the use, the group recognises an intangible asset.
Current asset investments Current asset investments comprise investments in securities which are classifi ed as held-for-trading.
They are initially recognised at cost, including transaction costs, and subsequently measured at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement.
100 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial statements Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and that form an integral part of the groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash fl ow.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing bank overdrafts, loans and loan notes are recognised at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are recognised in the income statement on an accrual basis using the effective interest method.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated initially at fair value.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the group are recorded at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
i Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost represents expenditure incurred in the ordinary course of business in bringing inventories to their present condition and location and includes appropriate overheads.
Cost is calculated using either the weighted average or the fi first-in-fi first-out method.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
j Impairment The carrying value of the groups assets, with the exception of inventories and deferred tax assets, is reviewed on an ongoing basis for any indication of impairment and, if any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying value of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of any other asset, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine its recoverable amount.
The amount of the reversal is limited such that the assets carrying amount does not exceed that which would have been determined after depreciation and amortisation if no impairment loss had been recognised.
k Employee benefi ts Retirement benefi t costs Payments to defi ned contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Payments made to state-managed retirement benefi t schemes are dealt with as payments to defi ned contribution schemes where the groups obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defi ned contribution retirement benefi ts scheme.
The retirement benefi t obligation recognised in the consolidated statement of fi financial position represents the present value of the defi ned benefi t obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from the calculation is limited to unrecognised past service cost plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
For defi ned benefi t plans, the cost charged to the income statement consists of current service cost, net interest cost, and past service cost.
The fi finance element of the pension charge is shown in fi finance expense and the remaining service cost element is charged as a component of employee costs in the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses and other remeasurement gains and losses are recognised immediately in full through the statement of comprehensive income.
Share-based payments The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
The fair value of share-based payments is determined at the date of grant and expensed, with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
The amount expensed is adjusted over the vesting period for changes in the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest, save for changes resulting from any market-related performance conditions.
l Provisions and contingent liabilities Provisions are recognised when a present legal or constructive obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.
The amount recognised as a provision is the groups best estimate of the cost of settlement at the end of the reporting period.
In respect of claims and litigation, the group provides for anticipated costs where an outfl ow of resources is considered probable and a reasonable estimate can be made of the likely outcome.
For all risks, the ultimate liability may vary from the amounts provided and will be dependent upon the eventual outcome of any settlement.
Management exercise judgement in measuring the exposures to contingent liabilities see note 34 through assessing the likelihood that a potential claim or liability will arise and in quantifying the possible range of fi financial outcomes.
Where the time value of money is material, provisions are stated at the present value of the expected expenditure using an appropriate discount rate.
m Restructuring provision A restructuring provision is recognised when the group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it.
The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring, which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the entity.
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 G4S plc 101 Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements continued 3.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED n Revenue recognition Revenue Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business and is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue for manned security and cash solutions products and for recurring services in security systems products is recognised to refl ect the period in which the service is provided.
Revenue on security systems installations is recognised either on completion in respect of product sales, or in accordance with the stage of completion method in respect of construction contracts.
Construction contracts Where signifi cant, security system installations with a contract duration in excess of one month are accounted for as construction contracts.
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
This is measured either by the proportion that contract costs incurred for work to date bear to the estimated total contract costs or by the proportion that the sales value of work completed to date bears to the total sales value.
Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that it is likely that they will be agreed with the customer.
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred that are deemed likely to be recoverable.
Contract costs are recognised as expenses as they are incurred.
Where it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense in the income statement.
Construction contracts are recognised in the consolidated statement of fi financial position at cost plus profi t recognised to date, less provision for foreseeable losses and less progress billings.
o Pre-contract costs Pre-contract costs in respect of major outsourcing contracts incurred after the point at which the group achieves preferred bidder status at which point it is considered probable that the contract will be obtained are capitalised and expensed over the life of the contract subject to recoverability criteria.
Costs incurred prior to this point are expensed as incurred.
Capitalised costs are expensed immediately in the event that preferred bidder status is not followed by the award of the contract.
p Onerous contracts Onerous contract provisions are recognised for losses on contracts where the forecast costs of fulfi lling the contract throughout the contract period exceed the forecast income receivable.
Management plans to recover the position on loss-making contracts require a level of judgement and are only taken into account in the calculation of the onerous contract provision when implementation has commenced and tangible evidence exists of benefi ts being delivered.
The provision is calculated based on discounted cash fl ows to the end of the contract.
In-year losses from onerous contracts will continue to be reported in underlying earnings as they are incurred, whilst provisions for future losses on onerous contract provisions will be charged and unwound through specifi c items.
Vacant property provisions are recognised when the group has committed to a course of action that will result in the property becoming vacant.
The provision is calculated based on discounted cash fl ows to the end of the lease taking into account expected future sub-lease income.
q Interest Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
This is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the fi financial assets net carrying amount.
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the income statement.
r Income taxes Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity or other comprehensive income.
The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profi t for the year.
Taxable profi t differs from net profi t as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated fi financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profi t, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profi ts will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of each deferred tax asset is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that suffi cient taxable profi ts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is measured based on the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Tax liabilities or refunds may differ from those anticipated due to changes in tax legislation, differing interpretation of tax legislation and uncertainties surrounding the application of tax legislation.
In situations where uncertainty exists, provision is made for contingent tax liabilities and assets on the basis of management judgement following consideration of the available relevant information.
102 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial statements s Leasing Leases are classifi ed as fi finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
On occasion this classifi cation requires a level of judgement.
All other leases are classifi ed as operating leases.
Assets held under fi finance leases are recognised at the inception of the lease at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the consolidated statement of fi financial position as a fi finance lease obligation.
Lease payments made or received are apportioned between fi finance charges or income and the reduction of the lease liability or asset so as to produce a constant rate of interest on the outstanding balance of the liability or asset.
Rentals payable or receivable under operating leases are charged or credited to income on a straight-line basis over the lease term, as are incentives to enter into operating leases.
t Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets and disposal groups classifi ed as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classifi ed as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
The group must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classifi cation.
A discontinued operation is a component of the groups business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale that has been disposed of, has been abandoned or meets the criteria to be classifi ed as held for sale.
u Dividend distribution Dividends are recognised as distributions to equity holders in the period in which they are paid or approved by the shareholders in general meeting.
v Adoption of new and revised accounting standards and interpretations In the year ended 31 December 2013, the group adopted the following new standards and amendments: As a result of the amendment to IAS 19 2011, the group has changed its accounting policy with respect to the basis for determining the income or expense related to its post-employment defi ned benefi t plans.
The amendment makes changes to the recognition, measurement and disclosure of the defi ned benefi t expense, in particular requiring that the return on investment assets recognised in the income statement be calculated at the same interest rate as that used for calculating the fi finance cost on the obligations, and to the disclosures of employee benefi ts.
Pensions interest has therefore been restated for the change in calculation of the net pension interest charge, resulting in an additional 14m interest cost for the year ended 31 December 2013 and 7m additional interest cost for the year ended 31 December 2012.
The amendments also require that the group re-allocates pension administration costs from its previous classifi cation within fi finance income through other comprehensive income OCI to disclosing it within PBITA.
Current year and prior year PBITA has reduced by 3m as a result of this restatement.
As a result of the amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, the group has modifi ed the presentation of items of comprehensive income in its condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income, to present separately items that would be reclassifi ed to profi t or loss in the future from those that would never be reclassifi ed.
Comparative income has also been re-presented accordingly.
The adoption of the amendment to IAS 1 has no impact on the recognised assets, liabilities and comprehensive income of the group.
The group also adopted IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement during the year.
This has not resulted in any signifi cant impact on the groups results for the year ended 31 December 2013 or the year ended 31 December 2012.
The group has not adopted early any standard, amendment or interpretation.
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been announced but are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2013.
Those that are expected to have an impact on the group accounts are detailed below: IFRS 10 2011 Consolidated Financial Statements, which replaces parts of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements and all of SIC-12 Consolidation Special Purpose Entities, introduces a new control model that focuses on whether the group has power over an investee, exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and the ability to use its power to affect those returns.
This differs from the previous approach where one of the main criteria used to consolidate was to have the power to govern the fi financial and operating policies of the entity.
Apart from certain exceptions within the Asia Middle East region including certain business in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Qatar it is expected that under the terms of the existing shareholder agreements the remainder of the groups principal subsidiaries see note 43 will continue to be consolidated upon adoption of IFRS 10 2011.
Those entities which do not meet the IFRS 10 2011 criteria to be consolidated will be accounted for generally as joint ventures under the new IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements replaces IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and SIC-13 Jointly Controlled Entities Non-monetary Contributions by Vendors and removes the option to account for jointly controlled entities using the proportionate consolidation method.
Instead all jointly controlled entities will be accounted for using the equity method of accounting, similar to that used to account for associates under the current standards.
As the group currently applies the proportionate method of accounting to its jointly controlled entities this will impact the groups consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of fi financial position.
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 G4S plc 103 Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements continued 3.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Had the group applied IFRS 10 2011 and IFRS 11 to its accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 it would have had the following estimated impact on the groups consolidated income statement, statement of fi financial position and statement of cash fl ow.
Year ended 31 December 2013 Year ended 31 December 2012 As reported Adjustments New basis As reported Adjustments New basis m m m m m m Income statement Revenue 7,428 317 7,111 7,024 277 6,747 PBITA before specifi c items 442 32 410 470 27 443 PBT 314 27 287 353 15 338 Tax 75 2 73 83 83 PAT 239 25 214 270 15 255 Non-controlling interests 25 25 22 15 7 Profi t to equity holders 214 214 248 248 Statement of fi financial position Non-current assets 2,988 18 3,006 3,222 18 3,240 Current assets 2,364 167 2,197 2,388 147 2,241 Total assets 5,352 149 5,203 5,610 129 5,481 Current liabilities 1,684 74 1,610 1,408 80 1,328 Non-current liabilities 2,749 48 2,701 2,971 18 2,953 Total liabilities 4,433 122 4,311 4,379 98 4,281 Net assets 919 27 892 1,231 31 1,200 Non-controlling interests 52 27 25 55 31 24 Statement of cash fl ow Net cash fl ow from operating activities 400 42 358 287 41 246 Net cash fl ow from investing activities 163 30 133 195 14 181 Net cash fl ow from fi nancing activities 95 3 92 46 25 71 Net increase decrease in cash 142 9 133 138 2 136 Excluding specifi c items, amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets, goodwill impairment, acquisition-related expenses and profi t on disposal of assets and subsidiaries.
2012 results also exclude the impact of the Olympics contract.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interest in Other Entities is a new and comprehensive standard on disclosure requirements for all forms of interest in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off balance sheet vehicles.
The standard includes disclosure requirements for entities within the scope of IFRS 10 2011 and IFRS 11.
IFRS 10 2011, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 together form a suite of standards that are effective from 1 January 2013.
However they have been endorsed by the EU to be applied from 1 January 2014.
The group will therefore adopt all three standards for its fi financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014.
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES, JUDGEMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS The preparation of fi financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the groups accounting policies, which are described in note 3, with respect to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the fi financial statements, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the fi financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
These judgements, estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, including current and expected economic conditions, and in some cases, actuarial techniques.
Although these judgements, estimates and associated assumptions are based on managements best knowledge of current events and circumstances, the actual results may differ.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The judgements, estimates and assumptions which are of most signifi cance in preparing the groups 2013 accounts are detailed below: Review of the carrying value of assets and liabilities In 2013 the group carried out a review of the carrying value of its assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2012, taking into account any changes in facts or circumstances since that date.
The purpose of this review was to ensure that the fi financial statements were presented in a more balanced way.
This exercise required a level of judgement and in many cases taking a more balanced judgement based on the groups current understanding of circumstances surrounding each issue.
The results of the review are presented within specifi c items given the one-off nature of the review performed and are disclosed in note 8.
104 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial statements Contract portfolio review The group delivers outsourcing services that in some circumstances can be complex in nature and may be governed by unique contractual arrangements.
There is a risk that revenue recognition on these contracts is not in accordance with contractual entitlements and therefore provisions may be required to be recognised within contract provisions see note 34.
Estimates and judgements are therefore required to determine the appropriate level of provisioning applied to these contracts.
Compliance with foreign ownership rules and consolidation of subsidiaries The group has a diverse set of complex ownership structures, which are sometimes driven by local laws and regulations relating to foreign ownership.
In some instances the group operates through local structures with limited direct share ownership of the business but exercises control through shareholder agreements.
In determining whether some group entities qualify for consolidation under IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements, professional and legal advice is sought and a level of judgement is required.
Consolidation of any of these entities would be at risk if the groups ability to enforce its rights of control were successfully challenged.
Furthermore, as set out in note 3 v, following the adoption of IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements in 2014, the group expects to cease to consolidate some of these entities and will equity account for them.
Carrying value of goodwill The group tests tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that amounts may be impaired.
The impairment analysis for such assets is based principally upon discounted estimated future cash fl ows from the use and eventual disposal of the assets.
Such an analysis includes the estimation of future results, cash fl ows, annual growth rates and discount rates.
Judgement is required in relation to the achievability of the long-term business plan and macroeconomic assumptions underlying the valuation process.
In certain circumstances, where market prices can be ascertained for example through recent transactions, fair value less costs to sell is used as a basis for the recoverable amount.
This involves judgements and estimates to apply reasonable valuations techniques and to estimate future selling costs.
The full methodology and results of the groups impairment testing is presented in note 19.
Discontinued operations The group normally has business disposals underway at any reporting date.
There is a risk that any such businesses may not meet the accounting standards criteria for presentation as discontinued at the balance sheet date either because they are not a separate major line of business or there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of achieving the sale or the realisable value on disposal see note 7.
The latter requires a level of judgement due to the range of potential sale prices.
Taxation The group operates in many tax jurisdictions including countries where the tax legislation is not consistently applied and under some complex contractual circumstances where the responsibility for tax arising is not always clear.
Management are required to apply judgements and estimates to determine the appropriate amount of tax to provide for and any required disclosure around contingent tax liabilities at each period end.
Valuation of retirement benefi t obligations The valuation of defi ned retirement benefi t schemes is arrived at using the advice of qualifi ed independent actuaries who use the projected unit credit method for determining the groups obligations.
This methodology requires the use of a variety of assumptions and estimates, including the appropriate discount rate, the expected return on scheme assets, mortality assumptions, future service and earnings increases of employees and infl ation.
Full details of the groups retirement benefi t obligations, including an analysis of the sensitivity of the calculations to the key assumptions are presented in note 33.

OPERATING SEGMENTS The group operates on a worldwide basis and derives a substantial proportion of its revenue, PBITA and PBIT from each of the following six geographic regions: Africa, Asia Middle East, Latin America, Europe, North America and UK & Ireland.
For each of the reportable segments, the group executive committee the chief operating decision maker reviews internal management reports on a regular basis.
This presentation has been re-aligned during the year to more closely refl ect internal management reporting which is based on geographical regions.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Operations qualifying as discontinued in 2012 mainly comprised the cash and secure solutions businesses in Pakistan, which were disposed of in October 2012, the justice business in the United States of America, which was disposed of in April 2012, and the groups classifi ed US Government Solutions business.
The classifi ed US Government Solutions business is still included within discontinued operations as at 31 December 2013 as it was held for sale at that date.
Due to circumstances beyond the groups control, mainly relating to the impact on market sentiment arising out of political uncertainty culminating with the US Government shutdown in early October 2013, the sale process has been extended and has now taken over 12 months since the previous year end.
The sale process has progressed to a stage of negotiation with potential buyers and the group is confi dent a sale will be agreed in 2014.
Operations qualifying as discontinued in 2013 also included the groups cash business in Canada and the groups remaining business in Norway, both of which were sold in January 2014.

Share placing In August 2013 the group completed a 9.99% share placing which resulted in the weighted average number of shares for the year increasing to 1,452 million.
ACQUISITIONS Current year acquisitions The group undertook a number of business combinations in the current year including the acquisition of Deposita, a cash solutions business in South Africa.
A summary of the provisional fair value of net assets acquired by geographical location is presented below: Emerging Total Europe Markets group m m m Provisional fair value of net assets acquired of subsidiary undertakings 5 9 14 Goodwill 13 4 Total purchase consideration 612 18 The following table sets out the provisional fair value to the group in respect of all acquisitions made in the year: Fair value m Intangible assets 15 Property, plant and equipment 2 Deferred tax assets 2 Inventories 4 Trade and other receivables 3 Cash and cash equivalents 1 Trade and other payables 6 Borrowings 4 Deferred tax liabilities 3 Net assets acquired of subsidiary undertakings 14 Goodwill 4 Total purchase consideration paid in cash 18 Adjustments made to identifi able assets and liabilities on acquisition are to refl ect their fair value.
These include the recognition of customer-related intangible assets amounting to 12m.
The fair values of net assets acquired are provisional and represent estimates following a preliminary valuation exercise.
These estimates may be adjusted to refl ect any development in the issues to which they relate.
The goodwill arising on acquisitions can be ascribed to the existence of a skilled, active workforce, developed expertise and processes and the opportunities to obtain new contracts and develop the business.
None of these meet the criteria for recognition as intangible assets separable from goodwill.
No goodwill acquired in the year is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
From their respective dates of acquisition, the acquired businesses contributed 28m to revenues, 4m to PBITA and 3m to profi t for the part year they were under the groups ownership.
If all acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2013, group revenue would have been 7,434m, underlying PBITA would have been 443m and total loss for the year would have been 341m.

ACQUISITIONS CONTINUED Prior year acquisitions Principal acquisitions in subsidiary undertakings in the prior year included the purchase of a 100% interest in Vanguarda Segurana e Vigilncia Ltda Vanguarda, a security personnel, security systems and monitoring services provider in Brazil.
At 31 December 2012, the fair value adjustments made against net assets acquired were provisional.
The initial accounting in respect of acquisitions made during 2012 has since been fi nalised.
This resulted in fair value adjustments to acquired trade debtors increase of 9m, trade creditors decrease of 3m and provisions decrease of 3m with a resulting 15m decrease in the value of goodwill.
The net assets acquired and goodwill arising in respect of all acquisitions made in 2012 are as follows: Fair value m Intangible assets 31 Property, plant and equipment 1 Trade and other receivables 16 Cash and cash equivalents 17 Trade and other payables 19 Provisions 4 Borrowings 1 Deferred tax liabilities 9 Net assets acquired of subsidiary undertakings 32 Goodwill 61 Total purchase consideration 93 Adjustments made to identifi able assets and liabilities on acquisition are to refl ect their fair value.
These include the recognition of customer-related intangible assets amounting to 31m.
In the year of acquisition, in aggregate, the acquired businesses contributed 39m to revenues, 4m to PBITA and 1m to profi t for the part year they were under the groups ownership.
If all acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2012, group revenue would have been 7,264m, underlying PBITA would have been 472m and total profi t for the year would have been 64m.
Post balance sheet acquisitions No signifi cant acquisitions have been effected between the balance sheet date and the date that the fi financial statements were authorised for issue.
DISPOSAL OF SUBSIDIARIES During the current year the group disposed of its data solutions business in Colombia and its cash business in Slovakia.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED Goodwill allocation Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash-generating units CGUs which are expected to benefi t from that business combination.
The majority of the groups goodwill was generated by the merger of the security services businesses of Group 4 Falck and Securicor in 2004 which was accounted for as an acquisition of Securicor by Group 4 Falck.
Goodwill impairment testing The group tests tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that any of these assets may be impaired.
The annual impairment test is performed prior to the year end when the budgeting process is fi nalised and reviewed post year end.
The groups impairment test compares the carrying value of each CGU with its recoverable amount.
CGUs are identifi ed on a country level basis including signifi cant business units, as per the groups detailed management accounts.
Under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, an impairment is deemed to have occurred where the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying value.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is generally determined by its value in use which is derived from discounted cash fl ow calculations.
The key inputs to the calculations are described below.
Forecast cash fl ows All operating countries in the group are required to submit a budget for the next fi financial year for the current year test this is for the year ended 31 December 2014 and their strategic plan forecasts for the following two years in this case the years ended 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2016.
The revenue fi gures submitted as part of this exercise are used to derive a growth rate for the discounted cash fl ow calculation see the growth rate table below.
The group applies a 10% forecast risk to reduce revenue forecasts in each year to refl ect the uncertainties inherent in estimating future revenue streams.
Forecast cash fl ows are adjusted from year 4 onwards by applying a growth rate as detailed in the growth rate section, and discounted using specifi c risk-adjusted discount rates as described in the discount rate section.
Growth Rate Growth rates are determined from the budgeted and forecast revenue in years 1-3 and then projected using the lower of the forecast growth rate and the countrys nominal growth rate per the IMF to a terminal growth rate in year 15 of 1% for developed markets or 3% for emerging markets.
This is detailed in the table below: Growth assumptions Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Year 6 to 15 Terminal value Input Budget Forecast Forecast Projected to Projected to Projected to Estimate of residual year 5 at lower year 5 at lower year 15 growth: developed of forecast or of forecast or terminal growth 1%: emerging 3% country growth country growth Example 8% 7% 6% 5% 4% 4% to 1% 1% over 10 years Budgets and forecasts are reviewed by the group Board.
In the above example, budgeted year 1 growth rate is 8%, forecast growth in year 2 is 7% and in year 3 is 6%.
The country growth rate is 4% so the growth rate is reduced each year to reach 4% at year 5.
From year 6 the growth rate is then reduced over the next ten years to provide a terminal value growth of 1% the example is based on a developed market CGU.
Discount rate Discount rates are calculated for each CGU based on the relevant local risk-free rate adjusted for that CGUs specifi c risk-adjusted equity risk premium.
For the impairment test performed for the year ended 31 December 2013 the group has revised the calculation of the discount rates applied to certain CGUs.
This revision adjusts for the current low-interest rate environment by increasing abnormally low discount rates.
Details of how the other key discount rate inputs are derived are given below: Input How determined 31 Dec 2013 Risk free rate The risk free rate is generally obtained from the applicable governments 10 year gilt bond rates.
Where these are unavailable the group uses the closest available information eg shorter term gilt rates.
2.83% in UK UK equity risk premium The equity risk premium is determined for the UK by analysing a variety of sources including economic studies carried out by Barclays Capital and others.
5.0% in UK Operating country Specifi c local equity risk premiums are based on the UK risk premium adjusted for specifi c equity risk premium economic and fi financial risks.
The sources for these adjustments are the Institutional Investor Magazine and the IMF website as well as other studies by independent economists.
Leveraged beta Beta is a risk adjustment applied to the discount rate to refl ect the risk of the groups operating companies relative to the market as a whole.
The groups beta is obtained from 0.8 for the independent market studies and is adjusted for the appropriate leverage of the group.
group Tax rate Local tax rates are applied to each CGU to calculate pre-tax cost of equity.
23% in UK Debt margin The group applies a margin to the cost of debt for each CGU, with a higher margin applied to those CGUs operating in higher risk environments.
These margins range from 1.5% in less risky CGUs for example in the UK to 5-6% in more risky CGUs eg 5.5% in Yemen.
1.5% in UK Weighted average The weighted average cost of capital is calculated by weighting the cost of equity and the cost of capital cost of debt by the applicable debt:equity ratio at the year end.
45m of goodwill in respect of the cash solutions business in Canada was reclassifi ed as held for sale in 2013.
Within the UK, the most signifi cant CGUs and their goodwill carrying values are UK Care and Justice 247m, UK Cash Solutions 205m and UK Secure Solutions 102m.
Within the USA, the most signifi cant CGU is US Commercial Security Solutions with goodwill of 302m.
Impairment During the year ended 31 December 2013 impairment charges totalling 46m were recorded in respect of the groups goodwill, in the following countries: Goodwill Goodwill prepostimpairment Impairment impairment Growth rate Discount rate Democratic Republic of Congo 8 4 4 11.4% 42.7% Malawi 3 2 1 10.6% 50.0% Nigeria 9 4 5 13.6% 25.6% Brazil 122 24 98 8.0% 18.4% Ireland 17 5 12 4.2% 10.1% Other impaired 7 7 Non-impaired 1,846 1,846 Total 2,012 46 1,966 Lower of country growth rate per IMF and implied year 3 business forecast growth rate.
The impairment charge in Brazil was driven by losses incurred in the fi first half of the year in the technology business and a general downturn in trading.
The impairment in Ireland was as a result of the economic challenges in the country and the specifi c situation of the groups cash business.
Certain CGUs in Africa were impaired as a result of worsening economic and political circumstances in those countries.
Sensitivity to key assumptions The key assumptions used in the discounted cash fl ow calculations relate to the discount rates and growth rates used.
The table below shows the additional impairment that would arise from an increase in discount rates by 1% and 3% with all other variables being equal, for example taking the UK base rate from 8.6% to 9.6% and 11.6% or a decrease in growth rates by 1% and 3% with all other variables being equal, for example taking the UK growth rate from 4.3% to 3.3% and 1.3% for the group in total and for each of its signifi cant countries.

INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURES At the year end the group owned 59% of the equity of Bridgend Custodial Services Ltd.
The group jointly shares operational and fi financial control over the operations and is therefore entitled to a proportionate share of its results, which are consolidated on the basis of the equity shares held.
The groups correctional facilities in South Africa are under a similar arrangement other than that the groups holding is 20%.
During the year the group acquired a 50% share of the equity of Policity Limited, to construct and run a police training academy facility in Israel, which also operates under a similar arrangement.
The results of each of the jointly controlled operations are prepared in accordance with group accounting policies.
The way the group accounts for joint ventures will change in 2014 with the adoption of IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, as explained in note 3 v. In particular, the group will no longer account for joint ventures using the proportionate method and will instead apply the equity method.
Amounts proportionately consolidated into the groups fi financial statements are as follows: 2013 2012 Results m m Revenue 43 36 Expenses 39 32 Profi t after tax 4 4 2013 2012 Balance sheet m m Assets Non-current assets 22 16 Current assets 24 6 Liabilities Current liabilities 9 10 Non-current liabilities 32 7 Net assets 5 5 22.

TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES CONTINUED Credit risk on trade receivables There is limited concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables, as the groups customers are both large in number and dispersed geographically in 120 countries.
The groups largest customer is the UK Government which comprises approximately 13% 2012:10% of the total trade debtor balance as at 31 December 2013.
Group companies are required to follow the Group Finance Manual guidelines with respect to assessing the credit worthiness of potential customers.
These guidelines include processes such as obtaining approval for credit limits over a set amount, performing credit checks and assessments and obtaining additional security where required.
Credit terms vary across the group and can range from 0 to 90 days to refl ect the different risks within each country in which the group operates.
There is no group-wide rate of provision, and provision is made for debts that are past due according to local conditions and past default experience.
The movement in the allowance for doubtful debts is as follows: 2013 2012 m m At 1 January 46 67 Amounts written off during the year 20 28 Increase in allowance 13 7 At 31 December 39 46 The ageing of trade debtors, net of allowance for doubtful debts, is as follows: 2013 2012 m m Not yet due 887 890 1-30 days overdue 132 161 31-60 days overdue 27 70 61-90 days overdue 28 29 91-180 days overdue 38 26 181-365 days overdue 6 7 Over 365 days overdue 2 14 Net trade debtors 1,120 1,197 Included within not yet due in the prior year is 75m relating to the Olympics contract settlement.
No additional provision has been made on the above amounts as there has not been a signifi cant change in credit quality and the group believes that the amounts are still recoverable.
The group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The proportion of trade debtors at 31 December 2013 that were overdue for payment was 21% 2012: 26%.
The group-wide average age of all trade debtors at year end was 54 days 2012: 60 days.
The directors believe the fair value of trade and other receivables, being the present value of future cash fl ows, approximates to their book value.
CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS 2013 2012 Notes m m Amounts due from contract customers included in trade and other receivables 24 23 22 Amounts due to contract customers included in trade and other payables 30 2 2 Net balances relating to construction contracts 21 20 Contract costs incurred plus recognised profi ts less recognised losses to date 287 311 Less: progress billings 266 291 Net balances relating to construction contracts 21 20 At 31 December 2013, advances received from customers for contract work amounted to 4m 2012: 4m.

DISPOSAL GROUPS CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE At 31 December 2013, disposal groups classifi ed as held for sale primarily comprised the assets and liabilities associated with the classifi ed Government Solutions business in the United States of America see note 7, the groups business in Norway which was sold in January 2014 and the cash solutions business in Canada which was also sold in January 2014.
A further impairment charge of 80m has been applied to goodwill and other assets in the US Government Solutions business during the year.
At 31 December 2012, disposal groups classifi ed as held for sale primarily comprised the assets and liabilities associated with the classifi ed Government Solutions business in the United States of America, which were subject to a 35m impairment charge to goodwill in the prior year to write down their assets to their estimated recoverable value.

The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited because wherever possible and in accordance with Group Treasury policy, the cash is placed with bank counterparties that hold investment grade credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The group operates a multi-currency notional pooling cash management system which included over 140 group companies at 31 December 2013.
It is expected that the number of participants in the group will continue to grow.
The group met the conditions of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation allowing balances within this cash pool to be offset for reporting purposes.
At 31 December 2013 422m 2012: 360m of the cash balances and the equivalent amount of the overdraft balances were offset.
Cash and cash equivalents of 39m 2012: 27m are held by the groups wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries.
Their use is restricted to the settlement of claims against the groups captive insurance subsidiaries.

The weighted average interest rates on bank overdrafts, bank loans and loan notes at 31 December 2013 adjusted for hedging were as follows: 2013 2012 % % Bank overdrafts 1.1 1.5 Bank loans 3.5 3.5 Private loan notes 4.2 4.5 Public loan notes 4.3 4.2 The groups committed bank borrowings comprise a 1,100m multi-currency revolving credit facility with a maturity date of March 2016.
At 31 December 2013, undrawn committed available facilities amounted to 965m 2012: 856m.
Interest on all committed bank borrowing facilities is at prevailing Libor or Euribor rates, dependent upon the period of drawdown, plus an agreed margin, and re-priced within one year or less.
Borrowing at fl oating rates exposes the group to cash fl ow interest rate risk.
The management of this risk is discussed in note 32.
The group issued fi xed rate loan notes in the US Private Placement market totalling US$550m 332m on 1 March 2007.
The group issued further fi xed rate loan notes in the US Private Placement market totalling US$514m 310m and 69m on 15 July 2008.
$65m notes matured and were repaid on 15 July 2013, with the remaining notes maturing in July 2015 $150m, July 2016 25m, July 2018 $224m and 44m, and July 2020 $75m.
The group issued its inaugural public note of 350m using its European Medium Term Note Programme on 13 May 2009.
During 2012 the group issued two further public notes, a 600m note issued in May 2012 maturing May 2017 and a 500m note issued in December 2012 maturing December 2018.

FINANCIAL RISK Capital management On 28 August 2013 the group raised equity capital amounting to 348m before costs.
The net proceeds of 343m were used to reduce debt that was drawn on the groups 1.1bn bank facility.
In May 2013, Standard & Poors downgraded the groups long term credit rating to BBBNegative.
However, following the equity capital raising the groups rating was revised to BBBStable in September 2013.
The group intends to continue to manage its capital structure so that it retains an investment grade rating.
The groups policy is to maintain a net debt to EBITDA ratio to below 2.5 times.
At the end of 2013 the ratio was 2.6 times, before 89m of divestment proceeds received in January 2014.
It is expected the ratio will be within the target range in 2014.
The group is currently well fi nanced with 965m available and undrawn facilities from its committed 1.1bn bank facility.
It has no signifi cant maturity until March 2016 and has a medium to long term debt maturity profi le.
The group can access fi finance from the debt capital markets and the bank market.
Borrowings are principally in sterling, US dollars and euros refl ecting the geographies of signifi cant operational assets and profi ts.
124 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial statements Liquidity risk The group mitigates liquidity risk by ensuring there are suffi cient undrawn committed facilities available to it.
For more details of the groups bank overdrafts, bank loans and loan notes see note 28.
The percentage of available, but undrawn committed facilities during the course of the year was as follows: 31 December 2012 28% 31 March 2013 25% 30 June 2013 25% 30 September 2013 32% 31 December 2013 32% To reduce re-fi nancing risk, group treasury obtains fi finance with a range of maturities and hence minimises the impact of a single material source of fi finance terminating on a single date.
Re-fi nancing risk is further reduced by group treasury opening negotiations to either replace or extend any major medium term facility at least 12 months before its termination date.

126 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial statements Market risk Currency risk and forward foreign exchange contracts The group conducts business in many currencies.
Transaction risk is limited since, wherever possible, each business operates and conducts its fi nancing activities in local currency.
However, the group presents its consolidated fi financial statements in sterling and it is in consequence subject to foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the results and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The group hedges a substantial proportion of its exposure to fl uctuations in the translation into sterling of its overseas net assets by holding loans in foreign currencies.
Translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency loans are recognised in equity to match translation adjustments on foreign currency equity investments as they qualify as net investment hedges.
At 31 December 2013, the groups US dollar and euro net assets were approximately 82% and 59% respectively hedged by foreign currency loans 2012: US dollar 85%, euro 60%.
Cross currency swaps with a nominal value of 101m are in place hedging the foreign currency risk on US$200m of the second US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008, effectively fi xing the sterling value of this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.9750.
Cross currency swaps with a nominal value of 266m were arranged to hedge the foreign currency risk on 325m of the euro public notes issued in May 2012, effectively fi xing the sterling value of this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.2217.
Cross currency swaps with a nominal value of 284m were arranged to hedge the foreign currency risk on 350m of the euro public notes issued in December 2012, effectively fi xing the sterling value of this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.2332.
Assuming a 1% appreciation of sterling against the US dollar and the euro, the fair value net gain on the cross currency swaps which hedge part of the currency loan notes would be expected to fall by 7m.
Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps Borrowing at fl oating rates as described in note 28 exposes the group to cash fl ow interest rate risk, which the group manages within policy limits approved by the directors.
Interest rate swaps and, to a limited extent, forward rate agreements are utilised to fi x the interest rate on a proportion of borrowings on a reducing scale over forward periods up to a maximum of fi five years.
At 31 December 2013 the nominal value of such contracts was 97m in respect of US dollar 2012: 98m and 37m in respect of euro 2012: 73m : their weighted average interest rate was 1.3% US dollar 2012: 1.3% and 2.8% euro 2012: 3.2 %, and their weighted average period to maturity was two and a half years.
All the interest rate hedging instruments are designated and fully effective as cash fl ow hedges and movements in their fair value have been deferred in equity.
The US Private Placement market is predominantly a fi xed rate market, with investors wanting a fi xed rate return over the life of the loan notes.
At the time of the fi first issue in March 2007, the group was comfortable with the proportion of fl oating rate exposure not hedged by interest rate swaps and therefore rather than take on a higher proportion of fi xed rate debt arranged fi xed to fl oating swaps effectively converting the fi xed coupon on the Private Placement to a fl oating rate.
Following the swaps the resulting average coupon on the US Private Placement is Libor 60bps.
These swaps have been documented as fair value hedges of the US Private Placement fi xed interest loan notes, with the movements in their fair value posted to profi t and loss at the same time as the movement in the fair value of the hedged item.
The interest on the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008, the sterling public notes issued in May 2009, 510m of the euro public notes issued in May 2012 and 380m of the euro public notes issued in December 2012 was kept at fi xed rate.
All three public notes have a coupon step up of 1.25% which is triggered should the credit rating of G4S plc fall below investment grade.
The core group borrowings are held in US dollar, euro and sterling.
Although the impact of rising interest rates is largely shielded by fi xed rate loans and interest rate swaps which provide certainty on the vast majority of the exposure, some interest rate risk remains.
A 1% increase in interest rates across the yield curve in each of these currencies with the 31 December 2013 debt position constant throughout 2014, would lead to an expectation of an additional interest charge of 8m in the 2014 fi financial year.
Commodity risk and commodity swaps The groups principal commodity risk relates to the fl uctuating level of diesel prices, particularly affecting its cash solutions businesses.
Commodity swaps and commodity options are used to fi x synthetically part of the exposure and reduce the associated cost volatility.
Commodity swaps hedging 41 million litres of projected 2014 diesel consumption, 27 million litres of projected 2015 diesel consumption and 9 million litres of projected 2016 diesel consumption were in place at 31 December 2013.
Counterparty credit risk The groups strategy for credit risk management is to set minimum credit ratings for counterparties and monitor these on a regular basis.
For treasury-related transactions, the policy limits the aggregate credit risk assigned to a counterparty.
The utilisation of a credit limit is calculated by applying a weighting to the notional value of each transaction outstanding with each counterparty based on the type and duration of the transaction.
The total mark to market value outstanding with each counterparty is also closely monitored against policy limits assigned to each counterparty.
For short-term transactions under one year, at inception of the transaction, the fi financial counterparty must be investment grade rated by either the Standard & Poors or Moodys rating agencies.
For long-term transactions, at inception of the transaction, the fi financial counterparty must have a minimum rating of BBB Baa1 from Standard & Poors or Moodys.
Treasury transactions are dealt with the groups relationship banks, all of which have a strong investment grade rating.
At 31 December 2013 the largest two counterparty exposures related to treasury transactions were 29m and 28m and both were held with institutions with a long term Standard & Poors credit rating of A and Arespectively.
These exposures represent 13% and 12% of the carrying values of the treasury transactions, with a fair value gain at the balance sheet date.
Both of these banks had signifi cant loan commitments outstanding to G4S plc at 31 December 2013.
The group operates a multi-currency notional pooling cash management system with a wholly owned subsidiary of an A rated bank.
At year end credit balances of 425m were pooled with debit balances of 422m, resulting in a net pool credit balance of 3m.
There is legal right of set off under the pooling agreement and an overdraft facility of 3m.
At an operating level the minimum investment grade rating criteria applies.
Exceptionally, where required by local country circumstances, counterparties with no, or a non-investment grade, rating can be approved as counterparties for a period of up to 12 months.
Due to the groups global geographical footprint and exposure to multiple industries, there is minimal concentration risk.
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 G4S plc 127 Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements continued 33.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The group operates a wide range of retirement benefi t arrangements which are established in accordance with local conditions and practices within the countries concerned.
These include funded defi ned contribution, multi-employer and funded and unfunded defi ned benefi t schemes.
Defi ned contribution arrangements The majority of the retirement benefi t arrangements operated by the group are of a defi ned contribution structure, where the employer contribution and resulting income statement charge is fi xed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees pay.
Contributions made to defi ned contribution schemes and charged to the income statement totalled 99m 2012: 107m.
In the UK, following the closure of the defi ned benefi t schemes to new entrants in 2004, the main scheme for new employees is a contracted-in defi ned contribution scheme.
G4S Government Solutions, Inc. is the administrator of several defi ned benefi t schemes.
G4S Government Solutions, Inc. is responsible for making periodic cost-reimbursable deposits to the various defi ned benefi t schemes as determined by independent actuaries.
In each instance, the US Department of Energy DOE acknowledged within the contract entered between the DOE and G4S Government Solutions, Inc. its responsibility for all unfunded pension and benefi t liabilities.
Therefore, these schemes are accounted for as defi ned contribution schemes.
Multi-employer arrangement In the Netherlands, most of the employees are members of the Security Industry Wide Pension Fund IWPF.
This is a career-average defi ned benefi t plan.
Pensionable salary is subject to a cap, and minus an offset that refl ects social security levels.
Withdrawal from the scheme is only possible under certain strict conditions determined by Dutch law and by the pension fund board of the IWPF.
The plan is funded by a premium that is set by the IWPF board in line with the fi nancing rules that state that the premium should cover the cost of the annual accrual of pension benefi ts.
Historically, the premium has been 30% of pensionable salaries and the employer pays 60% of this premium and the employees the remaining 40%.
The fi nancing rules specify that an employer is not obliged to pay any further premiums in respect of previously accrued benefi ts.
This means that in case of insuffi cient funding, the benefi ts of participants could, in theory, be reduced.
The current solvency ratio is 116.6% October 2013.
The required solvency ratio according to Dutch law is 122% as at 31 December 2012.
Should a surplus appear within the scheme the board will decide if a reduction in premium is possible although this would only be possible at much higher solvency levels.
Premiums paid to the scheme by the group and charged to the income statement in 2013 totalled 8m 2012: 8m.
The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid to the schemes during the fi financial year commencing 1 January 2014 in respect of the on-going accrual of benefi ts is approximately 8m.
The premium that the IWPF received in 2013 is not yet available: in 2012 this amounted to 60m of which approximately 8m was paid by the group.
The total number of employees in the scheme is approximately 22,000 at the end of 2012.
The number of employees working for the group is approximately 5,600 as at 31 October 2013.
The scheme is not accounted for as a defi ned benefi t scheme under IAS 19 Employee Benefi ts as it is not possible to identify the groups share of the schemes assets and liabilities.
As a result, and in line with general practice for such schemes, the scheme is accounted for as if it were a defi ned contribution scheme under IAS 19.
Defi ned benefi t arrangements The group operates several funded defi ned retirement benefi t schemes where the benefi ts are based on employees length of service.
Whilst the groups primary scheme is in the UK, it also operates other material schemes in the Netherlands and Canada and other less material plans elsewhere.
Under funded arrangements, the assets of defi ned benefi t schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds or similar structures in the countries concerned.
There are also various less material unfunded arrangements: for these the group does not hold related assets separate from the group.
The amounts recognised in income are included within the following categories in the income statement: 2013 2012 Amounts recognised in income m m Cost of sales 5 5 Administration expenses 2 3 Net fi finance costs 20 15 Total for all defi ned benefi t schemes 27 23 128 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial statements The Defi ned Benefi t Obligation DBO, Assets and balance sheet provisions for defi ned benefi t schemes are as follows: DBO Assets Provision 2013 m m m UK 2,011 1,562 449 Netherlands 111 88 23 Other 10 10 Total for material funded defi ned benefi t schemes 2,132 1,660 472 Total provision for unfunded and other funded defi ned benefi t schemes 32 Total provision for all defi ned benefi t schemes 504 DBO Assets Provision 2012 m m m UK 1,886 1,474 412 Canada 34 28 6 Netherlands 96 79 17 Other 9 8 1 Total for material funded defi ned benefi t schemes 2,025 1,589 436 Total provision for unfunded and other funded defi ned benefi t schemes 35 Total provision for all defi ned benefi t schemes 471 Liabilities and assets for the Canadian scheme were transferred to held for sale as at 30 June 2013 and the sale of the sponsoring business was completed on 17 January 2014.
UK Defi ned Benefi t Scheme The defi ned benefi t scheme in the UK accounts for 95% of the net balance sheet liability for material funded defi ned retirement benefi t schemes.
It comprises three sections: the Group 4 section which is the pension scheme demerged from the former Group 4 Falck A S: the Securicor section, responsibility for which the group assumed on 20 July 2004 with the acquisition of Securicor plc, and the GSL section, responsibility for which the group assumed on 12 May 2008 with the acquisition of GSL.
The UK scheme is closed to future accrual apart from some sub-sections of the GSL section, and for most members defi fines the pension based on fi final salary.
The GSL section has historically remained open to provide a facility to accept former public-sector employees who join G4S through outsourcings.
In the Group 4 and Securicor sections, members retain their link to fi final salary where appropriate on their benefi ts accrued up to closure in 2011.
As at the latest actuarial funding valuation, the participants of the UK pension scheme sections can be analysed as follows: Group 4 GSL Securicor At 5 April 2012 section section section Total Active participants Number 808 808 Average age N A 47.1 N A 47.1 Deferred participants Number 4,390 1,318 9,973 15,681 Average age 51.5 50.0 51.3 51.2 Pensioner participants Number 3,024 581 8,891 12,496 Average age 69.9 63.6 71.2 70.5 There is a mix of fi xed and infl ation-dependent pension increases in payment and deferment which vary from member to member according to their membership history and the section of the scheme.
The discounted weighted average duration of the accrued liabilities of the sections are respectively 17 years Group 4 section, 18 years GSL section and 18 years Securicor section.
The scheme is set up under UK law and governed by a Trustee company which is responsible for the schemes investments, administration and management.
The Board of the Trustee Company is comprised of an independent chairman and further independent, group and scheme membership representatives.
The current schedule of defi cit recovery contributions provides for a contribution of approximately 42m during 2014.
In addition, the company has pledged a share of any material disposal proceeds to the pension scheme to be shared in the same proportion as the pension scheme defi cit bears to overall group indebtedness and has agreed that additional contributions would be made in the event that the average annual dividend payment to ordinary shareholders over the three fi financial years 2013, 2014, 2015 exceeds a certain threshold or in the event that the company makes a signifi cant special dividend payment, or equivalent capital return, to its ordinary shareholders over the same period.
A funding valuation is carried out for the schemes Trustee every three years by an independent fi rm of actuaries.
Depending on the outcome of that valuation a schedule of future contributions is negotiated: the group has guaranteed any contributions due from its subsidiaries.
The most recent valuation had an effective date of 5 April 2012.
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 G4S plc 129 Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements continued 33.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED Other material Defi ned Benefi t Schemes Apart from the multi-employer scheme referred to above, the group operates two material pension schemes in the Netherlands which apply to different employee populations: they are known as the Securicor Staff and Cash Solutions schemes.
Both schemes defi ne pensions in terms of average career pay, are open to new entrants and are funded in accordance with Dutch requirements.
Pension increases in the Securicor Staff scheme are conditional on the funding level and so are only required if there is a funding surplus.
The Securicor scheme has a risk sharing arrangement whereby members pay 50% of the cost of the scheme but the group has opted to record 100% of the defi cit as a company liability due to uncertainties as to the practicalities of applying the schemes provisions in this respect: for example in 2012 benefi ts were reduced rather than increasing members contributions.
The Cash Solutions scheme is required to provide benefi ts at least equivalent to the industry-wide multi-employer scheme, and in particular pension increases in payment and deferment, as well as revaluation of active members rights in the Cash Solutions scheme have to follow the multi-employer scheme which also applies a conditional approach.
The Cash Solutions scheme is insured, so longevity risk on the base level of insured pension that is before increases is carried by the insurer, and any bonuses from the insurers returns may defray the cost of pension increases.
Accordingly, there is a counterparty risk against the insurer.
The other material scheme is in Canada: it is a fi final salary scheme that is closed to new entrants, other than to hourly-paid members in a few specifi c locations.
Most of the benefi ts are not subject to indexation in payment.
The scheme is funded in accordance with Canadian requirements.
The sponsoring business is held for sale as at 31 December 2013.
It was sold on 17 January 2014 and the entire liabilities and assets of the scheme are now the responsibility of the purchaser.
The discounted weighted average duration of the accrued liabilities of the schemes are respectively 28 years Netherlands Securicor Staff, 28 years Netherlands Cash Solutions and 18 years Canada.
Expected Contributions The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid to the material schemes during the fi financial year commencing 1 January 2014 in respect of the ongoing accrual of benefi ts are approximately 9m split 6m UK, 3m Netherlands and it is anticipated that these will remain at a similar level in the medium term subject to changes in fi financial conditions.
Additional contributions of approximately 42m will also be made in 2014 in respect of the defi cit in the UK schemes.
Principal Risks The groups pension schemes create a number of risk exposures.
Annual increases on benefi ts are, to a varying extent from scheme to scheme, dependent on infl ation so the main uncertainties affecting the level of benefi ts payable are future infl ation levels including the impact of infl ation on future salary increases and the actual longevity of the membership.
Benefi ts payable will also be infl uenced by a range of other factors including member decisions on matters such as when to retire and the possibility to draw benefi ts in different forms.
A key risk is that additional contributions are required if the investment returns fall short of those anticipated when setting the contributions to the pension plans.
For the UK funding valuation those assumed investment returns for funding valuations are set based on fi xed margins over the LIBOR swap curve.
The management of the pension fund assets has been delegated to an asset manager which manages the assets against a liability benchmark.
The key parameters of this mandate can be summarised as follows: An asset mix which is managed dynamically over time rather than a set strategic allocation Interest rate and infl ation risk is managed with the benchmark of hedging 100% of these risks as a percentage of the asset value through the use of debt instruments government bonds and derivatives Currency risk is managed with the objective of hedging at least 70% of the overseas currency exposure in the portfolio through the use of forward foreign currency contracts All pension schemes are regulated by the relevant jurisdictions.
These include extensive legislation and regulatory mechanisms that are subject to change and may impact G4S pension schemes.
Regarding fi financial reporting measures, the IAS 19 liability measurement DBO and the service cost are sensitive to the actuarial assumptions made on a range of demographic and fi financial matters that are used to project the expected benefi t payments, the most important of these assumptions being about future infl ation and salary growth levels and the assumptions made about life expectation.
The DBO and service cost are also very sensitive to the IAS 19 discount rate, which determines the discounted value of the projected benefi t payments.
The discount rate depends on market yields on high-quality corporate bonds.
Investment strategies are set with funding rather than IAS 19 considerations in mind and do not seek to provide a specifi c hedge against the IAS 19 measurement of liabilities.
As a result the difference between the market value of the assets and the IAS 19 liabilities may be volatile.
130 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial statements Assumptions and sensitivities The weighted average principal assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows: UK Canada Netherlands Key assumptions used at 31 December 2013 Discount rate 4.4% 5.0% 3.7% Expected rate of salary increases 3.5% 3.0% 2.0% Pension increases in payment for the UK, at RPI with a limit of 5% p. a.
3.2% 1.4% 1.4% Infl ation 3.4% 2.3% 2.0% Key assumptions used at 31 December 2012 Discount rate 4.5% 4.5% 3.7% Expected rate of salary increases 3.1% 3.0% 2.0% Pension increases in payment for the UK, at RPI with a limit of 5% p. a.
IAS 19 specifi es that pension liabilities should be discounted at appropriate high-quality corporate bond rates.
The group considers that it is appropriate to consider AA-rated corporate bonds as high quality and therefore have used discount rates based on yields on such bonds corresponding to the liability profi le of the schemes.
The effect of a movement in the discount rate applicable in the UK alters reported liabilities before associated deferred tax adjustments by approximately the amounts shown in the table below: Increase decrease in the DBO of the UK Scheme 2013 Sensitivity analysis m Discount rate assumption being 0.5% higher 163 Discount rate assumption being 0.5% lower 181 The effect of a movement in RPI infl ation applicable in the UK alters reported liabilities before associated deferred tax adjustments by approximately the amounts shown in the table below: Increase decrease in the DBO of the UK Scheme 2013 Sensitivity analysis m Infl ation assumption being 0.5% higher 79 Infl ation assumption being 0.5% lower 70 The above sensitivities allow for infl ation-dependent assumptions such as salary growth and relevant pension increases to vary corresponding to the infl ation assumption variation.
Due to the caps and fl oors on pension increases a certain movement in the infl ation assumption will not generally result in the same movement in the pension increase assumption.
In addition to the above, the group uses appropriate mortality assumptions when calculating the schemes obligations.
The mortality tables used for the scheme in the UK are: Birth year table S1P[M F]A Base with future improvements in line with CMI 2013 Core projections, based on a long term improvement rate of 1.25% p. a. and allowing for individual scaling factors based on the majority analysis carried out as part of the last funding valuation.
The resulting assumed life expectancy of a male member of the UK schemes currently aged 65 is between 21 and 22 years, depending on the section of the plan.
The assumed life expectancy at 65 of a male currently aged 52 is between 22 and 23 years.
At those ages, the assumed life expectancy for a female member is between 2 and 3 years higher than for a male member.
The effect of a one year change in this UK life expectancy assumption is to alter reported liabilities before associated deferred tax adjustments by approximately 88m.
The selection of these movements to illustrate the sensitivity of the DBO to key assumptions should not be interpreted as the group expressing any specifi c view of the probability of such movements happening.

Other UK investments are predominantly not quoted.
Derivatives include a range of interest rate and infl ation linked swaps, forward currency contracts, equity index total return swaps, equity options, and futures.
Investing in interest rate and infl ation linked swaps is designed to mitigate the impact of future changes in interest rates and infl ation.

PROVISIONS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Employee Claims Contract benefi ts Restructuring reserves provisions Total m m m m m At 1 January 2013 14 3461174 Additional provision in the year 21 68 27 136 252 Utilisation of provision 6 35 17 2 60 Transfers and reclassifi cations 2 2 Translation adjustments 2 3 1 At 31 December 2013 31 33 57 143 264 Included in current liabilities 200 Included in non-current liabilities 64 264 Employee benefi ts The provision for employee benefi ts is in respect of any employee benefi ts which accrue over the working lives of the employees, typically including items such as long service awards and termination indemnity schemes.
The groups net obligation in respect of long-term service benefi ts other than retirement benefi ts represents the present value of the future benefi t that employees have earned at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of scheme assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
Restructuring Restructuring provisions include amounts for redundancy payments, and the costs of closure of activities in acquired businesses and discontinued operations.
Settlement of restructuring provisions is highly probable.
The timing is uncertain but is generally likely to be short term.
Claims reserves The claims reserves are held by the wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries in Guernsey and the US which underwrite part of the groups cash solutions, general liability, workers compensation and auto liability policies.
The provisions are subject to regular actuarial review and are adjusted as appropriate.
Settlement of these provisions is highly probable but both the value of the fi final settlements and their timing is uncertain, dependent upon the outcome of ongoing processes to determine both liability and quantum in respect of a wide range of claims or possible claims.
Contract provisions Contract provisions include provisions for onerous contracts including future liabilities for loss-making contracts, for all properties sub-let at a shortfall, for the cost of replacing assets where there is a present contractual requirement and for long-term idle, leased properties.
Provisions relating to revenue recognition are also included in this category.
The provision is based on the value of future net cash outfl ows.
Whilst the likelihood of settlement of these obligations is considered probable, there is uncertainty over their value and duration.
On 12 March 2014 the group announced that it had reached agreement with the UK Ministry of Justice MoJ on a settlement in respect of claims arising in relation to Electronic Monitoring services provided between 2005 and 2013.
The agreement also concluded outstanding matters relating to two UK facilities management contracts.
The total settlement amount was 109m and the group has provided for this amount within contract provisions as at 31 December 2013.
Contingent liabilities Contingent liabilities exist in respect of agreements entered into in the normal course of business, none of which are individually or collectively signifi cant.
Details of unprovided contingent tax liabilities are presented in note 35.

A deferred tax asset of 30m 2012: 28m has been recognised in respect of approximately 120m 2012: 106m of gross losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 585m 2012: 379m of gross losses due to the unpredictability of future profi t streams in the relevant jurisdictions and the fact that a signifi cant proportion of such losses remains unaudited by the relevant tax authorities.
Included in unrecognised tax losses are gross losses of 15m which will expire between 2014 and 2023.
Other losses may be carried forward indefi nitely.
At 31 December 2013, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of non-UK subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 1,220m 2012: 1,378m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these gross differences on the basis that the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
At 31 December 2013, the group had total unprovided contingent tax liabilities of approximately 58m 2012: 5m relating to unresolved tax issues in various jurisdictions.

Merger reserve The merger reserve comprises reserves arising upon the merger between the former Group 4 Falck A S and the former Group 4 Securitas BV in 2000 and the acquisition of Securicor plc by the group in 2004.
In 2013 the 308m addition to the merger reserve resulted from the groups 9.99% share placing in August 2013.
Reserve for own shares An employee benefi t trust established by the group held 6,934,564 shares at 31 December 2013 2012: 7,589,853 shares to satisfy the vesting of awards under the performance share plan and performance-related schemes.
During the year no shares were purchased by the trust, whilst 655,289 shares were used to satisfy the vesting of awards under the schemes.
Shares held by the trust are treated as treasury shares, are deducted from equity, do not receive dividends and are excluded from the calculations of earnings per share.

Leased vehicles and other operating equipment are negotiated over an average lease term of four years.
Certain leased properties have been sub-let by the group.
Sub-leases are negotiated on terms consistent with those of the associated property.
The total future minimum sub-lease payments expected to be received by the group from sub-let properties amount to 12m 2012: 10m.

SHARE BASED PAYMENTS Shares allocated conditionally fall under either the groups performance-related bonus scheme or the groups Performance Share Plan PSP.
Shares allocated conditionally under the performance-related bonus scheme vest three years following the date of grant provided certain non-market performance conditions are met.
Those allocated under the PSP vest after three years, to the extent that a certain non-market performance conditions are met and b certain market performance conditions are met.
The proportion of the allocation of awards to these criteria is described in the remuneration report.
Vesting occurs after the third anniversary of the date the shares were allocated conditionally.
To the extent that the performance criteria have been met and the shares are not forfeited, these shares can only be released upon request after the third anniversary but before the tenth anniversary.
The weighted average share price at the date of allocation of shares allocated conditionally during the year was 291.7p 2012: 277.1p and the contractual life of all conditional allocations was three years.
Under the PSP, the vesting of half 2012: half of the shares allocated conditionally depends upon Total Shareholder Return a market performance condition over the performance period measured against a comparator group.
25% of the allocation vests upon the groups Total Shareholder Return equalling median performance amongst the comparator group.
The fair value of the shares allocated subject to this market performance condition has therefore been reduced by 75%.
The income statement is charged with an estimate for the vesting of shares conditionally awarded subject to non-market performance conditions.
The charge for 2013 was nil 2012: nil.
