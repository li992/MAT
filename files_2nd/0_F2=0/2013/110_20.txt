Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Included in this note are accounting policies which cover areas that the Directors consider require estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
These policies together with references to the related notes to the financial statements can be found below: Note Taxation 7 Intangible assets 11 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 11 Investment in equity accounted joint ventures 13 Share-based payments 24 Contingent liabilities and regulatory compliance 29 58 23124.04 25 March 2014 6:24 AM Proof 11 Financials www.
com 2 Significant accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The subsidiaries are companies controlled by 888 Holdings Public Limited Company.
Control exists where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date the parent gained control until such time as control ceases.
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements using the purchase method of accounting.
On the date of the acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values and any excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Parent Company and using consistent accounting policies.
Revenue Revenue is recognised provided that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is recognised in the accounting periods in which the transactions occurred after deduction of certain bonuses granted to customers and after adding the management fees and charges applied to customer accounts, and is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.
Revenue consists of income from online activities and that generated from processing customers cross currency deposits and withdrawals, which is allocated to each reporting segment.
Revenue from online activities comprises: Casino and Bingo Casino and Bingo online gaming revenue is represented by the difference between the amounts of bets placed by customers less amounts won.
Where the Group is using a third-party platform and is not deemed to be the principal, the recognised income is the net revenue share earned from that activity.
Poker Poker online gaming revenue represents the commission charged from each poker hand in ring games and entry fees for participation in Poker tournaments.
In Poker tournaments entry fee revenue is recognised when the tournament has concluded.
Emerging Offerings Revenue from Emerging Offerings is mainly comprised of Sportbook, Social games and brand licensing on third party platforms. }
Sportsbook online gaming revenue comprises net house win adjusted for the fair value of open betting positions. }
Social games revenue comprises the Groups share from the sale of virtual goods to customers playing the Groups games. }
Revenue derived from brand licensing on third party platforms represents the Groups net revenue share from that activity.
B2B } Where the Group is considered to be the principal, income is recognised as the gross revenue generated from use of the Groups platform in online gaming activities with the partners share of the revenue charged to operating expenses. }
In other cases income is recognised as the Group share of the net revenue generated from use of the Groups platform. }
B2B also includes fees from the provision of certain gaming related services to partners. }
Customer advances received are treated as deferred income within current liabilities and released as they are earned.
Operating expenses Operating expenses consists primarily of staff costs, payment service providers commissions, chargebacks, commission and royalties payable to third parties, all of which are recognised on an accruals basis, and depreciation and amortisation.

Foreign currency Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-US Dollar currencies are translated into US Dollar equivalents using year-end spot foreign exchange rates.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange rate differences on foreign currency transactions are included in financial income or financial expenses as appropriate.
The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from US Dollars are translated into the presentation currency as follows: a assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: and b income and expenses for each income statement are translated at an average exchange rate unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions.
Taxation The tax expense represents tax payable for the year based on currently applicable tax rates.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet differs from its tax base.
It is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the difference can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities assets are settled recovered.
Segment information Segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker.
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the management team comprising mainly the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer.
These segments are: } B2C Business to Customer Casino and games, Poker, Bingo and Emerging Offering: and } B2B Business to Business which offers Total Gaming Services under the Dragonfish trading brand.
Dragonfish offers to its business partners use of technology, software, operations, E-payments and advanced marketing services, through the provision of offline online marketing, management of affiliates, SEO, CRM and business analytics.
Intangible assets Acquisitions Identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
The identified intangibles are amortised over the useful economic life of the assets.
This has ranged between three months to four years for acquisitions to date.
The exception is acquisitions of trade names, which have an indefinite useful economic life and therefore an annual impairment test is conducted.
Internally generated intangible assets Expenditure incurred on development activities is capitalised only when the expenditure will lead to new or substantially improved products or processes, the products or processes are technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
All other development expenditure is expensed.
Subsequent expenditure on intangible assets is capitalised only where it clearly increases the economic benefits to be derived from the asset to which it relates.
The Group estimates the useful life of these assets as between three and five years, except for certain licence costs which are amortised over either the life of the licence, or up to 20 years, whichever is the shorter period.
com 2 Significant accounting policies continued Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the Companys interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Cost comprises the fair value of any assets transferred, liabilities assumed and equity instruments issued.
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated income statement.
Where the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceed the fair value of consideration paid, the excess is credited in full to the consolidated income statement on the acquisition.
Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are charged or credited to the income statement.
In addition the direct costs of acquisition are charged immediately as an expense.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation.
Assets are assessed at each balance sheet date for indications of impairment.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, at annual rates estimated to write off the cost of the assets less their estimated residual values over their expected useful lives.
The annual depreciation rates are as follows: IT equipment 33% Office furniture and equipment 715% Motor vehicles 15% Leasehold improvements Over the shorter of the term of the lease or useful lives Impairment of non-financial assets Impairment tests on goodwill are undertaken annually on 31 December, and where applicable an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount i. e. the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell, the asset is written down accordingly.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the assets cash generating unit i. e. the lowest group of assets in which the asset belongs for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
Investment in equity accounted joint ventures Jointly controlled entities JCE are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement and requiring unanimous consent for strategic financial and operating decisions.
JCEs are accounted for using the equity method equity accounted investees and are recognised initially at cost.
The Groups share of post-acquisition profits and losses is recognised in the consolidated income statement, except that losses in excess of the Groups investment in the JCEs are not recognised unless there is an obligation to make good those losses.
Profits and losses arising on transactions between the Group and its JCEs are recognised only to the extent of unrelated investors interests in the JCE.
The investors share in the JCEs profits and losses resulting from these transactions is eliminated against the carrying value of the JCEs.
Any premium paid for a JCE above the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is capitalised and included in the carrying amount of the JCE.
Where there is objective evidence that the investment in a JCE has been impaired the carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment in the same way as other non-financial assets, and any charge or reversal of previous impairments is taken to the consolidated income statement.
Where amounts paid for a JCE are exceeded by the Groups share of the fair value of net assets acquired, the excess is recognised as negative goodwill and released to the consolidated income statement immediately.
The Groups share of additional equity contributions from other joint venture partners is taken to Other Comprehensive Income.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised at fair value and carried at amortised cost and principally comprise amounts due from credit card companies and from e-payment companies.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when there is objective evidence that the full amount may not be collected.
Stock Code: 888 61 23124.04 25 March 2014 6:24 AM Proof 11 888 Holdings plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2 Significant accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into contracts for derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts to hedge operational risks associated with foreign exchange rates.
Such derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value under IAS 39 and comprise level 2 fair value measurement instruments and are carried in the balance sheets as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivatives are recorded immediately in the consolidated income statement.
A fair value measurement hierarchy is based on the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value to increase consistency and comparability.
The inputs are categorised into three levels, with the highest priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority given to unobservable inputs.
Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability.
Short term investments Short term investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market.
They are initially recognised at fair value, plus transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition.
They are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any provisions for impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and balances with banks.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
They include short-term deposits originally purchased with maturities of three months or less.
Equity Equity issued by the Company is recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised at fair value and carried at amortised cost.
Liabilities to customers Liabilities to customers comprise the amounts that are credited to customers bankroll the Groups electronic wallet, including provision for bonuses granted by the Group, less management fees and charges applied to customer accounts, along with full progressive provision for jackpots.
These amounts are repayable in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets comprise non-derivative financial assets not included in any of the above financial asset categories and comprise principally the Groups investments in entities not qualifying as joint ventures or subsidiaries.
They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in a separate component of equity.
Where there is a significant decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset the full amount of the impairment, including any amount previously charged to equity, is recognised in the income statement.
On disposal of an available-for-sale asset any balance within equity is transferred to the income statement.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases wherever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.
All other leases are classified as operating leases and rentals payable are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present or constructive obligation as a result of a past event from which it is probable that it will result in an outflow of economic benefits that can be reasonably estimated.
Dividends Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable.
In the case of interim dividends this is when paid.
In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
com 2 Significant accounting policies continued Share-based payments } Equity settled Where the Company grants its employees or contractors shares, or options, the fair value at the date of grant is charged to the income statement over the vesting period.
Non-market performance conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of instruments that eventually vest.
Market performance conditions are taken into account in determining the fair value at the date of grant. }
Cash-settled For transactions treated as cash settled share based payment transactions, the Company recognises the services received, and a liability to pay for those services, as the employees render the service.
Until the liability is settled, the Company remeasures the fair value of the liability at each reporting date and at the date of settlement, with any changes in fair value charged or credited to the income statement for the period.
Severance pay schemes Severance scheme surpluses and deficits are measured at: } The fair value of plan assets at the reporting date: less } Plan liabilities calculated using the projected unit credit method discounted to its present value using yields available for the appropriate government bonds that have maturity dates appropriate to the terms of the liabilities: plus } Unrecognised past service costs.
Any difference between the expected return on assets and that actually achieved, and any changes in liabilities over the year due to changes in assumptions or experience within the scheme, are recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Financial guarantee contracts Where the Group enters into financial guarantee contracts the Group considers these to be insurance contracts and accounts for them as such.
The Group treats the guarantee as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Group will be required to make payments under the guarantee.

A review was carried out at 31 December 2013 to assess whether there was any indication that its other intangible assets and property plant and equipment had been impaired.
Where an impairment calculation was carried out, the carrying value in use of the assets was determined by discounting the future cash flows of the relevant cash generating unit to their present value.
Goodwill Bingo Online Business Goodwill and intangible assets associated with the online Bingo business unit relates to the acquisition of the online Bingo business of Globalcom Limited during 2007 and the acquisition of the Wink Bingo business in 2009.
The income streams generated from the bingo business, comprising the B2C Bingo cash generating unit and the B2B cash generating unit, have been treated together as the risks and rewards associated with those income streams are deemed to be sufficiently similar.
Cash flow projections have been prepared covering the following five year period prior to assuming a long term growth rate.
Underlying growth rates as shown in the table below have been applied to revenue and are based on past experience, the reorganisations that have taken place within the B2C Bingo cash generating unit during the year, the positive results of which have been seen in recent months, and projections of future changes in the online gaming market.
com 11 Intangible assets continued Having applied conservative estimates, certain B2B contracts due to end in the next two years have not been projected to be renewed and have been assumed to gradually decline over the period to contract end.
The discount rate that is considered by the Directors to be appropriate is the Groups specific weighted average cost of capital which also applies to the online Bingo cash generating units.
Key assumptions used Operating Operating 2 2 Underlying Underlying Underlying expenses expenses Discount rate growth rate growth rate growth rate increase years increase year 1 1 applied year years 25 year 6 15 6 At 31 December 2013 9% 2% 1% 1% 3% 1% At 31 December 2012 10% 2% 0% 1% 6% 1% 1 The discount rate is recalculated every year by taking into account prevailing risk free rates, equity risk premium and company beta and having regard to external data commenting upon the Weighted Average Cost Of Capital applied to the Group.
2 Operating expenses exclude marketing costs which were included in the projections throughout the period on a slowly declining percentage of revenues.
Under the key assumptions above, the Bingo unit recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount by US$49 million.
A 1% increase in the discount rate, or a 1% reduction in the underlying growth rate over the forecast period would reduce this excess by US$17 million and US$13 million respectively.
Internally generated Intangible assets Other intangible assets No impairment tests were considered to be required at 31 December 2013 and the carrying value of other intangible assets is considered to be appropriate.
Licensesprior year impairment During the year 2012, the Group requested the French licence to be revoked given the impact of high gaming duty rates imposed in France which ultimately rendered the offering of the Groups online gaming services in that jurisdiction not economically viable.
As a consequence no future income arises from these assets and the Group made a full impairment charge of US$0.8 million in respect of the French licence costs and other intangible assets of US$0.1 million.
com 13 Investment in equity accounted joint ventures The following entities meet the definition of Jointly Controlled Entities and have been equity accounted in the consolidated financial statements: Country of Effective interest Effective interest Name incorporation 31 December 2013 31 December 2012 Technology Solutions Gibraltar Limited 50% Gibraltar 50% AAPN Holdings LLC 47% USA AGN LLC 47% USA AAPN New Jersey LLC USA 47% Technology Solutions Gibraltar Limited TSG In 2010 the Group obtained a licence to operate online poker games in France.
High gaming duty rates imposed in France rendered the offering of the Groups online gaming services in that jurisdiction not economically viable.
Accordingly, in 2012, the Group requested its local licence to be revoked following agreement to terminate the joint venture.
Consequently, in 2012, the Group impaired the full amount of its investment in the joint venture in the amount ofUS$1.3 million.
USA Jointly Controlled Entities On 11 March 2013 the Group entered into a joint venture agreement JVA with Avenue OLG Entertainment LLC Avenue and other minority shareholders to form AAPN Holdings LLC AAPN.
Under that agreement the Group has a 47% interest in AAPN.
AAPN is funded by Avenue as defined in the JVA.
AAPN New Jersey LLC AAPN NJ is the entity which contracted with an Atlantic City casino licensee in connection with the operation of a B2C gaming offering in New Jersey an offering which launched in November 2013.
AGN LLC is the entity which contracted with a Las Vegas casino licensee in connection with the operation of a B2C gaming offering in Nevada this offering has not yet launched.
As at December 31 2013, AGN LLC and AAPN NJ together, the Operating Entities were 100% owned by 888 US Inc.
However, both are regarded as jointly controlled entities, as the Group has agreed that so long as the Operating Entities remain wholly owned by the Group, they will be operated in a manner consistent with the contractual arrangements in place within the AAPN JVA.
The Group also has an irrevocable commitment to contribute 100% of the interests in AAPN NJ and AGN LLC, to AAPN for no consideration, upon fulfillment of certain conditions.
On this basis the three entities, the US Joint venture have been equity accounted for reflecting the Groups effective 47% interest in their aggregated results and assets.
On 8 July 2013, AGN LLC obtained the required licences by the Nevada Gaming Commission enabling it to provide online gaming services in the State of Nevada in accordance with the stipulations of the licences.
On 8 November 2013, AAPN NJ obtained the transactional waiver by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement enabling it to provide online gaming services in the State of New Jersey for a period of six months from the date of the waiver and subject to final approval by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement.

During 2013 the US JV launched regulated license gaming offering in the states of Nevada and New Jersey.
As a result substantial marketing costs were incurred in order to facilitate the penetration into these newly opened markets.
On acquisition of the interest in AAPN the difference of US$1.9 million between the consideration paid of nil and the share of net assets of the entity of US$1.9 million was accounted for as a profit on acquisition in line with IAS 31.
The Groups share of subsequent increases in the net assets of AAPN arising from equity injections by its JV partners, amounting to US $6.1 million has been accounted for through Other Comprehensive Income.

Policies and procedures for managing these risks are set by the Board following recommendations from the Chief Financial Officer.

Capital The capital employed by the Group is composed of equity attributable to shareholders.
The primary objective of the Group is maximising shareholders value, which, from the capital perspective, is achieved by maintaining the capital structure most suited to the Groups size, strategy, and underlying business risk.
Other than disclosed elsewhere in note 28, there are no demands or restrictions on the Groups capital.
The main financial risk areas are as follows: Credit risk Trade receivables The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to trade receivables due primarily from the Groups payment service providers PSP.
These are third party companies that facilitate deposits and withdrawals of funds to and from customers virtual wallet with the Group.
These are mainly intermediaries that transact on behalf of the main credit card companies.
com 27 Financial risk management continued The risk is that a PSP would fail to discharge its obligation with regard to the balance owed to the Group.
The Group reduces this credit risk by: } Monitoring those balances on a regular basis. }
Arranging for the shortest possible cash settlement intervals. }
Replacing rolling reserve requirements, where they exist, with a Letter of Credit by a reputable financial institution. }
Ensuring a new PSP is only contracted following various due diligence and Know Your Customer procedures. }
Ensuring policies are in place to reduce dependency on any specific PSP and as a result gain high degree of diversification.
The Group believes that based on the above and on extensive past experience, the PSP receivables are of good credit quality and there is no requirement to provide for any potential bad debts arising from a PSP failing to discharge its obligation.
None of the balances owed by the various PSP are overdue or impaired 2012: nil.
An additional credit risk the Group faces relates to customers disputing charges made to their credit cards chargebacks or any other funding method they have used in respect of the services provided by the Group.
Customers may fail to fulfil their obligation to pay which will result in funds not being collected.
These chargebacks and uncollected deposits, when occurring, will be deducted at source by the PSPs from any amount due to the Group.
As such the Group provides for these eventualities by way of a provision based on analysis of past transactions.
This provision is netted off from the trade receivables balance and at 31 December 2013 was US$1.2 million 2012: US$1.1 million.
The Groups in-house Fraud and Risk Management department carefully monitors deposits and withdrawals by following prevention and verification procedures using internally developed bespoke systems integrated with commercially available third party measures.
Cash and cash equivalents The Group controls its cash position out of its Gibraltar headquarters.
Subsidiaries in its other main locations maintain minimum cash balances which are deemed required for their operations.
Cash settlement proceeds from PSPs, as described above, are paid into bank accounts controlled by the Treasury function.
The Group maintains its funds with highly reputable financial institutions and will not hold funds with financial institutions with low credit rating.
The Group maintains its cash reserves in highly liquid deposits and regularly monitors rates in order to maximize yield.
Restricted cash Restricted cash represents customers funds held for payment service provider transactions in respect of regulated markets.
Short term investments Short term investments primarily relates to deposits held by banks for guarantees in respect of regulated markets licence.

Market risk Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to interest rate risk is limited to the interest bearing deposits in which the Group invests surplus funds.
The Groups policy is to invest surplus funds in low risk money market funds and in interest bearing bank accounts.
The Group arranges for excess funds to be placed in these interest bearing accounts with its principal bankers in order to maximise availability of funds for investments.
Downside interest rate risk is minimal as the Group has no floating rates borrowings.
Given current low interest rates a 0.5% downward movement in bank interest rates would not have a significant impact on finance income for the year.
However, a 0.5% increase in interest rates would, based on the year end deposits, increase annual profits by US$0.4 million.
Currency risk The Groups financial risk arising from exchange rate fluctuations is mainly attributed to: } Mismatch between balance sheet liabilities to customers which is predominantly denominated in US$ and the net receipts from customers which are settled in the currency of the customers choice, of which sterling GBP and Euros EUR are significant. }
Mismatch between reported revenue which is mainly generated in USD the Groups functional and reporting currency and a significant portion of deposits which are settled in local currencies. }
Expenses, the majority of which are denominated in foreign currencies including sterling GBP, euro EUR and New Israeli Shekel ILS.
The Group continually monitors the foreign currency risk and takes steps, where practical, to ensure that the net exposure is kept to an acceptable level, inter alia by using foreign exchange forward contracts designed to fix the economic impact of known liabilities.
At 31 December 2013 the Group had entered into US Dollar GB Pound and US Dollar Euro forward contracts totaling US$146 million regarding 2014 expected currency excess in GB Pound and Euro.
The total fair value of the forward contracts was US$4.2 million liability to be settled on a monthly basis throughout 2014.
During 2012 the Group had entered into Israeli Shekel US Dollar outstanding forward contracts totaling US$81 million regarding 2013 operational business costs incurred in Israeli Shekels.
In addition the Group had entered into US Dollar GB Pound as well as US Dollar Euro forward contracts totaling US$140 million regarding 2013 currency excess in GB Pound and Euro.
The total fair value of the forward contracts as at 31 December 2012 was US$ 3.3 million asset which had been settled during the year 2013.

b Given the nature of the legal and regulatory landscape of the industry, from time to time the Group has received notices, communications and legal actions from a small number of regulatory authorities and other parties in respect of its activities.
The Group has taken legal advice as to the manner in which it should respond and the likelihood of success of such actions.
Based on this advice and the nature of the actions, the Board is unable to quantify reliably any material outflow of funds that may result, if any.
Accordingly, no provisions have been made.
c The Group operates in numerous jurisdictions.
Accordingly, the Group is filing tax returns, providing for and paying all taxes and duties it believes are due based on local tax laws, transfer pricing agreements and tax advice obtained.
The Group is periodically subject to audits and assessments by local taxing authorities.
The Board is unable to quantify reliably any exposure for additional taxes, if any, that may arise from the final settlement of such assessments.
Accordingly, no additional provisions have been made.
