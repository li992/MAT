90 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2013 Group overview South West Water Viridor Group Governance Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 1.
General information Pennon Group Plc is a company registered in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
The address of the registered office is given on page 87.
Pennon Groups business is operated through two main subsidiaries.
South West Water Limited holds the water and sewerage services appointments for Devon, Cornwall and parts of Dorset and Somerset.
Viridor Limiteds business is recycling, renewable energy and waste management.
Principal accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented.
a Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost accounting basis except for fair value items, principally acquisitions, transfers of assets from customers and derivatives as described in accounting policy notes b, v and n respectively and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee as adopted by the European Union, and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
A summary of the principal accounting policies is set out below, together with an explanation where changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption of new accounting standards and interpretations in the year.
The going concern basis has been adopted in preparing these financial statements as stated by the Directors on page 70.
New or revised standards or interpretations which were mandatory for the first time in the year beginning 1 April 2012 did not have a material impact on the net assets or results of the Group.
For the preparation of these financial statements IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and IAS 19 Revised Employee Benefits were in issue, but not yet effective.
IFRS 11 is relevant to the Group, but it is not expected to have a material effect on the results or net assets, as the Group currently consolidates joint ventures on an equity basis.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of IAS 19 Revised Employee Benefits on 1 April 2013 will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
In the year to 31 March 2014 the revised standard is expected to result in a net finance cost of 4 million and a further 1 million is expected to be charged to operating profit to recognise administration costs as they are incurred.
Pension liabilities will reduce by 10 million as at 31 March 2013 as a result of the change.
Other standards and interpretations in issue, but not yet effective, are not expected to have a material effect on the Groups net assets or results.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best assessment of the amounts, actual events or actions and results may ultimately differ from those estimates.
b Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements include the results of Pennon Group Plc and its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associate undertakings.
The results of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associate undertakings are included from the date of acquisition or incorporation, and excluded from the date of disposal.
The results of subsidiaries are consolidated where the Group has the power to control the financial and operating policies of a subsidiary.
The results of joint ventures and associate undertakings are accounted for on an equity basis.
Intra-group trading and loan balances and transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the purchase of subsidiaries.
The excess of the value transferred to the seller in return for control of the acquired business, together with the fair value of any previously held equity interest in that business over the Groups share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets, is recorded as goodwill note 40. c Revenue recognition Revenue represents the fair value of consideration receivable, excluding value added tax, trade discounts and inter company sales, in the ordinary course of business for goods and services provided.
Revenue is recognised once the services or goods have been provided to the customer.
Income from main water and waste water charges includes billed amounts for estimated usage and also an estimation of the amount of unbilled charges at the year-end based upon a defined methodology reflecting historical consumption and current tariffs.
Income from electricity generated from waste management landfill gas production during the year includes an estimation of the amount to be received under Renewables Obligation Certificates.
Accrued income from waste management contracts at the balance sheet date is recognised using managements expectation of amounts to be subsequently billed for services rendered to the client in accordance with the terms of the contract.
Income from recycling activities within waste management includes amounts based upon market prices for recyclate products and industry schemes for waste electrical and electronic equipment WEEE notes and packaging volumes PRNs processed.
Revenue from long-term service concession arrangements is recognised based on the fair value of work performed.
Where an arrangement includes more than one service, such as construction and operation of waste management facilities, revenue and profit are recognised in proportion to a fair value assessment of the total contract value split across the services provided.
d Landfill tax Landfill tax is included within both revenue and operating costs.
Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2013 91 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements Continued 2.
Principal accounting policies Continued e Segmental reporting Each of the Groups business segments provides services which are subject to risks and returns which are different from those of the other business segments.
The Groups internal organisation and management structure and its system of internal financial reporting is based primarily on business segments.
The reportable business segments comprise the regulated water and sewerage services undertaken by South West Water Limited and the waste management business of Viridor Limited.
Segmental revenue and results include transactions between businesses.
Inter-segmental transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
f Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation from the acquisition of subsidiary and joint venture undertakings represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired, less any subsequent impairment charges.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating units or group of cash generating units, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Each unit or group of units to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes.
Goodwill is allocated and monitored at the reportable operating segment level.
Further details are contained in accounting policy j.
When a subsidiary or joint venture undertaking is sold, the profit or loss on disposal is determined after including the attributable amount of unamortised goodwill.
g Other intangible assets Other intangible assets acquired in a business combination are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, finite life intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives, with the expense charged to the income statement through operating costs.
h Property, plant and equipment i Infrastructure assets being water mains and sewers, impounding and pumped raw water storage reservoirs, dams, pipelines and sea outfalls Infrastructure assets were included at fair value on transition to IFRS and subsequent additions are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges.
Expenditure to increase capacity or enhance infrastructure assets is capitalised where it can be reliably measured and it is probable that incremental future economic benefits will flow to the Group.
The cost of day-to-day servicing of infrastructure components is recognised in the income statement as it arises.
Infrastructure assets are depreciated evenly over their useful economic lives, and are principally: Dams and impounding reservoirs 200 years Water mains 40 100 years Sewers 40 100 years Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until commissioned.
ii Landfill sites Landfill sites are included within land and buildings at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Cost includes acquisition and development expenses.
The cost of a landfill site is depreciated to its residual value which is linked to gas production at the site post-closure over its estimated operational life taking account of the usage of void space.
iii Landfill restoration Where the obligation to restore a landfill site is an integral part of its future economic benefits, a non-current asset within property, plant and equipment is recognised.
The asset recognised is depreciated based on the usage of void space.
iv Other assets including property, overground plant and equipment Other assets are included at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other assets are depreciated evenly to their residual value over their estimated economic lives, and are principally: Land and buildings Freehold buildings 30 60 years Land and buildings Leasehold buildings Over the estimated economic lives or the finance lease period, whichever is the shorter Operational properties 40 80 years Fixed plant 20 40 years Vehicles, mobile plant and computers 3 10 years Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until commissioned.
The cost of assets includes directly attributable labour and overhead costs which are incremental to the Group.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction of a qualifying asset an asset necessarily taking a substantial period of time to be prepared for its intended use are capitalised as part of the asset.
Assets transferred from customers are recognised at fair value as set out in accounting policy v. Asset lives and residual values are reviewed annually.
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing sale proceeds with carrying amounts.
These are included in the income statement.
92 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2013 Group overview South West Water Viridor Group Governance Financial statements i Leased assets Assets held under finance leases are included as property, plant and equipment at the lower of their fair value at commencement or the present value of the minimum lease payments, and are depreciated over their estimated economic lives or the finance lease period, whichever is the shorter.
The corresponding liability is recorded as borrowings.
The interest element of the rental costs is charged against profits using the actuarial method over the period of the lease.
Rental costs arising under operating leases are charged against profits in the year they are incurred.
j Impairment of non-financial assets Assets with an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment, or whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Assets subject to amortisation or depreciation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which an assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value, less costs to sell, and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash generating units.
Value in use represents the present value of projected future cash flows expected to be derived from a cash generating unit, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate which reflects an assessment of the market cost of capital of the cash generating unit.
Impairments are charged to the income statement in the year in which they arise.
Non-financial assets other than goodwill that have been impaired are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
k Investment in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiary undertakings are initially recorded at cost, being the fair value of the consideration paid.
Subsequently, investments are reviewed for impairment on an individual basis annually or if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
l Investment in joint ventures Joint ventures are entities over which the Group exercises joint control.
Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the joint venture at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill and is included in the carrying value of the investment in the joint venture.
The carrying value of the Groups investment is adjusted for the Groups share of post-acquisition profits or losses recognised in the income statement and statement of comprehensive income.
Losses of a joint venture in excess of the Groups interest are not recognised unless the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to fund those losses.
m Cash and cash deposits Cash and cash deposits comprise cash in hand and short-term deposits held at banks.
Bank overdrafts are shown within current borrowings.
n Derivatives and other financial instruments The Group classifies its financial instruments in the following categories: i Loans and receivables All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Following initial recognition interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the instruments are derecognised or impaired.
Premia, discounts and other costs and fees are recognised in the income statement through the amortisation process.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
The fair value of the liability component of a convertible bond is determined using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond.
This amount is recorded as a liability on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bonds.
The remainder of the proceeds are allocated to the conversion option.
This is recognised in shareholders equity.
ii Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest receivable and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the original terms of the receivables.
iii Trade payables Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
iv Service concession arrangements Where the provision of waste management services is performed through a contract with a public sector entity which controls a significant residual interest in asset infrastructure at the end of the contract, then consideration is treated as contract receivables, split between profit on the construction of assets, operation of the service and the provision of finance which is recognised in notional interest within finance income.
Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2013 93 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements Continued 2.
Principal accounting policies Continued v Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts, to hedge risks associated with interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations.
Derivative instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured at fair value for the reported balance sheet.
The Group designates certain hedging derivatives as either: a hedge of a highly probable forecast transaction or change in the cash flows of a recognised asset or liability a cash flow hedge, or a hedge of the exposure to change in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability a fair value hedge.
The gain or loss on remeasurement is recognised to the income statement except for cash flow hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, when the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument which is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity, and the ineffective portion in the income statement.
The gains or losses deferred in equity in this way are subsequently recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged underlying transaction or firm commitment is recognised in the income statement.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting the Group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The Group is also required to document and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis.
This effectiveness testing is reperformed at the end of each reporting period to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Where a non-derivative transaction or series of transactions with the same counterparty has the aggregate effect in substance of a derivative instrument, the transaction or series of transactions shall be recognised as a single derivative instrument at fair value with associated movements recorded in the income statement.
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than one year, and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than one year.
Derivative financial instruments deemed held for trading which do not qualify for hedge accounting are classified as a current asset or liability with any change in fair value recognised immediately in the income statement.
vi Financial instruments at fair value through profit Financial instruments at fair value through profit reflect the fair value movement of the hedged risk on a hedged item which has been designated in a fair value hedging relationship.
The fair values of these financial instruments are initially recognised on the date the hedging relationship is entered into and subsequently remeasured at each subsequent balance sheet date.
The gain or loss on remeasurement for the period is recognised in the income statement.
o Taxation including deferred tax The tax charge for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in the statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity.
In this case the tax is also recognised in the statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax is calculated on the basis of tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Management periodically evaluates tax items subject to interpretation and establishes full provisions on individual tax items where in the judgement of management the position is uncertain.
The Group includes a number of companies, including the parent company, which are part of a tax group for certain aspects of the tax legislation.
One of these aspects relates to group relief whereby current tax liabilities can be offset by current tax losses arising in other companies within the same tax group.
Payment for group relief is made equal to the tax benefit and amounts are included within the current tax disclosures.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the tax base, except if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be realised.
Deferred tax is determined using the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and expected to apply when the deferred tax liability is settled or the deferred tax asset is realised.
p Provisions Provisions are made where there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that there will be an outflow of economic benefits to settle this obligation and a reliable estimate of this amount can be made.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material the current amount of a provision is the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle obligations.
The unwinding of the discount to present value is included as notional interest within finance costs.
The Groups policies on specific provisions are: i Landfill restoration costs Provisions for the cost of restoring landfill sites are made when the obligation arises.
Where the obligation recognised as a provision gives access to future economic benefits, an asset in property, plant and equipment is recognised.
Provisions are otherwise charged against profits based on the usage of void space.
ii Environmental control and aftercare costs Environmental control and aftercare costs are incurred during the operational life of each landfill site and for a considerable period thereafter.
Provision for all such costs is made over the operational life of the site and charged to the income statement on the basis of the usage of void space at the site.
Further provisions required after the operational life of a site are recognised immediately in the income statement.
iii Onerous contracts Where the unavoidable costs of meeting a contracts obligations exceed the economic benefits derived from that contract, the unavoidable costs, less revenue anticipated under the terms of the contract, are recognised as a provision and charged to the income statement.
An impairment loss on any assets dedicated to that contract is also recognised as described in accounting policy j.
94 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2013 Group overview South West Water Viridor Group Governance Financial statements q Share capital and treasury shares Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Where the Company purchases the Companys equity share capital treasury shares the consideration paid, including any directly attributable costs, is deducted from equity until the shares are cancelled or re-issued.
Where such shares are subsequently re-issued any consideration received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, is included in equity.
The Group balance sheet includes the shares held by the Pennon Employee Share Trust, relating to employee share-based payments, which have not vested at the balance sheet date.
These are shown as a deduction from shareholders equity until such time as they vest.
r Dividend distributions Dividend distributions are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid: final dividends when approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
s Employee benefits i Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
Defined benefit pension schemes Defined benefit pension scheme assets are measured using bid price.
Defined benefit pension scheme liabilities are measured by independent actuaries who advise on the selection of Directors best estimates.
The projected unit credit method is employed and liabilities discounted at the current rate of return on high quality corporate bonds of equivalent term to the liabilities.
The increase in liabilities of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes, expected to arise from employee service in the year, is charged against operating profit.
The expected return on scheme assets and the increase during the year in the present value of scheme liabilities are shown in notional interest within finance income and cost.
Changes in benefits granted by the employer are recognised immediately as past service cost in the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience items and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in the statement of comprehensive income.
Defined contribution scheme Costs of the defined contribution pension scheme are charged to the income statement in the year in which they arise.
ii Share-based payment The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment plans for employees.
The fair value of the employee services required in exchange for the grant is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the grant.
Fair values are calculated using an appropriate pricing model.
Non market-based vesting conditions are adjusted for in assumptions as to the number of shares which are expected to vest.
t Pre-contract and development costs Pre-contract and development costs including bid costs are expensed as incurred, except where it is probable that the contract will be awarded or the development completed, in which case they are recognised as an asset which is amortised to the income statement over the life of the contract.
u Fair values The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on the market price of comparable instruments at the balance sheet date if they are publicly traded.
The fair values of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to approximate to their book values.
In the case of non-current bank loans and other loans the fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
v Transfers of assets from customers Where an item of property, plant and equipment that must be used to connect customers to the network is received from a customer, or where cash is received from a customer for the acquisition or construction of such an item, that asset is recorded and measured on initial recognition at its fair value.
The credit created by the recognition of the asset is recognised in the income statement.
The period over which the credit is recognised depends upon the nature of the service provided, as determined by the agreement with the customer.
Where the service provided is solely a connection to the network, the credit is recognised at the point of connection.
If the agreement does not specify a period, revenue is recognised over a period no longer than the economic life of the transferred asset used to provide the ongoing service.
The fair value of assets on transfer from customers is determined using a cost valuation approach allowing for depreciation.
w Foreign exchange Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated at the closing balance sheet rate.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
x Perpetual capital securities Perpetual capital securities are issued securities that qualify for recognition as equity.
Accordingly any periodic returns are accounted for as dividends and recognised directly in equity and as a liability at the time the Company becomes obligated to pay the periodic return.
This reflects the nature of the periodic returns being only made at the Companys discretion.
y Exceptional items Exceptional items are those that in the Directors view are required to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Groups financial performance.
Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2013 95 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements Continued 3.
Financial risk management a Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: liquidity risk, market risk interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk.
The Groups treasury function seeks to ensure that sufficient funding is available to meet foreseeable needs, maintains reasonable headroom for contingencies and manages inflation and interest rate risk.
The principal financial risks faced by the Group relate to liquidity, interest rate and credit counterparty risk.
These risks and treasury operations are managed by the Group Director of Finance in accordance with policies established by the Board.
Major transactions are individually approved by the Board.
Treasury activities are reported to the Board and are subject to review by internal audit.
Financial instruments are used to raise finance, manage risk, optimise the use of surplus funds and manage overall interest rate performance.
The Group does not engage in speculative activity.
i Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term committed facilities which are designed to ensure the Group has sufficient available funds for operations and planned expansions equivalent to at least one years forecast requirements at all times.
Details of undrawn committed facilities and short-term bank facilities are provided in note 28.
Refinancing risk is managed under a Group policy that permits no more than 20% of Group net borrowings to mature in any financial year.
The Group and South West Water have entered into covenants with lenders.
Whilst terms vary, these typically provide for limits on gearing primarily based on South West Water Limiteds Regulatory Capital Value and Viridor Limiteds EBITDA and interest cover.
Contractual undiscounted cash flows, including interest payments, at the balance sheet date were: Due within Due between Due between Over 1 year 1 and 2 years 2 and 5 years 5 years Total m m m m m Group 31 March 2013 Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings excluding finance lease liabilities 97.0 216.5 440.8 1,397.7 2,152.0 Interest payments on borrowings 24.5 21.8 47.6 630.4 724.3 Finance lease liabilities including interest 56.6 63.0 228.0 2,045.3 2,392.9 Derivative financial liabilities Derivative contracts net payments 19.1 26.3 26.3 8.6 80.3 31 March 2012 Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings excluding finance lease liabilities 284.8 96.1 274.8 1,371.4 2,027.1 Interest payments on borrowings 28.4 18.2 40.8 642.3 729.7 Finance lease liabilities including interest 63.8 60.8 232.2 2,214.3 2,571.1 Derivative financial liabilities Derivative contracts net payments 15.9 14.0 15.7 45.6 Company 31 March 2013 Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings 75.9 185.4 347.5 160.2 769.0 Interest payments on borrowings 15.3 12.5 19.2 12.8 59.8 31 March 2012 Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings 253.2 75.0 181.6 100.0 609.8 Interest payments on borrowings 18.2 7.6 9.5 15.0 50.3 96 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2013 Group overview South West Water Viridor Group Governance Financial statements ii Market risk The Group has a policy of maintaining at least 50% of interest-bearing liabilities at fixed rates.
The Group uses a combination of fixed rate and index-linked borrowings and fixed rate interest swaps as cash flow hedges of future variable interest payments to achieve this policy.
At the year-end 54% 2012 56% of Group net borrowings were at fixed rates including 50% of South West Waters borrowings fixed for the period to March 2015 and 19% 2012 18% index-linked, after the impact of financial derivatives.
The notional principal amounts of the interest rate swaps are used to determine settlement under those swaps and are not therefore an exposure for the Group.
These instruments are analysed in note 23.
The interest rate for index-linked debt is based upon an RPI measure which is also used in determining the amount of income from customers in South West Water.
The Group has no significant interest-bearing assets upon which the net return fluctuates from market risk.
Deposit interest receivable is expected to fluctuate in line with interest payable on floating rate borrowings.
Consequently the Groups income and cash generated from operations note 38 are independent of changes in market interest rates.
For 2013 if interest rates on variable net borrowings had been on average 0.5% higher lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year and equity would have decreased increased by 2.0 million 2012 1.3 million.
For 2013 if RPI on index-linked borrowings had been on average 0.5% higher lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year and equity would have decreased increased by 1.4 million 2012 1.3 million.
Foreign currency risk occurs at transactional and translation level from borrowings and transactions in foreign currencies.
These risks are managed through cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward contracts which provide certainty over foreign currency risk.
iii Credit risk Credit counterparty risk arises from cash and cash deposits, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as exposure to customers, including outstanding receivables.
Further information on the credit risk relating to trade receivables is given in note 22.
Counterparty risk arises from the investment of surplus funds and from the use of derivative financial instruments.
The Board has agreed a policy for managing such risk which is controlled through credit limits, counterparty approvals and rigorous monitoring procedures.
The Group has no other significant concentration of credit risk.
The Groups surplus funds are managed by the Groups treasury function and are usually placed in short-term fixed interest deposits or the overnight money markets.
Deposit counterparties must meet a credit rating threshold set by the Board of P1 Moodys or A1 Standard and Poors.
b Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to minimise the cost of capital.
The Groups policy is to have 12 months pre-funding of projected capital expenditure.
At 31 March 2013 the Group had cash and facilities, excluding restricted funds, of 1 billion.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group seeks to maintain a balance of returns to shareholders through dividends and an appropriate capital structure of debt and equity for each business segment and the Group.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net borrowings divided by total capital.
Net borrowings are analysed in note 39 and calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash deposits.
Total capital is calculated as total shareholders equity plus net borrowings.
The gearing ratios at the balance sheet date were: 2013 2012 m m Net borrowings note 39 2,008.7 2,104.6 Total equity 1,064.3 822.1 Total capital 3,073.0 2,926.7 Gearing ratio 65.4% 71.9% South West Water Limited is also monitored on the basis of the ratio of its net borrowings to Regulatory Capital Value.
Ofwats optimum range for gearing is 55% 65%.
2013 2012 m m Regulatory Capital Value 2,915.7 2,826.7 Net borrowings 1,600.3 1,584.9 Net borrowings Regulatory Capital Value 54.9% 56.1% Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2013 97 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements Continued 3.
Financial risk management Continued The Group has entered into covenants with lenders and, whilst terms vary, these typically provide for limits on gearing and interest cover.
The Group has been in compliance with its covenants during the year.
c Determination of fair values The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that ar e observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices level 2 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.
The Groups financial instruments are valued principally using level 2 measures as analysed in note 23.
The fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market for example over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
A variety of methods and assumptions are used based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term debt.
Other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The carrying values, less impairment provision, of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate to their fair values.
The fair value of financial liabilities, principally environmental provisions, is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates The Groups principal accounting policies are set out in note 2.
Management is required to exercise significant judgement and make use of estimates and assumptions in the application of these policies.
Estimates are based on factors including historical experience and expectations of future events that management believe to be reasonable.
However, given the judgemental nature of such estimates, actual results could be different from the assumptions used.
Impairment of non-financial assets and goodwill In order to determine whether impairments are required the Group estimates the recoverable amount of an individual asset or assets grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash generating units.
For the purposes of assessing impairment of goodwill, the waste management segment is considered to be a single cash generating unit as it is an integrated business and this is the lowest level to which goodwill is allocated and monitored by management.
Impairment calculations are based on projections of future cash flows for the cash generating unit and the use of a terminal value to incorporate expectations of growth after the period covered by specific plans.
The cash flows are discounted by the weighted average cost of capital appropriate to the business activity which is reviewed on an annual basis.
If the cash flow or discount rate assumptions were to change because of market conditions, the level of impairment could be different and could result in the impairment being increased or reversed, in part or in full, at a future date.
The principal assumptions used to assess impairment are set out in notes 15 and 17 of the financial statements.
Impairment of intangible assets The Group records all assets and liabilities acquired in business acquisitions, including goodwill, at fair value.
Intangible assets which have an indefinite useful life, principally goodwill, are assessed at least annually for impairment.
The initial goodwill recorded and subsequent impairment analysis require management to make estimations of future cash flows, terminal values and an assessment of the long-term pre-tax discount rate to be applied to those cash flows which reflects an assessment of the cost of capital of the cash generating unit.
Environmental and landfill restoration provisions Environmental control and aftercare costs are incurred during the operational life of each landfill site and for a considerable period thereafter.
The period of aftercare post-closure and the level of costs expected are uncertain and can vary significantly from site to site.
Key factors are the type of waste, the speed at which it decomposes, the volume of leachate requiring treatment and regulatory requirements specific to the site.
The amounts expected to be incurred have been re-assessed, re-estimated and aligned to the revised landfill site operating lives established from the anticipated decline in landfill activity.
The revised provision includes a change in the estimate of the aftercare period to 60 years after site closure 2012 30 years to align with updated technical assessment using independent external advice, as well as incorporating updated assumptions based on recent historic data and future cost estimates.
The provisions are recognised in the financial statements at the net present value of the estimated future expenditure required to settle the Groups obligations.
A discount rate is applied to recognise the time value of money and is unwound over the life of the provision.
This is included in the income statement as a financial item within finance costs.
As at 31 March 2013 the Groups environmental and landfill restoration provisions were 184.2 million note 32.
Where a restoration provision gives access to future economic benefits, an asset is recognised and depreciated in accordance with the Groups depreciation policy.
As at 31 March 2013 these assets had a net book value of 35.5 million note17.
98 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2013 Group overview South West Water Viridor Group Governance Financial statements Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes for which actuarial valuations are carried out as determined by the trustees at intervals of not more than three years.
The last valuation of the main scheme was at 31 March 2010.
The pension cost and liabilities under IAS 19 are assessed in accordance with Directors best estimates using the advice of an independent qualified actuary and assumptions in the latest actuarial valuation.
The assumptions are based on member data supplied to the actuary and market observations for interest rates and inflation, supplemented by discussions between the actuary and management.
The mortality assumption uses a scheme-specific calculation based on CMI 2009 actuarial tables with an allowance for future longevity improvement.
The principal assumptions used to measure schemes liabilities, sensitivities to changes in those assumptions and future funding obligations are set out in note 30 of the financial statements.
Taxation The Group current income tax provision of 67.0 million note 27 reflects managements judgement of the amount of tax payable for fiscal years with open tax computations where liabilities remain to be agreed with HM Revenue & Customs.
Management periodically evaluates items detailed in tax returns where the tax treatment is subject to interpretation.
The Group establishes provisions on a full basis for individual tax items where the tax position is assessed as uncertain.
Service concession arrangements Consideration from public sector entities for the operation of waste management service concessions is treated as contract receivables, split between profit on the construction of assets, operation of the service and provision of finance recognised as interest receivable.
Managements allocation between these three elements is assessed to reflect external market conditions according to the type of service provided.
Site development costs The development of waste management facilities for new projects such as Energy from Waste plants are subject to obtaining planning permissions.
Development costs are capitalised using managements assessment of the likelihood of a successful outcome for each project.
To the extent that planning permission is not received any capitalised development costs are expensed.
Landfill costs The estimation of landfill reserves is of particular importance in assessing landfill costs, since the projected cost of a landfill site is depreciated over its estimated operational life taking into account the usage of void space and gas production at the site post-closure.
In estimating the operational life of a landfill site consideration is given to the expected ongoing decline in the landfill market.
Where Viridor plans to build a competing energy from waste facility at certain existing landfill sites, void which consequently is no longer expected to be used is excluded from the calculation of operational life.
The estimates of landfill reserves are regularly reviewed and updated during the financial year for usage and other events for example site extensions.
Estimates are also subject to physical review by external advisors.
A number of factors impact on the depreciation of landfill reserves including the available void space, future capital expenditure and operating costs.
The assumptions are revised as these factors change.
The estimate of gas production at landfill sites post-closure reduces the depreciation of landfill reserves.
An assessment is undertaken for individual sites of the historic profile of gas production during landfilling activity and the projected generation post-closure according to the type of waste contained in the landfill and expected profile of gas production over time.
Useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment The carrying value of property, plant and equipment as at 31 March 2013 was 3,279.6 million note 17 and the Groups accounting policy is set out in note 2 h. In the year ended 31 March 2013 additions totalled 410.1 million and the depreciation charge was 147.7 million.
Estimated useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment are based on managements judgement and experience.
When management identifies that actual useful lives differ materially from the estimates used to calculate depreciation, the charge is adjusted prospectively.
Due to the significance of capital investment to the Group, variations between actual and estimated useful lives could impact operating results both positively and negatively.
Asset lives and residual values are reviewed annually and, except for assets subject to impairment, historically changes to remaining estimates of useful lives have not been material.
Revenue recognition The Group recognises revenue at the time of delivery of services.
Payments received in advance of services delivered are recorded as a liability.
South West Water raises bills and recognises revenue in accordance with its entitlement to receive revenue in line with the limits established by the Periodic Review price-setting process.
For water and waste water customers with water meters, revenue recognised is dependent upon the volume supplied including an estimate of the sales value of units supplied between the date of the last meter reading and the year-end.
Estimated usage is based on historic data, judgement and assumptions.
Viridor estimates income from certain contractual revenue streams based on tonnages, cost and historic data which are dependent on agreement with the customer after the delivery of the service.
Provision for doubtful debts At the balance sheet date each subsidiary evaluates the collectability of trade receivables and records provisions for doubtful debts based on experience including comparisons of the relative age of accounts and consideration of actual write-off history.
The actual level of debt collected may differ from the estimated levels of recovery.
As at 31 March 2013 the Groups current trade receivables were 212.4 million, against which 76.4 million had been provided for impairment note 22.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of Ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held in the employee share trust note 36, which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to include all dilutive potential Ordinary shares.
The Group has two types of dilutive potential Ordinary shares those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys Ordinary shares during the year: and the contingently issuable shares under the Groups Performance and Co-investment Plan and the deferred shares element of the Annual Incentive Bonus Plan, to the extent that the performance criteria for vesting of the awards are expected to be met.

Goodwill Restated note 40 m Cost: At 1 April 2011 300.4 Recognised on acquisition of subsidiaries 26.1 At 31 March 2012 326.5 Recognised on acquisition of subsidiaries note 40 12.5 At 31 March 2013 339.0 Carrying amount: At 1 April 2011 300.4 At 31 March 2012 326.5 At 31 March 2013 339.0 Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at acquisition to the cash generating unit CGU expected to benefit from that business combination.
All of the carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the waste management segment and this is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored.
Impairment testing of goodwill The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are any indications that impairment may have arisen.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined based on value-in-use calculations which, under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, require the use of base cash flow projections that reflect reasonable and supportable assumptions with specific restrictions on the estimates to be used.
These include limitations on reflecting cash flows to take account of future cost restructuring, or improvement or enhancement of asset performance.
Discount rates are required to be derived independently of the Groups capital structure and reflect managements prudent estimate of a rate that investors would require if they were to choose a similar investment.
The base cash flow projections have been derived by prudently adjusting key assumptions underlying the Groups detailed budget and strategic plan projections.
These cover a period of 7 years and are prepared as part of the annual planning cycle.
This period is believed to lead to a more realistic estimate of future cash flows than 5 years.
These plans are based on detailed market-by-market forecasts of projected volumes, prices and costs for each business activity.
These forecasts reflect, on an individual operational site basis, numerous assumptions and estimates.
The key assumptions include: anticipated changes in market size and volumes: recyclate prices: energy selling prices: gate fees: the level of future landfill tax: and cost inflation.
Management has determined the value assigned to each assumption based on historical experience, market surveys, industry analysis and current legislation.
For business activities with an indefinite life a terminal growth rate has been used.
The key assumptions which management has applied to the cash flow projections include: Assumption Basis for assumption Discount rate Pre-tax discount rates used range from 8% to 11% across the segments Discount rates have been determined based on an estimate business activities of the waste management segments weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the different risk profiles of the segments business activities to the extent that the cash flows have not already been adjusted.
Investments in joint ventures reflect an expected equity return only.
Long term growth rate 2.5% applied to periods beyond the period of the detailed projections Based on forecasts of growth in waste management markets and the UK economy.
Using managements cash flow projections on the above basis, the value-in-use of the waste management business exceeds the carrying amount by 400 million headroom.
The headroom relative to the Companys investment in the waste management business note 20 is 197 million.
A reasonably possible change, with all other variables held constant, of a 0.5% increase in discount rates, a 0.5% reduction in the long-term growth rate or a 5.0% reduction in overall net cash flows, as a result of movements in key assumptions, would reduce headroom by 133 million, 60 million and 70 million respectively.

The average remaining life is six years.
Patents are amortised over their estimated useful economic lives which at acquisition was 13 years.
The average remaining life is five years.
The carrying values of other intangible assets are reviewed annually or when events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable.
The principal assumptions used to assess impairment are set out in note 17 of the financial statements.

Asset lives and residual values are reviewed annually.
Asset transfers reclassifications include assets transferred from other non-current assets of nil million 2012 4.4 million.
During the year borrowing costs of 13.6 million 2012 3.0 million have been capitalised on qualifying assets, at an average borrowing rate of 4.5%.
Impairment testing for property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets Property, plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when any indicators of impairment are identified.
Most of the individual assets do not generate independent cash flows and as a result, for the purposes of impairment reviews, the assets are grouped into cash generating units CGUs.
The CGUs of the waste management segment comprise individual sites which constitute the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets.
The carrying value of these individual sites is compared to the recoverable amount of the CGUs, which is based predominantly on value-in-use.
Value-in-use calculations use the same base cash flow projections used for testing goodwill note 15 and are derived by adjusting the Groups detailed budget and strategic plan which cover a period of 7 years and are approved by the Board annually.
The key assumptions are the same as for the impairment testing of goodwill note 15.
For certain CGUs the recoverable amount is determined by reference to the fair value less costs to sell of the underlying assets using external and internal valuations of property and equipment and managements estimate of disposal costs.
Impairment charges of 78.2 million for property, plant and equipment and 5.8 million for other intangible assets have been identified in the waste management segment relating to certain CGUs, principally landfill 43.3 million and recycling 31.4 million activities, to reflect reduced landfill volumes and recyclate prices.
For the purposes of disclosing the results of the impairment review the CGUs have been grouped together by business activity as each CGU within a business activity exhibits a similar risk profile.
The key assumptions in the Groups detailed budget and strategic plan are the same as those used for testing goodwill note 15.
The assumptions applied to these cash flow projections are: Assumption Basis for assumption Discount rate Pre-tax discount rates used are 8% for landfill and 8.5% for recycling Discount rates have been determined based on an estimate of the waste management segments weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the different risk profiles of the segments business activities to the extent that the cash flows have not already been adjusted.
Long-term growth rate 2.5% applied to periods beyond the strategic plan period up to the end of Based on forecasts of growth in waste management markets and the life of the assets for recycling.
For landfill activities a finite life has been the UK economy.
identified based on projected volumes.
Using management cash flow projections a 0.5% increase in the discount rate or a 0.5% decrease in the estimated long-term growth rate, with all other variables held constant, would not have a material impact on the impairment charge.

Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes and also a defined contribution section within the main scheme.
The assets of the Groups pension schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The trustees of the funds are required to act in the best interest of the funds beneficiaries.
The appointment of schemes trustees is determined by the schemes trust documentation.
The Group has a policy for the main fund that one-half of all trustees, other than the Chairman, are nominated by members of the schemes, including pensioners.
Defined contribution schemes Pension costs for defined contribution schemes were 2.8 million 2012 2.7 million.
Defined benefit schemes Assumptions The principal actuarial assumptions at 31 March were: 2013 2012 % % Expected return on schemes assets 4.3 6.3 Rate of increase in pensionable pay 3.4 3.5 Rate of increase for current and future pensions 3.4 3.3 Rate used to discount schemes liabilities 4.3 4.7 Inflation 3.4 3.3 For 2013 14 IAS 19 Revised Employee Benefits will be implemented which requires the expected return on schemes assets to be the same as the rate used to discount liabilities.
Mortality Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics and experience.
The average life expectancy in years of a member having retired at age 62 on the balance sheet date is projected as: 2013 2012 Male 25.0 24.9 Female 27.0 27.0 The average life expectancy in years of a future pensioner retiring at age 62, 20 years after the balance sheet date, is projected as: 2013 2012 Male 25.9 25.8 Female 28.3 28.2 The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the schemes liabilities are: Impact on Change in schemes assumption liabilities Rate of increase in pensionable pay 0.5% 1.3% Rate of increase in current and future pensions 0.5% 6.6% Rate used to discount schemes liabilities 0.5% 9.2% Inflation 0.5% 8.3% Life expectancy 1 year 3.6% Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2013 123 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements Continued 30.

Expected returns on equity and property investments reflected long-term rates of return experienced in the respective markets.
Expected yields on fixed interest investments were based on gross redemption yields as at the balance sheet date.
In conjunction with its investment advisors, the trustees have structured the schemes investments with the objective of balancing investment returns and levels of risk.
The asset allocation for the main scheme has three principal elements: holding of bonds which is expected to be less volatile than most other asset classes and reflects the schemes liabilities a proportion of equities, with fund managers having freedom in making investment decisions to maximise returns investment of a relatively small proportion of the schemes assets in alternative asset classes which give the potential for diversification currently property and diversified growth.
The liabilities of the defined benefit schemes are measured by using the projected unit credit method which is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the scheme liabilities make allowance for projected increases in pensionable pay.

The Group paid no deficit recovery contributions to the main scheme during the year 2012 35 million since all payments up to 31 March 2015 under the existing schedule of contributions have been made.
The Group monitors funding levels on an annual basis and expects to pay total contributions of around 14 million during the year ended 31 March 2014.

The majority of the Groups deferred tax liability is expected to be recovered over more than one year.
The majority of the Companys deferred tax asset is expected to be recovered over more than one year.
All deferred tax assets and liabilities within the same jurisdiction are offset.
The deferred tax balance has been reduced by a credit of 10.6 million to recognise the changes in the rate of corporation tax enacted on 17 July 2012 to reduce the rate from 1 April 2013 from 24% to 23%.
This credit includes a credit of 12.7 million recognised in the income statement and a debit of 2.1 million recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
If the Government proposals contained in the Financial Bill 2013 to reduce the rate of corporation tax by a further 2% for the financial year 2014 and a further 1% for the financial year 2015 had been enacted at the balance sheet date, the impact would have been a further reduction of approximately 32 million.
