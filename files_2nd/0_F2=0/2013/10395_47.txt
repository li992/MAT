In addition the group has 0.7m 2012: 0.4m of capital losses.
The UK Government announced a reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 24% to 23% from 1 April 2013, which was substantively enacted on 3 July 2012.
The reduction in the balance sheet carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the rate of tax at which those assets are expected to reverse has resulted in a deferred tax credit of 0.1m to the income statement.
The UK Government has indicated that it intends to enact further reductions in the main tax rate of 3% down to 20% by 1 April 2015.
Future rate reductions would further reduce the UK deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised but the actual impact will be dependent on the deferred tax position at the time.
