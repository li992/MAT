Impairment Upstream During 2013, the Upstream segment recognized impairment losses of $1,255 million.
The main elements were impairment losses of $251 million and $159 million relating to the Browse project in Australia and the Mad Dog Phase 2 project in the Gulf of Mexico respectively, resulting from the selection of alternative development scenarios for both projects: write-downs of a number of assets in the North Sea, caused by increases in expected decommissioning costs, amounting to $253 million in aggregate: a $134-million write-down of pipelines in the North Sea due to cost increases: a $122-million write-down to fair value less costs to sell based on expected proceeds resulting from a decision to divest our interest in the Polvo field in Brazil: and other impairment losses amounting to $335 million in total that were not individually significant.
These impairment losses were partly offset by reversals of impairment of certain of our interests in Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico, and the North Sea amounting to $226 million in total, triggered by reductions in expected decommissioning costs, partly as a result of an increase in the discount rate for provisions.
During 2012, the Upstream segment recognized impairment losses of $3,046 million.
The main elements were a $1,082-million write-down of our interests in the Fayetteville and Woodford shale gas assets in the US, due to reserves revisions, lower values being attributed to recent market transactions and a fall in the gas price: a $999-million impairment loss relating to the decision to suspend the Liberty project in Alaska: a $706-million aggregate write-down of a number of assets, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea, caused by increases in the decommissioning provision resulting from continued review of the expected decommissioning costs: a $144-million write-down of certain gas storage assets in Europe due to changes to the European gas market: and other impairment losses amounting to $116 million in total that were not individually significant.
These impairment losses were partly offset by reversals of impairment of certain of our interests in the Gulf of Mexico amounting to $222 million, triggered by a decision to divest assets: and other reversals of impairment amounting to $67 million in total that were not individually significant.
During 2011, the Upstream segment recognized impairment losses of $1,443 million.
The main elements were a $555-million impairment loss relating to a number of our interests in the Gulf of Mexico, caused by an increase in the decommissioning provision as a result of further assessments of the regulations relating to idle infrastructure and a decrease in our assumption of the discount rate for provisions: the $393-million write-down of our interest in the Fayetteville shale gas asset in the US, triggered by a decrease in value by reference to a sale transaction by a partner of its interest in the same asset: and the $153-million write-down of our interest in the proposed Denali gas pipeline in Alaska, resulting from a decision not to proceed with the project.
There were several other impairment losses amounting to $342 million in total that were not individually significant.
These impairment losses were partly offset by reversals of impairment of certain of our interests in the Gulf of Mexico and Egypt amounting to $146 million in total, triggered by an increase in our assumption of long-term oil prices.

During 2012, the Downstream segment recognized impairment losses of $2,892 million largely related to assets held for sale for which sales prices had been agreed, see Note 4 for further information.
This impairment loss included $1,552 million relating to the Texas City refinery and associated assets and $1,042 million relating to the Carson refinery and associated assets.
During 2011, the Downstream segment recognized impairment losses of $599 million, of which $398 million related to assets classified as held for sale.
