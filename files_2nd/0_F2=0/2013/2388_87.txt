Note 19 outlines the management of risk aspects for currency risk.
For cash flow hedges the group only claims hedge accounting for the intrinsic value on the currency with any fair value attributable to time value taken immediately to the income statement.
The pre-tax amount reclassified from equity and recognized in the income statement in production and manufacturing expenses was a loss of $4 million 2012 $62 million loss and 2011 $195 million gain.
The amount reclassified from equity and recognized in the carrying amount of non-financial assets was a loss of $17 million 2012 $19 million loss and 2011 $13 million gain.
The amounts remaining in equity at 31 December 2013 in relation to these cash flow hedges consist of deferred gains of $85 million maturing in 2014, deferred losses of $23 million maturing in 2015 and deferred gains of $10 million maturing in 2016 and beyond.
At 31 December 2012, BP had entered into three agreements to sell its 50% interest in TNK-BP and acquire 18.5% of Rosneft, as described in Note 6.
During the period from signing until completion on 21 March 2013, these agreements represented derivative financial instruments that were required to be measured at fair value.
BP designated two of the agreements, for the acquisition of a 5.66% shareholding in Rosneft from Rosneftegaz, and for the acquisition of a 9.80% shareholding from Rosneft, as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge, and so changes in the fair values of these agreements were recognized in other comprehensive income.
The third agreement, under which BP sold its 50% interest in TNK-BP in exchange for cash and a 3.04% shareholding in Rosneft, was also a derivative financial instrument, but its fair value could not be reliably measured.
An asset of $1,410 million related to these agreements was recognized on the balance sheet at 31 December 2012, of which $1,339 million related to the fair value of the cash flow hedge derivatives.
The derivatives measured at fair value at 31 December 2012 were categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy using inputs that included the quoted Rosneft share price.
During 2013, a charge of $2,061 million was recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to these agreements and $4 million was recognized in the income statement.
The resulting cumulative charge of $651 million recognized in other comprehensive income would only be recognized in the income statement if the investment in Rosneft were either sold or impaired.
The cash flow hedge derivatives were valued using the quoted Rosneft share price at the time the deal completed, of $7.60 per share.
Fair value hedges At 31 December 2013, the group held interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate risk on fixed rate debt issued by the group.
The effectiveness of each hedge relationship is quantitatively assessed and demonstrated to continue to be highly effective.
The loss on the hedging derivative instruments recognized in the income statement in 2013 was $1,240 million 2012 $536 million gain and 2011 $328 million gain offset by a gain on the fair value of the finance debt of $1,228 million 2012 $537 million loss and 2011 $327 million loss.
The interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps mature within one to 10 years, with an average maturity of four to five years 2012 four to five years and are used to convert sterling, euro, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and Hong Kong dollar denominated borrowings primarily into US dollar floating rate debt.
Note 19 outlines the groups approach to interest rate and currency risk management.
