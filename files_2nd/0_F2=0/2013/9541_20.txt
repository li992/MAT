28 Lonmin Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Performance Mining Operations IN THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2013, MARIKANA UNDERGROUND OPERATIONS DELIVERED THEIR BEST PERFORMANCE IN THE LAST SIX YEARS.
GIVEN THE ISSUES AT THE END OF LAST YEAR, THIS IS A WELCOME ACHIEVEMENT.
We maintained the momentum established at the Importantly our investment and focus on Saffy has beginning of the financial year and achieved an begun to yield positive rewards, as production for the impressive result, to mine a total of 11.7 attributable year reached 1.15 million tonnes a 28.1% increase million tonnes during the year, an increase of 1.3 million from last year as its ore reserve position increased by tonnes from 2012.
108.7% year on year in line with plans to ramp up production at this shaft.
Notwithstanding this It is important to read these results, however, within encouraging increase in production, the ramp up at the context of the six week stoppage and early ramp Saffy has been slower than planned as it continued up of late 2012, which affects year on year to face poor ground conditions and follows a process comparisons favourably for 2013. of stringent roof support systems.

Only K3 Shaft UG2 Karee operations, comprised of K3, 4B 1B and K4, Decline project, Saffy Shaft and Rowland Shaft were mined 4.95 million tonnes during 2013, an increase allocated capital funds to continue with ore reserve of 12.9%.
K3, our largest shaft, increased by 17.2% development projects that are currently in execution.

The decision to introduce hybrid mining continues to deliver positive results.
The roll-out of the hybrid crews will be further pursued in 2014.
