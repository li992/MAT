In accordance with Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
In accordance with FRS 1 Cash Flow Statements, the Company is exempt from preparing its own Cash Flow Statement.
Going concern The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, based on the Directors opinion, after making reasonable enquiries, that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the result for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the Balance Sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19 Deferred Tax.

The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRS 17 Retirement benefits, accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
Refer to Note i for the additional disclosures required by FRS 17.
Foreign currencies The Company enters into forward exchange contracts and options to mitigate the currency exposures that arise on sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies.
Transactions in foreign currencies are converted into Sterling at the rate ruling on the date of the transaction.

The fair value of options granted after 7November 2002 and those not yet vested as at 1 April 2005 is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted toreflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to market conditions.
When options are granted to employees of subsidiaries of the Company, the fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense in the Financial Statements of the subsidiary undertaking together with the capital contribution received.
In the Financial Statements of the Company, the options granted are recognised as an investment in subsidiary undertakings with a corresponding increase in equity.
Dividends on shares presented within shareholders funds Dividends unpaid at the Balance Sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the Financial Statements.
