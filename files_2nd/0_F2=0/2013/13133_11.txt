70 Redrow plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 1.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Management considers the key sources of estimation uncertainty and critical accounting judgements relate to: Carrying value of inventories The Group carries inventories at the lower of cost and net realisable value less cash on account.
Due to the nature of development timescales, it is routinely necessary to estimate costs to complete and future revenues and to allocate nonunit specific development costs between units legally completing in the current financial year and in future periods.
A full review of the net realisable value of inventories was undertaken by the Group as at 30 June 2013.
Pensions The Group has utilised assumptions including a rate of return on assets, mortality assumptions and a discount rate having been advised by its actuary.
To the extent that such assumed rates are different from what actually transpires, the retirement benefit obligations of the Group would change.

e. Retirement benefit schemes The Redrow Staff Pension Scheme the Scheme comprises two sections: a funded, selfadministered, defined benefit section and a funded defined contribution section.
The defined benefit section was closed to all new entrants from July 2006, having been closed to all but a limited number of agreed new entrants from October 2001.
Both sections of the Scheme were closed to future accrual with effect from 1 March 2012.
The total pension charge for the year was 5.4m 2012: charge of 10.7m.
A charge of 1.8m related to the defined benefit section of the Scheme 2012: charge of 8.5m, with 0.1m being credited to the income statement 2012: charge of 0.6m and a charge of 1.9m to the statement of comprehensive income 2012: charge of 7.9m.
The charge arising from the defined contribution section was 3.6m 2012: 2.2m.

Employees continued e. Retirement benefit schemes continued Triennial valuation A full independent triennial actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section of the Scheme was undertaken at 1 July 2011.
The method used was the Projected Unit Method.
In the opinion of the Actuary, there was a deficit of 9.8m in the defined benefit section of the Scheme, with the value of the Schemes assets representing 90% of the Schemes liabilities.
As at 1 July 2011 the value of the defined benefit section of the Schemes assets was 83.7m.
The previous triennial valuation was undertaken as at 1 July 2008 and reported a surplus of 9.9m.
Defined benefit scheme IAS 19 valuation Redrow has a policy of recognising all actuarial gains and losses for its defined benefit plan in the period in which they occur, outside the income statement, in the statement of comprehensive income.
This disclosure relates to the defined benefit section of the Scheme.
The Schemes assets are held separately from the assets of Redrow and are administered by the trustees and managed professionally.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section was carried out at 1 July 2011.
This valuation has been updated to 30 June 2013 by a qualified actuary for the purposes of these accounts.
The Group expects to contribute 0.5m to the Scheme in the year ending 30 June 2014.
The major financial assumptions used in arriving at the IAS 19 valuation were: 2013 2012 Long term rate of increase in pensionable salaries n a n a 1 Rate of increase of benefits in payment lesser of 5% per annum and RPI 3.4% 3.1% 2 Rate of increase of benefits in payment lesser of 2.5% per annum and RPI 2.2% 2.2% Discount rate 4.7% 4.6% Inflation assumption RPI 3.6% 3.2% CPI 2.6% 2.2% Expected return on assets 5.9% 5.4% 1 In respect of pensions in excess of the guaranteed minimum pension earned prior to 30 June 2006.
2 In r espect of pensions in excess of the guaranteed minimum pension earned after 30 June 2006.
Other pension increases are valued in a consistent manner.
The expected return on assets assumption has been derived by considering the appropriate return for each of the main asset classes listed below.
The yields assumed on bond type investments are based on published redemption yields at the balance sheet date.
The assumed return on equities, property and diversified growth funds reflects an assumed allowance for the outperformance of these asset classes over UK Government bonds in the long term.
The rates of return are shown net of investment manager expenses.
The mortality tables used in the actuarial valuation were as follows which make allowance for projected further improvements in mortality : For male members: SIN X A CMI 2010 1% Long Term Trend The life expectancies implied by these tables for typical members are: Pensioner currently aged 65: Male 22.3 years Future pensioner when aged 65: Male 23.3 years It has been assumed that the majority of members will commute part of their pension in return for a tax free cash sum on retirement.
The Scheme closed to future benefit accrual on 29 February 2012.
Prior to the closure, active members received pensionable salary increases which were capped each year at the Retail Price Index RPI or 2.5% if lower.
Deferred pensions are assumed to increase in line with the Consumer Price Index CPI.
At the date the Scheme closure was effected, the best estimate of future CPI was almost identical to the salary growth assumption, hence the closure does not result in any curtailment item.
In 2012 an enhanced transfer value exercise was completed: approximately 3.5m was paid in transfer values to settle the benefits of approximately 70 members.
The liability under IAS 19 of these members was approximately 3.2m.
Therefore the exercise resulted in a settlement loss of 0.3m recognised in 2012.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities The following are the deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised by the Group and the movements thereon during the current and prior year: Share Short term Losses Employee Imputed Hedge based temporary carried benefits interest reserve payment differences forward Total m m m m m m m Deferred tax assets At 1 July 2011 0.2 2.2 0.1 0.7 60.6 63.8 Credit charge to income 0.2 1.7 14.5 12.6 Credit to equity 0.6 0.6 At 1 July 2012 0.8 2.4 0.1 2.4 46.1 51.8 Charge credit to income 0.2 2.3 18.6 16.5 Credit to equity 0.5 0.5 At 30 June 2013 1.1 2.4 0.1 4.7 27.5 35.8 Share Short term Losses Employee Imputed Hedge based temporary carried benefits interest reserve payment differences forward Total m m m m m m m Deferred tax liabilities At 1 July 2011 1.3 0.5 1.8 Charge to income 0.2 0.2 Credit to equity 1.3 1.3 At 1 July 2012 0.7 0.7 Credit to income 0.2 0.2 Credit to equity At 30 June 2013 0.5 0.5 The Group has no material unrecognised deferred tax assets.
The deferred tax balances in the Company relate to a deferred tax asset arising on retirement benefit obligations of 4.2m 2012: 3.9m.
The Group has considered carefully the extent to which it is probable that future taxable profit will be available resulting in taxable amounts against which the carried forward tax losses could be utilised.
The basis for supporting the recognition of the deferred tax asset is as follows: i.
Historic profitability The Group floated in May 1994 and, prior to the financial year ended June 2008, had never made a loss before tax since flotation or during the five years prior to flotation which provides evidence of historic profitability.
Identifiable causes of the losses and likelihood of reoccurrence The carried forward tax losses arise primarily from the exceptional net realisable value provisions created in 2008 and 2009 and to a lesser extent the trading losses in 2009 arising from the challenging housing market conditions.
The provisions principally arise from the reductions in house prices and the reduced rate of sales which have reduced land values.
Whilst the housing market remains uncertain, short of a collapse of market conditions from those experienced to date during 2013, material provisioning is not anticipated to reoccur regularly into the future.
Financial forecasts demonstrating a return to profitability The Groups medium term financial forecasting model has been reviewed.
This forecasts increased profitability building on the profitable performance in 2012 and 2013 and the deferred tax asset being utilised in the medium term.
A Corporation Tax rate of 23% from 1 April 2013 was substantively enacted on 3 July 2012.
Accordingly deferred tax balances have been revalued to the lower rate of 23% in these financial statements.
The Government has announced that it intends to further reduce the rate of Corporation Tax to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014 and 20% from 1 April 2015.
As this legislation was not substantively enacted by 30 June 2013, the impact of the anticipated rate change is not reflected in the tax provisions reported in these financial statements.
If the deferred tax assets of the Group at 30 June 2013 were all to reverse after April 2015, the effect of the future changes from 23% to 20% would be to reduce the deferred tax asset by 4.7m.
To the extent that the deferred tax reverses more quickly than this, the impact on the deferred tax asset will be reduced.

They represent the creation of additional provisions against sites acquired pre June 2009 and the reduction of provisions already in place against such sites as required i. e. a reallocation of the quantum of provision amongst sites where provisions already exist.
Financial risk management The Groups financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents, bank loans and overdrafts, derivative financial instruments and various items included within trade receivables and trade payables which arise during the normal course of business.
The tables below provide a summary of financial assets and liabilities by category.
The accounting policies for financial instruments have been applied to the following items: The Group 2013 2012 Loans and Loans and receivables receivables m m Assets per the balance sheet Noncurrent trade and other receivables 25.4 26.0 Current trade and other receivables 23.3 25.0 Cash and cash equivalents 39.0 37.4 87.7 88.4 2013 2012 Other Other financial 2013 financial 2012 liabilities Total liabilities Total m m m m Liabilities per the balance sheet Bank loans and overdrafts 130.0 130.0 51.4 51.4 Trade payables and other payables 134.7 134.7 114.8 114.8 Land creditors 124.3 124.3 108.3 108.3 389.0 389.0 274.5 274.5 Other financial liabilities are at amortised cost.

Where no such price is readily available then fair value is determined by discounting net forward cash flows at a risk adjusted rate.
All financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorised at level 2 within the hierarchical classification of IFRS 7 Revised.
The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks.
Financial risk management is conducted centrally using policies approved by the Board.
Market risk is negligible due to the Groups limited exposure to equity securities some limited exposure arises through the Redrow Staff Pension Schemes investment portfolio and the associated price risk.
Its foreign exchange exposure is negligible given the nature of the Groups business and its exclusive UK activities.
Liquidity risk and interest rate risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations as they fall due.
Liquidity risks are managed through the regular review of cash forecasts and by maintaining adequate committed banking facilities to ensure appropriate headroom.
At 30 June 2013, the Group had total unsecured bank borrowing facilities of 202.5m, representing 200.0m committed facilities and 2.5m uncommitted facilities.
The Groups cash surpluses arise from the short term timing differences.
As a consequence the Group does not consider it bears significant risk of changes to income and cash flows as a result of movements on interest rates on its interest bearing assets.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows money at floating rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises primarily from long term borrowings.
In order to manage its interest rate risk, the Group enters into simple risk management products, almost exclusively interest rate swaps.
All interest rate swaps are sterling denominated.
The swaps are arranged so as to match with those of the underlying borrowings to which they relate.
There was no ineffectiveness to be recorded in respect of these cash flow hedges in 2013 or 2012.

The swaps had a neutral value at 30 June 2013 and 30 June 2012.
For the year ended 30 June 2013, it is estimated that a general increase of 1% in interest rates applying for the full year would decrease the Groups profit before tax by 0.7m 2012: 0.7m.
Maturity of bank loans and borrowings The maturity of bank loans and borrowings is as below: The Group 2013 2013 2012 2012 Bank Bank Bank Bank overdraft loans overdraft loans m m m m Due within one year 35.0 21.4 Due between one and two years 98.2 Due between two and five years 31.7 35.0 98.2 21.4 31.7 Maturities above include estimated interest payable to the maturity of the facilities.

The Company was fully compliant with its banking covenants as at 30 June 2013.
At the year end, the Group and Company had 105.0m 2012: 170.0m of undrawn committed bank facilities available.
There is no material difference between the fair value of the bank overdrafts and bank loans and their carrying values as shown in the balance sheet.
c. Amounts due in respect of development land The Groups policy permits land purchases to be made on deferred payment terms.
In accordance with IAS 39, the deferred creditor is recorded at fair value and nominal value is amortised over the deferment period via financing costs, increasing the land creditor to its full cash settlement value on the payment date.
The interest rate used for each deferred payment is an equivalent loan rate available on the date of land purchase, as applicable to a loan lasting for a comparable period of time to that deferment.
The maturity profile of the total contracted cash payments in respect of amounts due in respect of land creditors at the balance sheet date is as follows: Total Due Due contracted Due less between between Balance at cash than one and two and 30 June payment one year two years five years m m m m m 2013 124.3 129.1 92.1 31.2 5.8 2012 108.3 114.2 67.7 43.1 3.4 d. Maturity of trade and other payables These represent current liabilities due within one year.
e. Credit risk Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, including call deposits with banks and financial institutions, derivative financial instruments and trade receivables.
It represents the risk of financial loss where counterparties are unable to meet their obligations.
Credit risk is managed centrally in respect of cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments.
In respect of placing deposits with banks and financial institutions and funds, individual risk limits are approved by the Board.
The table below shows the cash and cash equivalents as at the balance sheet date: Group Company 2013 2012 2013 2012 m m m m Held at Banks with at least an A credit rating per Standard & Poor 39.0 37.4 41.5 39.0 37.4 41.5 No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period or subsequently and the Group does not anticipate any losses from nonperformance by these counterparties.
There is no specific concentration of credit risk in respect of home sales as the exposure is spread over a number of customers.
In respect of trade receivables, the amounts presented in the balance sheet are stated after adjusting for any doubtful receivables, based on the judgement of the Groups management through using both previous experience and knowledge of the current position of any more substantial receivables.

Financial risk management continued f. Capital management The Group defines total capital as equity plus net debt where net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the level of returns achieved on its capital base and, with respect to its financing structure, the gearing ratio.
This is defined as net debt divided by equity.
The Groups objective in managing capital is to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to deliver value to its Shareholders and other stakeholders.
The Group operates within policies outlined by the Board in order to maintain an appropriate funding structure.
The Board keeps the Groups capital structure under review.
No dividends were paid in the year.
