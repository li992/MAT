Financial instruments and risk management The group issues or holds financial instruments mainly to finance its operations: to finance corporate transactions such as dividends, share buybacks and acquisitions: for the temporary investment of short-term funds: and to manage the currency and interest rate risks arising from its operations and from its sources of finance.
In addition, various financial instruments, for example trade receivables and trade payables, arise directly from the groups operations.
Financial risk management The groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk : credit risk and liquidity risk.
Treasury operations The group has a centralised treasury operation whose primary role is to manage liquidity, funding, investments and counterparty credit risk arising from transactions with financial institutions.
The treasury operation also manages the groups market exposures, including risks from volatility in currency and interest rates.
The treasury operation acts as a central bank to group entities providing central deposit taking, funding and foreign exchange management services.
Funding and deposit taking is usually provided in the functional currency of the relevant entity.
The treasury operation is not a profit centre and its objective is to manage financial risk at optimum cost.
Treasury policy Treasury policy is set by the Board.
Group treasury activities are subject to a set of controls appropriate for the magnitude of the borrowing, investments and group-wide exposures.
The Board has delegated its authority to operate these policies to a series of panels that are responsible for the management of key treasury risks and operations.
Appointment to and removal from the key panels requires approval from two of the Chairman, the Chief Executive or the Group Finance Director.
The management of exposures arising from trading related financial instruments, primarily trade receivables and trade payables, is through a series of policies and procedures set at a group and line of business level.
Line of business management apply and review these policies and procedures to assess and manage the financial risk arising from these financial instruments.
There has been no change in the nature of the groups risk prole between 31 March 2013 and the date of approval of these financial statements.
Interest rate risk management Management policy The group has interest-bearing financial assets and liabilities which may expose the group to either cash ow or fair value volatility.
The groups policy, as set by the Board, is to ensure that at least 70% of net debt is at xed rates.
Short-term interest rate management is delegated to the treasury operation while long-term interest rate management decisions require further approval by the Group Finance Director, Director Treasury, Tax and Risk Management or the Treasurer BT Group who have been delegated such authority from the Board.
Hedging strategy In order to manage the groups interest rate prole, the group has entered into cross-currency and interest rate swap agreements with commercial banks and other institutions to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are xed.
The duration of the swap agreements matches the duration of the debt instruments.
The majority of the groups long-term borrowings have been, and are, subject to xed Sterling interest rates after applying the impact of these hedging instruments.
Sensitivities Interest rates The group is exposed to volatility in the income statement and shareholders equity arising from changes in interest rates.
To demonstrate this volatility, management have concluded that a 1% increase in interest rates and parallel shift in yield curves across Sterling, US Dollar and Euro currencies is a reasonable benchmark for performing a sensitivity analysis.
Financial instruments and risk management continued After the impact of hedging, the groups main exposure to interest rate volatility in the income statement arises from fair value movements on certain derivatives not in hedge relationships, oating rate borrowings, investments and cash equivalents which are largely inuenced by Sterling interest rates.
With all other factors remaining constant at 31 March 2013, a 1% increase in Sterling interest rates would increase the groups annual net finance expense by approximately 4m 2011 12: 7m.
The groups main exposure to interest rate volatility within shareholders equity arises from fair value movements on derivatives held in the cash ow reserve.
The derivatives have an underlying interest exposure to Sterling, Euro and US Dollar rates.
With all other factors remaining constant and based on the composition of derivatives included in the cash ow reserve at the balance sheet date, a 1% increase in interest rates in each of the currencies would impact equity, before tax, as detailed below: 2013 2012 m m Increase Increase At 31 March Reduce Reduce Sterling interest rates 418 435 US Dollar interest rates 420 406 Euro interest rates 36 66 A 1% decrease in interest rates would have broadly the same impact in the opposite direction.
Credit ratings The groups 2016 and 2030 bonds contain covenants which have required the group to pay higher rates of interest once the group ceased to be rated at least A3 in the case of Moodys or at least A in the case of Standard & Poors S&P.
Additional interest of 0.25% per year accrues for each ratings category downgrade by each agency below those levels from the next coupon date following a downgrade.
Based on the total notional value of debt outstanding of 2.5bn at 31 March 2013, the groups finance expense would increase decrease by approximately 12m a year if BTs credit rating were to be downgraded upgraded, respectively, by one credit rating category by both agencies from the current ratings.
The groups 600m 2014 bond attracts an additional 1.25% for a downgrade by one credit rating below Baa3 BBB by either or both Moodys and S&P, respectively.
This would result in an additional finance expense of approximately 6m per year.
The groups credit ratings were as detailed below: 2013 2012 At 31 March Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Rating agency Standard & Poors BBB Stable BBB Stable Moodys Baa2 Positive Baa2 Stable The group is targeting a BBB Baa1 credit rating over the medium term.
Foreign exchange risk management Management policy The purpose of the groups foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the group from the risk that eventual future net inows and net outows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
The Boards policy for foreign exchange risk management defines the type of transactions which should normally be covered, including significant operational, funding and currency interest exposures, and the period over which cover should extend for the different types of transactions.
Short-term foreign exchange management is delegated to the treasury operation whilst longterm foreign exchange management decisions require further approval from the Group Finance Director, Director Treasury, Tax and Risk Management or the Treasurer BT Group who have been delegated such authority by the Board.
The policy delegates authority to the Director Treasury, Tax and Risk Management to take positions of up to 100m and for the Group Finance Director to take positions of up to 1bn.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Hedging strategy A significant proportion of the groups external revenue and costs arise within the UK and are denominated in Sterling.
The groups non-UK operations generally trade and are funded in their functional currency which limits their exposure to foreign exchange volatility.
Foreign currency borrowings used to finance the groups operations have been predominantly swapped into Sterling using cross-currency swaps.
Foreign currency borrowings comprised: 2013 2012 At 31 March m m Euro 2,690 3,341 US Dollar 3,996 3,543 Other 1 6,686 6,885 The currency prole of these borrowings after the impact of hedging is disclosed in note 24.
The group also enters into forward currency contracts to hedge foreign currency investments, interest expense, capital purchases and purchase and sale commitments on a selective basis.
The commitments hedged are principally denominated in US Dollar, Euro and Asia Pacic region currencies.
As a result, the groups exposure to foreign currency arises mainly on its non-UK subsidiary investments and on residual currency trading ows.
Sensitivities Foreign exchange rates After hedging, with all other factors remaining constant and based on the composition of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, the groups exposure to foreign exchange volatility in the income statement from a 10% strengthening weakening in Sterling against other currencies would result in a charge credit respectively of approximately 2m 2011 12: credit charge of approximately 8m.
The groups main exposure to foreign exchange volatility within shareholders equity excluding translation exposures arises from fair value movements on derivatives held in the cash ow reserve.
The majority of foreign exchange uctuations in the cash ow reserve are recycled immediately to the income statement to match the hedged item and therefore the groups exposure to foreign exchange uctuations in equity was insignicant in both 2012 13 and 2011 12.
Liquidity risk management Management policy The group ensures its liquidity is maintained by entering into short, medium and long-term financial instruments to support operational and other funding requirements.
The group determines its liquidity requirements by the use of both short and long-term cash forecasts.
These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom analysis which is used to assess funding adequacy for at least a 12-month period.
On at least an annual basis the Board reviews and approves the maximum long-term funding of the group and on an ongoing basis considers any related matters.
Short and medium-term requirements are regularly reviewed and managed by the treasury operation within the parameters of the policies set by the Board.
Renancing risk is managed by limiting the amount of borrowing that matures within any specified period and having appropriate strategies in place to manage renancing needs as they arise.
The maturity prole of the groups loans and borrowings at 31 March 2013 is disclosed in note 24.
The group has term debt maturities of 0.3bn in 2013 14.
During 2012 13 and 2011 12 the group issued commercial paper and held cash, cash equivalents and current investments in order to manage short-term liquidity requirements.
At 31 March 2013 the group has undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 1.5bn 2011 12: 1.5bn maturing in March 2016.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Maturity analysis The following table provides an analysis of the remaining contractually agreed cash ows including interest payable for the groups non-derivative financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis, which therefore differs from both the carrying value and fair value.

b Foreign currency-related cash ows were translated at closing rates as at the relevant reporting date.
Credit risk management Management policy The groups exposure to credit risk arises from financial instruments transacted by the treasury operation primarily derivatives, investments, cash and cash equivalents and from its trading-related receivables.
For treasury-related balances, the Boards dened policy restricts exposure to any one counterparty by setting credit limits based on the credit quality as dened by Moodys and S&P and by dening the types of financial instruments which may be transacted.
The minimum credit ratings permitted with counterparties are A3 A for long-term and P1 A1 for shortterm investments.
The treasury operation continuously reviews the limits applied to counterparties and will adjust the limit according to the nature and credit standing of the counterparty up to the maximum allowable limit set by the Board.
Where multiple transactions are undertaken with a single counterparty, or group of related counterparties, the group may enter into netting arrangements to reduce the groups exposure to credit risk by making use of standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA documentation.
The group also seeks collateral or other security where it is considered necessary.
The treasury operation regularly reviews the credit limits applied when investing with counterparties in response to market conditions, continues to monitor their credit quality and actively manages any exposures which arise.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Operational management policy The groups credit policy for trading-related financial assets is applied and managed by each of the lines of business to ensure compliance.
The policy requires that the creditworthiness and financial strength of customers is assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis.
Payment terms are set in accordance with industry standards.
The group will also enhance credit protection, when appropriate, taking into consideration the groups exposure to the customer, by applying processes which include netting and offsetting, and requesting securities such as deposits, guarantees and letters of credit.
The group takes proactive steps including constantly reviewing credit ratings of relationship banks to minimise the impact of adverse market conditions on trading-related financial assets.
Exposures The maximum credit risk exposure of the groups financial assets at the balance sheet date is as follows: 2013 2012 At 31 March Notes m m Derivative financial assets 1,250 1,023 Investments 22 595 581 a Trade and other receivables 16 2,178 2,477 Cash and cash equivalents 23 924 331 4,947 4,412 a The carrying amount excludes 184m 2011 12: 169m of non-current trade and other receivables which relate to non-financial assets, and 699m 2011 12: 830m of prepayments and other receivables.

The concentration of credit risk for trading balances of the group is provided in note 16, which analyses outstanding balances by line of business.
The derivative financial assets were held with 14 counterparties at 31 March 2013 2011 12: nine counterparties.
After applying the legal right of set-off under the groups ISDA documentation, the group had a net exposure to derivative counterparties of 910m 2011 12: 705m of which 90% 2011 12: 98% was with four counterparties 2011 12: six.
The group has credit support agreements with certain swap counterparties whereby on a weekly and monthly basis the fair value position on notional 945m of long dated cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps is collateralised.
As at 31 March 2013, the group had paid cash collateral of 26m 2011 12: 22m in respect of fair value losses and had received cash collateral of 385m 2011 12: 350m in respect of fair value gains.
The related net cash inow, including foreign exchange of 2m 2011 12: 20m is 33m 2011 12: 258m.
The collateral paid and received is recognised within cash and cash equivalents, and loans and other borrowings, respectively.

The carrying amounts are included in the group balance sheet under the indicated headings.
The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of financial assets and liabilities are as follows: the carrying amount of investments classied as loans and receivables equates to fair value due to the short maturity of the investments held the carrying amount of trade receivables and payables approximates to fair values due to the short maturity of amounts receivable and payable the fair value of the groups bonds and other long-term borrowings are estimated on the basis of quoted market prices for the same or similar issues with the same maturities where they exist and on calculations of the value of future cash ows using approximate discount rates in effect at the balance sheet date where market prices of similar issues do not exist the fair value of the groups outstanding swaps and foreign exchange contracts are estimated using discounted cash ow models and market rates of interest and foreign exchange at the balance sheet date.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Fair value hierarchy Financial instruments measured at fair value at 31 March 2013 consist of derivative financial instruments and investments classied as availablefor-sale or designated at fair value through profit and loss under IAS 39 and are further analysed by the level of valuation input.
The three levels of valuation methodology used are: Level 1 uses quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 uses inputs for the asset or liability other than quoted prices, that are observable either directly or indirectly Level 3 uses inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data, such as internal models or other valuation methods.
Derivative financial instruments The fair value of the groups outstanding derivative financial assets and liabilities consisted of swaps and foreign exchange contracts and were estimated using discounted cash ow models and market rates of interest and foreign exchange at the balance sheet date.
All derivative financial instruments are categorised at Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Investments Non-current investments analysed at Level 1 consisted of listed available-for-sale investments of 45m 2011 12: 31m and listed investments of 11m 2011 12: 10m designated at fair value through profit and loss.
The groups listed investments were measured at fair value using quoted market prices for identical assets.
530m 2011 12: 505m of current asset available-for-sale investments were measured using Level 2 valuation methods.
The fair value of 8m 2011 12: 27m of non-current investments classied as available-for-sale was determined using Level 3 valuation methods.
A reconciliation of the movements in balances measured using Level 3 valuation methods is presented below: m At 1 April 2011 and 1 April 2012 27 Disposals 19 At 31 March 2013 8 There were no losses recognised in the income statement in respect of Level 3 assets held at 31 March 2013.
Hedging activities Our hedging policies use derivative financial instruments to manage financial risk.
Derivatives that are held as hedging instruments are formally designated as hedges as dened in IAS 39.
Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes if they meet the criteria for designation as fair value hedges or cash ow hedges in accordance with IAS 39.
Fair value hedges Fair value hedges principally consist of interest rate and cross-currency swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair value of xed-rate, long-term financial instruments due to movements in market interest rates.
Gains and losses arising on fair value hedges are disclosed in note 25.
Cash ow hedges Cash ow hedges principally consist of interest rate and cross-currency swaps that are used to hedge the variability in future interest and currency cash ows on assets and liabilities which bear interest at variable rates and or are in a foreign currency.
Forward foreign currency contracts are used to hedge anticipated and committed future currency cash ows.
Where these contracts qualify for hedge accounting they are designated as cash ow hedges.
