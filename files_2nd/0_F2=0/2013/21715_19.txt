INVESTMENT INFORMATION Investment Objective and Policy The investment objective of the Company is to seek to provide consistent long-term capital growth through an investment policy of investing substantially all of its assets in AllBlue or any successor vehicle of AllBlue.
Accordingly, the Companys published investment policy is consistent with that of AllBlue.
In the event that AllBlue changes its investment policy without Shareholder approval, the Directors will consider removing the Companys assets from AllBlue or taking other appropriate action so that the Company is not in breach of any applicable regulation.
AllBlue Limited AllBlue is a fund incorporated in the Cayman Islands with an investment objective to provide consistent long-term appreciation of its assets through investment in a diversified portfolio of underlying funds.
Investors in the Company are therefore offered an opportunity to participate indirectly in the same investment portfolio as that of AllBlue.
