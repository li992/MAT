Group financial statements Notes to the Company financial statements Overview Strategic report Governance Further information Notes to the Company financial statements A Accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis which assumes that the Company will continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accounting convention and basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom UK GAAP.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 from presenting its own profit and loss account.
The profit after tax dealt with in the accounts of Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc, determined in accordance with the Act was 36.7m 2012: 97.1m.
Under FRS 1 revised Cash Flow Statements, the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement as its cash flows are included within the published consolidated cash flow statement of Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group contain financial instruments disclosures and comply with FRS 29 Financial Instruments Disclosures.
Consequently the Company has taken advantage of certain exemptions in FRS 29 from the requirement to present separate financial instrument disclosures for the Company.
The Company is also exempt under the terms of the revised FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures from disclosing related party transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries within the Group.
Investments In the Companys financial statements, investments in subsidiary and associated undertakings are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Dividends received and receivable are credited to the Companys profit and loss account.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less depreciation and are depreciated to their residual values on a straight line basis over their useful economic lives.
Capital expenditure on computer software development is recorded separately within fixed assets as capital work in progress.
Once the project is completed the balance is transferred to computer software.
Capital work in progress is not depreciated.
Cash and liquid resources Cash comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand less overdrafts payable on demand.
135 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2013 Notes to the Company financial statements continued Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account deferred taxation because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Except as otherwise required by accounting standards, full provision without discounting is made for all timing differences, which have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences arise when items on income and expenditure are included in tax computations in periods different from their inclusion in the financial statements.
Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
The Company uses a fair value hedging model to designate bank loans and bonds held in overseas currencies as hedging instruments against designated overseas investments held in the same currency.
Under such fair value hedges, both the hedged item and the hedging instrument are retranslated with the exchange differences in both cases being recorded in the profit and loss account as they arise at each period end.
The Directors have reviewed the accounting treatment of the unhedged part of the investment and decided it is appropriate to recognise this at historical cost.
Share-based payment Where the Company is the settling entity for employees of subsidiaries who receive share-based payments, but the beneficiary of the services is the subsidiary, the Company recognises the fair value of the employee services received by the subsidiary as an increase in the investment in the subsidiary.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are appropriately authorised and approved for payment and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the financial statements.
Treasury shares held by employee benefit trust Transactions of the Company sponsored employee benefits trust are included in the Company financial statements.
In particular, the trusts repurchase of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.
