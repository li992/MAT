The gain relates to the release of surplus onerous contract provision which was initially established within our Decontamination business in 2010.
Since then substantial progress has been made in the turnaround of these contracts, with one of them returning to profitability in 2013.
The release of the provision in 2013 reflects this achievement along with the expectation that the remaining contract will break even, in line with plan, by the end of 2014.
The tax charge on this was 0.4 million.

These Business Lines are managed and controlled at the operating segment level and each of the operating segments has their own dedicated management team.
The internal group reporting reflects this Business Line structure.
Management monitor goodwill at operating segment level and goodwill has been allocated on this basis.
Goodwill that is specific to a particular operating segment has been included in the operating segment directly.
All other goodwill has been reallocated to the appropriate operating segments prospectively using the three-year average forecast operating cash flow of the time of the change of composition of CGUs in 2012.
Under the new business line structure, we have 23 CGUs which represents the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates independent cash flow from other groups of assets.
For the purpose of a goodwill impairment review, acquired goodwill has been allocated to nine groups of CGUs being the operating segments.
The operating segments are Workwear, Facilities, UK Flat Linen, Scandinavian Flat Linen, Germany & Austria Healthcare, Ireland, Direct Sales, Clinical Solutions and Decontamination.
St Str ra ategic tegic repo repor rt t G Go ov five ernance rnance F Fi inanc financial ial statements statments Berendsen plc Report and 133 Accounts 2013 8 Goodwill continued For reporting purposes, the goodwill has been allocated to the operating segments as outlined below.

An annual goodwill impairment test is then carried out by comparing the carrying amount of the group of CGUs to which the goodwill relates to its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of each operating segment is based on value-in-use calculations which management develop from forecast cash flows based on past performance, market data and its expectation of future market development.
These calculations require the use of estimates and the pre-tax cash flow projections are based on the groups current three-year strategic plan.
Cash flows beyond the three-year period have been extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 2% 2012: 2% and are appropriate because these are long-term businesses.
The growth rate of 2% 2012: 2% does not exceed long-term GDP estimates for countries that the group operates within.
The main assumptions on which forecast cash flows have been based are revenue, operating margin and cash growth.
Projected cash flows have been discounted using pre-tax discount rates of 11% 2012: 11%.
The discount rates reflect market assumptions for the Risk Free-rates and Equity Risk Premiums and also take into account the net cost of debt.
No reasonably foreseeable change in these assumptions would cause an impairment.
The annual impairment testing carried out in the current year showed that the recoverable amount for all groups of CGUs to which goodwill is allocated exceeded the carrying amount of the groups of CGUs.

This facility expires on 15 July 2016.
In December 2009, the group issued private placement notes of US$259 million and 25 million.
The US$259 million was immediately swapped into euros.
Berendsen plc Report and 140 Accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 15 Borrowings continued In May 2006, the group issued private placement notes of US$250 million which were immediately swapped into a basket of Danish krone, Swedish krona and euros.
For further details of the groups derivative financial instruments against its borrowings see note 16.
The private placement amounts in the table above are stated at the year end exchange rates.
As underlying currencies have been swapped from US dollars via derivative contracts, the group has a loss on financial instruments see note 16 which is offset by the currency translation gain on the underlying borrowing noted above.

In May 2006 the group placed US$250 million at fixed rates for periods between eight and twelve years and in December 2009 the group undertook a further placement of US$259 million and 25 million at fixed rates for periods between seven and twelve years.
In both placements the foreign currency amounts were immediately swapped into other currencies: Danish krone, Swedish krona and euros.
This is to offset the foreign exchange rate exposure arising on the groups foreign currency assets.
The conversion from US dollars into currency was achieved in two stages.
In the first stage swaps were taken out to convert US dollars to sterling.
All of these swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges, with the exception of one swap from the 2006 placement, which has been designated as a fair value hedge.
In the second stage further swaps were taken out to convert sterling to the required currencies.
These have been designated as hedges of net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
The fixed interest rate cross-currency contracts entered into have options exercisable by either party to terminate after five years and ten years if relevant.
The value of the swap at the time would then be cash settled.
During the year in accordance with group policy, the group entered into several forward foreign exchange contracts for the purchase of US dollars in the future at fixed rates.
These forward contracts reduce the foreign exchange exposure on the procurement of textiles and capital equipment from Far East suppliers.
Cash flow hedges The derivative asset recognised on five of these fifteen instruments is 11.8 million, of which the currency component is a loss of 2.4 million and a loss of 0.2 million taken to the hedging reserve.
The derivative liability on the ten remaining instruments is 2.6 million, of which the currency component is a loss of 3.1 million and a gain of 2.2 million taken to the hedging reserve.
The total exchange component of the cash flow hedge derivatives movement has been accounted for as a component part of currency translation 5.5 million loss.
Of this movement 2.0 million loss has been taken to the hedging reserve and will be continuously released to the income statement until the repayment of the private placement.
The forward foreign exchange contracts have resulted in the recognition of a derivative liability of 0.4 million 2012: asset of 0.2 million.
During the year a loss of 0.5 million 2012: loss of 0.3 million was recognised in equity.
This equity transfer will then be recognised in the income statement in line with the hedged transaction.
Net investment hedges The second stage of the US private placement swaps results in sterling being exchanged into Danish krone, Swedish krona and euros.
At 31 December 2013 the fixed rate borrowings vary between rates of 4.45% and 5.57% on the fixed European swaps.
The floating Danish krone swap varies against CIBOR.
These swaps are accounted for as hedges of the groups assets in the relevant countries.
The movement on the derivative liability arising has been accounted for as a component part of currency translation 14.1 million loss.
The groups borrowings under its revolving credit facilities are designated as a hedge of its European operations.
The carrying value of the borrowings as at 31 December 2013 was 136.1 million 2012: 187.7 million.
The foreign exchange loss of 0.9 million on translation is taken to reserves as a component part of currency translation.
Fair value hedges US$50 million of the 2006 US private placement was swapped into a floating Danish krone 309.1 million, via a sterling swap.
The sterling swap is dealt with as a fair value hedge.
The ineffective portion of the fair value hedge resulted in a profit of 156,526 2012: profit 171,629.
The fair value hedge has resulted in the recognition of a 2.1 million derivative asset 2012: 4.2 million.

The groups overall risk management programmes focus on the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimise potential adverse effects on the groups financial performance.
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by the group finance team under the supervision of the Chief Financial Officer under policies approved by the board of directors.
The Chief Financial Officer identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the groups operating units.
The board approves written principles for foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and credit risk, and the use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and receives regular reports on such matters.
a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk The group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
The majority of operations in the group bill their revenues and incur their costs in the same functional currency.
The group faces some currency exposure in respect of the procurement of textiles and capital equipment from Far East suppliers.
The group policy is to enter forward contracts to purchase US dollars based upon the expected purchases.
These derivatives are classified as cash flow hedges.
The groups policy is not to hedge foreign currency exposures on the translation of its overseas profit to sterling.
Where appropriate, borrowings are effectively arranged in currencies so as to provide a natural hedge against the investment in overseas net assets.
During 2013 and 2012, derivative financial instruments were used to manage foreign currency risk as follows: As at 31 December 2013 Sterling Euro US dollar Danish krone Swedish krona Other Total m m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 24.0 59.9 48.7 75.4 32.3 240.3 Bank overdrafts 132.4 17.4 1.3 151.1 Net cash and cash equivalents note 13 108.4 42.5 48.7 75.4 31.0 89.2 Borrowings, excluding finance lease liabilities note 15 23.2 32.5 309.2 45.3 61.3 471.5 Finance lease liabilities note 15 1.4 0.2 4.7 0.4 6.7 Pre-derivative position 133.0 9.8 309.2 3.4 9.4 30.6 389.0 Derivative effect note 16 0.4 212.9 309.2 48.2 64.9 17.2 Post-derivative position 133.4 203.1 44.8 55.5 30.6 406.2 As at 31 December 2012 Sterling Euro US dollar Danish krone Swedish krona Other Total m m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 27.0 46.1 34.4 43.6 15.9 167.0 Bank overdrafts 64.2 27.4 1.7 93.3 Net cash and cash equivalents note 13 37.2 18.7 34.4 43.6 14.2 73.7 Borrowings, excluding finance lease liabilities note 15 72.0 53.5 316.8 44.4 43.2 529.9 Finance lease liabilities note 15 2.8 4.1 0.6 7.5 Pre-derivative position 112.0 34.8 316.8 10.0 3.7 13.6 463.7 Derivative effect note 16 0.2 202.7 316.8 47.1 65.2 1.6 Post-derivative position 112.2 237.5 57.1 68.9 13.6 462.1 The exposure to euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone largely relate to our net investment hedge activities as described and shown in note 16.
Berendsen plc Report and 144 Accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 17.1 Financial risk factors continued ii Price risk The group is not exposed to any equity securities price risk.
The group may from time to time be exposed to changes in the price of cotton.
To mitigate against this risk the group may enter into forward contracts to buy cotton based textiles at a future date.
Such contracts are not recognised as derivative financial instruments as they are held with the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with the entitys expected purchase, sale or usage requirements.
iii Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The groups interest bearing assets include cash and cash equivalents which earn interest at floating rates.
The groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the group to fair value interest rate risk.
Group policy is to maintain a majority of its borrowings at fixed rate using interest rate swaps to achieve this when necessary.
During 2013 and 2012, the groups borrowings at variable rate were denominated in sterling, euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone.
The following table sets out the carrying amount, by contractual repricing date or maturity where there is no repricing, of fixed rate borrowings that are exposed to interest rate risk before taking into account interest rate swaps: As at As at 31 December 31 December 2013 2012 m m Fixed interest rate borrowings In one year or less 32.7 2.7 In more than one year, but not more than two years 4.6 35.1 In more than two years but not more than five years 140.9 83.4 In more than five years 163.9 228.5 342.1 349.7 Floating interest rate borrowings 136.1 187.7 Total borrowings 478.2 537.4 During 2013 and 2012, net debt was managed using derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk as follows: As at 31 December 2013 As at 31 December 2012 Fixed-rate Floating-rate Total Fixed-rate Floating-rate Total m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 89.2 89.2 73.7 73.7 Borrowings 342.1 136.1 478.2 349.7 187.7 537.4 Pre-derivative net debt position 342.1 46.9 389.0 349.7 114.0 463.7 Derivative effect note i 11.4 28.2 16.8 43.9 45.7 1.8 Post-derivative net debt position 330.7 75.1 405.8 393.6 68.3 461.9 i Excludes the forward foreign exchange contract derivatives.
b Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a group or local basis as appropriate.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of A are accepted.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across geographical areas.
If there is no independent rating, management assesses the credit quality of the customer taking into account, its financial position, past experience and other factors.
Individual risk limits are set based on internal ratings.
Management monitors the utilisation of credit limits regularly.
Management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful debts.
Treasury related credit risk Counterparty risk arises from the investment of surplus funds and from use of derivative instruments.
As at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012, we had a number of exposures to individual counterparties.
In accordance with our treasury policies and exposure management practices, counterparty credit exposure limits are continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered significant in the ordinary course of treasury management activity.
Management does not expect any significant losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
St Str ra ategic tegic repo repor rt t G Go ov five ernance rnance F Fi inanc financial ial statements statments Berendsen plc Report and 145 Accounts 2013 17.1 Financial risk factors continued The counterparty exposure under all financial assets including trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial contracts were 243.4 million 2012: 245.8 million.
The group does not hold any collateral as security.
c Liquidity risk Cash flow forecasting is performed in the operating entities of the group and is aggregated by group finance.
Group finance monitors rolling forecasts of the groups liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities note 15 at all times so that the group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants where applicable on any of its borrowing facilities.
Such forecasting takes into consideration the groups debt financing plans, covenant compliance, and compliance with internal balance sheet ratio targets.
The table below analyses the groups financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relative maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet to the contract maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are contractual undiscounted cash flows using spot interest and foreign exchange rates at 31 December 2013.

The following analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK, euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone interest rates and sterling exchange rate on our financial instruments.
We have excluded from this analysis the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying values of trade receivables and payables, since these are not exposed to risk from the market variables.
This analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-retirement obligations, provisions and on the non-financial assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the positions at those dates and is not representative of the years then ended, as all of these varied.
Berendsen plc Report and 146 Accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 17.1 Financial risk factors continued The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis:, financial derivatives in net investment hedging relationship will not influence interest or foreign exchange sensitivity analysis:, the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, deposits and derivative instruments:, the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is recorded fully within the income statement: and, changes in the carrying value of financial instruments from movements in exchange rates are recorded fully within equity.
The following table shows the groups exposure to foreign exchange risk as at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012, which is a result of increase decrease of 10% movement in foreign exchange gains losses on translation of foreign currency denominated borrowings.
The foreign exchange risk is naturally hedged against the net assets of our operations in Continental Europe.
All foreign exchange on both the borrowings and net assets is taken to reserves where it will offset.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or take other steps to increase share capital or reduce debt.
The group manages its capital structure using a number of measures and taking into account its future strategic plans.
Such measures include its net interest cover and leverage ratios, which are included in its banking covenants.
The group continues to remain compliant with all its banking covenants.

The valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
Specific techniques used to value financial instruments include:, quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments:, the fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves:, the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date, with the resulting value discounted back to present value:, other techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.

Defined benefit plans As set out in Accounting Policies, on 1 January IAS 19 Employee Benefits became mandatory for the first time and the pensions information contained in this note has been prepared under this basis.
Consequently, prior year information, as applicable, has been restated to reflect the impact of this change.
The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes and unfunded schemes.
Of these, the principal schemes are the defined benefit plans in the UK and the unfunded scheme in Sweden.
Within the United Kingdom, the group now operates only the one registered defined benefit pension scheme Berendsen DB UK Retirement Benefits Scheme formerly known as the Davis Service Group Retirement Benefits Scheme, following a merger with the one other smaller scheme on 1 February 2013.
The triennial valuation of the newly merged scheme at that date requires that, as well as the employer contributions for the 110 active members of the scheme, Berendsen will continue contributions to cover the past service deficit, arising under the technical provisions, of 1.25m per quarter until August 2015.
The level of benefits provided depends on each members length of scheme membership and salary in the final years leading up to retirement.
In the UK plan, the pensions in payment are generally increased by 5% in respect of pre-1 February 1999 membership, and by the retail price index for membership from that date.
Benefit payments are made from trustee administered funds.
Plan assets are governed by regulations in the UK, as is the nature of the relationship between the group and the trustees and their composition.
Responsibility for governance of the plan, including investment decisions and contribution schedules, lies jointly with the company and the trustees.
The trustees must comprise of representatives of the company and plan members in accordance with legislation.
Overseas, there is a comparatively small defined benefit scheme operated in Ireland.
Along with the scheme in Sweden further unfunded schemes exist within Germany and Norway.
Under all unfunded schemes the group discharges its pension obligations through schemes administered by insurance companies or government agencies.
The overall surplus on the plans is 7.1 million of which 38.2 million surplus is in respect of the UK plan.
There is a deficit of 31.1 million on other funded and unfunded plans, of which 25.2 million relates to Sweden.
Where a defined benefit scheme is administered by an insurance company with a collective of other companies and the insurance company is unable to assess the share of the groups pension obligation, the pension scheme has been accounted for as a defined contribution pension scheme.
At the last valuation date the present value of the defined benefit obligation was comprised of 588 active employees, 2,516 deferred members and 1,561 members in retirement.
Expected contributions, including special contributions, to post employment benefit schemes for the year ended 31 December 2014 are 7m 2013:7.7m.

The principal assumptions made by the actuaries were:- 2013 2012 % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.1 2.8 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.0 2.9 Discount rate 4.5 4.2 Inflation rate RPI 2.9 2.9 Inflation rate CPI 2.3 2.3 Mortality rate Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on advice, published statistics and experience in each territory.

In the case of the funded plans, the group ensures that the investment positions are managed within a framework that has been developed to achieve long-term investments that are in line with the obligations of the pension schemes.
Within this framework, the groups objective is to work towards matching the pension obligations by investing principally in long term corporate bonds Berendsen plc Report and 166 Accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 27 Pension commitments continued with maturities that match the benefit payments as they fall due.
The group believes that its current strategy is best suited to the particular scheme.
The group has not changed the processes used to manage risks from previous periods.
Investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
A large portion of assets in 2013 consists of equities and bonds, although the group also invests in diversified growth funds and a small amount of cash.
The majority of equities which constitute 42% of the overall portfolio are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of international blue chip entities with a target of 50% UK and 50% Overseas.
The other growth assets are the diversified growth funds which have a target of 25% of the overall portfolio.
The group has agreed that it will aim to eliminate the deficit on a technical provisions basis by the end of 2015 and deficit contributions of 1.25m per quarter are being made to achieve this.
Funding levels are monitored on a quarterly basis and the current agreed contribution rate in respect of active members is 29.5% of pensionable salaries.
These contribution rates have been set following the completion of the latest triennial valuation of the scheme as at 1 February 2013.
The group considers that the contribution rates set at this valuation is sufficient to eliminate the deficit over the agreed period and that regular contributions, which are based on service costs, will not increase significantly.

The pension surplus is recognised in the balance sheet as the company has the right to any surplus after settlement of all liabilities under the terms of the trust deed.
Sensitivities The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is set out below for the defined benefit schemes and unfunded schemes Defined benefit schemes Change in Increase in Decrease in assumption assumption assumption Discount rate 0.5% Decrease by 9% Increase by 10% Salary growth rate 0.5% No change No change Pension growth rate 0.5% Increase by 4% Decrease by 3% Life expectancy Change by 1 year Increase by 3% Decrease by 3% Unfunded schemes Change in Increase in Decrease in assumption assumption assumption Discount rate 0.5% Decrease by 8% Increase by 9% Salary growth rate 0.5% Increase by 5% Decrease by 4% Pension growth rate 0.5% Increase by 7% Decrease by 6% Life expectancy Change by 1 year Increase by 4% Decrease by 4% The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit to significant actuarial assumptions the same method has been applied when calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of financial position.
