The fair value adjustments for the year ended 31 December 2013 include the pro forma impact for the four month period prior to acquisition year ended 31 December 2012: annual period.
These incorporate adjustments for depreciation, amortisation and onerous contracts, although the largest impact is the reversal of the non-cash inventory uplift adjustment of $445 million.
Inventories held by Xstrata at the date of acquisition were required to be recognised at fair value under IFRS.
This results in negligible margins upon the subsequent sale of these inventories.
The income impact of fair value uplift on inventory has been excluded from the pro forma financial information to accurately present the underlying operating margins and provide more useful information about the performance of the Group.
The inventory uplift did not impact the pro forma results for the year ended 31 December 2012.
2 Considered for the purposes of the pro forma to have occurred immediately prior to the commencement of the accounting period.
3 Pro forma 2012 has been adjusted to reflect the updated year-end fair value acquisition accounting for the acquisitions of Xstrata and Viterra.
