Continued market volatility in 2013, in particular in relation to interest rates and inflation expectations, has meant that the funding positions of our pension schemes have also been volatile during the year.
However, the strong 30 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2013 Our performance Financial position Treasury assets Defined benefit pension schemes growth in asset prices in 2013 has moved both the schemes into a surplus on an accounting basis at 31 December 2013.
The combined accounting surplus on the two defined benefit schemes was 1.6 million at the year end, compared to a combined deficit of 2.1 million at 31 December 2012.
This improvement is mainly due to continued funding, improved asset returns and the impact of higher discount rates on the valuation of scheme liabilities.
Full details of the assumptions underlying the accounting valuation and associated sensitivities are included in note 26 to the consolidated financial statements.
Funding valuations, which form the basis of the annual contributions that we make into the schemes, are required to be more prudent than valuations used for financial reporting.
Regular annual contributions to the schemes for ongoing service by scheme members were 2.5 million in 2013, based on 14.8% of pensionable salaries.
In addition, further funding contributions of up to 3.1 million per year are payable until 2017 under the current agreement, although this will be revisited during 2014 as part of the triennial valuation process.
