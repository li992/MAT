This buffer is not available to finance the groups day-to-day operations.
The statutory cash flow statement reflects the cash inflow outflow after funding the growth in the receivables book.
The groups financial model is to fund the receivables book through a combination of 20% equity and 80% debt.
Accordingly, to assess the groups capital generation to pay dividends to the companys shareholders, capital generation is calculated as net cash generated from used in operating activities, after assuming that 80% of the growth in receivables is funded with borrowings, less net capital expenditure.
Capital generated in 2013 on this basis was 139.2m 2012: 107.7m compared with a dividend payable in respect of 2013 of 116.0m 2012: 104.9m.
