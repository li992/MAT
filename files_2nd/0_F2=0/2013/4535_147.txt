28 Share-based payments The total charge to operating profit relates to the following equity settled schemes: 31 August 1 September 2013 2012 m m Performance Share Plan PSP 1.3 1.4 Executive Share Option Plan ESOP 0.1 Share Incentive Plan SIP 0.1 Deferred Bonus Matching Plan DBMP 0.1 0.1 Charge for the financial year 1.5 1.6 The following table reconciles the movement in shares awarded under the Company share schemes and the weighted average exercise price WAEP for the ESOP scheme.
Grants under the PSP, SIP and DBMP all comprise a right to acquire shares for no or nominal consideration.
An award under the PSP will normally vest on the third anniversary of date of grant and must be exercised within six months of vesting.
No payment is required for the grant of an award.
An award under the PSP comprises a right to receive free shares or a nil cost option with performance conditions attached.
Awards granted on 24 November 2009 vested on 24 November 2012.
32% of the awards vested based on an EPS growth of 6.1% during the applicable performance period.
Awards granted on 1 November 2011 and 1 May 2012 The vesting of the shares granted under these awards is dependent upon the growth of both EPS and Return on Capital Employed ROCE.
75% of the awards is based upon EPS growth.
Where growth is less than 6% per annum over the three year period, this element of the awards lapses.
Where growth is 6% per annum, 30% of the shares awarded vests: where growth is 12% per annum, the EPS element of the awards vests in full.
Between these two points, awards vest on a straight line basis between 30% and 100%.
The remaining 25% of the awards is dependent upon ROCE.
If average ROCE is below the cost of capital over the three year period, this element of the awards lapses.
If average ROCE is equal to the cost of capital over the three year period, then 30% of the shares awarded vests.
If average ROCE is equal to the cost of capital plus 5% then the ROCE element of the awards vests in full.
Awards granted on 1 November 2012 and 1 May 2013 The vesting of the shares granted under these awards is dependent upon the growth of both EPS and ROCE.
If average ROCE is below the cost of capital plus 1% over the three year period, this element of the awards lapses.
If average ROCE is equal to the cost of capital plus 1% over the three year period, then 30% of the shares awarded vests.
In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments, the vesting conditions attached to the PSP are classified as non-market conditions and therefore the shares have been fair valued at face value with a discount to take into account the non-entitlement to dividends in the vesting period where relevant.
The fair value of these PSP awards is calculated based on a Black-Scholes model assuming the inputs shown in the table below: Grant date 1 May 2013 1 Nov 2012 Number of shares under award number 580,036 3,800,797 Expected term years 3.0 3.0 Share price at grant pence 84.5 123.7 Exercise price pence Risk free rate 0% 0% Expected volatility N A N A Expected dividend yield 3.5% 2.4% Fair value of award pence 76.0 115.0 Volatility is a measure of the amount by which the Companys share price is expected to fluctuate in the period.
Where volatility has been used in the calculation of the fair value of the award, it has been estimated by using the most recent historical share price volatility which is commensurate with the expected term of the option taking into account its contractual life.
ii Executive Share Option Plan The ESOP allows the Company to grant options to acquire shares to eligible employees.
These options will normally become exercisable following a three year performance period, only if and to the extent that the performance conditions to which they are subject have been satisfied.
Once the options have vested, the employees have a seven year period in which to exercise.
Options are granted with an exercise price equal to the middle market value of the shares on the day immediately preceding the date of grant.
The options granted on 24 November 2009 became exercisable in full based on ROCE performance exceeding the cost of capital by 7.8% during the applicable performance period.
There are no unvested options under this plan.
