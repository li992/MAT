Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 March 2013 1.
GENERAL INFORMATION Big Yellow Group PLC is a Company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
The address of the registered office is 2 The Deans, Bridge Road, Bagshot, Surrey, GU19 5AT.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 4 and in the Business Review on pages 18 to 23.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the economic environment in which the Group operates.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Adoption of new and revised standards In the current year, there were no new or revised Standards or Interpretations that have been adopted that have affected the amounts reported in these financial statements.
Standards not affecting the reported results nor the financial position The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted in the current year: Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements amended June 2011 Amendments to IAS 12 Income taxes Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits revised June 2011 Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures Their adoption has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements but may impact the accounting for future transactions and arrangements.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : IFRS 1 amended Severe hyperinflation and removal of fixed dates for first time adopters IFRS 7 amended Disclosures Transfers of financial assets IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements IFRS 11 Joint arrangements IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in other entities IFRS 13 Fair value measurement IAS 1 amended Presentation of items of other comprehensive income IAS 12 amended Deferred tax: Recovery of underlying assets IAS 19 revised Employee benefits IAS 27 revised Separate financial statements IAS 28 revised Investments in associates and joint ventures IAS 32 amended Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities With the exception of IFRS 9, IFRS 10, IFRS 11, IFRS 12, IFRS 13, IAS 27 and IAS 28, which the Group is currently evaluating, we do not expect there to be a material impact from the adoption of these standards.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review has been completed.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain properties and financial instruments.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.
The principal accounting policies adopted, which have been applied consistently to the results, other gains and losses, assets, liabilities and cash flows of entities included in the consolidated financial statements in the current and preceding year, are set out below: Going concern A review of the Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out on pages 18 to 29 of the Business and Financial Reviews.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are shown in the balance sheet, cash flow statement and accompanying notes to the financial statements.
Further information concerning the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk can be found in the Business and Financial Reviews, and in the Report on Corporate Governance.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Going concern continued After reviewing Group and Company cash balances, borrowing facilities and projected cash flows, the Directors believe that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue operations for the foreseeable future.
In reaching this conclusion the Directors have had regard to the Groups operating plan and budget for the year ended 31 March 2014 and projections contained in the longer term business plan which covers the period to March 2018.
The Directors have considered carefully the Groups trading performance and cash flows as a result of the uncertain global economic environment and the other principal risks to the Groups performance.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company made up to 31 March each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of Big Yellow Group PLC and all of its subsidiaries at the year end using acquisition accounting principles.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Any costs directly attributable to the business combination are recognised in the income statement.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Investment in subsidiaries These are recognised at cost less provision for any impairment.
Investment in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting except when classified as held for sale.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of an associate in excess of the Groups interest in that associate which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Groups net investment in the associate are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the relevant associate.
Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which case appropriate provision is made for impairment.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income and is not subsequently reversed.
The goodwill in the balance sheet has an indefinite useful economic life.
Revenue recognition Revenue represents amounts derived from the provision of services which fall within the Groups ordinary activities after deduction of trade discounts and any applicable value added tax.
Income is recognised over the period for which the storage room is occupied by the customer on a straight line basis.
The Group recognises non-storage income on a straight line basis over the period in which it is earned.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Management fees earned are recognised on a straight line basis over the period for which the services are provided.
77 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2013 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Operating leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability.
The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs are accounted for on an accruals basis in the statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying value amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Finance costs All borrowing costs are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they are incurred, unless the costs are incurred as part of the development of a qualifying asset, when they will be capitalised.
Commencement of capitalisation is the date when the Group incurs expenditure for the qualifying asset, incurs borrowing costs and undertakes activities that are necessary to prepare the assets for their intended use when it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits to the entity and the costs can be measured reliably.
In the case of suspension of activities during extended periods, the Group suspends capitalisation.
The Group ceases capitalisation of borrowing costs when substantially all of the activities necessary to prepare the asset for use are complete.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated after gains and losses on surplus land, movements on the revaluation of investment properties and before the share of results of associates, investment income and finance costs.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from the net profit as reported in the statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates substantively enacted at the balance sheet date that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the statement of comprehensive income, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Plant, equipment and owner occupied property All property, plant and equipment, not classified as investment property, are carried at historic cost less depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets, other than land and investment properties, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Freehold property 50 years Freehold improvements 20 years Leasehold improvements Over period of the lease Plant and machinery 10 years Fixtures and fittings 5 years Computer equipment 3 years Motor vehicles 4 years The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Investment property The criterion used to distinguish investment property from owner-occupied property is to consider whether the property is held for rental income and for capital appreciation.
Where this is the case, the Group recognises these owned or leased properties as investment properties.
Investment property is initially recognised at cost and revalued at the balance sheet date to fair value as determined by professionally qualified external valuers.
In accordance with IAS 40, investment property held as a leasehold is stated gross of the recognised finance lease liability.
Gains or losses arising from the changes in fair value of investment property are included in the statement of comprehensive income of the period in which they arise.
In accordance with IAS 40, as the Group uses the fair value model, no depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties including integral plant.
Leasehold properties that are leased under operating leases are classified as investment properties and included in the balance sheet at fair value.
The obligation to the lessor for the buildings element of the leasehold is included in the balance sheet at the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception, and is shown within note 21.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and a reduction of the outstanding lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Investment property under construction Investment property under construction is initially recognised at cost and revalued at the balance sheet date to fair value as determined by professionally qualified external valuers.
Gains or losses arising from the changes in fair value of investment property under construction are included in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Surplus land Surplus land, which can include assets held for development and future sale, is recognised at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Any gains and losses on surplus land are recognised through the statement of comprehensive income.
Impairment of assets At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets net selling price and its value-in-use ie the net present value of its future cash flows discounted at the Groups average pre-tax interest rate that reflects the borrowing costs and risk for the asset.
Inventories Inventories, representing the cost of packing materials, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in profit or loss.
The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset and is included in the other gains and losses line item in the income statement.
A Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of interest rates.
The Group uses interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The policy in respect of interest rates is to maintain a balance between flexibility and the hedging of interest rate risk.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently reviewed at each balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest rate derivatives at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the forward curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract.
79 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2013 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued A - Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting continued Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as they arise.
The Group has not adopted hedge accounting.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the statement of comprehensive income.
B - Loans and receivables Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
C - Impairment of financial assets Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
D - Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
The carrying amounts of these assets approximates to the fair value.
E - Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
F - Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
G - Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Retirement benefit costs Pension costs represent contributions payable to defined contribution schemes and are charged as an expense to the statement of comprehensive income as they fall due.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
These are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the share-based payment is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model and excludes the effect of non market based vesting conditions.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non market based vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recovered in profit and loss such that the cumulative expenses reflects the revised estimate with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised for the goods or services acquired, measured initially at the fair value of the liability.
At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured, with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss for the year.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described above, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued a Estimate of fair value of Investment Properties and Investment Property Under Construction The Groups self storage centres and stores under development are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology which is based on projections of net operating income.
The Group employs expert external valuers, Cushman & Wakefield LLP, who report on the values of the Groups stores on a biannual basis.
Principal assumptions underlying managements estimation of the fair value are those related to: stabilised occupancy levels: the absorption period to these stabilised levels: expected future growth in storage rents and operating costs: maintenance requirements: capitalisation rates and discount rates.
A more detailed explanation of the background and methodology adopted in the valuation of the Groups investment properties is set out in note 14 to the accounts.
b Capital Goods Scheme receivable The Group has recognised a receivable in the year in respect of amounts due back from HMRC under the Capital Goods Scheme following the imposition of VAT on self storage from 1 October 2012.
The amount recognised is subject to agreement with HMRC, is payable over up to ten years and has been discounted at the Groups average cost of debt.
REVENUE Analysis of the Groups operating revenue can be found below and in the Portfolio Summary on page 30.
2013 2013 2012 2012 000 000 000 000 Open stores Self storage income 58,112 54,734 Other storage related income 9,996 9,363 Ancillary store rental income 226 176 68,334 64,273 Stores under development Non-storage income 298 270 298 270 Fee income Fees earned from Big Yellow Limited Partnership 639 720 Other management fees earned 400 400 1,039 1,120 Revenue per statement of comprehensive income 69,671 65,663 Interest receivable on bank deposits see note 7 33 20 Total revenue per IAS 18 69,704 65,683 Non-storage income derives principally from rental income earned from tenants of properties awaiting development.
SEGMENTAL INFORMATION IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
Given the nature of the Groups business, there is one segment, which is the provision of self storage and related services.
Revenue represents amounts derived from the provision of self storage and related services which fall within the Group's ordinary activities after deduction of trade discounts and value added tax.
The Groups net assets, revenue and profit before tax are attributable to one activity, the provision of self storage and related services.
These all arise in the United Kingdom in the current year and prior year.

The freehold and leasehold investment properties have been valued at 31 March 2013 by external valuers, Cushman & Wakefield LLP C&W.
The valuation has been carried out in accordance with the RICS Valuation Professional Standards, published by The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors the Red Book.
The valuation of each of the investment properties and the investment properties under construction has been prepared on the basis of either Fair Value or Fair Value as a fully equipped operational entity, having regard to trading potential, as appropriate.
The valuation has been provided for accounts purposes and as such, is a Regulated Purpose Valuation as defined in the Red Book.
In compliance with the disclosure requirements of the Red Book, C&W have confirmed that: The members of the RICS who have been the signatories to the valuations provided to the Group for the same purposes as this valuation have done so since September 2004.
C&W have been carrying out this bi-annual valuation for the same purposes as this valuation on behalf of the Group since September 2004.
C&W do not provide other significant professional or agency services to the Group.
In relation to the preceding financial year of C&W, the proportion of the total fees payable by the Group to the total fee income of the firm is less than 5%.
The fee payable to C&W is a fixed amount per store, and is not contingent on the appraised value.
89 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2013 14.
VALUATION OF INVESTMENT PROPERTY continued Market uncertainty C&Ws valuation report comments on valuation uncertainty resulting from low liquidity in the market for self storage property.
C&W note that, although there were a number of self storage transactions in 2007, the only significant transactions since 2007 are: 1.
The sale of a 51% share in Shurgard Europe which was announced in January 2008 and completed on 31 March 2008.
The sale of the former Keepsafe portfolio by Macquarie to Alligator Self Storage which was completed in January 2010: and 3.
The purchase by Shurgard Europe of the 80% interests held by its joint venture partner Arcapita in its two European joint venture vehicles, First Shurgard and Second Shurgard.
The price paid was 172 million Euros and the transaction was announced in March 2011.
The two joint ventures owned 72 self storage properties.
The purchase of Selstor, Sweden, by Pelican Self Storage M3 Capital in the fourth quarter of 2012.
There have been seven single store market transactions in the UK since 2010.
C&W state that due to the lack of comparable market information in the self storage sector, there is greater uncertainty attached to their opinion of value than would be anticipated during more active market conditions.
Valuation methodology C&W have adopted different approaches for the valuation of the leasehold and freehold assets as follows: Freehold and long leasehold The valuation is based on a discounted cash flow of the net operating income over a ten year period and notional sale of the asset at the end of the tenth year.
Net operating income is based on projected revenue received less projected operating costs together with a central administration charge of 6% of the estimated annual revenue subject to a cap and a collar.
The initial net operating income is calculated by estimating the net operating income in the first 12 months following the valuation date.
The net operating income in future years is calculated assuming either straight-line absorption from day one actual occupancy or variable absorption over years one to four of the cash flow period to an estimated stabilised mature occupancy level.
In the valuation the assumed stabilised occupancy level for the 54 trading stores both freeholds and leaseholds open at 31 March 2013 averages 81.5% 31 March 2012: 82.4%.
The projected revenues and costs have been adjusted for estimated cost inflation and revenue growth.
The average time assumed for the 32 established stores to trade at their maturity levels is 32 months 31 March 2012: 32 months : for the 22 lease-up stores, the period to maturity is 43 months 31 March 2012: 44 months.
C. The capitalisation rates applied to existing and future net cash flow have been estimated by reference to underlying yields for industrial and retail warehouse property, yields for other trading property types such as student housing and hotels, bank base rates, ten year money rates, inflation and the available evidence of transactions in the sector.
The valuation included in the accounts assumes rental growth in future periods.
If an assumption of no rental growth is applied to the external valuation, the net initial yield pre-administration expenses for the 32 established stores is 6.8% 31 March 2012: 6.8% rising to a stabilised net yield pre-administration expenses of 8.1% 31 March 2012: 8.1%.
Also on a no growth and pre-administration expenses basis the 22 lease-up stores have a net initial yield of 4.9% 31 March 2012: 4.4% rising to 8.4% 31 March 2012: 8.6% on stabilisation.
D. The future net cash flow projections including revenue growth and cost inflation have been discounted at a rate that reflects the risk associated with each asset.
The weighted average annual discount rate adopted for both freeholds and leaseholds is 11.2% 31 March 2012: 11.2%.
E. Purchasers costs of 5.8% see below have been assumed initially and sale plus purchasers costs totalling 6.8% are assumed on the notional sales in the tenth year in relation to the freehold stores.
Short leasehold The same methodology has been used as for freeholds, except that no sale of the assets in the tenth year is assumed but the discounted cash flow is extended to the expiry of the lease.
The average unexpired term of the Groups seven short leasehold properties is 15.7 years 31 March 2012: 16.7 years.
Investment properties under construction C&W have valued the stores in development adopting the same methodology as set out above but on the basis of the cash flow projection expected for the store at opening and after allowing for the outstanding costs to take each scheme from its current state to completion and full fit-out.
C&W have allowed for holding costs and construction contingency, as appropriate.
One scheme does not yet have planning consent and C&W have reflected the planning risk in their valuation.
Immature stores: value uncertainty C&W have assessed the value of each property individually.
However, two of the stores in the portfolio are relatively immature and have low initial cash flow.
C&W have endeavoured to reflect the nature of the cash flow profile for these properties in their valuation, and the higher associated risks relating to the as yet unproven future cash flow, by adjustment to the capitalisation rates and discount rates adopted.
However, immature low cash flow stores of this nature are rarely, if ever, traded individually in the market, unless as part of a distressed sale or similar situation.
Although, there is more evidence of immature low cash flow stores being traded as part of a group or portfolio transaction.
Please note C&Ws comments in relation to market uncertainty in the self storage sector due to the lack of comparable market transactions and information.
The degree of uncertainty relating to the two immature stores is greater than in relation to the balance of the properties due to there being even less market evidence that might be available for more mature properties and portfolios.
VALUATION OF INVESTMENT PROPERTY continued Assumptions continued C&W state that in practice, if an actual sale of the properties were to be contemplated then any immature low cash flow stores would normally be presented to the market for sale lotted or grouped with other more mature assets owned by the same entity, in order to alleviate the issue of negative or low short term cash flow.
This approach would enhance the marketability of the group of assets and assist in achieving the best price available in the market by diluting the cash flow risk.
C&W have not adjusted their opinion of fair value to reflect such a grouping of the immature assets with other properties in the portfolio and all stores have been valued individually.
However, they highlight the matter to alert the Group to the manner in which the properties might be grouped or lotted in order to maximise their attractiveness to the market place.
C&W consider this approach to be a valuation assumption but not a Special Assumption, the latter being an assumption that assumes facts that differ from the actual facts existing at the valuation date and which, if not adopted, could produce a material difference in value.
C&W have not assumed that the entire portfolio of properties owned by the entity would be sold as a single lot and the value for the whole portfolio in the context of a sale as a single lot may differ significantly either higher or lower from the aggregate of the individual values for each property in the portfolio, reflecting the lotting assumption described above.
Valuation assumption for purchasers costs The Groups investment property assets have been valued for the purposes of the financial statements after deducting notional purchasers cost of 5.8% of gross value, as if they were sold directly as property assets.
The valuation is an asset valuation which is entirely linked to the operating performance of the business.
They would have to be sold with the benefit of operational contracts, employment contracts and customer contracts, which would be very difficult to achieve except in a corporate structure.
This approach follows the logic of the valuation methodology in that the valuation is based on a capitalisation of the net operating income after allowing a deduction for operational cost and an allowance for central administration costs.
Sale in a corporate structure would result in a reduction in the assumed Stamp Duty Land Tax but an increase in other transaction costs reflecting additional due diligence resulting in a reduced notional purchasers cost of 2.75% of gross value.
All the significant sized transactions that have been concluded in the UK in recent years were completed in a corporate structure.
The Group therefore instructed C&W to carry out a Red Book valuation on the above basis, and this results in a higher property valuation at 31 March 2013 of 796,890,000 34,008,000 higher than the value recorded in the financial statements.
The valuations in Big Yellow Limited Partnership are 4,840,000 higher than the value recorded in the financial statements, of which the Groups share is 1,613,000.
The sum of these is 35,621,000 and translates to 25.1 pence per share.
We have included this revised valuation in the adjusted diluted net asset calculation see note 12.

The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
The Operating and Financial Review contains commentary on the Capital Goods Scheme receivable.
91 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2013 16.
TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES continued Trade receivables The Group does not typically offer credit terms to its customers, requiring them to pay in advance of their storage period and hence the Group is not exposed to significant credit risk.
A late charge of 10% is applied to a customers account if they are greater than 10 days overdue in their payment.
The Group provides for receivables on a specific basis.
There is a right of lien over the customers goods, so if they have not paid within a certain time frame, we have the right to sell the items they store to recoup the debt owed by the customer.
Trade receivables that are overdue are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts determined by reference to past default experience.
For individual storage customers, the Group does not perform credit checks, however this is mitigated by the fact that these customers are required to pay in advance, and also to pay a deposit ranging from between one week to four weeks storage income.
Before accepting a new business customer who wishes to use a number of the Groups stores, the Group uses an external credit rating to assess the potential customers credit quality and defines credit limits by customer.
There are no customers who represent more than 5 per cent of the total balance of trade receivables.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 384,000 2012: 173,000 which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The average age of these receivables is 34 days past due 2012: 31 days past due.
Ageing of past due but not impaired receivables 2013 2012 000 000 1 - 30 days 299 117 30 - 60 days 37 16 60 days 48 40 Total 384 173 The increase in aged debtors from the prior year relates principally to tenants at sites awaiting development, rather than storage customers.
The majority of these amounts have been collected since the year end.

Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES 31 March 31 March 2013 2012 000 000 Current Trade payables 8,454 9,159 Other payables 5,445 2,957 Accruals and deferred income 10,500 12,916 Amounts owed to associate 2 2 VAT repayable under Capital Goods Scheme 20 641 24,421 25,675 Non-current VAT repayable under Capital Goods Scheme 12 315 The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the credit terms.
The Directors consider the carrying amount of trade and other payables and accruals and deferred income approximates fair value.
The Directors estimate the fair value of the Groups VAT payable under the Capital Goods Scheme as follows: 2013 2012 Carrying Estimated Carrying Estimated amount fair value amount fair value 000 000 000 000 VAT payable under the Capital Goods Scheme 32 31 956 913 The fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at interest rates prevailing at the year end.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 19, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Groups debt facilities require 60% of total drawn debt to be fixed.
The Group has complied with this during the year.
With the exception of derivative instruments which are classified as a financial liability at fair value through the profit and loss FVTPL, financial liabilities are categorised under amortised cost.
All financial assets are categorised as receivables.
Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, but are not employed for speculative purposes.
Significant accounting policies Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 2 to the financial statements.
Balance sheet management The Groups Board reviews the capital structure on an ongoing basis.
As part of this review, the Board considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
The Group seeks to have a conservative gearing ratio the proportion of net debt to equity.
The Board considers at each review the appropriateness of the current ratio in light of the above.
The Board is currently satisfied with the Groups gearing ratio.
The gearing ratio at the year end is as follows: 2013 2012 000 000 Debt 238,306 284,000 Cash and cash equivalents 7,850 10,060 Net debt 230,456 273,940 Balance sheet equity 552,628 494,500 Net debt to equity ratio 41.7% 55.4% Debt is defined as long-term and short-term bank borrowings, as detailed in note 19.
Equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group attributable to equity holders of the Company.
Net debt is defined as gross bank borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
93 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2013 18.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Significant accounting policies continued B.
Debt management The Group borrows through a senior term loan, secured on 40 self storage assets and sites, and through a 15 year loan with Aviva Commercial Finance Limited secured on a portfolio of 15 self storage assets.
Borrowings are arranged to ensure an appropriate maturity profile and to maintain short term liquidity.
Funding is arranged in the Group and in Big Yellow Limited Partnership through banks and financial institutions with whom the Group has a strong working relationship.
C. Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, and by the use of interest rate swap contracts.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite: ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
At 31 March 2013 the Group had one interest rate derivative in place: 70 million fixed at 2.80% excluding the margin on the underlying debt instrument until September 2016.
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
The interest rate swaps settle on a monthly basis.
The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is one month LIBOR.
The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
The Group does not hedge account for its interest rate swaps and states them at fair value, with changes in fair value included in the statement of comprehensive income.
The loss in the statement of comprehensive income for the year on the fair value of interest rate derivatives was 223,000 2012: loss of 7,965,000.
The fair value of the above derivatives at 31 March 2013 was a liability of 5,494,000 2012: liability of 15,748,000.
D. Interest rate sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Groups earnings, without jeopardising its flexibility.
Over the longer term, permanent changes in interest rates may have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At 31 March 2013, it is estimated that an increase of 0.5 percentage points in interest rates would have reduced the Groups adjusted profit before tax by 350,000 2012: reduced adjusted profit before tax by 470,000 and a decrease of 0.5 percentage points in interest rates would have increased the Groups adjusted profit before tax by 350,000 2012: increased adjusted profit before tax by 470,000.
There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity.
The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the variable rate borrowings, net of interest rate swaps, at the year end.
The Groups sensitivity to interest rates has decreased during the year, following the repayment of floating rate debt from cash resources.
The Board monitors closely the exposure to the floating rate element of our debt.
E. Cash management and liquidity Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Included in note 19 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.
Short term money market deposits are used to manage liquidity whilst maximising the rate of return on cash resources, giving due consideration to risk.
F. Foreign currency management The Group does not have any foreign currency exposure.
G. Credit risk The credit risk management policies of the Group with respect to trade receivables are discussed in note 16.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over 38,000 customers in our stores.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.

Fair values of financial instruments The fair values of the Groups cash and short term deposits and those of other financial assets equate to their book values.
Details of the Groups receivables at amortised cost are set out in note 16.
The amounts are presented net of provisions for doubtful receivables, and allowances for impairment are made where appropriate.
Trade and other payables, including bank borrowings, are carried at amortised cost.
Finance lease liabilities are included at the fair value of their minimum lease payments.
Derivatives are carried at fair value.
For those financial instruments held at valuation, the Group has categorised them into a three level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique in accordance with IFRS 7.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3.
If the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the category level is based on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument in its entirety.
The fair value of the Groups outstanding interest rate derivative, as detailed in note 18C, has been estimated by calculating the present value of future cash flows, using appropriate market discount rates, representing Level 2 fair value measurements as defined by IFRS 7.
There are no financial instruments which have been categorised as Level 1 or Level 3.
Maturity analysis of financial liabilities The contractual maturities based on market conditions and expected yield curves prevailing at the year end date are as follows: Trade and other Interest rate Borrowings Finance payables swaps and interest leases Total 2013 000 000 000 000 000 From five to twenty years 122,377 23,489 145,866 From two to five years 2,216 168,561 5,965 176,742 From one to two years 12 1,649 12,472 1,989 16,122 Due after more than one year 12 3,865 303,410 31,443 338,730 Due within one year 24,421 1,641 12,472 1,989 40,523 Total 24,433 5,506 315,882 33,432 379,253 Trade and other Interest rate Borrowings Finance payables swaps and interest leases Total 2012 000 000 000 000 000 From five to twenty years 25,436 25,436 From two to five years 4,854 5,953 10,807 From one to two years 315 4,235 288,680 1,984 295,214 Due after more than one year 315 9,089 288,680 33,373 331,457 Due within one year 25,675 4,860 10,228 1,984 42,747 Total 25,990 13,949 298,908 35,357 374,204 95 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2013 18.

On 26 April 2012, the Group announced the completion of a 100 million 15 year fixed rate loan with Aviva Commercial Finance Limited.
The loan is secured over a portfolio of 15 freehold self storage centres which were valued at 242.1 million at 29 February 2012 for the purposes of the drawdown.
The annual fixed interest rate on the loan is 4.9%.
The loan amortises to 60 million over the course of the 15 years, consistent with the Group's medium term debt reduction strategy.
The debt service is payable monthly based on fixed annual amounts.
The loan outstanding on the fifth anniversary will be 89.8 million: 76.7 million outstanding on the tenth anniversary, with 60 million remaining at expiry in April 2027.
In October 2012 the Group entered into a new 190 million four year bank facility with Lloyds TSB, HSBC and Santander, expiring in September 2016.
The facility replaced the Group's existing 225 million facility, expiring in September 2013, which was provided by the same three banks and HSH Nordbank, who have been fully repaid following completion of this refinancing.
In February 2013, the Group repaid and cancelled 35 million of the bank facility following the placing carried out in January 2013, leaving a facility amount of 155 million.
120 million of the facility is term loan with the balance of 35 million revolving.
The facilities attract a ratcheted margin over LIBOR based on interest cover.
The Group is currently paying a blended 2.4% margin, the lowest margin on the ratchet, which is effective for income cover of greater than 3 times.
BANK BORROWINGS continued The Group was comfortably in compliance with its banking covenants at 31 March 2013, as illustrated in the table below.
