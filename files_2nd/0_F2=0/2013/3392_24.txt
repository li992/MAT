Intragroup transactions There are no material intragroup transactions included within the figures for revenue and profit disclosed in this note.
Business restructuring and incident costs In 2013, restructuring costs of 11.7 million related to a major simplification of the divisional management structure 4.4 million, business unit integration and restructuring 5.5 million, excess property costs 1.1 million and incident and other costs 0.7 million.
There is a 2.8 million difference between the expense in the income statement and the amount appearing in the cash flow statement due to the timing of payments and noncash movements.
In 2012, restructuring costs related to the closure of the Groups Marshall, Texas site 3.3 million, the restructuring of the Groups US countermeasures businesses 2.5 million, the restructuring of the Groups UK operations 2.6 million, and an additional 1.5 million relating to several smaller restructuring projects.
There were also a number of Board changes during the year, resulting in associated costs of 2.0 million.

The largest customer had sales reported in all four of the Groups business segments, whilst sales to the second largest customer primarily arose in the Pyrotechnics & Munitions segment.
These were the only individual customers where direct sales account for more than 10% of Group revenue for the year.

Tests are conducted more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from valueinuse calculations.
The key assumptions for the valueinuse calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to cash flows during the period for which management has detailed plans.
Management estimates discount rates using pretax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to each of the CGUs.
Pretax discount rates, derived from the Groups posttax weighted average cost of capital of 7.4% 2012: 7.8% which has adjusted for a premium specific to each of the CGUs to account for differences in currency risk, country risk and other factors affecting specific CGUs, have been used to discount projected cash flows.
These premiums range from 1% to 3% 2012: 1% to 4%.
The calculation has used the Groups forecast figures for the next five years.
At the end of five years, the calculations assume the performance of the CGUs will grow at a nominal annual rate of 0.5% in perpetuity.
The growth rates are based on managements view of industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by management for the next five years, and extrapolates cash flows after that period based on growth as described above.
Following a detailed review, impairment losses have been recognised in relation to HiShear of 50.9 million as a consequence of lower expectations of future trading performance and cash inflows, which have been informed by the recent integration of HiShear with Chemring Energetic Devices, which form part of the Energetic SubSystems segment.
These lower expectations reflect the continuing challenging economic conditions facing the defence industry within the US and the operational issues that have been encountered at HiShear.
In the year ended 31 October 2012 an impairment of goodwill of 22.5 million was recognised in respect of Chemring Ordnance and Chemring Energetic Devices Clear Lake facility.
The impairments recognised in the consolidated income statement, as part of nonunderlying items within continuing operating profit, in respect of goodwill and acquired intangibles are as follows: 2013 2012 Goodwill impairments m m HiShear Technology Corporation 50.9 Chemring Ordnance, Inc. 6.8 Chemring Energetic Devices, Inc. 15.7 50.9 22.5 In respect of acquired intangible assets, an impairment of 15.7 million has been made in the year ended 31 October 2013 in relation to Chemring Energetic Devices' Clear Lake facility, as a result of lower expected cash inflows at this business.
This reflects the continuing challenging economic conditions facing the defence industry within the US, and the markets served by this facility in particular.
The value of impairments of acquired intangible assets is as follows: 2013 2012 Acquired intangibles impairment m m Chemring Energetic Devices, Inc. 15.7 The impairment charges were primarily driven by business valuations that were negatively impacted by lower cash flows within business plans, reflecting the challenging economic conditions facing the defence industry in the US in particular.

A 1% addition to the discount rate for each CGU was also modelled, and under these circumstances HiShear would require an additional impairment charge of up to 3.0 million against acquired intangibles, Simmel Difesa would require an impairment charge of up to 4.0 million against goodwill, Chemring Detection Systems would require an impairment charge of up to 4.0 million against goodwill and Chemring Energetics UK would require an impairment charge of approximately 3.0 million against goodwill.
The remaining CGUs would not require any impairment.
Setting longterm growth rates beyond the five year forecast period to zero would result in HiShear requiring an additional impairment charge of up to 1.0 million against acquired intangibles and Chemring Detection Systems requiring an impairment charge of approximately 1.0 million against goodwill.
As part of the business restructuring process, certain businesses are in the process of being combined.
We continue to monitor CGUs for impairment in light of this, and expect fewer principal CGUs going forward.

No interest is charged on receivables from the date of invoice to payment.
The Groups policy is to provide in full for trade receivables outstanding for more than 120 days beyond agreed terms, unless extenuating circumstances exist.
Due to the nature of the customer base, the Group does not experience significant bad debt writeoffs.
The decrease in trade receivables is due to a lower level of revenue in the final month of the year compared to 2012.
The increase in the average credit period was due to the timing of invoicing and cash receipts at the end of the year.
An ageing analysis has not been shown, as all significant overdue receivables are covered by the allowance for doubtful debts.
The vast majority of the trade receivables balance was not yet due at the year end based on the credit terms provided to customers.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair values.

In January 2011, the Group completed a refinancing of its bank facilities with a syndicate of five banks.
The resulting revolving credit facility, which is unsecured and provides both finance and funds for general working capital purposes, totals 230.0 million.
The term of the facility extends to April 2015, with an option to extend for a further twelve months.
This revolving credit facility provides access to committed lending and bonding line support.
None of the borrowings in the current or the prior year were secured.
The directors do not believe the fair value of the Groups borrowings to be materially different to the book values.
There have been no breaches of the terms of the loan agreements during the current or previous year.
The Group has the following undrawn borrowing facilities in various currencies available, in respect of which all conditions precedent have been met.
These facilities are at floating interest rates.

The revolving credit facility and the loan note agreements have different covenant compliance calculations - the primary difference being that the revolving credit facility uses consolidated net debt in the debt ratio, whereas the loan note agreements require consolidated total debt to be used.

The main risks addressed by financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups policies in respect of the management of these risks, which remained unchanged throughout the year, are set out below.
The Groups global activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk, including: forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk arising from transactional foreign exchange exposures: and interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of movement in interest rates.
Foreign currency risk management The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies, giving rise to exposures to exchange rate fluctuations.
Foreign currency exchange risk can be subdivided into two components, transactional risk and translation risk: Transactional risk: The Group's policy is to hedge transactional currency exposures via the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
The measurement and control of this risk is monitored on a Groupwide basis.
Translation risk: The Group's translates overseas results and net assets in accordance with the accounting policy in note 3.
The translation risk on net assets is mitigated by the transfer of currencies between Group companies and the appropriate use of foreign currency borrowings.
The sterling equivalents of the carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the year end were as follows: 2013 2012 USD EUR NOK AUD USD EUR NOK AUD Monetary assets m 22.8 43.1 5.4 3.3 64.8 64.3 5.8 1.7 Monetary liabilities m 299.2 72.6 4.5 4.1 300.8 103.0 3.3 3.5 Foreign currency denominated net assets are partially hedged by foreign currency borrowings.
The borrowings detailed below were designated as hedging instruments in net investment hedges: 2013 2012 USD EUR NOK AUD USD EUR NOK AUD Borrowings m 252.1 251.4 40.2 The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk, most with a maturity of less than one year from inception.
The exchange rates which have the most significant effect on the Group are those relating to the US dollar and the Euro.
The following table details the forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding: Average exchange rate Expiring within one year 2013 2012 2013 2012 m m US dollar 1.56 1.54 32.5 12.2 The principal amounts of the Groups US dollar loan notes have been accounted for as a net investment hedge of the US businesses.
This hedge was effective throughout the year and the losses arising on translation have been offset against the gains on retranslation of these businesses in reserves.

This sensitivity represents management's assessment of a reasonably possible change in its foreign exchange rates.
This sensitivity analysis only includes translation of the results of foreign currency denominated companies and so does not factor in the impact on the results of sterling or other currency companies that have transactions in US dollars or euros.
The Groups policy is that no more than 75% of gross debt should have fixed interest rates.
During the year, the average fixed interest level was within this policy.
The UK borrowings are denominated in sterling and US dollar, and at the shorter end are subject to floating rates of interest.
The Group has entered into a floating to fixed interest rate swap for 50.0 million of Euro borrowings at a weighted average rate of 3.77% and a fixed to floating interest rate swap for $80.0 million of US dollar borrowings at a weighted average rate of 4.20%.
The Group has outstanding fixed interest loan notes in the US, repayable in November 2016 $80.0 million, November 2017 12.5 million and $125.0 million and November 2019 $200.0 million.
This arrangement provides a natural hedge against the Groups investment in its US businesses.
As the Group has predominantly fixed interest rate debt, a change in interest rates would not have an immediate significant impact on the income statement.
An increase decrease in interest rates of 1% would cause the finance expense to increase decrease by 0.7 million.

Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, and trade and other receivables, which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
Whilst the Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty, the credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is monitored on an ongoing basis using credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies, the credit default swap market and market capitalisation.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, based on prior experience and an assessment of the current economic environment.
Trade receivables are attributable to a small number of customers spread across diverse geographical areas.
Customers are mainly multinational organisations or government agencies with whom the Group has longterm business relationships.
The Group's principal customers are government defence departments, such as the US Department of Defense, the UK Ministry of Defence and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Ministry of Defence and Aviation, as well as US and UK defence prime contractors such as Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems and General Dynamics.
Counterparties are monitored on an ongoing basis for credit risk, and as at the balance sheet date the risk was deemed to be low.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and action is taken to minimise the credit risk to the Group.

Any departures from this policy require approval by the Group finance function.
The Groups pricing risk is primarily in relation to the cost of raw materials and is not considered significant.
Pricing risk is managed through negotiations with suppliers and, where appropriate, the agreement of fixed price supply contracts.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
From time to time, the Group purchases its own shares on the market: the timing of these purchases depends on market prices.
Primarily, such shares are intended to be used for satisfying awards under the Groups sharebased incentive schemes.
Buy and sell decisions are made on a specific transaction basis by the Board.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

The Finance Act 2013, which provides for reductions in the main rate of corporation tax from 23% to 21% effective from 1 April 2014 and to 20% effective from 1 April 2015, was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013.
These rate reductions have been reflected in the calculation of deferred tax at the balance sheet date.
The impact of any further changes in the main rate of corporation tax will be taken into account at subsequent reporting dates, once any such changes have been substantively enacted.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset in accordance with the Groups accounting policy.
Deferred tax balances after offset, for balance sheet purposes, are analysed as follows: 2013 2012 m m Noncurrent liabilities 38.8 52.7 Noncurrent assets 21.7 16.9 17.1 35.8 At the balance sheet date, the Group had unrecognised tax losses of 48.2 million 2012: 43.1 million potentially available for offset against future profits in certain circumstances, with the majority arising from recent acquisitions.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of this amount because of the unpredictability of future taxable qualifying profit streams.

The cumulative preference shares carry an entitlement to a dividend at the rate of 7p per share per annum, payable in equal instalments on 30 April and 31 October each year.
Holders of the preference shares have the right on a windingup to receive, in priority to any other classes of shares, the sum of 1 per share together with any arrears of dividends.

Pensions In the UK, the Group operates a defined benefit scheme the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme.
In Germany, Chemring Defence Germany GmbH operates a defined benefit scheme the Chemring Defence Germany Scheme and in Norway, Chemring Nobel AS operates a defined benefit scheme the Chemring Nobel Scheme.
The other UK and overseas pension arrangements are all defined contribution schemes, with a combined cost of 6.3 million 2012: 6.6 million.
The Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme is a funded scheme and the assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The scheme was closed to future accrual on 6 April 2012.
A full actuarial valuation of the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme as at 6 April 2012 has been completed and updated to 31 October 2013 by a qualified actuary, using the projected unit credit method.
The main assumptions for the scheme are detailed below.
The net deficit of the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme was 24.2 million at 31 October 2013 2012: 25.9 million.
Under the funding plan agreed with the trustees following the 2012 actuarial valuation, the Company has agreed to eliminate the deficit calculated at that time over a period of seven years.
This funding plan provides for contributions of 8.2 million to be paid by the Group in monthly instalments during the year ending 31 October 2014, and thereafter, 5.0 million per annum to be paid in monthly instalments until 2019.
The Company and the trustees monitor funding levels annually, and a new funding plan is agreed with the trustees every three years, based on actuarial valuations.
The Group considers that the current contribution rates agreed with the trustees are sufficient to eliminate the calculated deficit over the agreed period.
The Group has provided a bank guarantee and letters of credit totalling 27.2 million 2012: 27.2 million to the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme, comprising a 20.0 million letter of credit and a 7.2 million bank guarantee, which may only be drawn upon certain events of default by the Company.
On 31 July 2012, the disposal of the marine business triggered a payment of 1.6 million falling due to the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme under Sections 75 and 75A of the Pensions Act 1995.
This debt was settled in full by the Group on 22 August 2012.
The Chemring Defence Germany Scheme is an unfunded scheme.
The actuarial liability has been calculated at 31 October 2013 by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
The main assumptions used were a discount rate of 6.0%, inflation rate of 1.8% and rate of increase in deferred pensions of nil %.
The net deficit of the Chemring Defence Germany Scheme was 0.9 million at 31 October 2013 2012: 0.8 million.
The Chemring Nobel Scheme is an unfunded scheme.
The main assumptions used were a discount rate of 4.1% and rate of increase in deferred pensions of 0.6%.
The net deficit of the Chemring Nobel Scheme was nil at 31 October 2013 2012: 0.3 million.

For the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme, the actuarial table currently used is SAPS Year of Birth Tables with a medium cohort and 1% underpin.
This results in the following life expectancies at age 65: 2013 2012 Future pensioners - male 88.6 88.2 - female 91.3 91.0 Current pensioners - male 86.3 86.3 - female 89.2 89.1 The assumption considered to be the most significant is the discount rate adopted.
If the discount rate used in determining retirement benefit obligations were to change by 0.1% then it is predicted that the deficit in the scheme would change by approximately 1.4 million.
A change in the rate of inflation by 0.1% is predicted to change the deficit by approximately 0.9 million and a one year change to the longevity assumption would change the deficit by approximately 2.5 million.
The Group anticipates contributions to the defined benefit schemes for the year ending 31 October 2014 will be 8.2 million 2013: 2.0 million.

Contingent liabilities The Group enters into contracts which have offset commitments.
These requirements are valued at the time of the contract being awarded.
The cost of the offsets are reviewed throughout the contract life and provided for within the contract costings to the extent of the potential liability.
At 31 October 2013, the Group had contingent liabilities in respect of bank and contractual performance guarantees and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
Where it is expected that a material liability will arise in respect of these matters, appropriate provision is made within the financial statements.
As the conditions of these guarantees are currently being met, no obligating event is foreseeable and therefore no provision has been made.
The Group is, from time to time, party to legal proceedings and claims, and is involved in correspondence relating to potential claims, which arise in the ordinary course of business.
The Group is currently engaged in preaction correspondence in relation to the manufacture of certain components for the NLAW combat weapon by Chemring Energetics UK.
may become indirectly involved in proceedings relating to environmental issues in the Colleferro region of Italy, where its principal manufacturing site is located.
In light of the current status of these matters, the directors do not consider the outcome of all the proceedings, actions and claims in which it is currently involved, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.
A provision of 4.6 million 2012: 1.4 million exists to cover potential legal costs for the Group with regards to pending and probable legal actions.
This provision is detailed in note 25.
The Group has a 2.5 million deductible under its material damage and business interruption insurance policy, subject to a maximum liability of 3.5 million in any one year.
