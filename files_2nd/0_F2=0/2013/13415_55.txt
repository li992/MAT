Previously it was included as part of the European CGU.
ii Impairment testing for continuing operations The recoverable amounts of CGUs or groups of CGUs for Beverage Cans were determined based on value in use calculations at 31 December 2013.
Thecashflow projections used in these calculations are based on the Groups financial budget for 2014, as approved by the board in December 2013, and the Groups financial plans in respect of 2015 and 2016.
As highlighted in the principal accounting policies, the calculation of value in use requires the use of estimates which, although based on managements best knowledge, may ultimately differ from actual results.
Key assumptions The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are: a Discount rates.
The pre tax discount rates used in the value in use calculations are set out in the table below.
These discount rates are derived from the Groups pre tax weighted average cost of capital WACC, as adjusted for the specific risks relating to each region in which the CGUs operate.
Cash flows beyond the three year planning horizon have been extrapolated using growth rates of 2.0% for Europe 2012: 1.6%, 2.4% for the US 2012: 2.5%, 4.8% for Brazil 2012: 4.7% and at rates ranging between 3.3%and 6.8% for all other continuing operations CGUs 2012: 3.6% and 6.1%.
The growth rates used do not exceed the long term GDP growth rates relating to each region in which theCGUs operate.
Forecasts for sales and margins are based on analyses of sales, markets, costs and competitors.
Consideration is given to past experience and knowledge of future contracts.
Forecasts for aluminium costs are based on forward prices and time projections after taking into account pass through of costs and hedging.
Forecasts for other raw materials and energy costs are based on inflation forecasts and supply and demand factors.
Sensitivities With respect to the Turkey CGU, a comparison of the recoverable amount with the carrying value gave rise to 6m goodwill headroom.
A 1% increase in discount rates would reduce the recoverable amount by approximately 5m.
Similarly, a 1% decrease in either growth rates or operating profit would reduce the recoverable amount by approximately 4m and 1m, respectively.
With respect to all other CGUs or groups of CGUs, management considers that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of goodwill to fall below carrying value at 31 December 2013.
