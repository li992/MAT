Goodwill Group m Cost At 1 July 2011, 30 June 2012 and 30 June 2013 816.7 Accumulated impairment losses At 1 July 2011, 30 June 2012 and 30 June 2013 24.5 Carrying amount At 30 June 2012 and 30 June 2013 792.2 The Groups goodwill has a carrying value of 792.2m relating to the housebuilding segment.
The goodwill relating to the commercial developments segment, with a cost of 24.5m, was fully impaired in the year ended 30 June 2008.
The Group conducts an annual impairment review of goodwill and intangibles together for both the housebuilding and commercial developments segments.
The impairment review was performed at 30 June 2013 and compared the value-in-use of the housebuilding segment with the carrying value of its tangible and intangible assets and allocated goodwill.
The Group allocates any identi ed impairment first to goodwill and then to assets on a pro-rata basis, which in the case of the Group is its intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.
The value-in-use was determined by discounting the expected future cash ows of the housebuilding segment.
The first two years of cash ows were determined using the Groups approved detailed site-by-site business plan.
The cash ows for the third to fifth years were determined using Group level internal forecasted cash ows based upon expected volumes, selling prices and margins, taking into account available land purchases and work in progress levels.
The cash ows for year six onwards were extrapolated in perpetuity using an estimated growth rate of 2.5%, which was based upon the expected long-term growth rate of the UK economy.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations were: Discount rate: this is a pre-tax rate re ecting current market assessments of the time value of money and risks appropriate to the Groups housebuilding business.
Accordingly, the rate of 12.2% 2012: 12.9% is considered by the Directors to be the appropriate pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate, being the Groups estimated long-term pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
This rate used in the 30 June 2013 impairment review is calculated using the average capital structure of the Group during the financial year, consistent with the prior year, due to the cyclicality of the Groups borrowing requirements and re ects the Groups reduced borrowing costs following the comprehensive re nancing completed during the year.
Expected changes in selling prices for completed houses and the related impact upon operating margin: these are determined on a site-bysite basis for the first two years dependent upon local market conditions and product type.
For years three to five, these have been estimated at a Group level based upon past experience and expectations of future changes in the market, taking into account external market forecasts.
Sales volumes: these are determined on a site-by-site basis for the first two years dependent upon local market conditions, land availability and planning permissions.
Expected changes in site costs to complete: these are determined on a site-by-site basis for the first two years dependent upon the expected costs of completing all aspects of each individual development including any additional costs that are expected to occur as a result of the business being on an individual development site for longer due to current market conditions.
