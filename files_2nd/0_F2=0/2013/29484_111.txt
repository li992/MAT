Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information St. Jamess Place plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 151 early exercise assumptions The following allowance has been made for the impact of early exercise once options have vested: 1 SAYE plan all option holders are assumed to exercise half-way through the six month exercise window.
2 Executive, sales management and partner share option schemes it is assumed that 10% of option holders are forced to exercise their options each year irrespective of the level of the share price.
For the remainder it is assumed that one-half will exercise their options each year if the share price is at least 33% above the exercise price.
allowance for performance conditions The executive performance share plan includes a market based performance condition based on the Companys total shareholder return relative to an index of comparator companies.
The impact of this performance condition has been modelled using Monte Carlo simulation techniques, which involve running many thousands of simulations of future share price movements for both the Company and the comparator index.
For the purpose of these simulations it is assumed that the share price of the Company and the comparator index are 20% 2012: 20% correlated and that the comparator index has volatilities ranging between 18% p. a. to 107% p. a.
The performance condition is based on the Companys performance relative to the comparator index over a three year period commencing on 1 January each year.
The fair value calculations for the awards that were made in 2013 therefore include an allowance for the actual performance of the Companys share price relative to the index over the period between 1 January 2013 and the various award dates.
