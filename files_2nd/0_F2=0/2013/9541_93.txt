Any difference between the adjustment to the investment in the associate and non-controlling interest is taken directly to equity.
Since Incwala only holds interests in WPL, EPL and Akanani, which are all subsidiaries of Lonmin Plc, the adjustment resulted in the investment in the associate being reduced to nil.
