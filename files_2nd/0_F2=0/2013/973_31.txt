SEGMENTAL INFORMATION The Groups segments are aligned to the structure of business units based around core commodities.
Each business unit has a management team that is accountable to the Chief Executive.
In the instance of Copper, Nickel and Niobium and Phosphates, the same management team is responsible for the management of all three business units.
The Kumba Iron Ore, Iron Ore Brazil and Samancor business units have been aggregated as the Iron Ore and Manganese segment on the basis of the ultimate product produced ferrous metals.
The Other Mining and Industrial segment includes the Lafarge Tarmac joint venture and other Tarmac businesses, and also included Amap until it was disposed of in November 2013.
Until November 2012, this segment also included Scaw South Africa.
Following a Group reorganisation in the second half of 2013, and to align to the way the businesses are now managed, the Niobium and Phosphates business is reported as a separate segment, having previously been reported in the Other Mining and Industrial segment.
Comparatives have been reclassified to align with current year presentation.
On 16 August 2012, the Group acquired a controlling interest in fide Beers Socit Anonyme fide Beers Diamonds segment.
Until this date fide Beers was accounted for as an associate of the Group.
From 16 August 2012, fide Beers ceased to be an associate and has been accounted for as a subsidiary.
For details of this acquisition see note 30.
The Group Management Committee evaluates the financial performance of the Group and its segments principally with reference to underlying operating profit.
Underlying operating profit is operating profit before special items and remeasurements and includes the Groups attributable share of associates andjoint ventures operating profit before special items and remeasurements.
Underlying EBITDA is underlying operating profit before depreciation and amortisation insubsidiaries and joint operations and includes attributable share of underlying operating profit before depreciation and amortisation of associates and jointventures.
Segment revenue includes the Groups attributable share of associates and joint ventures revenue.
Segments predominantly derive revenue as follows Iron Ore and Manganese: iron ore, manganese ore and alloys: Metallurgical Coal: metallurgical coal: Thermal Coal: thermal coal: Copper and Nickel: base metals: Niobium and Phosphates: niobium and phosphates: Platinum: platinum group metals: Diamonds: rough and polished diamonds: and Other Mining and Industrial: heavy building materials, until November 2013, iron ore and until November 2012, steel products.
The Exploration segment includes the cost of the Groups exploration activities across all segments.
The segment results are stated after elimination of inter-segment transactions and include an allocation of corporate costs.

OPERATING PROFIT AND UNDERLYING EARNINGS BY SEGMENT The following table analyses operating profit including attributable share of associates and joint ventures operating profit by segment and reconciles it to underlying earnings by segment.
Operating profit loss before special items and remeasurements includes attributable share of associates and joint ventures operating profit before special items and remeasurements which is reconciled to Share of net income from associates and joint ventures in note 3.
Underlying earnings is an alternative earnings measure, which the directors consider to be a useful additional measure of the Groups performance.
Underlying earnings is profit for the financial year attributable to equity shareholders of the Company before special items and remeasurements and is therefore presented after net finance costs, income tax expense and non-controlling interests.
For a reconciliation from Loss for the financial year attributable to equity shareholders of the Company to Underlying earnings for the financial year, see note 9.

SPECIAL ITEMS AND REMEASUREMENTS Special items are those items of financial performance that the Group believes should be separately disclosed on the face of the income statement to assist inthe understanding of the underlying financial performance achieved by the Group.
Such items are material by nature or amount to the years results and require separate disclosure in accordance with IAS 1 paragraph 97.
Special items that relate to the operating performance of the Group are classified as operating special items and principally comprise impairment charges.
Non-operating special items include profits and losses on disposals of investments and businesses as well as certain adjustments relating to business combinations.
Remeasurements comprise other items which the Group believes should be reported separately to aid an understanding of the underlying financial performance of the Group.
This category includes: Unrealised gains and losses on non-hedge derivative instruments open at the year end in respect of future transactions and the reversal of the historical marked to market value of such instruments settled in the year.
Where the underlying transaction is recorded in the income statement, the realised gains or losses are recorded in underlying earnings in the same year as the underlying transaction for which such instruments provide an economic, but not formally designated, hedge.
If the underlying transaction is recorded in the balance sheet, for example capital expenditure, the realised amount remains in remeasurements on settlement of the derivative.
Such amounts are classified in the income statement as operating when the underlying exposure is in respect of the operating performance of the Group and otherwise as financing.
Foreign exchange impacts arising in US dollar functional currency entities where tax calculations are generated based on local currency financial information and hence deferred tax is susceptible to currency fluctuations.
Such amounts are included within income tax expense.
The remeasurement and subsequent depreciation of a previously held equity interest as a result of a business combination.

2 Relates to the Diamonds, Other Mining and Industrial and Thermal Coal segments 2012: Iron Ore and Manganese, Platinum and, until 16 August, Diamonds.
Operating special items Barro Alto The Barro Alto nickel project produced first metal in 2011 but its ramp-up has been significantly affected by issues in the kilns and furnaces.
In order to eliminate uncertainties, most notably as a result of furnace design flaws, and enable attainment of the nominal capacity of the operation, a redesign and rebuild of the furnaces is planned to take place.
The cost of the existing furnaces of $211 million has been written-off and the impact of lost production during the rebuild process together with the associated capital expenditure as well as a decline in nickel prices and updated operational planning has resulted in a further impairment of $801 million to the assets carrying value.
Consequently a total impairment charge of $1,012 million has been recorded.
The post-tax impairment charge is $724 million.
Platinum portfolio review Platinum announced in August 2013 that it had completed the section 189 consultations on its proposals to create a sustainable, competitive and profitable platinum business for the long term benefit of all its stakeholders.
Following the conclusion of these consultations, the proposals became effective.
As a result, Khuseleka 2 shaft and Khomanani 1 and 2 shafts have been placed on long term care and maintenance as part of the consolidation of the Rustenburg operations into three operating mines, and the Union Mine North declines have been closed.
As the Group no longer expects to receive future economic benefits from these operations they have been fully impaired, resulting in a charge of $379 million.
The charge after tax and non-controlling interests is $232million.
In 2012 an impairment charge of $860 million was recognised in relation to certain Platinum projects and other assets not in use, that were not considered economically viable.
Foxleigh An impairment charge of $331 million has been recorded in relation to Foxleigh Metallurgical Coal, principally driven by a decline in metallurgical coal prices.
The post-tax impairment charge is $232 million.
Michiquillay The Group acquired the Michiquillay copper project in northern Peru in 2007.
To date, $337 million in costs have been capitalised, primarily representing the costs of acquisition.
In 2013, following a review of the concept level study, the Group decided not to progress the study to the pre-feasibility stage in its existing form, and engaged with the Peruvian government to agree a temporary suspension of acquisition payments to allow for a full review of the conceptual study.
Inview of the uncertainty in relation to the implementation of the project and its outcome, costs capitalised to date are no longer considered recoverable and have been fully impaired, resulting in a charge of $337 million.
No tax arises on the impairment.
Thermal Coal This relates to an impairment of $143 million in relation to the Isibonelo operation, reflecting managements revised expectation of the operations future profitability under a long term coal supply contract, and animpairment of $100 million at the Kleinkopje operation, driven primarily by a decline in export thermal coal prices.
The total post-tax impairment charge is $177 million.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2013 167 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT 6.
SPECIAL ITEMS AND REMEASUREMENTS continued Onerous contract provisions The charge of $434 million in relation to onerous contracts principally reflects a provision increase of $393 million for coal supply agreements inherited on acquisition of Callide in 2000.
The pricing in the agreements, which extend to 2031, is significantly below market rates resulting in the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations exceeding the economic benefit expected to be received from the contract.
The increased provision reflects higher forecast operatingexpenditure.
The post-tax charge in relation to onerous contract provisions is $341 million.
Reversal of fide Beers inventory uplift Inventory held by fide Beers at the date of acquisition 16 August 2012 was required to be recognised at fair value under IFRS.
This resulted in negligible margins being realised upon the subsequent sale of inventory held at the acquisition date.
The reversal of fair value uplifts on the remaining inventory sold in 2013 of $126 million 2012: $421 million has been excluded from the Groups underlying earnings so as not to distort the operating margins of fide Beers and to provide more useful information about the performance of the Group.
Restructuring costs Restructuring costs principally comprise charges of $146 million relating to the implementation of the Platinum portfolio review and $64 million related to integration costs incurred by the Lafarge Tarmac joint venture following its formation.
Restructuring costs after tax and non-controlling interests is $167million.
2012 In 2012, significant operating special items included the impairment of the Minas-Rio iron ore project Iron Ore Brazil, impairments of certain Platinum projects and other Platinum assets not in use, a charge arising at Loma fide Nquel due to the cancellation of its mining concessions in November 2012, charges relating to onerous contract provisions, principally in relation to Callide, and the reversal of fair value uplifts on inventory sold by fide Beers.
Operating remeasurements Operating remeasurements reflect a net loss of $550 million 2012: $112 million principally in respect of derivatives related to capital expenditure in Iron Ore Brazil.
Derivatives which have been realised during the period had a cumulative net operating remeasurement loss since their inception of $137million 2012:loss of $71 million.
In addition, operating remeasurements includes a $131 million depreciation and amortisation charge 2012: $41 million arising due to the fair value uplift on the pre-existing 45% shareholding of fide Beers, which was required on acquisition of a controlling stake.
Non-operating special items A loss of $175 million $124 million after non-controlling interests has been recognised in the year relating to the sale of Amap in November 2013 Other Mining and Industrial.
In December2012, Amap was reclassified to held for sale and recognised at fair value less costs to sell, resulting in a loss of $404million being recognised.
For further details see note 31.
In December 2013, the Group withdrew from the Pebble copper project in Alaska.
The Groups 50% interest in the project was written-off in full, resulting in acharge of $311 million, including exit costs.
No tax arises on the exit from Pebble.
A loss of $55 million has been recognised on the formation of the Lafarge Tarmac joint venture in January 2013 Other Mining and Industrial 2012:$135million.
Theloss in the current year primarily relates to the transfer to the income statement of $62 million cumulative exchange losses previously recognised in equity, partially offset by a net gain of $7 million arising on the formation of the joint venture and the associated sale of certain of Tarmac Quarry Materials operations.
For further details see note 30.
The Kumba Envision Trust charge of $54 million 2012: $77 million relates to Kumbas broad based employee share scheme provided solely for the benefit ofnon-managerial Historically Disadvantaged South African employees who do not participate in other Kumba share schemes.
Other non-operating special items principally comprise a gain of $44 million on deferred proceeds following payment received in the year in respect of undeveloped coal assets in Australia Metallurgical Coal which the Group disposed of in 2010, and a gain on disposal of the Groups 16.79% effective interest in Palabora Mining Company Limited, a company listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange JSE, in July 2013.
Other non-operating special items, after tax and non-controlling interests, are a gain of $154 million.
Financing remeasurements Financing remeasurements reflect a net loss of $130 million 2012: net loss of $88 million and relate to an embedded interest rate derivative, derivatives relating to debt and other financing remeasurements.
Special items and remeasurements tax Special items and remeasurements tax amounted to a credit of $590 million 2012: credit of $1,110 million.
This includes a one-off tax charge of $188 million offset by a tax credit on special items and remeasurements of $923 million 2012: credit of $377 million and a tax remeasurement charge of $145 million 2012:charge of $189million.
The tax charge of $188 million relates principally to a settlement reached in the current year between the South African Revenue Service and Rustenburg Platinum Mines Limited in respect of certain previously unresolved historical tax matters.
The total amount payable in terms of the settlement agreement is $324 million and has been fully provided for.
The total tax credit relating to subsidiaries and joint operations of $587 million 2012: credit of $1,113 million comprises a current tax charge of $159 million 2012: charge of $8 million offset by a deferred tax credit of $746 million 2012: credit of $1,121 million.

IAS 1 requires income from associates and joint ventures to be presented net of tax on the face of the income statement.
Associates and joint ventures tax is therefore not included within the Groups income tax expense.
Associates and joint ventures tax included within Share of net income from associates and joint ventures for the year ended 31 December 2013 is $155million 2012:$200million.
Excluding special items and remeasurements this becomes $158 million 2012: $197 million.
The effective tax rate before special items and remeasurements including attributable share of associates and joint ventures tax for the year ended 31December 2013 was 32.0%.
This is higher than the equivalent effective tax rate of 29.0% for the year ended 31 December 2012 due to the impact of various prior year adjustments and the remeasurement of certain withholding tax provisions across the Group.
In future periods it is expected that the effective tax rate will remain above the United Kingdom statutory tax rate.

The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data: Loss attributable to equity shareholders of the Company Headline earnings Underlying earnings 2012 2012 2012 1 1 1 2013 restated 2013 restated 2013 restated Earnings US$ million Basic loss earnings 961 1,470 1,312 1,218 2,673 2,860 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares 2 Interest payable on convertible bond net of tax 19 2 Unwinding of discount on convertible bond net of tax 19 Diluted earnings US$ million 961 1,470 1,312 1,218 2,673 2,898 Number of shares million Basic number of ordinary shares outstanding 1,281 1,254 1,281 1,254 1,281 1,254 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares Share options and awards 4 5 4 5 2 Convertible bond 23 Diluted number of ordinary shares outstanding million 1,281 1,254 1,285 1,259 1,285 1,282 1 Certain balances related to 2012 have been restated to reflect the adoption of new accounting pronouncements.
2 All outstanding convertible bonds were converted or redeemed in 2012.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue on the assumption of conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
Potential ordinary shares shall be treated as dilutive when, and only when, their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease earnings per share or increase loss per share from continuing operations.
Basic loss per share is equal to diluted loss per share as all 16,688,080 2012: 16,325,905 potential ordinary shares are anti-dilutive and 134,679 2012:10,339,454 have been excluded from the calculation of diluted headline earnings per share and diluted underlying earnings per share as they are anti-dilutive.
Basic and diluted number of ordinary shares outstanding represent the weighted average for the year.
The average number of ordinary shares in issue excludes shares held by employee benefit trusts and Anglo American plc shares held by Group companies.
Underlying earnings is presented after non-controlling interests and excludes special items and remeasurements, see note 5.
Underlying earnings is distinct from Headline earnings, which is a JSE defined performance measure.
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share, based on headline and underlying earnings, uses the following earnings data: 2012 1 US$ million 2013 restated Loss for the financial year attributable to equity shareholders of the Company 961 1,470 Operating special items 2,491 6,050 Operating special items tax 569 1,600 Operating special items non-controlling interests 53 123 Non-operating special items and remeasurements 456 1,494 Non-operating special items tax 10 35 Non-operating special items non-controlling interests 62 180 Headline earnings for the financial year 1,312 1,218 2 Operating special items 800 989 Operating remeasurements 550 112 3 Non-operating special items 13 98 Financing remeasurements 130 88 Tax special item 188 Special items and remeasurements tax 219 455 Non-controlling interests on special items and remeasurements 101 100 Underlying earnings for the financial year 2,673 2,860 1 Certain balances related to 2012 have been restated to reflect the adoption of new accounting pronouncements.

DIVIDENDS Dividends payable during the year are as follows: US$ million 2013 2012 Final ordinary dividend for 2012 53 US cents per ordinary share 2011: 46 US cents per ordinary share 672 559 Interim ordinary dividend for 2013 32 US cents per ordinary share 2012: 32 US cents per ordinary share 406 411 1 1 1,078 970 1 Of this, $618 million 2012: $599 million was recognised in the parent company.
Total dividends paid during the year were $1,078 million 2012: $970 million.
The directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2013 of 53 US cents per share.
Based on shares eligible for dividends at 31 December 2013, this will result in an estimated distribution of $678 million of shareholders funds, of which $374 million will be distributed by the parent company.
These financial statements do not reflect this dividend payable as it is still subject to shareholder approval.
As stated in note 33, the employee benefit trust has waived the right to receive dividends on the shares it holds.

3 The goodwill balances provided are net of cumulative impairment charges of $1,105 million 2012: $1,105 million.
4 Includes $20 million 2012: $6 million of amortisation arising due to the fair value uplift of the Groups pre-existing 45% shareholding in fide Beers.
This has been included within operating remeasurements.
In December 2012 an impairment of $1,105 million was recorded against goodwill related to Minas-Rio.
The valuation of Minas-Rio was determined on a value in use basis using a real pre-tax discount rate of 8.5%.
The total impairment charge of $4,960 million before tax was recorded against the carrying value of goodwill and mining properties, with an associated deferred tax credit of $960 million.
Impairment tests for goodwill See note 40f for the Groups accounting policy on impairment of goodwill.
Goodwill is allocated for impairment testing purposes to cash generating units CGUs or groups of CGUs which reflect how it is monitored for internal management purposes.
This allocation largely represents the Groups segments.
Any goodwill associated with CGUs included within these segments is not significant when compared to the goodwill of the Group.
The allocation of goodwill to CGUs or groups ofCGUs is as follows: US$ million 2013 2012 Thermal Coal 88 88 Copper 124 124 Nickel 10 10 Platinum 230 230 Diamonds 2,056 2,324 Other 160 178 2,668 2,954 For the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on a fair value less costs of disposal basis.
The key assumptions used in determining fair value less costs of disposal are set out in note 1.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in a key assumption on which the recoverable amounts are based would not cause the carrying amounts to exceed their recoverable amounts.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT See notes 40g to 40j for the Groups accounting policies on property, plant and equipment.
The adoption of IFRIC 20 has resulted in the write-off of previously capitalised deferred stripping costs of $155 million to retained earnings as they were not associated with an existing component of an operating mine.
The adoption of IFRS 11 has resulted in $312 million of property, plant and equipment being reclassified to investments in equity accounted joint ventures.
2 Additions to mining properties and leases include amounts of $382 million in relation to deferred stripping production stage Ore Reserves development.
Before the adoption of IFRIC 20, a net deferral of production stage stripping costs of $147 million in 2012 was included in additions to mining properties and leases.
The treatment of production stage Ore Reserves development has not changed.
3 2012 includes $196 million of other assets, all of which have been disposed of or transferred into other categories in 2013.
4 Includes $2,579 million 2012: $2,343 million of depreciation within operating profit, $111 million 2012: $35 million of depreciation arising due to the fair value uplift on the pre-existing 45% shareholding of fide Beers and nil 2012: $70 million of accelerated depreciation, both of which have been recorded within operating special items and remeasurements see note 6, and $100million 2012:$81million of pre-commercial production depreciation which has been capitalised.
See note 3 for a split of depreciation and amortisation by segment.
5 Relates mainly to amounts transferred from capital works in progress.
The impairments recorded in the year are detailed in note 6.
Fair value less costs of disposal has been used as the basis for determining the recoverable amount.
The fair value depends principally on unobservable inputs and is classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
Where the recoverable amount is estimated to be less than the carrying amount an impairment has been recorded.
Included in the additions is $320 million 2012: $266 million of net interest expense incurred on borrowings funding the construction of qualifying assets which has been capitalised during the year.
Assets held under finance leases relate to plant and equipment with a net book value of $50 million 2012: $27 million, depreciation charges in the year amounted to $13 million 2012: $7 million.

The historical level of customer default is minimal and as a result the credit quality of year end trade receivables is considered to be high.
Of the year end trade receivables balance, $65 million 2012: $36 million were past due at 31 December, stated after an associated impairment provision of $19 million 2012: $11million.
The overdue debtor ageing profile is typical of the industry in which certain of the Groups businesses operate.
Given this, the existing insurance cover including letters of credit from financial institutions and the nature of the related counterparties, these amounts are considered recoverable.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS See notes 40m and 40n for the Groups accounting policies on impairment of financial assets, derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting.
The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities are as shown below.
Where the carrying amount of a financial asset or liability does not approximate its fair value, this is also disclosed.
For financial assets and liabilities which are traded on an active market, such as listed investments or listed debt instruments, fair value is determined by reference to market value.
For non-traded financial assets and liabilities, fair value is calculated using discounted cash flows, considered to be reasonable and consistent with those that would be used by a market participant, and based on observable market data where available, unless carrying value is considered to approximate fair value.

2 Trade and other receivables exclude prepayments and accrued income.
Trade and other payables exclude tax and social security and deferred income.
3 Derivative instruments are analysed between those which are Held for trading and those designated into hedge relationships in note 19.
4 The carrying value of financial asset investments within loans and receivables is considered to approximate fair value 2012: fair value of $1,397 million including investments categorised as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
5 Borrowings designated in fair value hedges represent listed debt.
The fair value of these borrowings is $14,907 million 2012: $13,735 million, which is based on the quoted market price and consequently categorised as level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.
6 For the majority of borrowings at amortised cost the carrying value is considered to approximate the fair value.
In certain circumstances the fair value of borrowings is based on managements estimates of future cash flows and consequently the valuation is categorised as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
The total fair value of borrowings at amortised cost is $3,269 million 2012:$4,062 million.

This category includes listed equity shares.
2 Valued using techniques based significantly on observable market data.
Instruments in this category are valued using valuation techniques where all of the inputs that have a significant effect onthe valuation are directly or indirectly based on observable market data.
3 Instruments in this category have been valued using a valuation technique where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation is not based on observable market data.
Where inputs can be observed from market data without undue cost and effort, the observed input is used.
Otherwise, management determines a reasonable estimate for the input.
Financial assets and liabilities included within level 3 primarily consist of contingent proceeds and related receivables relating to disposals, embedded derivatives, unlisted equity investments, certain cross currency swaps of Brazilian real denominated borrowings whose valuation depends upon unobservable inputs and commodity sales contracts which do not meet the conditions for the own use exemption under IAS 39.

Anglo American plc Annual Report 2013 177 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET 19.
DERIVATIVES See note 40n for the Groups accounting policy on derivatives.
The fair values of derivatives are separately recorded on the Consolidated balance sheet within Derivative financial assets and Derivative financial liabilities.
Derivatives are classified as current or non-current depending on the date of expected settlement of the derivative.
The Group utilises derivative instruments to manage certain market risk exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes, however it may choose not to designate certain derivatives as hedges for accounting purposes.
Such derivatives are classified as non-hedges and fair value movements are recorded in the Consolidated income statement.
The use of derivative instruments is subject to limits and the positions are regularly monitored and reported to senior management.
Cash flow hedges In certain cases the Group classifies its forward foreign currency contracts, which hedge highly probable forecast transactions, as cash flow hedges.
Where this designation is documented, changes in fair value are recognised in equity until the hedged transactions occur, at which time the respective gains or losses are transferred to the Consolidated income statement or hedged balance sheet item.
Fair value hedges The majority of interest rate swaps taken out to swap the Groups fixed rate borrowings to floating rate, in accordance with the Groups policy have been designated as fair value hedges.
The carrying value of the hedged debt is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the impact on its fair value of changes in market interest rates.
Changes in the fair value of the hedged debt are offset against fair value changes in the interest rate swap and classified within net finance costs in the Consolidated income statement.
Held for trading The Group may choose not to designate certain derivatives as hedges.
This may occur where the Group is economically hedged but IAS 39 hedge accounting cannot be achieved or where gains and losses on both the derivative and hedged item naturally offset in the Consolidated income statement, as is the case for certain cross currency swaps of non-US dollar debt.
Where these derivatives have not been designated as hedges, fair value changes are recognised in the Consolidated income statement as remeasurements and are classified as financing or operating depending on the nature of the associated hedged risk.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of their host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value.
The fair value of the Groups open derivative position at 31 December excluding normal purchase and sale contracts held off balance sheet, recorded within Derivative financial assets and Derivative financial liabilities is as follows: Current Non-current 2013 2012 2013 2012 US$ million Asset Liability Asset Liability Asset Liability Asset Liability Derivatives hedging net debt Fair value hedge Interest rate swaps 8 30 354 138 687 6 Held for trading Forward foreign currency contracts 18 86 2 54 Cross currency swaps 24 15 32 125 248 919 60 781 Interest rate swaps 2 13 50 101 64 179 602 1,059 747 800 Other derivatives Cash flow hedge Forward foreign currency contracts 6 3 3 Fair value hedge Forward commodity contracts 3 1 2 Held for trading Forward foreign currency contracts 20 249 33 70 2 73 1 Other 13 29 4 20 271 37 101 2 80 1 Total derivatives 70 372 101 280 604 1,139 747 801 These marked to market valuations are not predictive of the future value of the hedged position, nor of the future impact on the profit of the Group.
The valuations represent the cost of closing all hedge contracts at year end, at market prices and rates available at the time.
The Group is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of financial instrument related risks.
For more information about these risks and the ways in which the Group manages them see notes 25 and 39.

NET DEBT See note 40o for the Groups accounting policy on cash and debt.
Net debt is a measure of the Groups financial position.
The Group uses net debt to monitor the sources and uses of financial resources, the availability of capital to invest or return to shareholders, and the resilience of the balance sheet.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents including derivatives which provide an economic hedge of debt and the net debt of disposal groups.

c Net debt by segment The Groups policy is to hold the majority of its cash and borrowings at the corporate centre.
Business units may from time to time raise borrowings in connection with specific capital projects, and subsidiaries with non-controlling interests have borrowings which are without recourse to the Group.
Other than the impact of South African exchange controls see note 24d below, there are no significant restrictions over the Groups ability to access these cash balances or repay these borrowings.
Net debt by segment is stated after elimination of inter-segment balances and includes related hedges.
Net debt in disposal groups is part of total net debt but not allocated to segments.

d South Africa net debt The Group operates in South Africa where the existence of exchange controls may restrict the use of certain cash balances.
The Group therefore monitors the cash and debt associated with these operations separately.
These restrictions are not expected to have a material effect on the Groups ability to meet its ongoing obligations.

BORROWINGS See note 40o for the Groups accounting policy on convertible debt and bank borrowings.
The Group accesses borrowings mostly in capital markets through bonds issued under the Euro Medium Term Note EMTN programme, the South African Domestic Medium Term Note DMTN programme, through accessing the United States US bond markets, and this year through bonds issued under the Australian Medium Term Note AMTN programme.
The Group uses interest rate and cross currency swaps to ensure that the majority of the Groups borrowings are floating rate US dollar denominated.
During 2013, the Group issued corporate bonds with a US$ equivalent value of $3.5 billion.
These included 750 million 2.5% guaranteed notes due 2021, 900 million 1.75% guaranteed notes due 2017, and 600 million 2.875% guaranteed notes due 2020 issued under the EMTN programme, and AUD500million 5.75% guaranteed notes due 2018 issued under the AMTN programme.
2 Assets with a book value of $56 million 2012: $49 million have been pledged as security, of which $30 million 2012: $35 million are property, plant and equipment, $22 million 2012: $10 million are financial assets and $4 million 2012: $4 million are inventories.
Related to these assets are borrowings of $41 million 2012: $26 million.
3 Details of assets held under finance leases are provided in note 12.

BORROWINGS continued Liquidity risk The Group ensures that there are sufficient committed loan facilities including refinancing, where necessary in order to meet short term business requirements, after taking into account cash flows from operations and its holding of cash and cash equivalents, as well as any Group distribution restrictions that exist.
In addition, certain projects are financed by means of limited recourse project finance, if appropriate.
The expected undiscounted cash flows of the Groups net debt related and other financial liabilities, by remaining contractual maturity, based on conditions existing at the balance sheet date are as follows: 2013 Net debt related financial liabilities Expected Derivatives Other future interest hedging financial US$ million Borrowings payments net debt liabilities Total Amount due for repayment within one year 2,098 762 245 4,204 6,819 Greater than one year, less than two years 1,903 720 19 2,604 Greater than two years, less than three years 1,532 540 67 2,005 Greater than three years, less than four years 2,872 470 165 3,177 Greater than four years, less than five years 2,642 417 58 3,001 Greater than five years 6,580 581 476 6,685 Total due for repayment after more than one year 15,529 2,728 785 17,472 Total 17,627 3,490 1,030 4,204 24,291 2012 1 restated Net debt related financial liabilities Expected Derivatives Other future interest hedging financial US$ million Borrowings payments net debt liabilities Total Amount due for repayment within one year 2,467 807 103 4,410 7,581 Greater than one year, less than two years 2,336 656 205 2,787 Greater than two years, less than three years 2,798 540 66 3,404 Greater than three years, less than four years 1,376 406 1,782 Greater than four years, less than five years 1,572 336 109 1,799 Greater than five years 7,695 686 182 8,199 Total due for repayment after more than one year 15,777 2,624 430 17,971 Total 18,244 3,431 533 4,410 25,552 1 Certain balances related to 2012 have been restated to reflect the adoption of new accounting pronouncements.

In March 2013 the Group replaced a $3.5 billion credit facility maturing in July 2015 with a $5 billion credit facility maturing in March 2018.
At the same time the $2 billion multi-currency credit facility within the Diamond segment was repaid and cancelled.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and, with cognisance of forecast future market conditions and structuring, to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to manage the short and long term capital structure, the Group adjusts the amount of ordinary dividends paid to shareholders, returns capital to shareholders via, for example, share buybacks and special dividends, arranges debt to fund new acquisitions and may also sell non-core assets to reduce debt.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the ratio of net debt to total capital gearing.
Total capital is calculated as Net assets as shown in the Consolidated balance sheet excluding net debt.
Total capital and gearing are as follows: 2012 1 US$ million 2013 restated Net assets 37,364 43,738 Net debt including related derivatives note 24 10,652 8,510 Total capital 48,016 52,248 Gearing 22.2% 16.3% 1 Certain balances related to 2012 have been restated to reflect the adoption of new accounting pronouncements.
The increase in gearing since 31 December 2012 reflects the $2.1 billion increase in net debt in the year.
Net assets at 31 December 2013 were $6.4 billion lower than at 31 December 2012 due to net movements in equity including currency translation adjustments, dividends and retained earnings in the year.
Management believes that gearing levels remain at a sustainable level given the Groups strong level of operating cash flows.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2013 185 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CASH FLOW STATEMENT, NET DEBT AND RELATED NOTES 25.
BORROWINGS continued Market risk Market risk is the risk that financial instrument fair values will fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
The Group uses net debt to manage the Groups interest rate risks and foreign exchange risks on borrowings and cash.
In relation to net debt, the Group manages its exposure with the use of cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps in order to ensure that the majority of borrowings are floating rate US dollar denominated.
The Group does not hedge foreign exchange exposures on rand denominated borrowings in South Africa.
For more information regarding the Groups financial risk management see note 39.
The Groups exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks has been re-presented to match more closely the way in which the Group manages its exposure to these risks.
The table below reflects the exposure of the Groups net debt to currency and interest rate risk.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS See note 40t for the Groups accounting policy on retirement benefits.
The Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans.
It also operates post employment medical plans, principally inSouth Africa.
Defined contribution plans The defined contribution pension and medical cost represents the actual contributions payable by the Group to the various plans.
At 31 December 2013 there were no material outstanding or prepaid contributions and so no accrual or prepayment has been disclosed in the balance sheet in relation to these plans.
The assets of the defined contribution plans are held separately in independently administered funds.
The charge in respect of these plans is calculated on the basis of the contribution payable by the Group in the financial year.
The charge for the year for defined contribution pension plans net of amounts capitalised was $261million 2012: $262 million and for defined contribution medical plans net of amounts capitalised was $88million 2012: $69 million.
Defined benefit pension plans and post employment medical plans The Group operates defined benefit pension and medical plans across a number of segments.
The most significant plans are in South Africa and the UnitedKingdom.
A summary of the movements in the net pension plan assets and retirement benefit obligations on the Consolidated balance sheet is as follows: 2012 1 US$ million 2013 restated Net liability recognised at 1 January 1,233 569 Acquired through business combinations 889 Net income statement charge 88 80 Remeasurement of net defined benefit obligation 97 190 Employer contributions 151 90 Other 10 39 Currency movements 70 14 Net liability recognised at 31 December 1,013 1,233 Amounts recognised as: 2 Defined benefit pension plans in surplus 191 176 Retirement benefit obligation pension plans 727 828 Retirement benefit obligation medical plans 477 581 1,013 1,233 1 Certain balances related to 2012 have been restated to reflect the adoption of new accounting pronouncements.
2 Amounts included in Other non-current assets on the Consolidated balance sheet.
The majority of the defined benefit pension plans are funded.
The assets of these plans are held separately from those of the Group, in independently administered funds, in accordance with statutory requirements or local practice in the relevant jurisdiction.
The unfunded liabilities are principally in relation totermination indemnity plans in Chile.
The post employment medical plans provide health benefits to retired employees and certain dependants.
Eligibility for cover is dependent upon certain criteria.
The majority of these plans are unfunded, and are principally in South Africa.
Independent qualified actuaries carry out full valuations at least every three years using the projected unit credit method.
The actuaries have updated the valuations to 31 December 2013.
Assumptions are set after consultation with the qualified actuaries.
While management believe the assumptions used are appropriate, achange in the assumptions used would impact the Groups other comprehensive income.
Characteristics and risks of plans The defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risks such as longevity, investment risk, inflation risk, interest rate risk as well as foreign exchangerisk.
The maturity profile of each plan will vary.
The weighted average duration of the South African plans is 12 years 2012: 12 years, United Kingdom plans is 19years 2012: 19 years and plans in other regions is 14 years 2012: 14 years.
This represents the average period over which future benefit payments are expected to be made.
Employer contributions are made in accordance with the terms of each plan and vary each year.
Employer contributions made in the year were $151million topension plans and in addition $28 million of benefits were paid in relation to post employment medical plans.
The Group expects to contribute $152 million toits pension plans and $28million to its post employment medical plans in 2014.
South Africa The pension plans in South Africa are in surplus, with the asset recognised on the balance sheet restricted to the amount in the Employer Surplus Account, being plan assets less plan liabilities less any contingency reserves as recommended by the funds actuaries.
The Employer Surplus Account is the amount that the Group is entitled to by way of refund.
All pension plans in South Africa are now closed to new members and the majority of plans are closed to future benefit accrual.
As the plans are in surplus no employer contributions are currently being made.
The Groups provision of anti-retroviral therapy to HIV positive staff has not significantly impacted the post employment medical plan liability.
United Kingdom The Group operates funded pension plans in the United Kingdom.
These plans are now closed to new members and the majority of plans are closed to future benefit accrual.
Certain assets held by the main plans in the United Kingdom are structured to closely match the characteristics of the liabilities through a variety of investment strategies, including the use of interest rate swaps and inflation swaps to hedge exposure to interest rate risk and inflation rate risk respectively.
The Group is committed to make payments to certain United Kingdom pension plans under deficit funding plans agreed with the respective Trustees.
Where the present value of the agreed funding payments exceeds the liability in respect of the plans as measured under IFRS, and would therefore, when paid, give rise to a surplus as measured under IFRS, a provision is recognised for any part of that surplus that would not be recoverable.
Any resulting surplus has been assessed to be fully recoverable and as such no provision has been recognised.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS continued Other Other pension and post employment medical plans primarily comprise obligations in Chile where legislation requires employers to provide for a termination indemnity, entitling employees to a cash payment made on the termination of an employment contract.
The features of this provision meet the definition of a defined benefit pension obligation under IAS 19R and consequently an unfunded liability is recognised on the Consolidated balance sheet.
Other plans are in Brazil, Canada and mainland Europe and consist of funded and unfunded pension plans and unfunded medical aid plans.
These plans are not considered to be significant tothe Group.
Actuarial assumptions The principal assumptions used to determine the actuarial present value of benefit obligations and pension charges and credits under IAS 19R are detailed below shown as weighted averages : 2013 2012 South United South United Africa Kingdom Other Africa Kingdom Other Defined benefit pension plans Average discount rate for plan liabilities 8.8% 4.4% 7.3% 8.1% 4.3% 6.8% Average rate of inflation 6.4% 3.4% 3.5% 6.3% 2.8% 1.9% 1 2 1 2 Average rate of increase in salaries 8.3% 3.4% 6.6% 8.3% 2.8% 3.9% Average rate of increase of pensions in payment 6.4% 3.3% 3.4% 6.3% 3.0% 0.4% Post employment medical plans Average discount rate for plan liabilities 8.8% 4.3% 8.1% 8.0% 4.5% 5.7% Average rate of inflation 6.4% 3.4% 5.7% 6.4% 2.7% 3.9% Expected average increase in healthcare costs 8.2% 8.1% 8.1% 7.7% 7.5% 7.6% 1 With the exception of fide Beers, plans in South Africa have ceased future accrual of benefits.
2 With the exception of fide Beers, plans in the United Kingdom have ceased future accrual of benefits but some benefits remain linked to salary increases.
Mortality assumptions are determined based on standard mortality tables with adjustments, as appropriate, to reflect experience of conditions locally.
In South Africa, the PA90 tables 2012: PA90 tables are used.
The main plans in the United Kingdom use either SAPS tables or Club Vita models with plan specific adjustments based onmortality investigations 2012: SAPS tables and Club Vita models.
Themortality tables used imply that a male or female aged 60 at the balance sheet date has the following future life expectancy: Male Female Years 2013 2012 2013 2012 South Africa 19.8 20.1 24.6 24.9 United Kingdom 28.7 28.5 30.2 30.1 Other 22.7 23.4 27.0 27.4 Sensitivity analysis Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of pension and medical plan liabilities are the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality.
The sensitivity analysis below has been provided by local actuaries on an approximate basis based on changes in the assumptions occurring at the end of the year assuming that all other assumptions are held constant and the effect of interrelationships is excluded.
The effect on plan liabilities is as follows: 2013 South United US$ million Africa Kingdom Other Total Discount rate 0.5% decrease 84 392 20 496 1 Inflation rate 0.5% increase 81 199 13 293 Life expectancy increase by 1 year 67 121 6 194 1 Salary, pension and expected increases in healthcare costs are all functions of inflation.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS See note 40u for the Groups accounting policies on share-based payments.
During the year ended 31 December 2013 the Group had share-based payment arrangements with employees relating to shares of the Company, the details of which are described in the Remuneration report.
All of these Company schemes are equity settled, either by award of ordinary shares BSP, LTIP and SIP or award of options to acquire ordinary shares ESOS, DOP and SAYE.
The ESOS is now closed to new participants, having been replaced with the BSP.
No options have been granted under theDOP.
The total share-based payment charge relating to Anglo American plc shares for the year is split as follows: US$ million 2013 2012 BSP 82 103 LTIP 52 46 Other schemes 10 8 1 Share-based payment charge relating to Anglo American plc shares 144 157 1 In addition, there are equity settled share-based payment charges of $65 million 2012: $89 million relating to Kumba Iron Ore Limited shares and $52 million 2012: $72 million relating to Anglo American Platinum Limited shares.
Certain business units also operate cash settled employee share-based payment schemes.
These schemes had a net charge of nil 2012: charge of $3million.
Schemes settled by award of ordinary shares The fair value of ordinary shares awarded under the BSP, LTIP and LTIP AOSC, being the more material share schemes, was calculated using a Black Scholes model.
The fair value of shares awarded under the LTIP TSR scheme was calculated using a Monte Carlo model.
Thefair value calculated per the assumptions above has been applied to the total number of awards.
The difference in income statement charge is not considered significant.
2 Three years of continuous employment with enhancement shares having variable vesting based on non-market based performance conditions.
3 Three years of continuous employment.
4 Variable vesting dependent on three years of continuous employment and Group AOSC target being achieved.
5 Variable vesting dependent on three years of continuous employment and market based performance conditions being achieved.
The expected volatility is based on historic volatility over the last five years.
The risk free interest rate is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds with aterm similar to the expected life of the award.
The charges arising in respect of the other Anglo American plc employee share schemes that the Group operated during the year are not considered material.

30. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND FORMATION OF JOINT VENTURES See note 40d for the Groups accounting policy on business combinations and goodwill arising thereon.
2013 Lafarge Tarmac transaction On 18 February 2011 the Group announced an agreement with Lafarge SA Lafarge to combine their cement, aggregates, ready-mix concrete, asphalt and asphalt surfacing, maintenance services and waste services businesses in the United Kingdom, forming a 50:50 joint venture.
In May 2012 the Competition Commission approved the formation of the joint venture subject to a number of conditions being met.
In July 2012 the Group accepted the conditions of the Competition Commission and consequently the associated Tarmac Quarry Materials assets were classified as held for sale and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
On 7 January 2013 the Group announced the completion of the 50:50 joint venture.
At the same time, and pursuant to the Competition Commissions conditions precedent to the formation of the joint venture, the Group completed the sale of certain of Tarmac Quarry Materials operations for consideration of $196 million to Mittal Investments.
The agreed sale of Tarmac Quarry Materials 50% ownership interest in Midland Quarry Products was subject to a right of pre-emption in favour of Hanson Quarry Products Europe Limited Hanson, who exercised their right in April 2013.
The main accounting effects of the transaction are set out below: At 31 December 2012 the assets and liabilities of Tarmac Quarry Materials were presented separately in the Consolidated balance sheet, within Assets held for sale and Liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale.
During the first half of 2013 the Group disposed of its interests in Tarmac Quarry Materials in exchange for a 50% interest in the newly formed joint venture, plus cash, deferred consideration and contingent consideration receivable for the operations that were sold to Mittal Investments and Hanson.
This resulted in derecognition of all assets and liabilities relating to the Tarmac Quarry Materials operations and recognition of an investment in the Lafarge Tarmac joint venture included in Investments in associates and joint ventures on the Consolidated balance sheet.
The Groups retained interest in the assets and liabilities of Tarmac Quarry Materials was included at the pre-transaction carrying amount.
The Groups share of the Lafarge business, acquired through its new interest in the Lafarge Tarmac joint venture, was accounted for at fair value.
The difference between the fair value of the acquired share of the Lafarge business and the fair value of the acquired share of its identifiable net assets was recognised as goodwill.
The fair values of the Lafarge identifiable net assets acquired and of the Lafarge Tarmac joint venture as a whole, were determined primarily by reference to the present value of future income streams expected to be generated by the assets, and to market prices achieved for comparable assets.
Where appropriate, certain assets were valued using a depreciated replacement cost approach.
Fair values recognised on acquisition were provisional at 30 June 2013 and are final at 31 December 2013.
The net assets derecognised, the proceeds and the resulting loss on disposal were as follows: US$ million 2013 Intangible assets 417 Property, plant and equipment 1,642 Other non-current assets 11 Current assets excluding cash 400 Total assets classified as held for sale 2,470 Current liabilities 400 Non-current liabilities 262 Total liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale 662 Net assets derecognised 1,808 Exchanged for: 50% interest in Lafarge Tarmac joint venture 1,658 1 Cash net of cash derecognised 70 Deferred and contingent consideration 87 1,815 Net gain arising 7 Less: cumulative translation loss recycled from reserves 62 Net loss on disposal 55 1 Cash derecognised in the transaction was $39 million.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND FORMATION OF JOINT VENTURES continued The Groups share of the net assets of the joint venture included in Investments in associates and joint ventures on the Consolidated balance sheet, based on final fair values at the date of acquisition, was as follows: 2013 Retained share in Acquired Tarmac share of Quarry Lafarge Joint venture Materials business net assets US$ million Book values Fair values Total Property, plant and equipment 721 560 1,281 Other non-current assets 6 8 14 Current assets 247 246 493 Net assets classified as held for sale 28 28 Current liabilities 266 239 505 Non-current liabilities 120 81 201 Net identifiable assets 616 494 1,110 Goodwill 202 346 548 1 Investment in joint venture 818 840 1,658 1 Included within the Other Mining and Industrial segment.
Goodwill of $548 million within the investment comprised $202 million of pre-existing goodwill relating to the retained interest in the Tarmac Quarry Materials business, and $346 million of goodwill relating to the formation of the new joint venture.
The latter portion relates in part to synergies expected to be realised through the combination of the two businesses, and also includes $26 million associated with the requirement to recognise a deferred tax liability based on the difference between the fair value of the assets acquired and their tax bases.
2012 fide Beers On 16 August 2012 Anglo American acquired an additional 40% of the share capital of fide Beers Socit Anonyme fide Beers to bring its total shareholding to85%.
fide Beers is a leading diamond company with expertise in the exploration, mining and marketing of diamonds.
The Group funded the acquisition by way of cash consideration of $5.2 billion, less cash acquired of $0.4 billion.
The acquisition has been accounted for as abusiness combination using the acquisition method of accounting with an effective date of 16 August 2012, being the date the Group gained control of DeBeers.
Goodwill recognised on acquisition, of $2,355 million, arose principally from the significant synergies associated with the Group having control of fide Beers, the value associated with the DeBeers workforce and the requirement to recognise a deferred tax liability calculated as the difference between the tax effect of the fair value of the assets acquired and their tax bases.
No goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

2 Included in non-operating special items, see note 6.
The total net loss on disposal of Amap of $175 million also includes a $46 million impairment recognised in the six months ending 30June2013.
Disposal of Amap On 28 December 2012 Anglo American and Cliffs Natural Resources Cliffs agreed to sell their respective 70% and 30% interests in the Amap iron ore system, including the mine, the rail infrastructure and the port of Santana, to Zamin Ferrous Limited Zamin.
Amap was classified as held for sale as at 31December 2012.
On 28 March 2013 an incident occurred which resulted in the tragic loss of four lives with a further two people still missing, as well as the total loss of the port operation.
A detailed investigation into the causes of the incident has been undertaken and the results have been passed on to Amaps insurers.
In light of the incident at the port, Anglo American entered into further discussions with Cliffs and Zamin.
On 25 September 2013 the Group announced that it had entered into an agreement with Cliffs to acquire its 30% interest in Amap and had agreed to amend its sale agreement with Zamin to reflect, inter alia, Anglo Americans disposal of a 100% interest in Amap to Zamin.
These transactions completed on 1 November 2013.
Consideration of $164 million from Zamin comprised: $134 million in cash net of certain adjustments at completion.
A potential adjustment of up to an additional $25 million is subject to the outcome of certain rulings in respect of the port reconstruction: and conditional deferred consideration of up to a maximum of $130 million in total, payable over a five year period and calculated on the basis of the market price for iron ore.
The estimated fair value of this consideration was $30 million.
Anglo American assumed responsibility for, and the risks and rewards of, certain insurance claims including those relating to the port incident, through the purchase of the claims from Amap at the full claim value of $168 million.
After the transaction the Group continued to recognise a deferred consideration asset, an insurance receivable and certain retained liabilities.
The valuation of the amounts receivable and the retained liabilities incorporates estimates, particularly in relation to the likely value of conditional deferred consideration receivable and the fair value of the insurance claims acquired from Amap.
These estimates are based on assumptions about future events and conditions which are considered appropriate based on the information available.
Reasonable changes in these assumptions would not result in a material change in the loss on disposal.
Disposal proceeds in 2013 In addition to the net cash outflow of $45 million on disposal of Amap, there was a net cash inflow of $48 million in respect of the formation of the Lafarge Tarmac joint venture Other Mining and Industrial segment, see note 30, a cash inflow of $44 million relating to deferred proceeds in respect of undeveloped coal assets in Australia which the Group disposed of in 2010 Metallurgical Coal segment, a further $30 million cash payment in respect of liabilities assumed as part of the Amap disposal and payments of $4 million in respect of transaction fees accrued in prior years.
This resulted in a net cash inflow on disposal of subsidiaries, net of cash disposed, of $13 million for the year ended 31December 2013.
Disposals in 2012 Disposals during 2012 relate to the disposal of Scaw South Africa and related companies in the Other Mining and Industrial segment.

Under the terms of these agreements, the Investment Companies have purchased Anglo American plc shares on the market and have granted to Tenon the right to nominate a third party which may include Anglo American plc but not any of its subsidiaries to take transfer of the Anglo American plc shares each has purchased on the market.
Tenon paid the Investment Companies 80% of the cost of the Anglo American plc shares including associated costs for this right to nominate, which together with subscriptions by Tenon for non-voting participating redeemable preference shares in the Investment Companies, provided all the funding required to acquire the Anglo American plc shares through the market.
These payments by Tenon were sourced from the cash resources of AASA.
Tenon is able to exercise its right of nomination at any time up to 31December 2025 against payment of an average amount of $5.16 per share to Epoch, $8.03 per share to Epoch Two and $6.66 per share to Tarl which will be equal to 20% of the total costs respectively incurred by Epoch, Epoch Two and Tarl in purchasing shares nominated for transfer to the third party.
These funds will then become available for redemption of the preference shares issued by the Investment Companies.
The amount payable by the third party on receipt of the AngloAmerican plc shares will accrue to Tenon and, in accordance with paragraph 33 of IAS 32, any resulting gain or loss recorded by Tenon will not be recognised in the Consolidated income statement of Anglo American plc.
Under the agreements, the Investment Companies will receive dividends on the shares they hold and have agreed to waive the right to vote on those shares.
The preference shares issued to the charitable trusts are entitled to a participating right of up to 10% of the profit after tax of Epoch and 5% of the profit after tax of Epoch Two and Tarl.
The preference shares issued to Tenon will carry a fixed coupon of 3% plus a participating right of up to 80% of the profit after tax of Epoch and 85% of the profit after tax of Epoch Two and Tarl.
Any remaining distributable earnings in the Investment Companies, after the above dividends, are then available for distribution as ordinary dividends to the charitable trusts.
The structure effectively provides Tenon with a beneficial interest in the price risk on these shares together with a participation in future dividend receipts.
The Investment Companies will retain legal title to the shares until Tenon exercises its right to nominate a transferee.
At 31 December 2013 the Investment Companies together held 112,300,129 2012: 112,300,129 Anglo American plc shares, which represented 8.1% 2012:8.1% of the ordinary shares in issue excluding treasury shares with a market value of $2,451million 2012: $3,455million.
The Investment Companies are not permitted to hold more than an aggregate of 10% of the issued share capital of Anglo American plc at any one time.
The Investment Companies are considered to be structured entities.
Although the Group has no voting rights in the Investment Companies and cannot appoint or remove trustees of the charitable trusts, the Investment Companies continue to meet the accounting definition of a subsidiary in accordance with IFRS 10, and as a result are consolidated by the Group.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES The Group is subject to various claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
Additionally, and as set out in the 2007 demerger agreement, Anglo American and the Mondi Group have agreed to indemnify each other, subject to certain limitations, against certain liabilities.
Anglo American has also provided Mitsubishi Corporation LLC with indemnities against certain liabilities as part of the sale to Mitsubishi of a 24.5% interest in Anglo American Sur SA in 2011.
Having taken appropriate legal advice, the Group believes that a material liability arising from the indemnities provided is unlikely.
The Group is required to provide guarantees in several jurisdictions in respect of environmental restoration and decommissioning obligations.
The Group has provided for the estimated cost of these activities.
No contingent liabilities were secured on the assets of the Group at 31 December 2013 or 31 December 2012.
Other Kumba Iron Ore Kumba 21.4% undivided share of the Sishen mine mineral rights On 28 March 2013 the Supreme Court of Appeal SCA dismissed the appeals of the Department of Mineral Resources DMR and Imperial Crown Trading 289 Pty Ltd ICT against the decision of the North Gauteng High Court, which, inter alia, confirmed that Sishen Iron Ore Company Pty Ltd SIOC became the exclusive holder of the mining rights at the Sishen mine in 2008 when the DMR converted SIOCs old order rights, and further set aside the grant of a prospecting right to ICT by the DMR.
The SCA held that as a matter of law and as at midnight on 30 April 2009, SIOC became the sole holder of the mining right to iron ore in respect of the Sishen mine, after ArcelorMittal South Africa Limited ArcelorMittal S. A. failed to convert its undivided share of the old order mining right.
Both ICT and the DMR lodged applications for leave to appeal against the SCA to the Constitutional Court.
The Constitutional Court hearing was held on 3September 2013.
On 12 December 2013 the Constitutional Court granted the DMRs appeal in part against the SCA judgment.
In a detailed judgment, the Constitutional Court clarified that SIOC, when it lodged its application for conversion of its old order right, converted only the right it held at that time being a 78.6% undivided share in the Sishen mining right.
The Constitutional Court further held that ArcelorMittal S. A. retained the right to lodge its old order right 21.4% undivided share for conversion before midnight on 30 April 2009, but failed to do so.
As a consequence of such failure by ArcelorMittal S. A. the 21.4% undivided right remained available for allocation by the DMR.
The Constitutional Court ruled further that, based on the provisions of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act MPRDA, only SIOC can apply for the residual 21.4% undivided share of the Sishen mining right.
The grant of the mining right may be made subject to such conditions considered by the Minister to be appropriate, provided that the proposed conditions are permissible under the MPRDA.
SIOC had previously applied for this 21.4%, and continues to account for 100% of what is mined from the reserves at Sishen mine.
SIOC has however, in compliance with the Constitutional Court order, submitted a further application to be granted this right.
As a further consequence of this finding, the High Courts ruling setting aside the prospecting right granted by the DMR to ICT also stands.
The findings made by the Constitutional Court are favourable to both SIOC and the DMR.
SIOCs position as the only competent applicant for the residual right protects SIOCs interests.
The DMRs position as custodian of the mineral resources on behalf of the nation, and the authority of the DMR to allocate rights, has also been ratified by the Court.
ArcelorMittal S. A. supply agreement The dispute between SIOC and ArcelorMittal S. A. regarding the contract mining agreement had been referred to arbitration in 2010.
In December 2011 the parties agreed to delay the arbitration proceedings until the final resolution of the mining rights dispute see above.
Interim Pricing Agreements were implemented to 31 December 2013.
In November 2013 SIOC and ArcelorMittal S. A. entered into a new Supply Agreement regulating the sale and purchase of iron ore between the parties which became effective from 1 January 2014.
This agreement, subject to certain express conditions, is contemplated to endure until the end of Life of Mine for the Sishenmine.
The conclusion of this agreement settled the arbitration and the various other disputes between the companies.
Following the Constitutional Court ruling see above, the sale of iron ore from SIOC to ArcelorMittal S. A. will remain regulated by the recently concluded SupplyAgreement.
Anglo American South Africa Limited AASA AASA, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in England and South Africa on behalf of former mineworkers ortheir dependants or survivors who allegedly contracted silicosis working for gold mining companies in which AASA was a shareholder and to which AASA provided various technical and administrative services.
In England: AASA is a defendant in five lawsuits filed in the High Court in London on behalf of approximately 6,000 named former mineworkers or their dependants.
One of the lawsuits is also a representative claim on behalf of all black underground miners in Anglo gold mines who have been certified as suffering from silicosis and related diseases.
In South Africa: i AASA is a defendant in approximately 100 separate lawsuits filed in the North Gauteng High Court Pretoria which have been referred to arbitration.
ii AASA is named as one of 32 defendants in a consolidated class certification application filed in South Africa.
iii On 19 September 2013 AASA concluded a settlement agreement in terms of which 23 claims filed in South Africa between 2004 and 2009 were settled, without admission of liability by AASA.
The terms of the agreement and the settlement amount which is not material to AASA are confidential.
The aggregate amount of the individual South African claims is less than $15 million excluding claims for interests and costs.
No specific amount of damages has been specified in the claims filed in England or in the consolidated class certification application filed in South Africa.
AASA successfully contested the jurisdiction of the English courts to hear the claims filed against it in that jurisdiction.
That ruling has been appealed.
AASA is defending the separate lawsuits filed in South Africa and will oppose the application for consolidated class certification in South Africa.

Related party transaction with Mitsubishi During the year the Group entered into a transaction with a related party of the Company for the purposes of the United Kingdom Listing Authority Listing Rules.
An Anglo American subsidiary entered into a Shareholder Agreement SHA with a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corporation Mitsubishi in relation to Anglo American Quellaveco SA, which owns Anglo Americans Quellaveco copper project.
Mitsubishi is a related party to Anglo American because its wholly owned subsidiary is a substantial shareholder in Anglo American Sur SA, a significant subsidiary of the Company.
Anglo American Sur SA owns and operates copper mines and metallurgical plants in Chile and has no ownership interest in Quellaveco.
Anglo American has a controlling 81.9% interest in Anglo American Quellaveco SA.
Mitsubishi purchased its 18.1% shareholding in this company in 2011 from an unrelated third party.
The entry into the SHA provides a formal contractual relationship with a minority shareholder to give more certainty to the way in which the shareholding relationship in Anglo American Quellaveco SA is managed.
It is primarily focused on the governance aspects of the relationship, information rights, the transferability of shares, arrangements for future funding and entitlement to production from the Quellaveco project.
The entry into the SHA did not involve a purchase or sale of an asset and no value is ascribed to this transaction.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Board approves and monitors the risk management processes, including documented treasury policies, counterparty limits, controlling and reporting structures.
The risk management processes of the Groups independently listed subsidiaries are in line with the Groups own policy.
The types of risk exposure, the way in which such exposure is managed and quantification of the level of exposure in the Consolidated balance sheet at 31December is provided as follows subcategorised into credit risk, commodity price risk, foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk.
Market risks a Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will cause a loss to Anglo American by failing to pay for its obligation.
The Groups principal financial assets, including amounts in assets held for sale that are susceptible to credit risks, are cash, trade and other receivables, investments and derivative financial instruments.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk primarily arises from these financial assets and is as follows: 2012 1 US$ million 2013 restated Cash and cash equivalents 7,702 9,298 2 Trade and other receivables 3,874 3,966 3 Financial asset investments 759 1,441 Derivative financial assets 674 848 4 Financial guarantees 12 33 13,021 15,586 1 Certain balances related to 2012 have been restated to reflect the adoption of new accounting pronouncements.
3 Financial asset investments exclude available for sale investments.
4 Financial guarantees issued by the Group in respect of third party liabilities represent an exposure to credit risk in excess of the Groups financial assets.
The Group limits credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments through diversification of exposures with a range of approved financial institutions.
Counterparty limits are set for each financial institution with reference to credit ratings assigned by Standard & Poors, Moodys and Fitch Ratings.
Given the diverse nature of the Groups operations both in relation to commodity markets and geographically, together with insurance cover including letters of credit from financial institutions, it does not have significant concentration of credit risk in respect of trade receivables, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is made where there is an identified loss event, which based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
Details of the credit quality of trade receivables and the associated provision for impairment are disclosed in note 16. b Commodity price risk The Groups earnings are exposed to movements in the prices of the commodities it produces.
The Groups policy is to sell its products at prevailing market prices and is generally not to hedge commodity price risk, although some hedging may be undertaken for strategic reasons.
In such cases, the Group generally uses forward and deferred contracts to hedge the price risk.
Certain of the Groups sales and purchases are provisionally priced, meaning that the selling price is determined normally 30 to 180 days after delivery to the customer, based on quoted market prices stipulated in the contract, and as a result are susceptible to future price movements.
The exposure of the Groups financial assets and liabilities to commodity price risk is as follows: 2012 1 2013 restated Commodity price linked Commodity price linked Not Not Subject to linked to Subject to linked to price Fixed commodity price Fixed commodity 2 3 2 3 US$ million movements price price Total movements price price Total Total net financial instruments excluding derivatives 1,261 678 10,946 9,007 304 1,087 8,281 6,890 Commodity derivatives net 3 3 1 1 Non-commodity derivatives net 834 834 232 232 Total financial instrument exposure to commodity risk 1,258 678 11,780 9,844 303 1,087 8,513 7,123 1 Certain balances related to 2012 have been restated to reflect the adoption of new accounting pronouncements.
2 Includes provisionally priced trade receivables and trade payables.
3 Includes receivables and payables for commodity sales and purchases not subject to price adjustment at the balance sheet date.
Commodity based contracts that are settled through physical delivery of the Groups production or are used within the production process, are classified as normal purchase or sale contracts and are not marked to market.
c Foreign exchange risk As a global business, the Group is exposed to many currencies principally as a result of non-US dollar operating costs and, to a lesser extent, from non-US dollar revenue.
The Brazilian real and South African rand are the most significant non-US dollar currencies influencing costs.
A strengthening of the US dollar against the currencies to which the Group is exposed has a positive effect on Anglo Americans underlying earnings.
The Groups policy is generally not to hedge such exposures as hedging is not deemed appropriate given the diversified nature of the Group, though exceptions can be approved by the Group Management Committee.
In addition, currency exposures exist in respect of non-US dollar approved capital expenditure projects and non-US dollar borrowings in US dollar functional currency entities.
The Groups policy is that such exposures should be hedged subject to a review of the specific circumstances of the exposure.
Analysis of foreign exchange risk associated with net debt balances and the impact of derivatives to hedge against this risk is included within note 25.
Of net other financial assets excluding net debt related balances of $811 million, $278 million are denominated in US dollar and $443 million in South African rand.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2013 203 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES 39.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued d Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises due to fluctuations in interest rates which impact on the value of short term investments and financing activities.
The Groups exposure to interest rate risk is particularly with reference to changes in US and South African interest rates.
The Groups policy is to borrow funds at floating rates of interest as, over the longer term, this is considered by management to give somewhat of a natural hedge against commodity price movements, given the correlation with economic growth and industrial activity, which in turn shows a high correlation with commodity price fluctuation.
In certain circumstances, the Group uses interest rate swap contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on a portion of its existing debt.
Strategic hedging using fixed rate debt may also be undertaken from time to time if approved by the Group Management Committee.
In respect of financial assets, the Groups policy is to invest cash at floating rates of interest and to maintain cash reserves in short term investments less than one year in order to maintain liquidity, while achieving a satisfactory return for shareholders.
Analysis of interest rate risk associated with net debt balances and the impact of derivatives to hedge against this risk is included within note 25.
Of net other financial assets excluding net debt related balances of $811 million, the majority are non-interest bearing.
e Financial instrument sensitivities Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits, derivative financial instruments, trade receivables and trade payables.
The following analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Groups financial instruments at 31 December to changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currencies.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the components of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31 December.
In addition, the commodity price impact for provisionally priced contracts is based on the related trade receivables and trade payables at 31 December.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the position at 31 December.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: all income statement sensitivities also impact equity for debt and other deposits carried at amortised cost, carrying value does not change as interest rates move no sensitivity is provided for interest accruals as these are based on pre-agreed interest rates and therefore are not susceptible to further rate changes changes in the carrying value of derivatives from movements in commodity prices and interest rates designated as cash flow hedges are assumed to be recorded fully within equity on the grounds of materiality no sensitivity has been calculated on derivatives and related underlying instruments designated into fair value hedge relationships as these are assumed materially to offset one another all hedge relationships are assumed to be fully effective on the grounds of materiality debt with a maturity of less than one year is floating rate, unless it is a long term fixed rate debt in its final year translation of foreign subsidiaries and operations into the Groups presentation currency has been excluded from the sensitivity.
Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the income statement and equity that would result from reasonably possible changes in the relevant commodity price.
The Group has determined that at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012, based on the above assumptions, there is no significant sensitivity to changes in market interest rates.

2 Includes sensitivities for non-hedge derivatives related to capital expenditure.
The above sensitivities are calculated with reference to a single moment in time and are subject to change due to a number of factors including: fluctuating trade receivable and trade payable balances derivative instruments and borrowings settled throughout the year fluctuating cash balances changes in currency mix.
As the sensitivities are limited to year end financial instrument balances, they do not take account of the Groups sales and operating costs, which are highly sensitive to changes in commodity prices and exchange rates.
In addition, each of the sensitivities is calculated in isolation whilst, in reality, commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currencies do not move independently.
