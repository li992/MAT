Electrocomponents plc Annual Report and Accounts 201397 NOTES TO THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 4 Pension schemes The UK defined benefit scheme is described in note 7 of the Group accounts.
The last actuarial valuation of the UK scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2010 and has been updated to 31 March 2013 by a qualified independent actuary in accordance with FRS 17.
The balance on the UK scheme is included within the balance sheet of RS Components Limited, a subsidiary of Electrocomponents plc, as it is this company which employs the majority of the scheme members.
As allowed by FRS 17, the balance has not been split between Electrocomponents plc and RS Components Limited as it is not possible to do so on a consistent and reasonable basis.
This disclosure therefore relates to the UK pension scheme rather than just the Electrocomponents plc portion of it.
The only significant difference that has been identified as between IAS 19 IFRS and FRS 17 UK GAAP is that the surplus in 2012 may be recognised under UK GAAP in the accounts of RS Components Limited.
The valuation of the scheme as at 31 March was: 2013 2012 m m Total market value of assets 384.3 346.2 Present value of scheme liabilities 396.7 335.6 Deficit Surplus in the scheme recognised in RS Components Limited 12.4 10.6 5 Dividends 2013 2012 m m Amounts recognised in the period: Final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2012 6.75p 2011: 6.5p 29.5 28.3 Interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2013 5.0p 2012: 5.0p 21.8 21.8 51.3 50.1 Proposed dividend for the year ended 31 March 2013 6.75p 29.5 The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 17 July 2013 and has not been included as a liability in these accounts.
