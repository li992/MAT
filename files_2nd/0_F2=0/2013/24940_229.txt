Contingent liabilities arising from legal proceedings and regulatory matters against Group companies are disclosed in Note 43.
Nominal principal amounts represent the amounts at risk should the contracts be fully drawn upon and clients default.
The amount of the loan commitments shown above reflects, where relevant, the expected level of take-up of preapproved loan offers made by mailshots to personal customers.
As a significant portion of guarantees and commitments is expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total of the nominal principal amounts is not indicative of future liquidity requirements.
Guarantees HSBC provides guarantees and similar undertakings on behalf of both third-party customers and other entities within the HSBC Group.
These guarantees are generally provided in the normal course of HSBCs banking business.
The principal types of guarantees provided and the maximum potential amount of future payments which HSBC could be required to make at 31 December 2013 were as follows: At 31 December 2013 At 31 December 2012 Guarantees Guarantees by HSBC by HSBC Holdings Holdings Guarantees in favour of Guarantees in favour of in favour of other HSBC in favour of other HSBC third parties Group entities third parties Group entities US$m US$m US$m US$m Guarantee type 1 Financial guarantees.................................................................... 31,224 36,800 32,036 36,800 2 Credit-related guarantees............................................................ 15,076 16,036 12,957 12,602 Other guarantees........................................................................... 38,254 35,371 84,554 52,836 80,364 49,402 1 Financial guarantees are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss incurred because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.
2 Credit-related guarantees are contracts that have similar features to financial guarantee contracts but fail to meet the definition of a financial guarantee contract under IAS 39.
The amounts disclosed in the above table are nominal principal amounts and reflect HSBCs maximum exposure under a large number of individual guarantee undertakings.
The risks and exposures arising from guarantees are captured and managed in accordance with HSBCs overall credit risk management policies and procedures.
Approximately half of the above guarantees have a term of less than one year.
Guarantees with terms of more than one year are subject to HSBCs annual credit review process.
