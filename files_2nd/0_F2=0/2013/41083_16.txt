directors remuneration rePort CONTINUED The table below shows the interests of harry Platt, a former Executive Director in the Savings Related Share Option Plan and the 2000 Approved Executive Share Option Plan.
Under the rules of the Executive Share Option Plan, if an option holder ceases to be a Director or employee of the Company on account of injury, ill health, disability, redundancy or retirement the Option may be exercised within a period of six months after cessation.
Given that the exercise price of all options that potentially could have been exercised were greater than the mid-market closing share price of Workspace ordinary shares on 31 December 2012 six months from date of cessation of harry Platt no profit would have arisen upon exercise of any of these options.
Consequently, these Options have been lapsed in full.
The closing mid-market price of Workspace Group PLC ordinary shares at 31 December 2012 was 3.02 and 28 March 2013 was 3.432.
During the year, the price of the Companys shares varied between 2.13 and 3.63.
Relate to Options granted under the rules of the SAYE Scheme and exercised in full in accordance with the SAYE Scheme rules.
There have been no changes in Directors interests over options in the period between the balance sheet date and 11 June 2013.
