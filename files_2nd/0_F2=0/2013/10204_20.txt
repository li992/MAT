B Foreign currency translation The functional currency of the Company is US Dollars.

C Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
D Called up share capital, share premium and dividend distribution Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

Interim dividends are recognized when paid.
E Taxation Corporation tax is payable on taxable profits at amounts expected to be paid, or recovered, under the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognized to take account of timing differences between the treatment of transactions for financial reporting purposes and their treatment for tax purposes.
A deferred tax asset is only recognized when it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be a suitable taxable profit from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse based on the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
F Employee benefit costs a Pension obligations The Company operates a defined contribution plan for which it pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
The Company has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
b Share based compensation The Company operated various equity-settled, share based compensation plans during the year.
No expense is recognized in respect of share options granted before 7 November 2002 and vested before 1 January 2005.
For shares or share options granted after 7 November 2002 and vested after 1 January 2005 the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the shares or options is recognized as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares or options granted.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
It recognizes the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the profit and loss account, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital contribution.
The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognized over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity in the parent entity accounts.
The social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of the share options is considered an integral part of the grant itself, and the charge is treated as a cash-settled transaction.
