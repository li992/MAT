The measures are deemed to be of importance for investors in property companies and aim to encourage more consistent and widespread disclosure.

However, we believe that our measure of underlying earnings per share is more appropriate than the EPRA measure in the context of our business as set out in note 18 c. The key difference relates to the adjustments in respect of exceptional items where EPRA is prescriptive about the adjustments that can be made.
A reconciliation of EPRA earnings per share to the Groups measure of underlying earnings per share is provided below.

However, we believe that our measure of NAV per share diluted, adjusted is more appropriate than the EPRA measure in the context of our business as set out in note 19 b.
The key difference is the swaps not currently used for economic hedges of debt which are excluded in the Group's definition of NAV per share diluted, adjusted.
The adjustment in respect of the non-controlling interest recoverable balance not recognised is due to historic accounting practices and is required, in our view, to give a more appropriate value of net assets attributable to equity owners of the Group.
