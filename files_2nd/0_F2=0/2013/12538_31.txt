156 Premier Oil plc 2013 Annual Report and Financial Statements NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued For the year ended 31 December 2013 7.
Pension Schemes continued Movements over previous five year period: 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million Defined benefit obligation 38.9 34.0 31.3 32.3 31.2 Scheme assets 44.5 38.2 28.4 28.2 25.6 Surplus deficit 5.6 4.2 2.9 4.1 5.6 Experience loss gain on Scheme liabilities 0.1 0.1 0.9 0.6 0.6 Loss gain from changes in the assumptions for value of Scheme liabilities 3.1 0.3 2.9 0.6 5.5 Experience gain loss on Scheme assets 1.1 1.4 0.7 1.5 1.9 Projected components of pension expense for year to 31 December 2014 The significant volatility in investment markets means that it is difficult to project forward the FRS 17 figures for the next year with confidence.
The following projections should therefore be treated with caution.
Assumptions implicit in the following projections are: the return on assets from 31 December 2013 is 5.5 per cent per annum: contributions to the Scheme will continue throughout the period in accordance with the current schedule of contributions in place at the date of signing this report: and there will be no changes to the terms of the Scheme.
The amounts recognised in the components of pension expense are: 2014 $ million Current service cost 0.3 Interest cost 1.7 Expected return on Scheme assets 2.1 Total 0.1 Sensitivity and risk The results of the calculations are sensitive to the assumptions used.
The balance sheet position revealed by FRS 17 calculations must be expected to be volatile, principally because the market value of assets with a significant exposure to equities is being compared with a liability assessment derived from corporate bond yields.
The table below illustrates the sensitivity of the FRS 17 balance sheet position to small changes in some of the assumptions.
Where one assumption has been changed all the other assumptions are kept the same as disclosed.
Change from Revised disclosed Surplus Surplus deficit deficit US$ million US$ million Discount rate less 0.1% pa 4.9 0.7 RPI inflation and linked assumptions plus 0.1% pa 4.9 0.7 Members living one year longer than expected 4.6 1.0 The key risks which could significantly impact the balance sheet, and to a lesser extent the profit and loss account, are as follows: a reduction in the discount rate, which will increase the value placed on the Scheme's liabilities: an increase in price inflation and or salary inflation: and improving life expectancy lower mortality rates resulting in benefits being paid for longer.
Unfunded pensions The company is paying an unfunded pension to a former director in regard to which annual increases and a reversionary spouse's pension apply on the same basis as to pensions paid under the Scheme.
On the same actuarial basis as used to assess the Scheme's pension costs, the present value as at 31 December 2013 of the future payments projected to be made in respect of UK unfunded pensions is US$0.9 million 2012: US$0.9 million.
