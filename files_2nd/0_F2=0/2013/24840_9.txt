Financial Results Accounting At 31 March 2013, the Group had 25 investments classified for IFRS reporting purposes as subsidiaries which it was deemed to control by virtue of having the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of the project entities.
This has increased by five over the year due to three incremental acquisitions and the purchase of two wholly-owned new investments.
Under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, the results of these companies are required to be consolidated in the Groups financial statements on a line-by-line basis.
However, these investments form part of a portfolio of similar investments which are held for investment purposes and managed as a whole and there is no distinction for operational purposes made between those investments classified as subsidiaries and those which are not.
Further, all debt owed by the Groups investments is non-recourse and the Group does not participate in their day-to-day management.
As in previous periods, in order to provide shareholders with further information regarding the Groups net asset value, coupled with greater transparency in the Companys capacity for investment and ability to make distributions, the results have been restated in pro-forma tables which follow the Financial Results.
The pro-forma tables show all investments accounted for on an Investment basis, which are reconciled to the consolidated financial statements on a line by line basis.
By deconsolidating the subsidiary investments, the performance of the business under consolidated IFRS basis may be compared with the results under the Investment basis.
In October 2012 revised IFRS standards were issued Investment Entities Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 to address the consolidation of investments held by investment companies.
These revised accounting standards are expected to require the Group in the future to prepare IFRS financial statements which do not consolidate subsidiaries in a similar manner to the Groups current pro-forma Investment basis tables.
The Group expects that these revised standards will apply to the Group and anticipate adoption of these standards in respect of the year ending March 2014 following their official adoption by the EU.

On this basis, the Ongoing Charges Percentage is 1.19% 2012 equivalent: 1.38%.
There are no performance fees paid to any service provider.
The Ongoing Charges reduced in the year by 0.2% reflecting a combination of lower gearing during the year on an Investment basis and the Groups expenses being spread over a larger capital base.
As the Investment Advisers management fee is based on a percentage of the portfolio value, lower gearing on an Investment basis means that the Investment Advisers fee as a percentage of net assets is lower and hence the Ongoing Charge Percentage is reduced.
