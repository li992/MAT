26 Contingent Liabilities Intellectual property litigation is commonplace in our industry and poses risks and uncertainties that may materially and adversely affect or disrupt our business, customer relationships, expenses or results of operations.
We are regularly involved in pending and threatened litigation in the course of our business and industry, which litigation may be inherently uncertain.
With respect to both existing and future litigation, we will continue vigorously to defend ourselves and or take other steps as we believe are in the overall interests of CSR and its shareholders.
The Company and its subsidiaries are currently involved in two patent infringement cases as disclosed below.
Other than these, the Company and its subsidiaries are not involved in any legal or arbitration proceedings which may have, or have had in the 12 months preceding the date of this report, a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Further, other than as disclosed below, due to inherent uncertainties, no accurate qualification of any cost, or timing of such cost, which may arise from any of the legal proceedings outlined below can be made.
CSR is a named defendant in two patent infringement cases filed by patent portfolio non-practising entities.
Each of these two cases includes other defendants.
The case brought by plaintiffs Azure Networks and Tri-County Excelsior Foundation is on appeal to the uS Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit following judgement of non-infringement entered against the plaintiffs on 30 May 2013 in the uS District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.
The case filed by HSM Portfolio and Technology Property on 1 September 2011 in the uS District Court for Delaware is in the discovery stages with trial scheduled for September 2015.
No provision has been recorded for any of the cases above as cash outflow has not been deemed probable at the balance sheet date.
