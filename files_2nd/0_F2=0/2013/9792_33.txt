Financial statements Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2013 86 Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Segmental information IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reporting on components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the executive directors.
The executive directors review the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources across each operating segment.
The operating segments are UK and International which are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting to the executive directors.
The UK segment consists of the UK retail business and UK franchise operations.
The International segment consists of Marks & Spencer owned businesses in the Republic of Ireland, Europe and Asia, together with international franchise operations.
The executive directors assess the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of operating profit.
This measurement basis excludes the effects of non-underlying items from the operating segments.
Central costs are all classified as UK costs and presented within UK operating profit.
The executive directors also monitor revenue within the segments.
To increase transparency, the Group has decided to include an additional voluntary disclosure analysing revenue within the reportable segments, by subcategory.
UK statutory profit includes 35.6m last year 50.7m in respect of fees received from HSBC in relation to M&S Bank formerly M&S Money.
UK management operating profit includes fees in relation to M&S Bank of 51.1m last year 50.7m, which reflects a non GAAP adjustment of 15.5m as detailed in note 5.
Adjustments to revenue relate to an adjustment for refunds recognised in cost of sales for management accounting purposes.
Management profit excludes the adjustments income or charges made to reported profit before tax that are one-off in nature, significant and distort the Groups underlying performance see note 5.
Following a change in the presentation of internal reporting, management revenue and the corresponding adjustments that reconcile to statutory revenue have been re-presented.
Certain revenue deductions such as staff discounts and loyalty points that were previously recognised in management cost of sales are now recognised in management revenue to align with statutory accounting.
There have been no changes to the reported segments.

These adjustments include: Strategic programme costs relating to the strategy announcements made in November 2010 and include the costs associated with the Focus on the UK plans.
This includes brand segmentation and business integration costs, asset write-offs and accelerated depreciation.
These costs are not considered normal operating costs of the business: Restructuring costs relating to the commencement of the Groups strategy to transition to a one tier distribution network and the closure costs of legacy logistics sites: IAS 36 Impairment of assets last year, the carrying value of the Marks and Spencer Marinopolous B.

On this basis the rate was reset at 9%.
In light of continued low long-term market interest rates and the successful bond issuance in December 2012, the Group bought back and cancelled these bonds in January 2013, resulting in a one-off fair value loss.
This charge is the fair value movement of the bond net of any immaterial associated unamortised bond costs and fees.
It is not considered a normal finance cost of the business: and The Group has an economic interest in M&S Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC, by way of a Relationship Agreement that entitles the Group to a 50% share of the profits of M&S Bank after appropriate deductions.
The Group does not share in any losses of M&S Bank and is not obligated to refund any fees received from HSBC although future income may be impacted by significant one-off deductions.
In the current year, the fee income has been impacted by the deduction of the estimated liability for providing redress to customers in respect of possible mis-selling of financial products.
This estimated liability has been recognised by M&S Bank in its audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012, the Groups share of which reduces the overall income due to it under the Relationship Agreement and has been treated as an adjustment to reported profit before tax on the basis that the directors believe that the impact of the provision recognised by M&S Bank materially distorts the Groups underlying performance.
The Group expects there to be a further reduction in fee income of c. 45m in the year to 29 March 2014.
The effect of the significant, one-off adjustments to the Groups income received from HSBC in the prior year was not material.
We are discussing with M&S Bank whether these charges are properly for our account under the terms of our agreement with HSBC.

On 3 July 2012, the Finance Bill received its third reading in the House of Commons and so the previously announced reduced rate of corporation tax of 23% from 1 April 2013 was substantively enacted.
The Group has remeasured its UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period at 23%, which has resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax credit of 5.7m in the income statement reducing the total effective tax rate by 1%, and the recognition of a deferred tax credit of 4.0m in other comprehensive income.
The Chancellor has further stated his intention to reduce the main rate of corporation tax to 21% from 1 April 2014 and to 20% from 1 April 2015.
These changes have not been substantively enacted at the date of the statement of financial position.
Had these changes been enacted, then the cumulative effects would have been a credit to the income statement of 11.5m 21% or 17.3m 20% and a credit to other comprehensive income of 7.9m 21% or 11.9m 20%.
Financial statements Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2013 90 Notes to the financial statements continued 8 Earnings per share The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on earnings after tax and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The underlying earnings per share figures have also been calculated based on earnings before items that are one-off in nature, significant and are not considered normal operating costs of the underlying business see note 5.
These have been calculated to allow the shareholders to gain an understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has only one class of dilutive potential ordinary shares being those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
Details of the underlying earnings per share are set out below: 2013 2012 m m Profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Company 466.7 513.1 Less add net of tax : Strategic programme costs 5.0 13.8 Restructuring costs 7.1 IAS 36 Impairment of assets 39.6 IAS 39 Fair value movement of put option over non controlling interest in Czech business 15.6 IAS 39 Fair value movement of embedded derivative 4.7 0.2 Fair value movement on buy back of the Puttable Callable Reset medium-term notes 57.3 Reduction in M&S Bank income for the impact of the financial product mis-selling provision 11.8 Non-underlying adjustment to tax charge in respect of prior periods 20.4 Underlying profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Company 522.8 551.1 Million Million Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 1,599.7 1,579.3 Potentially dilutive share options under Groups share option schemes 10.6 12.9 Weighted average number of diluted ordinary shares 1,610.3 1,592.2 Pence Pence Basic earnings per share 29.2 32.5 Diluted earnings per share 29.0 32.2 Underlying basic earnings per share 32.7 34.9 Underlying diluted earnings per share 32.5 34.6 9 Dividends 2013 2012 2013 2012 per share per share m m Dividends on equity ordinary shares Paid final dividend 10.8p 10.8p 172.3 170.2 Paid interim dividend 6.2p 6.2p 99.0 97.6 17.0p 17.0p 271.3 267.8 The directors have proposed a final dividend in respect of the year ended 30 March 2013 of 10.8p per share amounting to a dividend of 173.5m.
It will be paid on 12 July 2013 to shareholders on the register of members as at close of business on 31 May 2013, subject to approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, to be held on 9 July 2013.
In line with the requirements of IAS 10 Events after the reporting period, this dividend has not been recognised within these results.
A dividend reinvestment plan DRIP is available to shareholders who would prefer to invest their dividends in the shares of the Company.
The shares will go ex-dividend on 29 May 2013.
For those shareholders electing to receive the DRIP the last date for receipt of a new election is 21 June 2013.
The Groups policy to grow dividends in line with underlying earnings per share is explained in the Financial Review on page 34.

11 Retirement benefits The Group provides pension arrangements for the benefit of its UK employees through the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme.
This has a defined benefit section, which was closed to new entrants with effect from 1 April 2002, and a defined contribution section which has been open to new members with effect from 1 April 2003.
The defined benefit section operates on a final salary basis and at the year end had some 13,000 active members last year 14,000, 55,000 deferred members last year 56,000 and 51,000 pensioners last year 51,000.
At the year end, the defined contribution section had some 33,000 active members last year 9,000 and some 3,000 deferred members last year 2,000.
The Group also operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme in the Republic of Ireland.
Retirement benefits also include a UK post-retirement healthcare scheme and unfunded retirement benefits.
Within the total Group retirement benefit cost of 47.2m last year 32.1m, 23.0m last year 12.0m relates to the UK defined benefit section, 20.3m last year 15.9m to the UK defined contribution section and 3.9m last year 4.2m to other retirement benefit schemes.

Financial assumptions A full actuarial valuation of the UK Defined Benefit Pension Scheme was carried out at 31 March 2012 and showed a deficit of 290m.
A funding plan of 112m was agreed with the Trustees.
The difference between the valuation and the funding plan is expected to be met by investment returns on the existing assets of the pension scheme.
The financial assumptions for the UK scheme and the most recent actuarial valuations of the other post-retirement schemes have been updated by independent qualified actuaries to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 Employee Benefits in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes and are as follows: 2013 2012 % % Rate of increase in salaries 1.0 1.0 Rate of increase in pensions in payment for service 2.4 3.2 2.3 3.1 Discount rate 4.3 4.6 Inflation rate 3.4 3.1 Long-term healthcare cost increases 7.1 7.1 The inflation rate of 3.4% reflects the Retail Price Index RPI rate.
Certain benefits have been calculated with reference to the Consumer Price Index CPI as the inflationary measure and in these instances a rate of 2.4% last year 2.1% has been used.
The amount of the surplus varies if the main financial assumptions change, particularly the discount rate.
If the discount rate increased decreased by 0.1% the IAS 19 surplus would increase decrease by c. 115m last year 110m.
If the inflation rate increased by 0.1%, the IAS 19 surplus would decrease by c. 50m and if the inflation rate decreased by 0.1%, the IAS 19 surplus would increase by c. 75m.
C. Demographic assumptions Apart from post retirement mortality, the demographic assumptions are in line with those adopted for the last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme performed as at 31 March 2012.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions are based on an analysis of the pensioner mortality trends under the scheme for the period to March 2012 updated to allow for anticipated longevity improvements over the subsequent years.
The specific mortality rates used are based on the VITA tables, adjusted to allow for the experience of scheme pensioners.
The life expectancies underlying the valuation are as follows: 2013 2012 Current pensioners at age 65 males 22.4 22.1 females 24.1 23.4 Future pensioners at age 65 males 21.8 23.2 females 24.5 24.3 An increase of one year in the life expectancies would decrease the IAS 19 surplus by c. 230m.

As such, the Partnership is consolidated into the results of the Group.
The Partnership holds 1.6bn last year 1.5bn of properties which have been leased back to Marks and Spencer plc at market rates.
The Group retains control over these properties, including the flexibility to substitute alternative properties.
The limited partnership interest held by the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme entitles the Pension Scheme to receive an annual distribution of 71.9m from the profits of the Partnership earned from rental income.
In 2009 it was agreed with the Trustee that this distribution was discretionary at the instance of Marks and Spencer plc.
The discretionary right was exercisable if the Group did not pay a dividend or make any other form of return to its shareholders.
On this basis, the future value of total discretionary scheduled payments was an an equity instrument, disclosed within other reserves.
On 21 May 2012 the Group changed the terms of the Partnership to waive the Groups limited discretionary right over the annual distributions from the Partnership to the Pension Trustee.
The change has been reflected by the derecognition of the related equity instruments and recognition of a financial liability.
The financial liability has been initially measured at fair value of 606.0m, representing the present value of the remaining ten years of distributions of 71.9m per annum.
The difference between the value of the derecognised equity instrument of 427.9m and the fair value of the liability has been recognised in equity in accordance with IAS 32.
The change has no impact on the cash flows of the Group.
During the year to 30 March 2013 an interest charge of 16.6m was recognised in the income statement representing the unwinding of the discount included in this obligation.
Under IAS 19, the Partnership interest of the Pension Scheme in the Marks and Spencer Scottish Limited Partnership is included within the UK pension scheme assets, valued at 645.7m last year 664.8m.
The market value of this non-quoted financial asset is measured based on the expected cash flows and benchmark asset-backed credit spreads.
13 Share-based payments The charge for share-based payments for the year was 25.8m last year 32.5m.
Of the total share-based payments charge, 13.4m last year 15.0m relates to the Save As You Earn Share Option scheme.
The remaining charge is spread over the other schemes.
Further details of the option and share schemes that the Group operates are provided in the Remuneration report on pages 60 to 62.
Save As You Earn Share Option Scheme Under the terms of the scheme, the Board may offer options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company once in each financial year to those employees who enter into an HM Revenue & Customs HMRC approved Save As You Earn SAYE savings contract.
HMRC rules limit the maximum amount saved to 250 per month.
The price at which options may be offered is 80% of the average midmarket price for three consecutive dealing days preceding the offer date.
The options may normally be exercised during the six month period after the completion of the SAYE contract, either three or five years after entering the scheme.

Under the plan, annual awards, based on a percentage of salary, may be offered.
The extent to which the awards vest is based on underlying basic earnings per share growth over three years.
The value of any dividends earned on the vested shares during the three years will also be paid on vesting.
Further details are set out in the Remuneration report on page 61.
Awards under this scheme have been made in each year since 2005.
During the year, 9,333,652 shares last year 7,887,169 were awarded under the Plan.

C. Deferred Share Bonus Plan The Deferred Share Bonus Plan was introduced in 2005 06 as part of the Annual Bonus Scheme for approximately 450 of the most senior managers.
As part of the scheme, the managers are required to defer a proportion of any bonus paid into shares which will be held for three years.
There are no further performance conditions on these shares, other than continued employment and the value of any dividends earned during the deferred period will be paid on vesting.
During the year, 1,181,637 shares last year 2,366,847 have been awarded under the plan in relation to the annual bonus.
The fair value of the shares awarded was 325.1p last year 378.4p.
As at 30 March 2013, 6,576,038 shares last year 6,396,018 were outstanding under the scheme.
D. Restricted Share Plan The Restricted Share Plan was established in 2000 as part of the reward strategy for retention and recruitment of senior managers who are vital to the success of the business.
The Plan operates for senior managers below executive director level.
Awards under the Plan are made as part of ongoing reviews of reward packages, and for recruitment.
The shares are held in trust for a period of between one and three years, at which point they are released to the employee subject to them still being in employment.

Republic of Ireland Save As You Earn Scheme Sharesave, the Companys Save As You Earn Scheme was introduced in 2009 to all employees in the Republic of Ireland for a ten year period, after approval by shareholders at the 2009 AGM.
The scheme is subject to Irish Revenue rules which limit the maximum monthly saving to 500 per month.
The Company chose in 2009 to set a monthly savings cap of 320 per month to align the maximum savings amount allowed within the UK scheme.
When the savings contract is started, options are granted to acquire the number of shares that the total savings will buy when the contract matures, at a discounted price set at the start of the scheme.
The price at which the options may be offered is 80% of the average mid-market price for three consecutive days preceding the offer date.
Options cannot normally be exercised until a minimum of three years has elapsed.
During the year, 147,557 last year 97,270 options were granted, at a fair value of 73.8p last year 67.3p.

The long-term growth rate used is purely for the impairment testing of goodwill under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets and does not reflect long-term planning assumptions used by the Group for investment proposals or for any other assessments.
The pre-tax discount rate is based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, taking into account the cost of capital and borrowings, to which specific market-related premium adjustments are made: per una discount rate 10.7% last year 10.6%, Marks and Spencer Czech Republic a. s. 12.2% last year 12.3% and Supreme Tradelinks Private Limited 17.4% last year 12.7%.
The valuations use cash flows based on detailed financial budgets prepared by management covering a three year period.
Cash flows beyond this three year period are extrapolated for Marks and Spencer Czech Republic a. s. at a growth rate of 1.5% last year 1.5% and Supreme Tradelinks Private Limited at a growth rate of 6% last year 1.5%.
To stress test, nil growth has been assumed for per una.
These rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the Groups retail businesses.
If a zero per cent growth rate is assumed or the discount rate is increased by a pre-tax rate of 3%, per una, Marks and Spencer Czech Republic a. s. and Supreme Tradelinks Private Limited goodwill would not be impaired.
Last year, due to the economic environment in Greece and neighbouring countries, the Marks and Spencer Marinopoulos B. V. goodwill was impaired in full giving rise to a charge of 34.4m.
Brands consist of the per una brand cost of 80.0m and the M&S Mode brands of 32.4m.
The per una brand is a definite life intangible asset and is amortised on a straight line basis over a period of 15 years and is only assessed for impairment where such indicators exist.
The M&S Mode brands have been attributed an indefinite life as they give the Group the future right to use the M&S brand across Europe.
This is consistent with the Groups expansion plans in Europe and existing M&S brand recognition from its current presence.
Similar to goodwill, the M&S Mode brands are assessed for impairment annually based on their value in use.
The M&S Mode brands have been allocated for impairment testing across the European business.
No brand impairment charge has been recognised in 2012 13.

These notes are issued under Marks and Spencer plcs 3bn European medium-term note programme and all pay interest annually.
Interest on these bonds is payable semi-annually.
On 12 December 2012, the Group issued 400m of 12.5 year medium-term notes at a coupon rate of 4.75%.
In December 2007, the Group issued 250m of 6.875% 30 year Puttable Callable Reset medium-term notes PCR notes.
These included a coupon rate reset after five years based on a fixed underlying 25 year interest rate.
In light of continued low long-term market interest rates and the successful bond issuance in December 2012, the Group bought back and cancelled these bonds in January 2013 for 330.0m.
This resulted in a one-off finance charge of 75.3m representing the difference between the cost of the buy back and the carrying value of the PCR notes, offset by associated unamortised bond costs and fees see note 5.
Finance leases The minimum lease payments under finance leases fall due as shown in the table on the following page.
It is the Groups policy to lease certain of its properties and equipment under finance leases.
The average lease term for equipment is five years last year five years and 125 years last year 125 years for property.
Interest rates are fixed at the contract rate.
All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent payments.
The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors charges over the leased assets.
21 Financial instruments Treasury policy The Group operates a centralised treasury function to manage the Groups funding requirements and financial risks in line with the Board approved treasury policies and procedures, and their delegated authorities.
The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Groups operations.
The Group treasury function also enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate and currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and financing.
It remains the Groups policy not to hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes, except where financial constraints necessitate the need to liquidate any outstanding investments.
The treasury function is managed as a cost centre and does not engage in speculative trading.
Financial statements Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2013 102 Notes to the financial statements continued 21 Financial instruments continued Financial risk management The principal financial risks faced by the Group are liquidity funding, interest rate, foreign currency and counterparty risks.
The policies and strategies for managing these risks are summarised on the following pages: a Liquidity funding risk The risk that the Group could be unable to settle or meet its obligations at a reasonable price as they fall due: The Groups funding strategy ensures a mix of funding sources offering flexibility and cost effectiveness to match the requirements of the Group.
Operating subsidiaries are financed by a combination of retained profits, bank borrowings, medium-term notes and committed syndicated bank facilities.
At year end, the Group had a committed syndicated bank revolving credit facility of 1.325bn set to mature on 29 September 2017.
This facility contains only one financial covenant being the ratio of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and rents payable: to interest plus rents payable.
The covenant is measured semi-annually.
The Group also has a number of undrawn uncommitted facilities available to it.
At year end, these amounted to 105m last year 105m, all of which are due to be reviewed within a year.
At the balance sheet date a sterling equivalent of 81m last year nil was drawn under the committed facilities and nil last year nil was drawn under the uncommitted facilities.
In addition to the existing borrowings, the Group has a euro medium-term note programme of 3bn, of which 1.5bn last year 1.6bn was in issuance as at the balance sheet date.
A new 4.75% 400m bond was issued under the programme in December 2012 maturing in June 2025.

Exposures are managed through Group treasury policy which limits the value that can be placed with each approved counterparty to minimise the risk of loss.
The counterparties are limited to the approved institutions with secure long-term credit ratings AA3 or better, assigned by Moodys and Standard & Poors respectively, unless approved by exception by the CFO.
Limits are reviewed regularly by senior management.
The credit risk of these financial instruments is estimated as the fair value of the assets resulting from the contracts.

Excludes the embedded derivative within the lease host contract.
Standard & Poors equivalent rating shown as reference to the lowest credit rating of the counterparty from either Standard & Poors or Moodys.
The Group has very low retail credit risk due to transactions being principally of a high volume, low value and short maturity.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date was as follows: trade receivables 114m last year 115m, other receivables 60m last year 58m, cash and cash equivalents 193m last year 196m and derivatives 108m last year 111m.
c Foreign currency risk Transactional foreign currency exposures arise from both the export of goods from the UK to overseas subsidiaries, and from the import of materials and goods directly sourced from overseas suppliers.
Group treasury hedges these exposures principally using forward foreign exchange contracts progressively covering up to 100% out to 18 months.
Where appropriate, hedge cover can be taken out for longer than 18 months, with Board approval.
The Group is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk in relation to sterling against movements in US dollar and euro.
Forward foreign exchange contracts in relation to the Groups forecast currency requirements are designated as cash flow hedges with fair value movements recognised directly in comprehensive income.
To the extent that these hedges cover actual currency payables or receivables, then associated fair value movements previously recognised in comprehensive income are recorded in the income statement in conjunction with the corresponding asset or liability.
As at the balance sheet date the gross notional value in sterling terms of forward foreign exchange sell or buy contracts amounted to 1,342m last year 1,221m with a weighted average maturity date of seven months last year seven months.
Gains and losses in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts as at 30 March 2013 will be released to the income statement at various dates over the following 15 months last year 15 months from the balance sheet date.
The Group uses a combination of foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge balance sheet translation exposures.
As at the balance sheet date 200m last year 242m and HK$484m last year HK$291m of derivatives was hedging overseas net assets.
The Group also hedges foreign currency intercompany loans where these exist.
Forward foreign exchange contracts in relation to the hedging of the Groups foreign currency intercompany loans are designated as held for trading with fair value movements being recognised in the income statement.
The corresponding fair value movement of the intercompany loan balance results in an overall nil impact on the income statement.
As at the balance sheet date, the gross notional value of intercompany loan hedges was 307m last year 187m.
After taking into account the hedging derivatives entered into by the Group, the currency and interest rate exposure of the Groups financial liabilities excluding short-term payables and the liability to the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme which has no currency or interest rate exposure and the Marks and Spencer Czech Republic a. s. put option, is set out below: 2013 2012 Fixed rate Floating rate Total Fixed rate Floating rate Total m m m m m m Currency Sterling 1,929.9 318.1 2,248.0 2,030.4 205.2 2,235.6 Euro 3.9 6.7 10.6 6.8 5.1 11.9 Other 27.4 27.4 28.3 28.3 1,933.8 352.2 2,286.0 2,037.2 238.6 2,275.8 Financial statements Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2013 104 Notes to the financial statements continued 21 Financial instruments continued The floating rate sterling and euro borrowings are linked to interest rates related to LIBOR.
These rates are for periods between one and six months.
As at the balance sheet date and excluding finance leases, the fixed rate sterling borrowings are at an average rate of 5.6% last year 5.8% and the weighted average time for which the rate is fixed is eight years last year nine years.
d Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to sterling, US dollar and euro variable rate financial assets and liabilities.
The Groups policy is to use derivative contracts where necessary to maintain a mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings to manage this risk.
The structure and maturity of these derivatives correspond to the underlying borrowings and are accounted for as fair value or cash flow hedges as appropriate.
At the balance sheet date, fixed rate borrowings amounted to 1,933.8m last year 2,037.2m representing the public bond issues and finance leases, amounting to 85% last year 90% of the Groups gross borrowings.
The effective interest rates at the balance sheet date were as follows: 2013 2012 % % Committed and uncommitted borrowings 1.2 0.5 Medium-term notes 5.6 5.8 Finance leases 4.3 4.5 Derivative financial instruments 2013 2012 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Current Options held for trading 53.6 53.6 Forward foreign exchange contracts cash flow hedges 34.0 12.8 13.3 5.1 held for trading 3.6 0.9 0.1 1.3 net investment hedges 4.9 0.5 42.5 13.7 67.0 60.5 Non-current Cross currency swaps cash flow hedges 3.2 12.4 26.5 Forward foreign exchange contracts cash flow hedges 3.8 0.7 0.1 0.7 Interest rate swaps fair value hedge 32.4 24.0 Embedded derivative see note 5 25.9 20.1 65.3 13.1 44.2 27.2 Last year, the amounts reported as options held for trading in derivatives assets and liabilities represented the fair value of the call option with the Puttable Callable reset notes mirrored by the fair value of the sold option to have this call assigned.
In January 2013 the Group bought back and cancelled these notes.
The Group holds a number of interest rate swaps to re-designate its sterling fixed debt to floating debt.
These are reported as fair value hedges.
The ineffective portion recognised in the profit or loss that arises from fair value hedges amounts to nil last year 0.2m loss as the loss on the hedged item was 8.0m last year 23.6m loss and the gain on the hedging instrument was 8.0m last year 23.8m gain.
The Group also holds a number of cross currency swaps to re-designate its fixed rate US dollar debt to fixed rate sterling debt.
These are reported as cash flow hedges.
Sensitivity analysis The table below illustrates the estimated impact on the income statement and equity as a result of market movements in foreign exchange and interest rates in relation to the Groups financial instruments.
The Directors consider that a 2% - last year 2% movement in interest rates and a 20% - last year 20% weakening in sterling represents a reasonable possible change.
However this analysis is for illustrative purposes only.
The impact in the income statement due to changes in interest rates reflects the effect on the Groups floating rate debt as at the balance sheet date.
The impact in equity reflects the fair value movement in relation to the Groups cross currency swaps.
The impact from foreign exchange movements reflects the change in the fair value of the Groups transactional foreign exchange cash flow hedges and the net investment hedges at the balance sheet date.
The equity impact shown for foreign exchange sensitivity relates to derivative and non-derivative financial instruments hedging net investments.
This value is expected to be fully offset by the re-translation of the hedged foreign currency net assets leaving a net equity impact of zero.
The table excludes financial instruments that expose the Group to interest rate and foreign exchange risk where such risk is fully hedged with another financial instrument.
Also excluded are trade receivables and payables as these are either sterling denominated or the foreign exchange risk is hedged.

Unlisted equity investments are included in Level 3.
The fair value of embedded derivatives is determined using the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on financial forecasts.
The nature of the valuation techniques and the judgement around the inputs mean that a change in assumptions could result in significant change in the fair value of the instrument.

Fair value of financial instruments With the exception of the Groups fixed rate bond debt and the Partnership liability to the Marks & Spencer UK Pension scheme, there were no material differences between the carrying value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities and their fair values as at the balance sheet date.
The carrying value of the Groups fixed rate bond debt was 2,076.5m last year 2,171.6m : the fair value of this debt was 2,196.6m last year 2,121.7m.
The carrying value of the Partnership liability to the Marks & Spencer UK Pension scheme is 622.6m and the fair value of this liability is 606.0m.
Financial statements Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2013 106 Notes to the financial statements continued 21 Financial instruments continued Capital policy The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide optimal returns for shareholders and to maintain an efficient capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In doing so the Groups strategy is to maintain a capital structure commensurate with an investment grade credit rating and to retain appropriate levels of liquidity headroom to ensure financial stability and flexibility.
To achieve this strategy the Group regularly monitors key credit metrics such as the gearing ratio, cash flow to net debt see note 27 and fixed charge cover to maintain this position.
In addition, the Group ensures a combination of appropriate committed short-term liquidity headroom with a diverse and balanced long-term debt maturity profile.
As at the balance sheet date the Groups average debt maturity profile was eight years last year nine years.
During the year the Group maintained an investment grade credit rating of Baa3 stable with Moodys and BBBstable with Standard & Poors.
In order to maintain or realign the capital structure, the Group may adjust the number of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
