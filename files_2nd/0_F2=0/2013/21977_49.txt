Retirement benefit plans continued Other protection of BTPS member benets In the unlikely event that the group were to become insolvent there are additional protections available to members: the Crown Guarantee which was granted when the group was privatised in 1984 and which applies upon the winding up of BT.
The scope and extent of the Crown Guarantee is being claried by the Trustee through the courts.
The decision of the High Court issued in October 2010 was that the Crown Guarantee can cover members who joined before and after privatisation.
The Court confirmed that any payments to be made by the Government must be measured on an annuity basis.
In a further High Court decision issued in December 2011, it was decided that the Crown Guarantee does not cover the benets of members accrued while in service with companies that participate in the BTPS other than BT nor does it cover benefit augmentations granted by BT.
The judgments may still be subject to appeal the Pension Protection Fund PPF may take over the scheme and pay benets to members not covered by the Crown Guarantee.
There are limits on the amounts paid by the PPF and this would not give exactly the same benets as those provided by the scheme.
