Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies Basis of accounting These accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
The policies are consistent with the previous year except for the adoption of the amendment to FRS 29 IFRS 7 Disclosures Transfers of Financial Assets, which has not had any material effect on the Financial Statements of the Company.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All exchange differences are included in the pro t and loss account for the year.
Pension costs and other post-retirement bene ts For fide ned bene t plans, the service cost of providing retirement bene ts to employees during the year is charged to operating pro t or loss in the year.
The cost of providing bene ts under the fide ned bene t schemes is determined separately for each scheme using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
The full cost of providing amendments to bene ts in respect of past service that vests immediately is also charged to operating pro t or loss in the year.
The net surplus or fide cit on fide ned bene t pension schemes is reported on the balance sheet within the pension asset or liability.
For fide ned contribution schemes the amount charged to the pro t and loss account in respect of pension costs is the contributions payable in the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown either as accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiary undertakings are held at cost less provisions for impairment where a permanent diminution in value has been identi ed.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred.
Debt instruments Borrowings are stated at net proceeds received after deduction of issue costs.
The issue costs of debt instruments are amortised over the life of the instrument using the effective interest rate method.
Taxation Deferred income tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, in the future.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different to those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable pro ts from which the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred income tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Share-based payment The Company operates various equity-settled and cash-settled share schemes.
For equity-settled share options, the services received from employees are measured by reference to the fair value of the share options.
The fair value is calculated at grant date using a valuation model and recognised in the pro t and loss account, together with a corresponding increase in shareholders equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of options that will eventually vest.
Vesting conditions, other than market conditions, are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.
Market conditions are those conditions that are linked to the share price of the Company.
For equity-settled share award schemes, the fair value is calculated based on the share price at the grant date and, where applicable, any market vesting conditions, and expensed over the vesting period based on the number of shares expected to vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition: which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satis ed, provided that all other performance or service conditions are satis ed.
The financial effect of share options and awards over its equity shares granted to employees of subsidiary undertakings are recognised by the Company in its individual financial statements.
In particular, the Company records an increase in its investment in subsidiaries with a credit to equity equivalent to the FRS 20 cost in subsidiary undertakings.
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction award are modi ed, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as if the terms had not been modi ed, if the original terms of the award are met.
An additional expense is recognised for any modi cation that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise bene cial to the employee as measured at the date of modi cation.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of either the entity or the employee are not met.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modi cation of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
All cancellations of equity-settled transaction awards are treated equally.
142 Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Parent Company Financial Statements For cash-settled share awards, the services received from employees are measured at the fair value of the liability and recognised in the pro t and loss account on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The fair value of the liability is remeasured at each reporting date and at the date of settlement with changes in fair value recognised in the pro t and loss account.
In accordance with the transitional arrangements in FRS 20 IFRS 2, Share-based Payment, the requirements of FRS 20 have not been applied to equity instruments granted on or before 7 November 2002 and those vesting before 1 January 2005.
Treasury shares Own equity instruments which are re-acquired treasury shares are deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in pro t or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
Treasury shares are purchased and held by the Employee Share Trust to meet future distributions of shares to employees under the Groups various share option and share award schemes.
Dividend income Revenue is recognised when the Companys right to receive payment is established.

9 Pensions and post-retirement bene ts The Company operates one unfunded fide ned bene t pension scheme.
The last full valuation of the scheme on an FRS 17 IAS 19 basis has been updated to 31 March 2013, to re ect market conditions and material events in the plan.
The Company also participates in the Invensys Pension Scheme UK, which is the principal Group scheme covering the majority of UK employees.
The Invensys Pension Scheme UK is a funded fide ned bene t scheme.
However, the Company is unable to separately identify on a consistent and reasonable basis its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the Groups fide ned bene t scheme to which it participates, mainly because of the dif culty in obtaining accurate information for disposed companies and the subjective nature of any allocation basis.
Therefore, the Company accounts for this scheme as a fide ned contribution scheme, in accordance with the provisions of FRS 17.
The scheme is currently in fide cit on an IAS 19 basis using the projected credit actuarial valuation method to determine the schemes liabilities.
Details of the scheme, its fide cit and its princip al sensitivities are included in Note 25 to the Group Financial Statements in accordance with the accounting and disclosure requirements of IAS 19, which are generally equivalent to those ofFRS 17.
Pension costs in respect of the Invensys Pension Scheme UK represented contributions payable in the year and amounted to nil 2012:nil.
At 31 March 2013, the outstanding contributions included in creditors were nil 2012: nil.
Unfunded fide ned bene t scheme The major assumptions relating to the unfunded scheme are: 2013 2012 % % Major assumptions Rates of increase in salaries 4.75 4.75 1 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.60 3.60 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 4.20 4.70 2 In ation rate 3.50 3.50 1 The rate of increase for UK deferred pensions was 3.50% 2012: 3.50%.
2 The in ation rate is based on RPI.
An additional in ation rate assumption for CPI of 2.50% is used to re ect the UK Governments change of the in ation measure used to determine minimum pensionincreases.
com 145 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued 9 Pensions and post-retirement bene ts continued Standard SAPS actuarial mortality tables S1PA were adopted.
Based on scheme experience, the probability of death at each age was multiplied by 103% for males and 113% for females.
Future improvements in life expectancy have been allowed for in line with the standard CMI model projections subject to a longterm trend of 1.00% for males and 1.00% for females.
These mortality tables are consistent with those agreed by the Trustees for the 31 March 2011 formal valuation of the scheme.

150 Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Parent Company Financial Statements 14 Deferred income tax assets Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it is probable that pro t will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
A deferred income tax asset has not been recognised on temporary differences of 33 million with a tax value of 8 million 2012: 31 million with a tax value of 7 million in respect of pension obligations.

These capital losses may be carried forward inde nitely.
The standard rate of UK corporation tax has reduced to 23% from 1 April 2013 and is expected to reduce to 20% with effect from 1April2015.
The impact of the rate change to 20% would reduce the total unrecognised deferred income tax assets by 4 million.
