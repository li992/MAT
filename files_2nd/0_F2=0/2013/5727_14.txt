International Financial Reporting Standards are issued by the International Accounting Standard Board IASB.
IFRSs that are mandatory for application as of 31 December 2013, but not adopted by theEuropean Union, do not have any impact on the Groups consolidated financialstatements.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as disclosed in the accounting policies below.
Exceptions include, but are not limited to, property, plant and equipment at the date of transition to IFRS accounted for at deemed cost, available-for-sale investments measured at fair value, assets classified as held for sale measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and post-employment benefits measured at present value.
Going Concern These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The Groups activities in all of its operating segments continue to be affected by theuncertainty and instability of the current economic environment.
In response the Group implemented a number of cost cutting initiatives, reduced capital expenditures and significantly reduced the level of debt subject to financial maintenance covenants.
Based on the currently available facts and circumstances the directors and management have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Group Reorganisation in 2011 As the Group has been formed through a reorganisation in which EVRAZ plc became a new parent entity of the Group Note 20, these consolidated financial statements have been prepared as a continuation of the existing group using the pooling of interests method.
EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 123 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED year ended 31 December 2013 2. significant accounting policies continued Basis of Preparation continued Restatement of Financial Statements Correction of a Prior Period Error According to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates on the disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of the exchange differences relating to that foreign operation, recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the separate component of equity, should be reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment when the gain or loss on disposal is recognised.
In 2013, the Group discovered that in 2012 it did not reclassify the accumulated exchange losses in the amount of $96million on the disposal of its subsidiaries Dneprodzerzhinsk Coke Chemical Plant and Prichaly Kominterna.
As such, the Group corrected this prior period error and has disclosed the restated consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, the statement of financial position and the relevant extract from the statement of changes in equity for the year ended 31 December 2012 below.
The correction of this error does not affect the Groups compliance with financial covenants at 31December 2012.
Obligatory Change in the Accounting Policies Following the Amendments to IAS 19 Amended IAS 19 Employee Benefits, which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1January 2013, introduced a full recognition of deficit surplus of a defined benefit obligation in the statement of financial position, net presentation of interest on the defined benefit liabilities and assets, new presentation of changes in defined benefit obligations and plan assets and additional disclosure requirements.
These amendments are required to be applied retrospectively.
As such, in these consolidated financial statements the Group adjusted the balances starting from the earliest prior period presented and the results of its operations for the respective periods.
Reclassications In 2013, the Group applied new accounting policies with respect to certain operating costs previously included in general and administrative expenses.
Consequently, reclassifications have been made to the prior years financial statements to conform to the current year presentation: $21million 2012 and $18 million 2011 have been reclassified from general and administrative expenses into cost of revenue.

accounting policies continued Changes in Accounting Policies In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, the Group followed the same accounting policies and methods of computation as compared with those applied in theprevious year, except for the adoption of new standards and interpretations and revision of the existing standards as of 1 January 2013.
New Revised Standards and Interpretations Adopted in 2013: Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits IAS 19 revised includes a number of amendments to the accounting for defined benefit plans, including actuarial gains and losses that are now recognised in other comprehensive income and permanently excluded from profit and loss: expected returns on plan assets that are no longer recognised in profit or loss, instead, there is a requirement to recognise interest on the net defined benefit liability asset in profit or loss, calculated using the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation, and: unvested past service costs are now recognised in profit or loss at the earlier of when the amendment occurs or when the related restructuring or termination costs are recognised.
Other amendments include new disclosures, such as, quantitative sensitivity disclosures.
The amended standard is required to be applied retrospectively.
The effects of the application of the revised IAS 19 are disclosed in the Basis of Preparation above.
New Revised Standards and Interpretations Adopted in 2013: continued Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The amendment requires an entity to disclose information about rights to set-off financial instruments and related arrangements e. g. collateral agreements.
The disclosures would provide users with information that is useful in evaluating the effect of netting arrangements on an entitys financial position.
The new disclosures are required for all recognised financial instruments that are set off in accordance with IAS 32.
The disclosures also apply to recognised financial instruments that are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether the financial instruments are set off in accordance with IAS 32.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements.
IFRS 13 does not change when an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under IFRS when fair value is required or permitted.
IFRS 13 also requires specific disclosures on fair values, some of which replace existing disclosure requirements in other standards, including IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Changes to thePresentation of Other Comprehensive Income The amendments to IAS 1 introduce a grouping of items presented in other comprehensive income OCI.
Items that could be reclassified or recycled to profit or loss at a future point in time e. g. net gain on hedge of net investment, exchange differences on translation of foreign operations, net movement on cash flow hedges and net loss or gain on available-for-sale financial assets now have to be presented separately from items that will never be reclassified e. g. actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit plans and revaluation of land and buildings.
IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine This Interpretation applies to waste removal stripping costs incurred in surface mining activity, during the production phase of the mine.
If the benefit from the stripping activity will be realised in the current period, an entity is required to account for the stripping activity costs as part of the cost of inventory.
When the benefit is the improved access to ore, the entity recognises these costs as a non-current asset, only if certain criteria are met: 1 it is probable that the future economic benefit improved access to the ore body associated with the stripping activity will flow to the Group: 2 the Group can identify the component of the ore body for which access has been improved: and 3 the costs relating to the stripping activity associated with that component can be measured reliably.
This is referred to as the stripping activity asset.
The stripping activity asset is accounted for as an addition to, or as an enhancement of, an existingasset.
If the costs of the stripping activity asset and the inventory produced are not separately identifiable, the entity allocates the cost between the two assets using an allocation method based on a relevant production measure.
After initial recognition, the stripping activity asset is carried at its cost or revalued amount less depreciation or amortisation and less impairment losses, in the same way as the existing asset of which it is a part.
Amendments to standards following the May 2012 Improvements to IFRS project Except for IAS 19 revised, the amendments and new standards described above did not have asignificant impact on thefinancial position or performance of the Group.
The Group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yeteffective.

The Group expects that the adoption of the pronouncements listed above will not have asignificant impact on the Groups results of operations and financial position in the period of initial application.
significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates Accounting Judgements In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, apart from those involving estimates, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements: The Group determined that it obtained control over Corber on 16January 2013 Note11.
As of 31 December 2012, certain conditions relating to acquisition of an additional 50% ownership interest in Corber were not met.
As such, the Group did not consolidate Corber in 2012.
The Group determined that the 51% ownership interest in Timir Note 11 does not provide control over the entity Note11.
In April 2013, the Group concluded a joint venture agreement with Alrosa under which major operating and financial decisions are made by unanimous consent of the Group and Alrosa, it ensures that no single venturer is in aposition to control the activity unilaterally.
Consequently, the Group determined that Timir constitutes a joint controlled entity under IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures.
The Group determined that the future sale of EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium Limited and EVRAZ Vitkovice Steel does not constitute a discontinued operation as the expected disposal will not lead to the Group abandoning any geographical area of operation or any product line Note 12.
Management concluded that EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium Limited continues to meet the criteria of being classified as assets held for sale: it is being actively marketed for sale and management expects to complete the sale within 2014.
The carrying value of its assets is based on managements best estimate of the proceeds of the sale which takes into account the results of negotiations to date including binding or non-binding bids where relevant.
Estimation Uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cash-generating units fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the assets.
In 2013, 2012 and 2011, theGroup recognised an impairment loss of $240 million, $404 million and $105 million, respectively Note 9.
The determination of impairments of property, plant and equipment involves the use of estimates that include, but are not limited to, the cause, timing and amount of the impairment.
Impairment is based on a large number of factors, such as changes in current competitive conditions, expectations of growth in the industry, increased cost of capital, changes in the future availability of financing, technological obsolescence, discontinuance of service, current replacement costs and other changes in circumstances that indicate that impairment exists.
EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 133 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED year ended 31 December 2013 2. significant accounting policies continued significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates continued Estimation Uncertainty continued Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment continued The determination of the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit involves the use of estimates by management.
Methods used to determine the value in use include discounted cash flow-based methods, which require the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
These estimates, including the methodologies used, may have a material impact on the value in use and, ultimately, the amount of any impairment.
Useful Lives of Items of Property, Plant and Equipment The Group assesses the remaining useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment at least at each financial year end and, if expectations differ from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors.
These estimates may have a material impact on the amount of the carrying values of property, plant and equipment and on depreciation expense for the period.
On 1 January 2013, the Group changed its estimation of useful lives of property, plant and equipment, which resulted in a $43 million decrease in depreciation expense as compared to the amounts that would have been charged had no change in estimate occurred.
In 2012, the change in estimates of useful lives of property, plant and equipment resulted in an additional depreciation expense of approximately $5million.
In2011, the Group changed its estimation of useful lives of property, plant and equipment, which resulted in a $16 million decrease in depreciation expense as compared to the amounts that would have been charged had no change in estimate occurred.
Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities Acquired in Business Combinations The Group is required to recognise separately, at the acquisition date, the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired or assumed in a business combination at their fair values, which involves estimates.
Such estimates are based on valuation techniques which require considerable judgement in forecasting future cash flows and developing other assumptions.
Impairment of Goodwill The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cashgenerating units to which thegoodwill is allocated.
Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
Thecarrying amount of goodwill at 31 December 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $1,988 million, $2,180million and $2,180million, respectively.
In 2013, 2012 and 2011, theGroup recognised an impairment loss in respect of goodwill in theamount of $149 million, $Nil and $Nil, respectively.
More details of the assumptions used in estimating the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill is allocated are provided in Note5.
Mineral Reserves Mineral reserves and the associated mine plans are a material factor in the Groups computation of a depletion charge.
The Group estimates its mineral reserves in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves JORC Code.
Estimation of reserves in accordance with the JORC Code involves some degree of uncertainty.
The uncertainty depends mainly on the amount of reliable geological and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of this data, which also requires use of subjective judgement and development of assumptions.
Mine plans are periodically updated which can have a material impact on the depletion charge for the period.
More details on the impact of this on the current year are provided in Note 9.
Site Restoration Provisions The Group reviews site restoration provisions at each reporting date and adjusts them to reflect the current best estimate in accordance with IFRIC 1 Changes in Existing Decommissioning, Restoration and Similar Liabilities.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditures required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period based on the requirements of the current legislation of thecountry where the respective operating assets are located.
Thecarrying amount of a provision is the present value of the expected expenditures, i. e. cash outflows discounted using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The risks and uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances are taken into account in reaching thebest estimate of a provision.
Considerable judgement is required in forecasting future site restoration costs.
Future events that may affect the amount required to settle an obligation are reflected in theamount of a provision when there is sufficient objective evidence that they will occur.
134 EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Strategic Report Performance Governance Financial Statements 2. significant accounting policies continued significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates continued Estimation Uncertainty continued Post-Employment Benets The Group uses an actuarial valuation method for the measurement of the present value of post-employment benefit obligations and related current service cost.
This involves the use of demographic assumptions about the future characteristics of the current and former employees who are eligible for benefits mortality, both during and after employment, rates of employee turnover, disability and early retirement, etc.
as well as financial assumptions discount rate, future salary and benefit levels, expected rate of return on plan assets, etc.. More details are provided in Note 23.
Allowances The Group makes allowances for doubtful receivables to account for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments.
When evaluating the adequacy of an allowance for doubtful accounts, management bases its estimates on the current overall economic conditions, the ageing of accounts receivable balances, historical write-off experience, customer creditworthiness and changes in payment terms.
Changes in the economy, industry or specific customer conditions may require adjustments to theallowance for doubtful accounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements.
Asof 31 December 2013, 2012 and 2011, allowances for doubtful accounts in respect of trade and other receivables have been made in theamount of $59million, $101 million and $108 million, respectively Note 28.
The Group makes an allowance for obsolete and slow-moving raw materials and spare parts.
Inaddition, certain finished goods of the Group are carried at net realisable value Note 14.
Estimates of net realisable value of finished goods are based on the most reliable evidence available at the time the estimates are made.
These estimates take into consideration fluctuations of price or cost directly relating to events occurring subsequent to the end of the reporting period to the extent that such events confirm conditions existing at the end of the period.
Deferred Income Tax Assets Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
The estimation of that probability includes judgements based on the expected performance.
Various factors are considered to assess the probability of thefuture utilisation of deferred tax assets, including past operating results, operational plans, expiration of tax losses carried forward, and tax planning strategies.
Ifactual results differ from these estimates or if these estimates must be adjusted in future periods, thefinancial position, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.
Inthe event that the assessment of future utilisation of deferred tax assets must be reduced, this reduction will be recognised in the statement of operations.
Foreign Currency Transactions The presentation currency of the Group is the US dollar because presentation in USdollars is convenient for the major current and potential users ofthe consolidated financial statements.
The functional currencies of the Groups subsidiaries are theRussian rouble, US dollar, euro, Czech koruna, South African rand, Canadian dollar and Ukrainian hryvnia.
As at thereporting date, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the US dollar are translated into the presentation currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the reporting period, and their statements of operations are translated at the exchange rates that approximate the exchange rates at the dates of thetransactions.
Theexchange differences arising on the translation are taken directly to a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a subsidiary with functional currency other than the US dollar, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular subsidiary is recognised in the statement of operations.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at theend of the reporting period.
All resulting differences are taken to the statement of operations.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.
EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 135 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED year ended 31 December 2013 2. significant accounting policies continued Basis of Consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries, which are those entities in which the Group has an interest of more than 50% of the voting rights, or otherwise has power to exercise control over their operations, are consolidated.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are no longer consolidated from the date that control ceases.
All intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated: unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Where necessary, accounting policies for subsidiaries have been changed to ensure consistency with thepolicies adopted by the Group.
Non-controlling interest is the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent.
Non-controlling interests are presented in theconsolidated statement of financial position within equity, separately from theparents shareholders equity.
Total comprehensive income is attributed to the owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Acquisition of Subsidiaries Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree.
For each business combination, the Group measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in administrative expenses.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of theacquirers previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it should not be remeasured until it is finally settled within equity.
The initial accounting for a business combination involves identifying and determining the fair values to be assigned to the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the cost of the combination.
If the initial accounting for a business combination can be determined only provisionally by the end of the period in which thecombination is effected because either the fair values to be assigned to the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities or the cost of thecombination can be determined only provisionally, the Group accounts for thecombination using those provisional values.
The Group recognises any adjustments to those provisional values as a result of completing the initial accounting within twelve months of the acquisition date.
Comparative information presented for the periods before the completion of initial accounting for the acquisition is presented as if the initial accounting had been completed from the acquisition date.
Increases in Ownership Interests in Subsidiaries The differences between the carrying values of net assets attributable to interests in subsidiaries acquired and the consideration given for such increases is either added to additional paid-in capital, if positive, or charged to accumulated profits, if negative, in theconsolidated financialstatements.
Purchases of Controlling Interests in Subsidiaries from Entities under Common Control Purchases of controlling interests in subsidiaries from entities under common control are accounted for using the pooling of interests method.
The assets and liabilities of the subsidiary transferred under common control are recorded in these financial statements at the historical cost of the controlling entity thePredecessor.
Related goodwill inherent in the Predecessors original acquisition is also recorded in the financial statements.
Any difference between the total book value of net assets, including the Predecessors goodwill, and the consideration paid is accounted for in the consolidated financial statements as an adjustment to the shareholders equity.
These financial statements, including corresponding figures, are presented as if asubsidiary had been acquired by the Group on the date it was originally acquired by thePredecessor.
136 EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Strategic Report Performance Governance Financial Statements 2. significant accounting policies continued Basis of Consolidation continued Put Options over Non-controlling Interests The Group derecognises non-controlling interests if non-controlling shareholders have a put option over their holdings.
The difference between the amount of the liability recognised in the statement of financial position over the carrying value of thederecognised non-controlling interests is charged to accumulated profits.
Investments in Associates Associates are entities in which the Group generally has between 20% and 50% of thevoting rights, or is otherwise able to exercise significant influence, but which it does not control or jointly control.
Investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost including goodwill.
Subsequent changes in the carrying value reflect the post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate and goodwill impairment charges, if any.
The Groups share of its associates profits or losses is recognised in the statement of operations and its share of movements in reserves is recognised in equity.
However, when the Groups share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless the Group has legal or constructive obligations to make payments to, or on behalf of, theassociate.
If the associate subsequently reports profits, the Group resumes recognising its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognised.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to theextent of the Groups interest in the associates: unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Interests in Joint Ventures The Groups interest in its joint ventures is accounted for under the equity method of accounting whereby an interest in jointly controlled entities is initially recorded at cost and adjusted thereafter for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of joint ventures.
The statement of operations reflects the Groups share of the results of operations of joint ventures.
Property, Plant and Equipment The Groups property, plant and equipment is stated at purchase or construction cost, excluding the costs of day-to-day servicing, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of plant and equipment when that cost is incurred and recognition criteria are met.
The Groups property, plant and equipment include mining assets, which consist of mineral reserves, mine development and construction costs and capitalised site restoration costs.
Mineral reserves represent tangible assets acquired in business combinations.
Mine development and construction costs represent expenditures incurred in developing access to mineral reserves and preparations for commercial production, including sinking shafts and underground drifts, roads, infrastructure, buildings, machinery and equipment.
At each end of the reporting period management makes an assessment to determine whether there is any indication of impairment of property, plant and equipment.
If any such indication exists, management estimates the recoverable amount, which is the higher of an assets fair value less cost to sell and its value in use.
The carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount, and the difference is recognised as impairment loss in thestatement of operations or other comprehensive income.
An impairment loss recognised for an asset in previous years is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment, except for mining assets, is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
The useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment and methods of their depreciation are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each fiscal year end.
Thetable below presents the useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment.
Weighted average remaining Useful lives useful life years years Buildings and constructions 1560 19 Machinery and equipment 445 11 Transport and motor vehicles 720 7 Other assets 315 12 The Group determines the depreciation charge separately for each significant part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Depletion of mining assets including capitalised site restoration costs is calculated using the units-of-production method based upon proved and probable mineral reserves.
The depletion calculation, however, does not take into account future development costs for reserves which are not yet in the production phase.
EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 137 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED year ended 31 December 2013 2. significant accounting policies continued Property, Plant and Equipment continued Maintenance costs relating to items of property, plant and equipment are expensed as incurred.
Major renewals and improvements are capitalised, and the replaced assets are derecognised.
The Group has the title to certain non-production and social assets, primarily buildings and facilities of social infrastructure, which are carried at their recoverable amount of zero.
Thecosts to maintain such assets are expensed as incurred.
Exploration and Evaluation Expenditures Exploration and evaluation expenditures represent costs incurred by the Group in connection with the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources before the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable.
The expenditures include acquisition of rights to explore, topographical, geological, geochemical and geophysical studies, exploratory drilling, trenching, sampling, activities in relation to evaluating the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting mineral resources.
These costs are expensed as incurred.
When the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable, the Group commences recognition of expenditures related to the development of mineral resources as assets.
These assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an asset may exceed its recoverable amount.
Leases The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on thesubstance of the arrangement at inception date as to whether the fulfilment of thearrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised from the commencement of thelease term at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of theminimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on theremaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged to interest expense.
The depreciation policy for depreciable leased assets is consistent with that for depreciable assets which are owned.
If there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is fully depreciated over the shorter of thelease term or its useful life.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of theasset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as anexpense in the statement of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred for an acquisition of a subsidiary or an associte and the amount recognised for non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the acquiree, the difference is recognised in the consolidated statement of operations.
Goodwill on acquisition of a subsidiary is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill on acquisition of an associate is included in the carrying amount of the investments in associates.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit, or the group of cash-generating units, to which the goodwill relates.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative fair values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
138 EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Strategic Report Performance Governance Financial Statements 2. significant accounting policies continued Intangible Assets Other Than Goodwill Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost.
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Expenditures on internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised development costs, are expensed as incurred.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite life are reviewed at least at each year end.
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are treated as changes in accounting estimates.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, they are tested for impairment annually either individually or at the cash-generating unit level.
Thetable below presents the useful lives of intangible assets.
Weighted average remaining Useful lives useful life years years Customer relationships 115 12 Contract terms 10 10 Other 519 10 Certain water rights and environmental permits are considered to have indefinite lives as management believes that these rights will continueindefinitely.
The most part of the Groups intangible assets represents customer relationships arising on business combinations Note 10.
Emission Rights One of the Groups subsidiaries participates in the programme for emission reduction established by the Kyoto protocol.
Emission rights allowances for each compliance period one year are issued at the beginning of the year, actual emissions are verified after theend of the year.
Allowances, whether issued by government or purchased, are accounted for as intangible assets in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
Allowances that are issued for less than fair value are measured initially at their fair value.
When allowances are issued for less than fair value, the difference between the amount paid and fair value is recognised as a government grant.
Initially the grant is recognised as deferred income in the statement of financial position and subsequently recognised as income on a systematic basis over the compliance period for which the allowances were issued, regardless of whether the allowances are held or sold.
As emissions are made, a liability is recognised for the obligation to deliver allowances equal to emissions that have been made.
This liability is a provision that is within the scope of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and it is measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period being the present market price of the number of allowances required to cover emissions made up to the end of the reporting period.
Financial Assets The Group classified its investments into the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity, and available-for-sale.
When investments are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
The Group determines the classification of its investments after initialrecognition.
Investments that are acquired principally for the purpose of generating a profit from short-term fluctuations in price are classified as held for trading and included in the category financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
Investments which are included in this category are subsequently carried at fair value: gains or losses on such investments are recognised in income.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity.
Held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective yield method.
EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 139 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED year ended 31 December 2013 2. significant accounting policies continued Financial Assets continued Investments intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, are classified as available-for-sale: these are included in non-current assets unless management has the express intention of holding the investment for less than 12 months from the end of the reporting period or unless they will need to be sold to raise operating capital, in which case they are included in current assets.
Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of the purchase and re-evaluates such designation on a regular basis.
After initial recognition available-for-sale investments are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or until the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is included in the statement of operations.
Reversals of impairment losses in respect of equity instruments are not recognised in the statement of operations.
Impairment losses in respect of debt instruments are reversed through profit or loss if the increase in fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in thestatement of operations.
For investments that are actively traded in organised financial markets, fair value is determined by reference to stock exchange quoted market bid prices at the close of business on the end of the reporting period.
For investments where there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques.
Such techniques include using recent arms length market transactions, reference to the current market value of another instrument, which is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis or other generally accepted valuation techniques.
All purchases and sales of financial assets under contracts to purchase or sell financial assets that require delivery of the asset within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the market place are recognised on the settlement date i. e. the date the asset is delivered by to the counterparty.
Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable, which generally are short-term, are recognised and carried at theoriginal invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment of accounts receivable that represents its estimate of incurred losses.
The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar receivables in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified.
The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets.
Inventories Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost of inventory is determined on the weighted average basis and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring or producing inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.
Thecost of finished goods and work in progress includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity, but excluding borrowing costs.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Value Added Tax The tax authorities permit the settlement of sales and purchases value added tax VAT on a net basis.
The Groups subsidiaries apply the accrual method for VAT recognition, under which VAT becomes payable upon invoicing and delivery of goods or rendering services as well upon receipt of prepayments from customers.
VAT on purchases, even if not settled at the end of the reporting period, is deducted from the amount of VAT payable.
Where provision has been made for impairment of receivables, an impairment loss is recorded for the gross amount of the debtor, including VAT.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method: any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption amount is recognised as interest expense over theperiod of the borrowings.
Borrowing costs relating to qualifying assets are capitalised Note 9.
140 EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Strategic Report Performance Governance Financial Statements 2. significant accounting policies continued Financial Guarantee Liabilities Financial guarantee liabilities issued by the Group are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.
Financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of the guarantee.
Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period and the amount initially recognised.
Equity Share Capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
External costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown as a deduction in equity from the proceeds.
Any excess of the fair value of consideration received over the par value of shares issued is recognised as additional paid-in capital.
Treasury Shares Own equity instruments which are acquired by the Group treasury shares are deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in statement of operations on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the treasury shares.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity only if they are declared before or the end of the reporting period.
Dividends are disclosed when they are proposed before the end of the reporting period or proposed or declared after the end of the reporting period but before the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.
Provisions for site restoration costs are capitalised within property, plant and equipment.
Employee Benets Social and Pension Contributions Defined contributions are made by the Group to the Russian and Ukrainian state pension, social insurance, medical insurance and unemployment funds at the statutory rates in force approximately 34.2%, based on gross salary payments.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions in respect of those benefits.
Its only obligation is to pay contributions as they fall due.
These contributions are expensed asincurred.
Dened benefit Plans The Group companies provide pensions and other benefits to their employees Note 23.
Theentitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the completion of a minimum service period.
Certain benefit plans require the employee to remain in service up to retirement age.
Other employee benefits consist of various compensations and non-monetary benefits.
The amounts of benefits are stipulated in the collective bargaining agreements and or in the plan documents.
The Group involves independent qualified actuaries in the measurement of employee benefit obligations.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit method.
Re-measurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding net interest and the return on plan assets excluding net interest, are recognised immediately in the statement of financial position with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Re-measurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.
Past service costs are recognised in profit or loss on the earlier of the date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and the date that the Group recognises  costs.
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
It is recorded within interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations.
The Group recognises current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine settlements in the consolidated statement of operations within cost of sales, general and administrative expenses and selling and distribution expenses.
EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 141 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED year ended 31 December 2013 2. significant accounting policies continued Employee Benets continued Other Costs The Group incurs employee costs related to the provision of benefits such as health services, kindergartens and other services.
These amounts principally represent an implicit cost of employment and, accordingly, have been charged to cost of sales.
Share-based Payments The Group has management compensation schemes Note 21, under which certain senior executives and employees of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby they render services as consideration for equity instruments .
The cost of equity-settled transactions with grantees is measured by reference to the fair value of the Companys shares at the date on which they are granted.
The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any conditions, other than market conditions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity additional paid-in capital, over the period in which service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant persons become fully entitled to the award the vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Groups best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The charge or credit in the statement of operations for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.
Once a share-settled transaction is vested, no further accounting entries are made to reverse the cost already charged, even if the instruments that are the subject of the transaction are subsequently forfeited.
In this case, the Group makes a transfer between different components of equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previousparagraph.
Cash-settled share-based payments represent transactions in which the Group acquires goods or services by incurring a liability to transfer cash or other assets to thesupplier of those goods or services for amounts that are based on the price or value of the Groups shares or other equityinstruments.
The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured initially at fair value at the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton model.
This fair value is expensed over the period until the vesting date with recognition of a corresponding liability.
The liability is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date up to and including the settlement date with changes in fair value recognised in the statement of operations.
The dilutive effect of outstanding share-based awards is reflected as additional share dilution in thecomputation of earnings per share Note 20.
Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
When goods are sold or services are rendered in exchange for dissimilar goods or services, the revenue is measured at the fair value of the goods or services received, adjusted by theamount of any cash or cash equivalents transferred.
When the fair value of the goods or services received cannot be measured reliably, the revenue is measured at the fair value of the goods or services given up, adjusted by the amount of any cash or cash equivalents transferred.
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Sale of Goods Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Themoment of transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership is determined by thecontract terms.
Rendering of Services The Groups revenues from rendering of services include electricity, transportation, port and other services.
Revenue is recognised when services are rendered.
142 EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Strategic Report Performance Governance Financial Statements 2. significant accounting policies continued Revenue continued Interest Interest is recognised using the effective interest method.
Dividends Revenue is recognised when the shareholders right to receive the payment is established.
Rental Income Rental income is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term on ongoing leases.
Current Income Tax Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income or equity and not in the statement of operations.
Deferred Income Tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in respect of temporary differences using the liability method.
Deferred income taxes are provided for all temporary differences arising between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes, except where the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
A deferred tax asset is recorded only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeablefuture.
Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on their products and services, and has four reportable operating segments: Steel production segment includes production of steel and related products at eleven steel mills.
Mining segment includes iron ore and coal mining and enrichment.
Vanadium products segment includes extraction of vanadium ore and production of vanadium products.
Vanadium slag arising in the steel-making process is also allocated to the vanadium segment.
Other operations include energy-generating companies, seaports, shipping and railway transportation companies.
Management and investment companies are not allocated to any of the segments.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable segments.
Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
Management monitors the results of the operating segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
Segment performance is evaluated based on EBITDA.
This performance indicator is calculated based on management accounts that differ from the IFRS consolidated financial statements for thefollowing reasons: 1 for the last month of the reporting period, the statement of operations for each operating segment is prepared using a forecast for that month: 2 the statement of operations is based on local GAAP figures with the exception of depreciation expense which approximates the amount underIFRS.
Segment revenue is revenue reported in the Groups statement of operations that is directly attributable to a segment and the relevant portion of the Groups revenue that can be allocated on a reasonable basis to a segment, whether from sales to external customers or from transactions with other segments.
Segment expense is expense resulting from the operating activities of a segment that is directly attributable to the segment and the relevant portion of an expense that can be allocated on a reasonable basis to the segment, including expenses relating to external counterparties and expenses relating to transactions with other segments.

Segment information continued Segment result is segment revenue less segment expense that is equal to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA.
Segment EBITDA is determined as a segments profit loss from operations adjusted for impairment of assets, profit loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, foreign exchange gains losses and depreciation, depletion and amortisation expense.
The following tables present measures of segment profit or loss based on management accounts.

In addition, the Group madea write-off of certain functionally obsolete items of property, plant and equipment and recorded an impairment relating to VAT with a long-termrecovery.
For the purpose of the impairment testing as of 31 December 2013 the Group assessed the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit to which the goodwill was allocated or where indicators of impairment were identified.
The recoverable amounts have been determined based on calculation of either value-in-use or fair value less costs to sell.
Both valuation techniques used cash flow projections based on the actual operating results and business plans approved by management and appropriate discount rates reflecting time value of money and risks associated with respective cash-generating units.
For the periods not covered by management business plans, cash flow projections have been estimated by extrapolating the results of the respective business plans using a zero real growth rate.
In determination of fair value less costs to sell the assets value additionally includes the cashflows of future projects not started yet and the associated capital expenditure costs.
The major drivers that led to impairment were the changes in expectations of long-term prices for iron ore and steel products, the increase in forecasted costs and changes in forecasted production volumes.
In 2013, the Group fully impaired Claymont Steel as it is expected that it will be idled due to soft demand in the market.
The melt shop and the rolling mill ceased operations and were closed at the end of 2013, employees contracts were terminated.
In 2013, the Group has divided Evrazruda into several cash-generating units, which were previously considered as one aggregated unit.
This was done, because management has developed separate strategies for certain mines of Evrazruda.
These strategies are based on each individual mine reserves, costs and potential profitability.
The enrichment and service facilities, which cannot be reasonably allocated to each individual mine, were considered in aggregation in the impairment testing calculations.
As a result, in 2013, the Group partially reversed an impairment of 2 mines.

The discount rates have been determined using the Capital Asset Pricing Model and analysis of industry peers.
Reasonably possible changes in discount rates could lead to an additional impairment at EVRAZ Consolidated West-Siberian Metallurgical Plant, EVRAZ Dnepropetrovsk Iron and Steel Works, EVRAZ Bagleykoks, Yuzhkuzbassugol, EVRAZ Palini e Bertoli, EVRAZInc.
NA and EVRAZ Inc. NA Canada cash-generating units.
If discount rates were 10% higher, this would lead to an additional impairment of $470 million.

Impairment of assets continued Sales Prices The prices of the products sold by the Group were estimated using industry research.
TheGroup expects that the nominal prices will grow with a compound annual growth rate of 0%-6.1% in 2014 2018, 3.0% in 2019 and thereafter.
Reasonably possible changes in sales prices could lead to an additional impairment at EVRAZ Consolidated West-Siberian Metallurgical Plant, EVRAZ Dnepropetrovsk Iron and Steel Works, EVRAZ Bagleykoks, Yuzhkuzbassugol, EVRAZ Inc. NA and EVRAZ Inc. NA Canada cash-generating units.
If the prices assumed for 2014 and 2015 in the impairment test were 10% lower, this would lead to an additional impairment of $1,525 million.
Sales Volumes Management assumed that the sales volumes of steel products would increase by 3% in 2014 and would grow evenly during the following four years to reach normal asset capacity utilisation thereafter.
Reasonably possible changes in sales volumes could lead to an additional impairment at EVRAZ Consolidated West-Siberian Metallurgical Plant, EVRAZ Dnepropetrovsk Iron and Steel Works, EVRAZ Bagleykoks, Yuzhkuzbassugol and EVRAZ Inc. NA cash-generating units.
If the sales volumes were 10% lower than those assumed for 2014 and 2015 in the impairment test, this would lead to an additional impairment of $399 million.
Cost Control Measures The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are based on the business plans approved by management.
A reasonably possible deviation ofcost from these plans could lead to an additional impairment at EVRAZ Consolidated West-Siberian Metallurgical Plant, EVRAZ Dnepropetrovsk Iron and Steel Works, EVRAZ Bagleykoks, EVRAZ Sukha Balka, Yuzhkuzbassugol, and EVRAZ Nikom and EVRAZ Inc. NA cash-generating units.
If theactual costs were 10% higher than those assumed for 2014 and 2015 in the impairment test, this would lead to an additional impairment of $1,024 million.

The following reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations: 2013 2012 2011 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for basic earnings per share 1,499,457,909 1,339,027,567 1,293,795,125 Effect of dilution: share-based awards 2,689,622 Weighted average number of ordinary shares adjusted for the effect ofdilution 1,499,457,909 1,339,027,567 1,296,484,747 Profit loss for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent, US$million $ 522 $ 398 $465 Basic earnings losses per share $ 0.35 $ 0.30 $0.36 Diluted earnings losses per share $ 0.35 $ 0.30 $0.36 In 2011, share-based awards Note 21 had a dilutive effect.
In 2012 and 2013, they were antidilutive as theGroup reported net loss.
In 2011, the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding from 1 January 2011 to the date of the first share exchange the reorganisation date was computed on the basis of the weighted average number of ordinary shares of Evraz Group S. A. outstanding during the period multiplied by the share exchange ratio.
The number of ordinary shares outstanding from the reorganisation date to the end of 2011 was the actual number of ordinary shares of EVRAZ plc outstanding during that period.
In addition, the weighted average number of ordinary shares for basic earnings per share does not include 7,333,333 shares of Evraz Group S. A. issued in 2009 to Lanebrook in exchange for theright to receive 7,333,333 shares lent under the shares lending transactions.
These transactions had no impact on equity, as the Groups net assets did not change as a result of these transactions.
The warrants issued in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in Corber 2013 Share Issue above are included in the calculation of basic earnings per share starting from the date of their issue.
Dividends Dividends declared by the parent company during 20112013 were as follows: Dividends Date of To holders declared, US$ per declaration registered at US$ million share Declared by Evraz Group S. A.
Equity continued Dividends continued In 2011, prior to the Groups reorganisation, Evraz Group S. A. declared interim dividends of $3.30 per share, including special dividends of $2.70 per share.
In the consolidated financial statements of the Group for 2011 these dividends were charged against accumulated profits.
At a meeting held on 15 May 2012, the shareholders of EvrazGroupS.
A. approved the distribution of those dividends from share premium of Evraz GroupS.
A. Consequently, in 2012, the Group decreased its additional paid-in capital and increased accumulated profits by $491 million.
The Board of directors decided not to declare a final dividend for 2012 and this decision was approved by the Annual General Meeting of shareholders of EVRAZ plc in June 2013.
Subsequent to the reporting date the Board of directors proposed special dividends Note 32.
In addition, certain subsidiaries of the Group declared dividends.
The share of non-controlling shareholders in those dividends was $1 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011.
Other Movements in Equity Non-controlling Interests in Subsidiaries In 2013, as a result of the acquisition of a controlling interest in Raspadskaya Note 4, the Group recognised $311 million representing noncontrolling shareholders owning approximately 18% in theentity.
In 2012 and 2011, the Group acquired non-controlling interests in certain subsidiaries Note4.
The excess of consideration over the carrying value of non-controlling interests amounting to $30million and $18 million, respectively, was charged to accumulated profits.
In 2012, as a result of the completion of the Groups reorganisation, in which the remaining global depository receipts of EvrazGroupS.
A. were converted into the newly issued shares of EVRAZplc, a 0.18% non-controlling interest in Evraz Group S. A. was derecognised Note 4.
This increased the shareholders equity by $6 million.
In 2011, the Group sold a 49.98% share in the Mezhegey coal field project to a third party for a non-cash consideration of $34 million, which approximated the carrying value ofanon-controlling interest arose on the transaction.
In June 2012, the Group acquired anadditional 9.996% ownership interest and its share in the project increased to approximately 60.016% Note 4.
During 2012 the non-controlling shareholder contributed $7million to the Mezhegey coal field project.

Compliance with Financial Covenants Some of the loan agreements and terms and conditions of notes provide for certain covenants in respect of Evraz Group S. A. and its subsidiaries.
The covenants impose restrictions in respect of certain transactions and financial ratios, including restrictions in respect of indebtedness andprofitability.
Notes due in 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2020 totalling $3,536 million issued by Evraz Group S. A. a holding company directly wholly owned by EVRAZ Plc, have covenants restricting the incurrence of indebtedness by the issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries conditional on a gross leverage ratio.
While the ratio level itself does not constitute a breach of covenants, exceeding the threshold triggers a restriction on incurrence of consolidated indebtedness, which is removed once the ratio goes back below the threshold.
The effect of the restriction is such that Evraz Group S. A. and its subsidiaries are not allowed to increase the consolidated indebtedness at the level of Evraz Group S. A. but are allowed to refinance existing indebtedness subject to certain conditions.
180 EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Strategic Report Performance Governance Financial Statements 22.
Loans and borrowings continued Compliance with Financial Covenants continued The $400 million notes due 2017 issued by Raspadskaya in 2012 have covenants similar to those of Evraz Group S. A. but with the ratio calculation based on the consolidated numbers of OAORaspadskaya and the restrictions applying only to OAO Raspadskaya and its subsidiaries.
These restrictions have the same effect on Raspadskaya, but no effect on EVRAZ plc and its other subsidiaries that are not part of the Raspadskaya Group.
OOO UK Mezhegeyugol, which is a direct subsidiary of EVRAZ plc, is not subject to restrictions imposed by the above mentioned covenants.
However, as a borrower of a $195 million project loan by Gazprombank, it is restricted from incurring any additional indebtedness without the consent of the lender.
The incurrence covenants are in line with the Groups financial strategy and, therefore, do not constitute any excessive restriction on its operations.
In addition to the incurrence covenants mentioned above, at 31 December 2013 the Group had loans with an aggregate principal amount of $251million, which are subject to financial maintenance covenants.
These covenants require Evraz Group S. A. to maintain two key ratios, consolidated net indebtedness to 12-month consolidated EBITDA and 12-month consolidated EBITDA to adjusted 12-month consolidated interest expense, within certain limits.
According to the respective facility agreements, as amended in June 2013, these ratios are tested semi-annually on the basis of consolidated financial statements of Evraz Group S. A. starting from 30 June 2014.
Abreach of one or both of the ratios would constitutean event of default under the above mentioned facility agreements, which in its turn may trigger cross default events under other debt instruments of Evraz Group S. A. and its subsidiaries.
In June 2013, the Group entered into amendments to certain loan agreements with a total outstanding principal amount of approximately EUR194million.
According to these amendments, the testing of financial maintenance covenants under the loan agreements was suspended in respect of the financial year 2013.
If such amendments had not been signed, the Group would have been in breach of the financial covenants.
The Group paid bank fees and legal costs of approximately $1million in connection with these amendments.
At 30 June 2013, theGroup had $404 million liabilities under loan agreements which contained financial restrictions which could have been breached upon the issue of the interim consolidated financial statements.
The Group repaid these liabilities in full and terminated the loan agreements in July 2013.
In September 2013, Raspadskaya repaid a $150 million bank loan to remove the risk of atechnical default in relation to this debt, which could causea cross-default under 7.75% bonds issued by Raspadskaya.
In 2012, the lenders under certain bank facilities and the holders of the 8.25% guaranteed notes due 2015 approved the requested amendments to the loan agreements and notes removing certain financial restrictions.
The Group incurred $7 million with respect to this covenants reset.
Unamortised Debt Issue Costs Unamortised debt issue costs represent agent commission and transaction costs paid by theGroup in relation to the arrangement and reset of loans and notes.

Employee benets Russian Plans Certain Russian subsidiaries of the Group provide regular lifetime pension payments and lump-sum amounts payable at retirement date.
These benefits generally depend on years of service, level of remuneration and amount of pension payment under the collective bargaining agreements.
Other post-employment benefits consist of various compensations and certain non-cash benefits.
The Group funds thebenefits when theamounts of benefits fall due for payment.
In addition, some subsidiaries have defined benefit plans under which contributions are made to aseparately administered non-state pension fund.
The Group matches 100% of the employees contributions to the fund up to 4% of their monthly salary.
TheGroups contributions become payable at the participants retirement dates.
Defined contribution plans represent payments made by the Group to the Russian state pension, social insurance, medical insurance and unemployment funds at the statutory rates in force, based on gross salary payments.
EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 181 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED year ended 31 December 2013 23.
Employee benets continued Ukrainian Plans The Ukrainian subsidiaries make regular contributions to the State Pension Fund thereby compensating preferential pensions paid by the fund to employees who worked under harmful and hard conditions.
The amount of such pension depends on years of service and salary.
In 2011 and before, these preferential pensions were partially funded by the State Pension Fund.
TheUkrainian subsidiaries gradually increased these contributions and starting from 2012 they pay 100% of preferential pensions.
In addition, employees receive lump-sum payments on retirement and other benefits under collective labour agreements.
These benefits are based on years of service and level of compensation.
All these payments are considered as defined benefit plans.
In 2013, the amended pension legislation introduced annual indexation of pensions, at least up to the level of CPI.
The indexation of pensions in a particular year depends on the availability of financial resources in the State pension fund.
The subsidiaries are obliged to pay preferential pensions indexed according to the governments decision.
The Group determined the amount of defined benefit obligations based on the assumption that pensions will be indexed despite possible insufficiency of money in the State pension fund, which would result in a non-fulfilment of this law by the fund itself and, consequently, would cancel the obligations of Ukrainian enterprises to pay higher pensions.
US and Canadian Plans The Groups subsidiaries in the USA and Canada have defined benefit pension plans that cover specified eligible employees.
Benefits are based on pensionable years of service, pensionable compensation, or a combination of both depending on theindividual plan.
Certain employees that were hired after specified dates are no longer eligible to participate in the defined benefit plans.
Those employees are instead enrolled in defined contribution plans and receive a contribution funded by the Groups subsidiaries equal to 27% of annual wages, including applicable bonuses.
The defined contribution plans are funded annually, and participants benefits vest after three years of service.
Thesubsidiaries also offer qualified Thrift 401 k plans to all of their eligible employees.
Other Plans Defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans are maintained by thesubsidiaries located in South Africa, Italy and the CzechRepublic.
Dened Contribution Plans The Groups expenses under defined contribution plans were as follows: US$ million 2013 2012 2011 Expense under defined contribution plans $488 $412 $404 Dened benefit Plans The Russian, Ukrainian and other defined benefit plans are mostly unfunded and theUS and Canadian plans are partially funded.
In 2013, there were no significant plan amendments, curtailments, or settlements.
The Groups defined benefit plans are exposed to the risks of unexpected growth in benefit payments as a result of increases in life expectancy, inflation, and salaries.
As the plan assets include significant investments in quoted and unquoted equity shares, corporate and governmental bonds and notes, the Group is also exposed to equity market risk.

Theexchange is exercised on approximately the same dates as thepayments under thebonds.
The swap contracts are summarised in the table below.

TheGroup accounted for these derivatives at fair value which was determined using valuation techniques.
The fair value was calculated as the present value of the expected cashflows under the contracts at the reporting dates.
Future rouble-denominated cashflows were translated into US dollars using the US$ RUR forward rate curve.
The discount rates used in the valuation were the non-deliverable forward rate curve and the interest rate swap curve for US dollar at the reporting dates.
In2013, 2012 and 2011, the change in fair value of the derivatives of $ 106 million, $96million and $ 176 million, respectively, together with a realised gain on the swap transactions, amounting to $51 million, $81million and $66million, respectively, was recognised within gain loss on financial assets and liabilities in the consolidated statement of operations Note 7.
In March 2013, upon repayment of the 9.25% bonds, the related swap contracts matured.
Contingent Consideration Payable Contingent consideration represents additional payments for the acquisition of Stratcor in2006.
This consideration could be paid each year up to 2019.
The payments depend on thedeviation of the average prices for vanadium pentoxide from certain levels and the amounts payable for each year are limited to maximum amounts.
In 2013 and 2012, theGroup was not required to pay this consideration due to the movements in the vanadium pentoxide market relative to the levels set in the agreement.

Financial risk management objectives and policies Credit Risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Financial instruments that potentially expose the Group to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and trade accounts receivable.
To manage credit risk related to cash, the Group maintains its available cash, mainly in USdollars, in reputable international banks and major Russian banks.
Management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of the banks in which it deposits cash.
The Groups trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related entities.
In 2013, themajor customers were Russian Railways and Enbridge Inc. 3.7%and 3.2% of total sales, respectively.
Part of the Groups sales is made on terms of letter of credit.
Inaddition, the Group requires prepayments from certain customers.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables, except when a customer applies for credit terms which are longer than normal.
In this case, the Group requires bank guarantees or other collateral.
The Group has developed standard credit terms and constantly monitors the status of accounts receivable collection and the creditworthiness of the customers.
Certain of the Groups long-standing Russian customers for auxiliary products, such as heat and electricity, represent municipal enterprises and governmental organisations that experience financial difficulties.
The significant part of doubtful debts allowance consists of receivables from such customers.
The Group has no practical ability to terminate the supply to these customers and negotiates with regional and municipal authorities the terms of recovery of these receivables.
At 31 December the maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying amount of financial assets, which is disclosed below.

The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The Group prepares a rolling 12-month financial plan which ensures that the Group has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses, financial obligations and investing activities as they arise.
The Group exercises a daily monitoring of cash proceeds and payments.
The Group maintains credit lines and overdraft facilities that can be drawn down to meet short-term financing needs.
If necessary, the Group refinances its short-term debt by long-term borrowings.
The Group also uses forecasts to monitor potential and actual financial covenants compliance issues Note 22.
Where compliance is at risk, the Group considers options including debt repayment, refinancing or covenant reset.
TheGroup has developed standard payment periods in respect of trade accounts payable and monitors the timeliness of payments to its suppliers and contractors.

Interest Rate Risk The Group borrows on both a fixed and variable rate basis and has other interest-bearing liabilities, such as finance lease liabilities and otherobligations.
The Group incurs interest rate risk on liabilities with variable interest rates.
The Groups treasury function performs analysis of current interest rates.
In case of changes inmarket fixed or variable interest rates management may consider the refinancing of a particular debt on more favourable terms.
The Group does not have any financial assets with variable interest rates.
Fair Value Sensitivity Analysis for Fixed Rate Instruments The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
Therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect the Groups profits.
The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets as assets available for sale.
Therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect the Groups equity.

This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.
In estimating reasonably possible changes the Group assessed thevolatility of interest rates during the reporting periods.

The currencies in which these transactions are denominated are primarily USdollars, Canadian dollars and euro.
The Group does not have formal arrangements to mitigate currency risks of the Groups operations.
However, management believes that the Group is partly secured from currency risks as foreign currency denominated sales are used to cover repayment of foreign currency denominated borrowings.

Commitments and contingencies Operating Environment of the Group The Group is one of the largest vertically integrated steel producers globally and the largest steel producer in Russia.
The Groups major subsidiaries are located in Russia, Ukraine, theEuropean Union, theUSA, Canada and the Republic of South Africa.
Russia, Ukraine and the Republic of South Africa are considered to be emerging markets with higher economic and political risks.
Steel consumption is affected by the cyclical nature of demand for steel products and the sensitivity of that demand to worldwide general economic conditions.
The global economic recession resulted in asignificantly lower demand for steel products and decreased profitability.
The global economic climate continues to be unstable and this may negatively affect theGroups results and financial position in amanner not currently determinable.
Taxation Russian and Ukrainian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations, and changes, which can occur frequently.
Further, the interpretation of tax legislation by tax authorities as applied to the transactions and activity of the Groups entities may not coincide with that of management.
As a result, tax authorities may challenge transactions and the Groups entities may be assessed for additional taxes, penalties and interest.
In Russia and Ukraine the periods remain open to review by the tax and customs authorities with respect to tax liabilities for three calendar years preceding the year of review.
Under certain circumstances reviews may cover longer periods.
Management believes that it has paid or accrued all taxes that are applicable.
Where uncertainty exists, the Group has accrued tax liabilities based on managements best estimate of the probable outflow of resources embodying economic benefits, which will be required to settle these liabilities.
Possible liabilities which were identified by management at the end of the reporting period as those that can be subject to different interpretations of the tax laws and other regulations and are not accrued in these financial statements could be up to approximately $60 million.
Contractual Commitments At 31 December 2013, the Group had contractual commitments for the purchase of production equipment and construction works for an approximate amount of $348million.
In 2010, the Group concluded an agreement for the supply of oxygen, nitrogen and argon by athird party for a period of 20 years.
Thecontractual price comprises a fixed component and a variable component.
The total amount of the fixed component approximates 256million euro.
The agreement is within the scope of IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease.
Social Commitments The Group is involved in a number of social programmes aimed to support education, healthcare and social infrastructure development in towns where the Groups assets are located.
The Group budgeted to spend approximately $114 million under these programmes in 2014.

Commitments and contingencies continued Environmental Protection In the course of the Groups operations, the Group may be subject to environmental claims and legal proceedings.
The quantification of environmental exposures requires an assessment of many factors, including changing laws and regulations, improvements in environmental technologies, the quality of information available related to specific sites, the assessment stage of each site investigation, preliminary findings and the length of time involved in remediation or settlement.
Management believes that any pending environmental claims or proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position and results of operations.
In addition, the Group has committed to various environmental protection programmes coveringperiods from 2014 to 2022, under which the Group will perform works aimed at reductions in environmental pollution and contamination.
As of 31 December 2013, the costs of implementing these programmes are estimated at $262million.
Legal Proceedings The Group has been and continues to be the subject of legal proceedings, none of which has had, individually or in aggregate, a significant effect on the Groups operations or financial position.
The Group exercises judgement in measuring and recognising provisions and the exposure to contingent liabilities related to pending litigations or other outstanding claims subject to negotiated settlement, mediation, arbitration or government regulation, as well as other contingent liabilities.
Judgement is necessary in assessing the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise, and to quantify the possible range of the final settlement.
Because of the inherent uncertainties in this evaluation process, actual losses may be different from the originally estimated provision.
These estimates are subject to change as new information becomes available, primarily with the support of internal specialists or with the support of outside consultants.
Revisions to the estimates may significantly affect future operating results.
Possible liabilities which were identified by the Group at the end of the reporting period as those that can be subject to different interpretations of legislation or contracts and are not accrued in these financial statements could be up to approximately $6 million.
Auditors remuneration The remuneration of the Groups auditor in respect of the services provided to the Group was as follows.
