The net UK pension costs for the year ended 31 March 2013 amounted to 1.4m 2012: nil.
The contributions paid by the Group to the defined contribution section of the scheme amounted to 4.7m 2012: 4.2m.
The rules of the UK Electrocomponents Group Pension scheme give the Trustee powers to wind up the scheme, which it may exercise if the Trustee is aware that the assets of the scheme are insufficient to meet its liabilities.
Although the scheme is currently in deficit on a statutory funding basis, the Trustee and the Company have agreed a plan to eliminate the deficit over time and the Trustee has confirmed as at 24 April 2013 that it has no current intention of exercising its power to wind up the scheme.
The costs of the defined benefit pension schemes in Germany and Republic of Ireland were 0.4m 2012: 0.4m.
The costs of the defined contribution schemes in Australia, North America, Germany and Republic of Ireland were 2.2m 2012: 2.1m, and those via government schemes in France, Italy, Scandinavia and North Asia were 4.1m 2012: 3.8m.
The Group expects to pay 5.0m to its UK defined benefit pension scheme in the year ending 31 March 2014.
The principal assumptions used in the valuations of the liabilities of the Groups schemes were: 2013 2013 2012 United 2013 Republic of 2012 2012 Republic of Kingdom Germany Ireland UK Germany Ireland Discount rate 4.40% 4.00% 4.00% 5.00% 3.75% 3.75% Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 2.55% 2.50% 2.00% 2.55% 3.00% 3.00% Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.20% 2.00% 2.00% 3.10% 2.00% 2.00% Inflation assumption 3.30% 2.00% 2.00% 3.20% 2.00% 2.00% The assumption on the rate of increase of pensionable salaries in the UK scheme has been restricted.
This is due to the introduction of salary capping entitlement arrangements with respect to the defined benefit pension scheme in June 2008.

A reduction to 23% effective from 1 April 2013 was substantively enacted on 3 July 2012.
This will apply to the Companys future tax charge.
In line with this change the rate applying to UK deferred tax assets and liabilities has been reduced from 24% to 23% creating a rate adjustment, which is partly reflected by a benefit to the Group income statement 0.1m, and partly in a benefit to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 0.1m.
Accordingly both recognised and unrecognised UK deferred tax balances as at 31 March 2013 have been calculated at a rate of 23%.
The further reduction in rate from 23% to 20% has not yet been substantively enacted.
If this reduction had been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, the effect would have been to reduce the net deferred tax liability by 0.5m.
Of this reduction, it is estimated that 0.5m would be credited to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Deferred taxation balances are analysed in note 21.

Value in use calculations The recoverable amount of goodwill is based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use discounted cash flow projections based on actual operating results together with management projections for five years.
These cash flows are based on extrapolations from earlier budgets and forecasts.
These are subject to assessing the reasonableness of the assumptions: for example by examining the causes of differences between past cash flow projections and actual cash flows.
Cash flows for further periods, i. e. beyond five years, are extrapolated using a long-term annual growth rate of 2% 2012: 2% which is consistent with the prudent market estimate long-term average growth rate for the distribution industry.
A pre-tax discount rate of 8.4% 2012: 9.0% has been applied in calculating the discounted projected cash flows.
Key assumptions The key assumptions used are the sales growth rate and discount rate.
The sales growth rate is prepared using internal forecasts based upon historical growth rates and future medium-term plans together with relevant macro economic indicators.
The long-term growth rates used are consistent with the prudent market estimate long-term average growth rates for the industry and do not exceed expected long-term GDP growth.
The discount rate is based upon the Groups Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC at 31 March 2013 and has been calculated reflecting market assessments at that time.
The Directors believe that currently all reasonably likely changes in the key assumptions referred to above would not give rise to an impairment charge.
Outcome of calculations The recoverable amount of the Allied Electronics Inc. cash generating unit exceeds its carrying value and the carrying value of the goodwill is therefore not impaired.

A Derivative financial assets and liabilities Fair values are estimated by discounting expected future contractual cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves and valuing any amounts denominated in foreign currencies at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
These financial instruments are included on the balance sheet at fair value, derived from observable market prices Level 2 as defined by IFRS7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
B Interest-bearing loans held at fair value These comprise sterling and foreign currency denominated interest bearing loans which are subject to hedge accounting.
The foreign currency amounts have been valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date Level 2 as defined by IFRS7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
C Loans designated under fair value hedge relationships These comprise Sterling and foreign currency denominated interest-bearing loans which are subject to hedge accounting.
The foreign currency amounts have been valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
These loans have been designated under fair value hedge relationships.
D Cash and cash equivalents, bank overdrafts, interest-bearing loans held at amortised cost Cash and cash equivalents largely comprise local bank account balances, which typically bear interest at rates set by reference to local applicable rates or cash float balances which have not yet cleared for interest purposes.
Fair values are estimated to equate to carrying amounts as their repricing maturity is less than one year.
Interest-bearing loans held at amortised cost comprise fixed rate sterling and foreign currency denominated loans.
For carrying values the foreign currency principal amounts have been valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Fair values are estimated by discounting future cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves.
Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand and are all unsecured.
They bear interest at rates set by reference to applicable local rates.
E Finance lease liabilities Fair values are estimated by discounting future cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves.
F Other financial assets and liabilities Fair values of receivables and payables are determined by discounting future cash flows.
For amounts with a repricing maturity of less than one year, fair value is assumed to approximate to the carrying amount.
Electrocomponents plc Annual Report and Accounts 201385 NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 20 Financial instruments continued Risk management objectives and policies The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of liquidity, market and credit.
Each of these are managed in accordance with Board approved policies.
The policies are set out below.
Liquidity risk The Groups key priority is to ensure that it can meet its liabilities as they fall due.
The Group ensures this by having sufficient committed debt facilities in place to meet its anticipated funding requirements.
The Groups forecast funding requirements and its committed debt facilities are reported to and monitored by the Treasury Committee monthly.
As at 31 March 2013 the Group had the following committed debt finance in place: Private Placement Notes of $150m with maturities of June 2015 and June 2017 A syndicated multicurrency facility for $75m, 120m and 50m with a maturity of November 2015 As at 31 March 2013 the Group had available 149.2m of undrawn committed debt facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
The Group also uses bank overdrafts, uncommitted short-term money market loans, cash and short-term investments.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Groups day-to-day funding and liquidity requirements.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including contractual future interest payments.

Some operating companies also have receivables in currencies other than their functional currency.
Hedging of currency exposures during periods when operating companies cannot easily change their selling prices is implemented in order to shelter the forecast gross profits during those periods.
In this way the impacts of currency fluctuations can be smoothed until selling prices can be changed in the light of movements in exchange rates.
The hedges are enacted through forward foreign currency contracts entered into by Group Treasury based on trading projections provided by the operating companies.
The Groups largest exposures relate to Euros and US Dollars.
As at 31 March 2013 net forecast exposures in Euros and US Dollars for the first six months Euros and first three months US Dollars of the year ending 31 March 2014 were 100% hedged.
In addition specific cash flows relating to material transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the local business are hedged when the commitment is made.
The Group classifies forward exchange contracts as hedging instruments against forecast receivables payables and designates them as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes.
The forecast cash flows are expected to occur evenly throughout the period for 12 months from the year end, and will affect the income statement in the period in which they occur.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts not used as hedges of forecast transactions as at 31 March 2013 was Nil 2012: Nil.
Foreign currency transaction exposures, and the hedges in place to mitigate them, are monitored monthly by the Treasury Committee.
The Group does not believe its foreign currency transactional risk has materially altered during the year.
Foreign currency translational risk During the year ended 31 March 2010 the Group issued $37.5m of Private Placement Notes with maturities of June 2015 and June 2017 and, using cross-currency interest rate swaps, swapped $36.25m to 22.5m at a floating interest rate.
In June 2010 the Group issued a further $112.5m of Private Placement Notes with maturities of June 2015 and June 2017 and, using crosscurrency interest rate swaps, swapped $63.75m into a combination of 14.8m and 28.3m at floating interest rates.
These cross-currency interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges and are expected to remain highly effective over the life of the Private Placement Notes.
The Group has designated certain external loans as net investment hedges against its investments in its US and European subsidiaries.
The carrying amount of the US hedge as at 31 March 2013 was $110m 72.4m, of which $40m 26.3m formed part of the unsecured bank facility, $50m 32.9m was from the US Private Placement market and $20m 13.2m was in the form of an overdraft.
The carrying amount of the Euro hedge was 32.7m 31.5m, of which 9m 7.6m formed part of the unsecured bank facility and 23.7m 19.9m was in the form of an overdraft.
Both the US Dollar and Euro overdrafts are shown in the balance sheet netted with positive cash balances, as there is an absolute right of set-off.
The carrying value of these US Dollar and Euro hedges remained highly effective, throughout the year ended 31 March 2013.
A foreign exchange loss of 2.8m 2012: gain of 3.4m was recognised in equity on translation of the loans to Sterling in the year ended 31 March 2013.
No other foreign currency translation exposures are explicitly hedged although local currency debt is used where economic and fiscally efficient in the financing of subsidiaries and this provides a degree of natural hedging.
Guidelines are in place to manage the currency mix of the Groups net debt.
The Group does not believe its foreign currency translational risk has materially altered during the year.
Interest rate risk The Group has relatively high interest cover and therefore the Group adopts a policy of paying and receiving most of its interest on a variable interest rate basis, as in the opinion of the Group this minimises interest cost over time.
This policy is subject to regular monitoring of the effect of potential changes in interest rates on its interest cost with a view to taking suitable actions should exposure reach certain levels.
The Group does not believe its interest rate risk has materially altered during the year.
As at 31 March 2013 the Group had: Fixed the interest on $40m borrowings from its syndicated bank facility until June 2013 using an interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge Left $50m of its Private Placement Notes fixed until June 2015 Swapped $100m of its Private Placement Notes from US Dollar fixed to Sterling floating $60m and Euro floating $40m using an interest rate swap.
This is designated as a fair value hedge All other borrowings were at a variable rate.

The amounts in the balance sheet represent the maximum credit risk exposure at the balance sheet date.
There were no significant concentrations of credit risk at the balance sheet date, as exposure is spread over a large number of counterparties, customers and geographic locations.
As such the Group does not believe its credit risk has materially altered during the year.
The Group identifies counterparties of suitable creditworthiness based on ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies and has procedures to ensure that only these parties are used, that exposure limits are set based on the external credit ratings and that these limits are not exceeded.
Trade and other receivables All operating companies have credit policies and monitor their credit exposure on an ongoing basis.
Each operating company performs credit evaluations on all customers seeking credit over a certain amount.
Trade receivables are stated net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by local management based on prior experience of customers and assessment of their current economic environment.
There are no significant individual allowances for doubtful receivables included within this amount.
For countries with no local operating company presence export credit limits are set and monitored on a country basis monthly by the Treasury Committee.
Given the profile of our customers, whereby credit risk is spread amongst a large number of customers with small balances, no further material credit risk has been identified with the trade receivables not past due other than those balances for which an allowance has been made.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was: 2013 2012 m m UK 62.7 61.9 Continental Europe 81.9 82.4 North America 34.5 32.5 Asia Pacific 23.5 24.8 202.6 201.6 The ageing of net trade receivables at the reporting date was: 2013 2012 m m Not past due 136.0 159.4 Past due 0-60 days 58.0 37.1 Past due 60-120 days 5.9 4.0 Past due 120 days 2.7 1.1 90 Electrocomponents plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial statements 20 Financial instruments continued The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of loans and receivables during the year was as follows: 2013 2012 m m Balance at 1 April 4.7 5.5 Impairment gain loss recognised 0.7 0.8 Balance at 31 March 5.4 4.7 Capital management The Boards policy is to always maintain a strong capital base, with an appropriate debt to equity mix, to ensure investor, creditor and market confidence and to support the future development of the business.
The Board monitors the return on capital employed, which the Group defines as operating profit as a percentage of net assets plus net debt and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Group seeks to raise debt from a variety of sources and with a variety of maturities.
As at 31 March 2013 the Group had a Revolving Credit Facility of 120m, $75m and 50m with a maturity of November 2015 and $65m of US Private Placement Notes due 2015 and $85m of US Private Placement Notes due 2017.
The Groups debt covenants are EBITA: Interest to be greater than 3:1 and Net Debt: EBITDA to be less than 3.25:1.
At the year end the Group comfortably met these covenants.
There were no significant changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.

This deferred tax liability is not expected to crystallise in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised for tax losses where current projections show that sufficient taxable profits will arise in the near future against which these losses may be offset.
2013 2012 m m Unrecognised deferred tax assets Tax losses 8.3 9.2 A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these tax losses which can be carried forward against future taxable income as recoverability is uncertain.
Deferred tax is provided at the standard rate of corporation tax applicable at the balance sheet date unless there is legislation enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date changing the rate.
