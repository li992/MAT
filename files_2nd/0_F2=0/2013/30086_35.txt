It is considered too uncertain that the Group will generate taxable profits in the relevant companies that the losses would be available to offset against and, on this basis, the deferred tax asset in respect of these expenses has not been recognised.
Due to the Companys status as an Investment Trust, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval for the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
In respect of properties held in subsidiaries, provision for capital gains tax has been made for revaluation surpluses not sheltered by brought forward capital losses or non-trade debits.
