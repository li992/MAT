Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRSs The Group and Company financial statements of Cranswick plc the Company for the year ended 31 March 2013 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 20 May 2013 and the balance sheets were signed on the Boards behalf by Martin Davey and Mark Bottomley.
Cranswick plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The Groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group and by the Company are set out in note 2.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to publish its individual income statement and related notes.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements of Cranswick plc, both consolidated and Company, have been prepared under IFRS as adopted by the European Union and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
A summary of the principal accounting policies, which have been consistently applied throughout the year and the preceding year, is as follows: Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Cranswick plc and its subsidiaries.
The results of undertakings acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year.
However, the nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, apart from those involving estimations, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements: Share-based payments Note 24 measurement of share-based payments Goodwill Note 11 measurement of the recoverable amount of cash generating units containing goodwill Provisions Note 21 judgements in relation to amounts provided Pensions Note 25 pension scheme actuarial assumptions Acquisitions Note 14 and note 30 fair values on acquisition Trade receivable provisions Note 17 provision for impairment of trade receivables New standards and interpretations applied The following accounting standards and interpretations became effective for the current reporting period: International Accounting Standards IAS IFRSs Effective date IAS 12 Income Taxes Amendment Deferred Taxes: Recovery of underlying assets 1 January 2012 The application of this standard has not had a material effect on the net assets, results and disclosures of the Group.
56 | Cranswick plc Report & Accounts 2013 Corporate Responsibility Financial Statements Shareholder Information Business Review Governance New standards and interpretations not applied The IASB and IFRIC have issued a number of new standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups and Companys financial statements in the period of initial application.
The standards not applied are as follows: International Accounting Standards IAS IFRSs Effective date IAS 32 revised Financial Instruments: Presentation on Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 1 January 2014 IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures 1 January 2013 IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Amendment Initial Application of IFRS 9 1 January 2015 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement 1 January 2015 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements 1 January 2014 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements 1 January 2014 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 1 January 2014 IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement 1 January 2013 IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income Amendment 1 July 2012 IAS 19 revised Employee Benefits 1 January 2013 IAS 27 revised Separate Financial Statements 1 January 2013 IAS 28 revised Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures 1 January 2013 IFRS May 2012 Annual Improvements 1 January 2013 The effective dates stated above are those given in the original IASB IFRIC standards and interpretations.
As the Group prepares its financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, the application of new standards and interpretations will be subject to their having been endorsed for use in the EU via the EU Endorsement mechanism.
In the majority of cases this will result in an effective date consistent with that given in the original standard or interpretation but the need for endorsement restricts the Groups discretion to early adopt standards.
The Group has not early adopted any of the above standards.
Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue, and any associated costs can be measured reliably.
Revenue on the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer on despatch and represents the value of sales to customers net of discounts, similar allowances and estimates of returns and excludes value added tax.
Operating profit The Groups investment in associate Farmers Boy Deeside Limited was made in July 2010 and was disposed of in March 2012 and therefore does not form part of the on-going operations of the Group.
Previously, the Group income statement included a subtotal of operating profit which included the share of results of the associate but in light of the disposal, the directors consider it appropriate to present instead new subtotals of Group operating profit prior to the results of the associate, and profit before net finance costs.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are material items which derive from events or transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of the reporting entity and which individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their size or incidence if the financial statements are to give a true and fair view.
Taxation Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences: i except where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and ii in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Accounting policies continued Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised: i except where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and ii in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income taxes relating to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity and not in the income statement.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement.
Dividends Dividends receivable by the Company are recognised in the income statement if they are declared, appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the entity paying the dividend, prior to the balance sheet date.
Dividends payable by the Company are recognised when declared and therefore final dividends proposed after the balance sheet date are not recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date.
Dividends paid to Shareholders are shown as a movement in equity rather than on the face of the income statement.
Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value.
Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in administrative expenses.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income.
Intangible assets Goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid for a business over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is capitalised and subject to an impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates.
Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
When an entity is disposed of, any goodwill associated with it is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal except that goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 31 March 2004 which was previously deducted from equity is not recycled through the income statement.
Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are capitalised at fair value separately from goodwill only if the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition and the future economic benefits are expected to flow to the Group.
Customer relationships are amortised evenly over their expected useful lives of 5 years, with amortisation charged through administration expenses in the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are included at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation is charged on property, plant and equipment on the depreciable amount, being cost less the estimated residual value based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives, or the estimated useful economic lives of their individual parts.
58 | Cranswick plc Report & Accounts 2013 Corporate Responsibility Financial Statements Shareholder Information Business Review Governance Useful economic lives are principally as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Short leasehold improvements Residue of lease Plant and equipment 5 - 11 years Motor vehicles 4 years The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment individually or at the cash generating unit level when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Capitalised borrowing costs Borrowing costs incurred in financing the construction of qualifying assets such as property, plant and equipment are capitalised up to the date at which the relevant asset is substantially complete.
Borrowing costs are calculated using the Groups weighted average cost of borrowing during the period of capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are expensed as incurred.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less any provision for impairment.
Interest in associates The Groups investment in its associate was accounted for using the equity method, initially recognised at fair value.
An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence.
Under the equity method, the investment in the associate was carried in the Group balance sheet at deemed cost being its fair value on initial recognition plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate, less distributions received and less any impairment in value of individual investments.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associate is included within the carrying amount of the associate and is neither amortised nor tested for impairment.
The share of profit or loss of the associate is shown on the face of the income statement.
This is the profit attributable to equity holders of the associate and therefore is profit after tax.
Where there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate, the Group recognises its share of any changes and discloses this, when applicable, in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate.
For the prior year, the financial statements of the associate were prepared for the period to 30 January 2012 and were updated to 31 March 2012 with reference to management accounts.
Where necessary, adjustments were made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
In the consolidated income statement for the reporting period, and for the comparable period of the previous year, income and expenses from discontinued operations are reported separately from continuing income and expenses down to the level of profit after taxes, even when the Group retains a non-controlling interest in the subsidiary after the sale.
The resulting profit or loss after taxes is reported separately in the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment once classified as held for sale are not depreciated.
Accounting for leases i Finance leases Assets which are financed by leasing agreements that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, in Property, plant and equipment and the corresponding capital cost is shown as an obligation to the lessor in Borrowings.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the term of the lease.
The interest element of the rental obligations is allocated to accounting periods during the lease term to reflect a constant rate of interest on the remainder of the capital amount outstanding.
ii Operating leases Leases, which are not finance leases, are classified as operating leases.
Lease payments are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Accounting policies continued Government grants and contributions UK Regional Development Grants and grants receivable from the European Union and DEFRA in respect of property, plant and equipment are credited to deferred income and released to the income statement over the relevant depreciation period.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a first in, first out basis and net realisable value after making allowance for any obsolete or slow-moving items.
In the case of finished goods, cost comprises direct materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of manufacturing fixed and variable overheads based on a normal level of activity.
Biological assets Biological assets are measured on initial recognition and at the end of each reporting period at fair value less cost to sell.
Changes in the measurement of fair value less cost to sell are included in profit or loss for the period in which they arise.
All costs incurred in maintaining the assets are included in profit or loss for the period in which they arise.
Fair values of livestock held for breeding are determined with reference to market prices of livestock of similar age, breed and genetic material.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash equivalents are defined as cash at bank and in hand including short term deposits with original maturity within 3 months.
For the purposes of the Group cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Financial instruments i Debt instruments, including bank borrowings Debt instruments are initially recognised at the fair value of net proceeds received after the deduction of issue costs.
Subsequently debt instruments are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Issue costs are charged to the income statement over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the balance sheet carrying amount under the effective interest method.
ii Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its cash flow risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The fair value of forward contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with a similar maturity profile.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
Where derivatives meet the hedging criteria under IAS 39 for cash flow hedges the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
Gains or losses recognised in comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects the net profit or loss.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to net profit or loss for the period.
Financial assets Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
60 | Cranswick plc Report & Accounts 2013 Corporate Responsibility Financial Statements Shareholder Information Business Review Governance Foreign currencies In the accounts of each entity in the Group, individual transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into functional currency at the actual exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into functional currency at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Profits and losses on settlement of individual foreign currency transactions and movements on monetary assets and liabilities are dealt with in the income statement.
Treasury shares Cranswick plc shares held by the Group are deducted from equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received on the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to retained earnings.
No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Employee benefits i Pensions A subsidiary of the Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme for certain employees which requires contributions to be made to a separate trustee administered fund.
The scheme was closed to new members on 30 June 2004.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised past-service costs.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in sterling, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
The amounts charged to operating profit are any gains and losses on settlements and curtailments, and these are included as part of staff costs.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension scheme are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past-service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The difference between the interest cost on plan liabilities and the expected return on plan assets is recognised in the income statement as other finance revenue or costs.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes for employees under which contributions are paid into schemes managed by major insurance companies.
Contributions are calculated as a percentage of employees earnings and obligations for contributions to the schemes are recognised as cost of sales or operating expenses in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
ii Equity settled share-based payments The Group operates a savings related share option scheme under which options have been granted to Group employees SAYE scheme.
In addition, the Group operates an Executive share option scheme albeit currently not in use and a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP for senior Executives.
Share options awarded are exercisable subject to the attainment of certain market based and nonmarket based performance criteria.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
Fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any service and performance vesting conditions, other than performance conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company market conditions.
Any other conditions which are required to be met in order for an employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered to be non-vesting conditions.
Like market performance conditions, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining the grant date fair value.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or nonvesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance or service conditions are satisfied.
Accounting policies continued At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated: representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period.
In addition, an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification.
No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled including when a non-vesting condition within the control of the entity or employee is not met, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in the income statement for the award is expensed immediately.
Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.
On transition to IFRS, the Group did not apply the measurement rules of IFRS 2 to equity settled awards granted before 7 November 2002 or granted after that date and vested before 1 January 2005.
However later modifications of such equity instruments are measured under IFRS 2.
3. Business and geographical segments IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of the internal financial information reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The Groups CODM is deemed to be the Executive Directors on the Board, who are primarily responsible for the allocation of resources to segments and the assessment of performance of the segments.
The CODM assesses profit performance using profit before taxation measured on a basis consistent with the disclosure in the Group accounts.
The Group reports on one reportable segment: Food Manufacture and supply of food products to UK grocery retailers, the food service sector and other food producers.
All Group revenues are received for the provision of goods: no revenues are received in relation to the provision of services.
Geographical segments The following table sets out revenues by destination, regardless of where the goods were produced: 2013 2012 000 000 UK 849,836 794,047 Continental Europe 20,222 26,482 Rest of World 5,113 246 875,171 820,775 In addition to the non-UK sales disclosed above the Group also made sales to export markets through UK based meat trading agents totalling 20,122,000 2012: 19,232,000.
Including these sales, total sales to export markets were 45,457,000 for the year 2012: 45,960,000.
Customer concentration The Group has 3 customers which individually account for more than 10 per cent of the Groups total net revenue.
These customers account for 28 per cent, 23 per cent and 10 per cent respectively.
In the prior year these same three customers accounted for 27 per cent, 25 per cent and 8 per cent respectively.
The Groups non-current assets were all located within the UK for both 2013 and 2012.

Taxation continued b Factors affecting tax charge for the year The tax assessed for the year is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK.
The differences are explained below: 2013 2012 000 000 Profit on ordinary activities before tax 47,439 48,351 Profit on ordinary activities multiplied by standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 24 per cent 2012: 26 per cent 11,385 12,571 Effect of: Disallowed expenses 191 453 Deferred tax rate change 327 736 Share-based payment deduction 132 199 Non-taxable amount on disposal of associate - 2,018 Impairment of goodwill - 1,280 Adjustments in respect of prior years 81 480 Total tax charge for the year 11,198 10,871 c Deferred tax Group 2013 2012 000 000 The deferred tax included in the balance sheet is as follows: Deferred tax liability in the balance sheet Accelerated capital allowances 8,179 9,128 Rollover and holdover relief 78 78 Other temporary differences 44 27 Share-based payments 1,582 858 Deferred tax on defined benefit pension scheme 772 1,282 Deferred tax liability 5,947 7,093 The deferred tax included in the income statement is as follows: Deferred tax in the income statement Accelerated capital allowances 1,011 634 Rollover relief - 42 Other temporary differences 136 58 Share-based payments 354 140 Deferred tax on defined benefit pension scheme 250 317 Deferred tax credit 1,251 557 Company 2013 2012 000 000 The deferred tax included in the balance sheet is as follows: Deferred tax asset in the balance sheet Accelerated capital allowances 23 42 Other temporary differences 118 123 Share-based payments 424 225 Deferred tax asset 565 390 66 | Cranswick plc Report & Accounts 2013 Corporate Responsibility Financial Statements Shareholder Information Business Review Governance d Temporary differences associated with Group investments At 31 March 2013 a nil tax liability has been recognised 2012: nil in respect of any taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries, as receipt by the Group of any dividends would be exempt from UK corporation tax.
There are no income tax consequences to the Group in relation to dividends paid to Shareholders.
e Change in Corporation Tax rate The main rate of corporation tax in the UK reduced from 26 per cent to 24 per cent from 1 April 2012.
A further reduction in the corporation tax rate to 23 per cent was enacted before the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is therefore provided at 23 per cent.
Further reductions in the corporation tax rate have been announced but not yet enacted.
It is anticipated that by 1 April 2015, the main rate of corporation tax in the UK will be reduced to 20 per cent.
The aggregate impact of the proposed reductions from 23 per cent to 20 per cent would reduce the deferred tax liability of the Group by approximately 776,000 and reduce the deferred tax asset of the Company by 74,000.
Profit attributable to members Of the profit attributable to members, the sum of 16,826,000 2012: 24,837,000 has been dealt with in the accounts of Cranswick plc.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to members of the parent company of 36,241,000 2012: 37,480,000 by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year.
In calculating diluted earnings per share amounts, the weighted average number of shares is adjusted for the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares for both basic and diluted amounts was as per the table below: 2013 2012 Thousands Thousands Basic weighted average number of shares 48,257 47,709 Dilutive potential ordinary shares share options 137 92 48,394 47,801 Basic weighted average number of shares for 2013 excludes a weighted average of nil shares 2012: 17,377 shares held during the year by the Cranswick plc Employee Benefit Trust and a weighted average of nil treasury shares 2012: 7,806 treasury shares held during the year by the Group.
At 31 March 2013 no shares were held by either the Trust or the Group 2012: nil.
Adjusted earnings per share In the current year the Group impaired freehold property, plant and equipment to their fair value at its mothballed production facility in East Lancashire note 12.
In the prior year, the Group impaired the carrying value of goodwill in relation to its Sandwiches cash generating unit note 11 and disposed of its investment in associate Farmers Boy Deeside Limited which was acquired in July 2010 note 15.
As the impairment of both goodwill and property, plant and equipment and the investment in the associate do not form part of the on-going business of the Group the directors consider it appropriate to present an adjusted EPS on the face of the income statement which excludes the effect of the impairments and the associate, thus facilitating better comparison with prior and future periods.
Adjusted earnings per share are calculated using the weighted average number of shares for both basic and diluted amounts as per the table above.
Adjusted net profits excluding the effect of the associate and the impairment of property, plant and equipment and goodwill are derived as follows: 2013 2012 000 000 Profit for the year 36,241 37,480 Impairment of property, plant and equipment 1,836 - Share of results of associate - 712 Profit on disposal of associate - 8,254 Fair value adjustment to put option in relation to associate - 95 Impairment of goodwill - 4,924 Adjusted profit for the year excluding effect of associate and impairment 38,077 34,767 68 | Cranswick plc Report & Accounts 2013 Corporate Responsibility Financial Statements Shareholder Information Business Review Governance 11.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to the following principal cash-generating units: Cash generating unit 2013 2012 000 000 Fresh pork 12,231 12,231 Cooked meats 90,167 84,679 Sandwiches 11,602 11,602 Continental Fine Foods 10,968 10,968 Other 3,359 3,359 128,327 122,839 Assumptions used The recoverable amount for each cash generating unit has been determined based on value in use calculations using annual budgets for each business for the following year, approved by the Board of Directors, and cash flow projections for the next four years.
Forecast replacement capital expenditure is included from budgets and thereafter capital is assumed to represent 100 per cent of depreciation.
Subsequent cash flows are forecast to grow in line with an assumed long-term industry growth rate of between 3 and 5 per cent derived from third party market information, including Kantar Worldpanel data.
A pre-tax discount rate of 8.3 per cent has been used 2012: 8.8 per cent being managements estimate of the weighted average cost of capital.
Intangible assets continued The calculation is most sensitive to the following assumptions: Sales volumes Sales volumes are influenced by the growth of the underlying food segment, the market shares of our customers, selling prices, and the quality of our products and service.
Historical volumes are used as the base and adjusted over the projection period in line with current growth rates.
Gross margin Gross margin depends upon average selling prices, the cost of raw materials and changes in the cost of production overheads.
Historical margins are used as the base, adjusted for managements expectations derived from experience and with reference to budget forecasts.
Discount rates All calculations of this nature are sensitive to the discount rate used.
Managements estimate of the weighted average cost of capital has been used for each cash generating unit.
Sensitivity Following the impairment of goodwill attributable to the Sandwiches cash generating unit in the prior year, as described below, management believes that currently there is no reasonably possible change to the assumptions that would reduce the value in use below the value of the carrying amount for any of the Groups cash generating units.
Assumptions and projections are updated on an annual basis.
Impairment of Sandwiches cash generating unit In the prior year, the Group performed its annual impairment test as at 31 March 2012, in line with the process described above.
The Sandwiches cash generating unit had historically been the most sensitive to a reasonably possible change in assumptions.
The projected cash flows for the year ended 31 March 2012 were updated to reflect the Sandwiches budget for the year ending 31 March 2013, expected future growth rate assumptions of 3 per cent and post year end trading.
Based on these calculations, which gave a value in use below the value of the carrying amount, and on-going economic uncertainty, the Group recognised an impairment loss within administration expenses for goodwill allocated to the Sandwiches cash generating unit of 4,924,000.

Cost includes 1,026,000 2012: 1,001,000 in respect of capitalised interest.
25,000 of interest, which was the whole amount eligible, was capitalised during the year 2012: nil.
The rate used to determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation was 1.53 per cent which is the effective rate of the borrowing used to finance the construction.
The directors believe that the fair value of the property, plant and equipment is not materially different to the net book amounts presented above.
Impairment During the current year the Board took the decision to demolish its mothballed production facility in East Lancashire following considerable investment in increased capacity at other Group locations in preference to utilising these premises as previously planned.
The book value of the property, plant and equipment was 1,836,000.
The fair value, which relates solely to the land, was determined by an independent valuer as 50,000 giving rise to an impairment loss of 1,786,000.
A further 50,000 has been accrued for demolition of the property giving a total income statement impairment charge of 1,836,000.

The principal subsidiary undertakings during the year were: Cranswick Country Foods plc The Sandwich Factory Group Limited registered in Scotland Cranswick Convenience Foods Limited Kingston Foods Lim ited 100 per cent owned by Cranswick Convenience Foods Limited Except where otherwise stated, each of the companies is registered in England and Wales and Cranswick plc holds directly 100 per cent of the shares and voting rights of each subsidiary undertaking.
In April 2009 the Group disposed of its Pet and Aquatics segment retaining a 5.5 per cent share of both businesses.
Following a subsequent reorganisation of the Pet and Aquatics businesses, Cranswick plc sold its 5.5 per cent investment in the Pet Products business on 5 April 2012 for a consideration of 221,000.
At 31 March 2012, as a result of the sale, the investment was transferred to assets held for sale.
The consideration for the sale was received in cash in the current year.
The transaction resulted in the Group retaining its 5.5 per cent interest in the Aquatics business, this interest has since reduced to a 3.3 per cent holding of TMC 2012 Limited following a further reorganisation and change in major shareholders.
The investment, being an unquoted entity, the value of which cannot be reliably measured, is held at a carrying value of nil.

Acquisition On 29 June 2012, the Group acquired 100 per cent of the issued share capital of Kingston Foods Limited for a total consideration of 8.9 million.
The principal activity of Kingston Foods Limited is the manufacture and distribution of cooked meat and poultry products and the acquisition is expected to enlarge the customer base of the Group.
Fair values of the net assets at the date of acquisition were as follows: Fair value 000 Net assets acquired: Customer relationships 795 Property, plant and equipment 682 Inventories 433 Trade receivables 1,743 Bank and cash balances 1,857 Trade payables 1,615 Provisions 187 Corporation tax liability 97 Deferred tax liability 200 3,411 Goodwill arising on acquisition 5,488 Total consideration 8,899 Satisfied by: Cash 7,843 Contingent consideration 1,056 8,899 Analysis of cash flows on acquisition: Included within cash flows from investing activities Cash consideration paid 7,843 Cash and cash equivalents acquired 1,857 5,986 Included within net cash from operating activities Transaction costs of the acquisition 145 Net cash outflow arising on acquisition 6,131 From the date of acquisition, the acquired business has contributed 11.6 million of revenue and a net profit after tax of 0.7 million to the Group.
If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the period, the Groups profit after tax for the year would have been 36.6 million and revenues would have been 879.2 million.
Included in the 5,488,000 of goodwill recognised above, are certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated from the acquiree and reliably measured due to their nature.
These items include the expected value of synergies and an assembled workforce.
Transaction costs of 145,000 have been expensed and are included in administration expenses.
Contingent Consideration The agreement includes contingent consideration payable in cash to the previous owners of Kingston Foods Limited based on the performance of the business over a 3 year period from acquisition.
The amount payable will be between nil and 2.5 million dependent on the average EBITDA of the business during the 3 year period versus an agreed target level.
The fair value of the contingent consideration at 31 March 2013 was estimated at 1,121,000, discounted in the table above.
Investment in associate Group The Group treated its 49 per cent shareholding in Farmers Boy Deeside Limited, over which it had significant influence, as an associate and accounted for it using the equity method, initially recognising the associate at its fair value.
On 30 March 2012 the Group sold its shareholding in Farmers Boy Deeside Limited to the majority shareholder.
Details of the assets disposed and the consideration received are as follows: 2012 000 Book value of associate 5,079 Book value of put option in relation to associate 1,167 Total book value of assets disposed 6,246 Consideration received in cash 14,500 Profit on disposal of associate 8,254 The following table illustrates the summarised financial information of the Groups investment in Farmers Boy Deeside Limited to the date of disposal in the prior year: 2012 000 Share of the associates results: Revenue 42,821 Loss for the period 712 16.

The Groups financial liabilities include sterling denominated overdraft balances of 66,000 2012: 1,312,000 and euro 483,000 2012: nil, all of which are held in the UK.
The proportion of the Groups net assets denominated in foreign currencies is immaterial.
The Groups other financial assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling.
Credit risk The Group makes a significant proportion of its sales to the major UK supermarket groups, which correspondingly represent a significant proportion of the Groups trade receivables at any one time.
Based on the financial strength of these customers, the Directors do not consider that the Group faces a significant credit risk in this regard.
Debts with other customers, which represent a smaller proportion of the Groups trade receivables, are considered to provide greater risk, particularly in the current economic climate.
These debts are reviewed on a regular basis by credit controllers and senior management and prudent provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full.
80 | Cranswick plc Report & Accounts 2013 Corporate Responsibility Financial Statements Shareholder Information Business Review Governance All cash financial assets are held by UK financial institutions.
The maximum credit exposure relating to financial assets is represented by their carrying values as at the balance sheet date.
Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
The Groups forward currency contracts are measured using Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The Groups 3.3 per cent 2012: 5.5 per cent retained shareholding in the Aquatics business TMC 2012 Limited would have been classified as level 3, however as the investment is an unquoted entity and cannot be reliably measured the Directors consider that its value is immaterial and no fair value has been applied.
Fair value of financial instruments Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties on an arms length basis.
The fair value of floating rate assets and liabilities is estimated to be equivalent to book value.
All derivative financial instruments are shown in the balance sheet at fair value.

Financial instruments continued Hedges Financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are held at fair value in the balance sheet.
The Group hedges the following cash flows: i Forward contracts to hedge expected future purchases The Group hedges a proportion of its near-term expected purchases denominated in overseas currencies.
Where these hedges meet the hedge criteria of IAS 39 changes in fair value are posted directly to other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified through the income statement at the time that the hedged item affects profit or loss.

The Company does not hold any forward contracts.
Interest rate risk The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
There is no material impact on the Groups equity.

Share-based payments The Group operates three share option schemes, a Revenue approved scheme SAYE, an unapproved scheme Executive Share Option and a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, all of which are equity settled.
The total expense charged to the income statement during the year in relation to share-based payments was 1,162,000 2012: 1,501,000.
Executive Share Option Scheme Share options are granted periodically to promote the involvement of senior management in the longer term success of the Group.
Options can only be exercised if certain performance conditions are met by the Group.
These conditions are based on Total Shareholder Return over the performance period and require the Group to be in the top half of a basket of food companies quoted on the London Stock Exchange selected by the remuneration Committee.
Options have a contractual life of ten years, being the maximum term.
Directors may also apply for SAYE options on the same terms as apply to all other employees.

The initial fair value of LTIP options is adjusted to take into account market-based performance conditions.
Pension schemes Defined benefit pension scheme The Group acquired a defined benefit final salary pension scheme during 2009, which is funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
The scheme was closed to new members and future accrual on 30 June 2004.
Pension costs are determined with the advice of an independent qualified actuary on the basis of a triennial valuation using the projected unit credit method.
The latest available formal actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 1 January 2010.
This valuation was updated to the year end.
Plan assets are stated at fair value at the respective balance sheet dates and overall expected rates of return are established by applying published brokers forecasts to each category of scheme assets.

A 0.1 per cent decrease in the discount rate would give rise to a 6,000 increase in the amounts charged to the income statement during the year, and a 530,000 increase in the deficit at 31 March 2013.
The scheme rules require the pension benefits to be uplifted by Retail Price Index RPI, so there was no financial effect from the statutory requirement to uplift pension benefits by Consumer Price index CPI rather than RPI.
