Financial Statements Notes to the Company Financial Statements C1 Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the EU, IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to those companies reporting under IFRSs.
Accounting policies have been consistently applied throughout the current and preceding periods.
Historically, the Company has prepared its financial statements to the Saturday closest to its accounting reference date of 30 April, meaning that financial periods have been for 52 week periods and occasionally 53 week periods.
For 2012 13, the Company has drawn up its accounts to 30 April 2013 and future accounting periods will also end on 30 April.
After making due enquiry, on the basis of current financial projections, the directors are satisfied that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The Companys accounting policies in relation to operating leases, share-based payments, translation of foreign currencies, property, plant & equipment, taxation and derivative financial instruments are set out in note 1 to the Group Financial Statements.
Other accounting policies which are specific to the Company are set out below.
a Share-based payments Where the Company has granted rights to its equity to employees of subsidiary undertakings in relation to equity-settled, sharebased payment arrangements the contribution to the subsidiary undertakings is recognised as an additional investment.
b Investments Investments are stated at cost, less any provision for impairment in value.
c Post-retirement benefits It is not practical to allocate the underlying assets and liabilities of the defined benefit section of the pension scheme to the Company on a consistent and reasonable basis.
The Company has therefore accounted for its contributions to the defined benefit section of the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
The Companys contributions to the defined contribution section of the pension scheme are charged to the income statement on an accruals basis as they become payable.

C12 Post-retirement benefits The Company maintains a pension scheme for eligible employees in the UK comprising both a defined benefit and defined contribution section.
The defined benefit section is a funded scheme with assets held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The scheme is valued by a qualified actuary at least every three years and contributions are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries so as to spread the pension cost over the normal expected service lives of members.
Since 1 September 2002, the defined benefit section of the scheme has been closed to new entrants and on 30 April 2010 was closed to future accrual with automatic entry into the defined contribution section being offered to those active members of the defined benefit section at that time.
Membership of the defined contribution section is offered to all eligible employees.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was last carried out as at 31 March 2010 and showed a shortfall of assets compared with liabilities of 239.0 million.
A recovery plan based on this valuation has been agreed with the trustee and commenced in 2010 11 with special contributions of 12.0 million, which rose to 16.0 million and 20.0 million in 2011 12 and 2012 13 respectively.
Contributions will remain at 20.0 million for 2013 14 and will rise approximately annually thereafter to 35.0 million by 2020 21.
The next triennial valuation has commenced and will be as at 31 March 2013.
At 31 March 2010, the market value of the schemes investments was 672.0 million and, based on the above assumptions, the value of the assets was sufficient to cover 74% of the benefits accrued to members with the liabilities amounting to 911.0 million.
The valuation of the defined benefit section for the purposes of IAS 19 showed a gross pension deficit before deferred tax of 406.4 million 2012 261.9 million and 2011 244.0 million.
Further particulars of the scheme are disclosed in note 21 to the Group Financial Statements.

The categories of financial assets and liabilities and their related accounting policy are set out in notes 1.11 and 1.15 to the Group Financial Statements.

Further details on the Companys interest rate swaps are included in note 22 d to the Group Financial Statements.
c Hedging activities The Company has previously managed exposures that arise on interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps.

d Interest rate profile of financial assets and financial liabilities by currency The following table sets out the interest rate exposure of the financial assets and liabilities of the Company: 2013 2012 2011 Sterling Sterling Sterling million million million Cash and cash equivalents: Floating rate 28.4 72.9 10.3 Fixed rate 133.0 161.4 72.9 10.3 Borrowings: Floating rate 86.5 336.1 461.8 Fixed rate 245.4 60.0 60.9 331.9 396.1 522.7 Net debt 170.5 323.2 512.4 Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
Floating rate cash and cash equivalents relate to money market deposits as shown in note C6.
Fixed rate borrowings comprise the 2015 Notes and the 2017 Notes 2012 and 2011 the unhedged part of the 2012 Bonds and the 2015 Notes.
Floating rate borrowings include bank overdrafts, fixed rate bonds notes after taking into account the effect of interest rates swaps entered into by the Company and drawings under the Amended Facility 2012 and 2011 the 360 million Facility.
The weighted average effective interest rate on bank overdrafts approximated 1.5% 2011 12 1.5%.
Further details on fixed and floating rate borrowings are shown in notes 17 and 22 to the Group Financial Statements.
e Sensitivity analysis The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, shows the sensitivity of profit before tax and total equity to changes in interest rates on derivative financial instruments and certain monetary items.
The sensitivity analysis reflects the position as at 30 April 2013 and 28 April 2012 respectively, and is not necessarily representative of actual or future outcomes.
Changes in interest rates affect the Companys loss before tax, mainly due to the impact of floating rate borrowings, cash and derivative financial instruments.
The Companys principal floating rate interest rate exposures are based on LIBOR.
The following sensitivity analysis shows a reasonably possible change in interest rates uniform across all currencies, with other variables held constant and the corresponding decrease would have an equal and opposite effect.
A 1% increase in interest rates would have a negative effect on profit before tax and equity of 3.2 million 2011 12 a 6.1 million negative effect on profit before tax and equity.
Assumptions used in calculating the sensitivity analysis are set out in note 22 e to the Group Financial Statements.
