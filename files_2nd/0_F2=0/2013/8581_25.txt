The Groups pension schemes Keeping it simple...
Under defined contribution schemes, the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate fund on behalf of the employee and has no further obligations to employees.
The risks and rewards associated with this type of scheme are assumed by the members rather than the Group.
It is the members responsibility to make investment decisions relating to their retirement benefits.
In a defined benefit scheme, members receive cash payments at and in retirement, the value of which is dependent on factors such as salary and length of service.
The Group underwrites investment, mortality and inflation risks necessary to meet these obligations.
In the event of poor returns the Group needs to address this through a combination of increased levels of contribution or by making adjustments to the schemes.
Schemes can be funded, where regular cash contributions are made by the employer into a fund which is invested, or unfunded, where no regular money or assets are required to be put aside to cover future payments.
The Group makes contributions to the ITV Pension Scheme, a separate trustee-administered fund that is not consolidated in these financial statements, but is reflected on the defined benefit pension deficit line on the statement of financial position.
It is the responsibility of the Trustee to manage and invest the assets of the schemes and to monitor the schemes funding position.
The Trustee is required to act in the best interest of the members.
The appointment of trustees is determined by the schemes documentation.
In the unfunded scheme the Group is responsible for meeting pension obligations as they fall due.

Total defined benefit scheme obligations Keeping it simple...
The defined benefit obligation the pension scheme liabilities may change due to the following: Current service cost the cost to the Group of benefits arising in the future which are attibutable to the members service in the current period.
This is charged to operating costs in the income statement.
Past service cost refers to the cost or credit as a result of changes in the benefits offered to members or a reduction in the number of employees covered by the scheme.
This is recognised through operating costs in the income statement.
Settlement gains losses these occur when the Group enters into a transaction to eliminate all further legal or constructive obligations for some or all of the benefits provided by the schemes.
Settlement gains or losses can arise from the transfer of member benefits into alternative pension arrangements, fully insuring benefits or on business disposals.
Increase due to interest cost future pension obligations are stated in present value, in that a discount factor is used to state the current worth of a future cost.
This interest cost is the unwinding of the discount on the present value of the obligation.
Broadly, it is determined by multiplying the discount rate at the beginning of the period by the present value of the obligation during the period.
This is recognised through net financing costs in the income statement.
Actuarial losses gains in order to value the Groups defined benefit obligation at the end of a period, it is necessary to apply certain assumptions in relation to demographic and financial trends.
Where there is a difference between previous estimates and actual experience, or a change to assumptions, this will give rise to actuarial gains or losses, which are recognised through other comprehensive income Benefits paid any benefits paid out by the schemes will lower the obligations of those schemes.

The inflation assumption has been set by looking at the When deciding on these assumptions the Group difference between the yields on fixed and index-linked takes independent actuarial advice relating to the Government bonds, also differentiating between past and appropriateness of the assumptions.
The inflation assumption is used as a basis for the remaining financial assumptions, except where inflation caps have been implemented.
Both the discount rate and the inflation assumption have been selected by considering yields taken from yield curves at terms, and weighted by cash flows, consistent with the pension obligations.
The yield curves are constructed by our actuarial advisers from the yields available on relevant AA rated corporate bonds for the discount rate and fixed and index-linked Government bonds for the inflation assumption.

The Pension scheme holds assets across a number of different classes, these being equities, bonds and other investments.
These assets are managed by the Trustee, although the Trustee is required to consult with the Group on changes to their investment policy.
Financial instruments are in place which provide protection against changes in market factors interest rates and inflation which could act to increase the pension deficit.
In 2011 the scheme obtained protection against the effect of increases in the life expectation of the majority of pensioner members by transacting a longevity swap.
Under the swap, the Trustees of the Scheme agreed to make predetermined payments in return for payments to meet the specified pension obligations as they fall due, irrespective of how long the members and their dependants live.
The difference in the present values of these two streams of payments is reflected in scheme assets.
In prior periods, the present value as at the year end was calculated using the same assumptions applied to the defined benefit obligation.
However, the introduction of IFRS 13 in the year means that the Group must now value the swap under market-based assumptions, which represents a change from previous best estimates.
This results in a nil valuation of the swap at inception, subsequently adjusted for changes in the market life expectancy and market discount rates.
Pension scheme assets are measured at their fair value and can change due to the following: The investment income on scheme assets is determined based on the discount rate at the beginning of the year and calculated as the expected percentage return multiplied by the fair value of the scheme assets.
Remeasurement gains and losses arise from differences between the actual and expected final asset values and are recognised through other comprehensive income.
A deduction from scheme assets is made for scheme administration expenses, which are recognised through operating costs in the income statement.
Employers contributions and cash contributions by scheme participants are paid into the schemes to be managed and invested.
Any benefits paid out by the schemes will reduce the value of the schemes assets.
Movements in the value of the longevity swap.
The value of the longevity swap is sensitive to changes in the discount rate or market life expectancy and movements are recognised as a remeasurement gain or loss in other comprehensive income.
