Pension commitments Defined contribution: The Company participates in the defined contribution scheme of The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan.
This scheme is not contracted out of the State Second Pension Scheme and is open to new entrants.
The expense recognised in these accounts for the year is 0.2m 2012: 0.2m, being the contributions paid and payable.
Defined benefit: The Company participates in a scheme which is part of The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company in an independently administered fund.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 March 2009 and was updated by Towers Watson Limited to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 29 June 2013 and 30 June 2012.
The contributions paid to the scheme are paid in line with the schedule of contributions, being 16.4% and 14.3% of pensionable salaries paid to upper and lower tier sections respectively.
The defined benefit scheme is effectively closed to new entrants, however existing members continue to build up further Final Salary benefits.
In June 2013, the Group commenced a formal 60-day consultation process with existing members and their representatives to close the defined benefit section to future accrual and to offer members the opportunity to join the defined contribution section instead.
At the time of writing this report, the Group was still considering the feedback it had received during the consultation period before reaching a final decision.
The scheme is a multi-employer scheme and, in accordance with FRS 17, the Company has accounted for its contributions to the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme because it is not possible to identify the Companys share of the net assets and liabilities in the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis due to the high volume of members pensioners and the historic interaction between Group companies.
