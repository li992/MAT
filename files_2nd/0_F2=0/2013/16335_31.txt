3Pi is a bolt-on acquisition to Ultras existing Tactical & Sonar Systems division, with which there are a significant number of internal and external synergies.
The fair values of the net assets are currently being calculated and have not been finalised due to the proximity of the acquisition to the publication of the 2013 financial statements.
The proximity to the financial statements publication also makes it impractical to disclose any further information with respect to this acquisition.
Full disclosure will be made in the next published financial statements.
35 Contingent liabilities The Group has entered into a number of guarantee and performance bond arrangements in the normal course of business totalling 62.6m 2012: 57.4m.
Provision is made for any amounts that the Directors consider may become payable under such arrangements, the provision as at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 was nil.
The nature of much of the contracting work performed by the Group means that there are occasional contractual issues, variations and renegotiations that arise in the ordinary course of business.
The Group is, from time to time, party to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
The Directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings, actions and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.
36 Prior period restatement IAS 19 revised 2011 has impacted the accounting for the Groups defined benefit pension scheme by i replacing the interest cost and expected return on plan assets with a net interest charge on the net defined benefit liability, and ii reclassifying administration costs of the defined benefit scheme from finance costs to administration expenses.
There is no change to the net pension liability or to net assets as a result of the change.
The comparative profit and loss account has been restated for the year ended 31 December 2012: the effect of adopting IAS 19 revised 2011 is to reduce previously reported profit before tax by 3.0m.
Subsequent to the adoption of IAS19 revised 2011, the Group has also elected to disclose the finance expense on the net defined benefit pension liability as a specific adjusting item within the calculation of underlying profit before tax as set out in note 2.
Consequently, the comparative figure has been restated for the year ended 31 December 2012 and previously reported underlying profit before tax has increased by 0.9m.
