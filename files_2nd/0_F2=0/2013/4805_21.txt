Diploma PLC 74 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 September 2013 1.
General Information Diploma PLC is a public limited company registered and domiciled in England and Wales and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The address of the registered office is 12 Charterhouse Square, London, EC1M 6AX.
The consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and were authorised by the Directors for publication on 18 November 2013.
These statements are presented in UK sterling, with all values rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand, except where otherwise indicated.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as adopted by the European Union, and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, as applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements of the Parent Company, Diploma PLC, have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP, and are set out in a separate section of the Annual Report & Accounts on pages 98 and 99.
Alternative Performance Measures The Group uses a number of alternative non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice non-GAAP financial measures which are not defined within IFRS.
The Directors use these measures in order to assess the underlying operational performance of the Group and as such, these measures are important and should be considered alongside the IFRS measures.
The following non-GAAP measures are referred to in this Annual Report & Accounts.
2.1 Adjusted operating profit At the foot of the Consolidated Income Statement, adjusted operating profit is defined as operating profit before amortisation and impairment of acquisition intangible assets, acquisition expenses and adjustments to deferred consideration collectively, acquisition related charges.
The Directors believe that adjusted operating profit is an important measure of the underlying operational performance of the Group.
2.2 Adjusted profit before tax At the foot of the Consolidated Income Statement, adjusted profit before tax is separately disclosed, being defined as profit before tax and before the costs of restructuring or rationalisation of operations, the profit or loss relating to the sale of businesses or property, fair value remeasurements under IAS 39 in respect of future purchases of minority interests and acquisition related charges.
The Directors believe that adjusted profit before tax is an important measure of the underlying performance of the Group.
2.3 Adjusted earnings per share Adjusted earnings per share is calculated as the total of adjusted profit before tax, less income tax costs, but excluding the tax impact on the items included in the calculation of adjusted profit and the tax effects of goodwill in overseas jurisdictions, less profit attributable to minority interests, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The Directors believe that adjusted earnings per share provides an important measure of the underlying earning capacity of the Group.
2.4 Free cash flow At the foot of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, free cash flow is reported, being defined as net cash flow from operating activities, after net capital expenditure on fixed assets and including proceeds received from business disposals, but before expenditure on business combinations investments and dividends paid to both minority shareholders and the Companys shareholders.
The Directors believe that free cash flow gives an important measure of the cash flow of the Group, available for future investment.
2.5 Trading capital employed In the segment analysis in note 3, trading capital employed is reported, being defined as net assets less cash and cash equivalents and after adding back borrowings, retirement benefit obligations, deferred tax, amounts in respect of future purchases of minority interests and adjusting for goodwill in respect of the recognition of deferred tax on acquisition intangible assets.
Return on trading capital employed is defined as the adjusted operating profit, divided by trading capital employed plus all historical goodwill and adjusted for the timing effect of major acquisitions and disposals.
Return on trading capital employed at the sector level does not include historical goodwill.
The Directors believe that return on trading capital employed is an important measure of the underlying performance of the Group.
3. Business Segment Analysis For management reporting purposes, the Group is organised into three main business segments: Life Sciences, Seals and Controls.
These segments form the basis of the primary reporting format disclosures below.
The principal activities of each of these segments is described in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 37.
Segment revenue represents revenue from external customers: there is no intersegment revenue.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment, as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Segment assets exclude cash and cash equivalents, deferred tax assets and corporate assets that cannot be allocated on a reasonable basis to a business segment.
Segment liabilities exclude borrowings, retirement benefit obligations, deferred tax liabilities and corporate liabilities that cannot be allocated on a reasonable basis to a business segment.
These items are shown collectively in the following analysis as unallocated assets and unallocated liabilities, respectively.
The comparatives have not been restated as these amounts are not material to the consolidated financial statements.

The fair value of services provided as consideration for part of the grant of the LTIP awards has been based on a predicted future value model and was0.2m 2012: 0.3m.
Group staff costs, including Directors emoluments, were as follows: 2013 2012 m m Wages and salaries 47.5 42.8 Social security costs 5.3 3.8 Pension costs defined contribution 1.5 1.1 Share-based payments 0.5 0.8 54.8 48.5 The average number of employees, including Executive Directors, during the year were: 2013 2012 Number Number Life Sciences 319 270 Seals 513 489 Controls 300 292 Corporate 13 11 Number of employees average 1,145 1,062 Number of employees year end 1,159 1,117 6.

Tax Expense 2013 2012 m m Current tax The tax charge is based on the profit for the year and comprises: UK corporation tax 2.7 3.3 Overseas tax 12.1 11.8 14.8 15.1 Adjustments in respect of prior year: Overseas tax 0.3 0.1 Total current tax 14.5 15.0 Deferred tax The net deferred tax credit based on the origination and reversal of timing differences comprises: United Kingdom 0.1 0.1 Overseas 0.9 0.5 Total deferred tax 0.8 0.6 Total tax on profit for the year 13.7 14.4 In addition to the above credit for deferred tax included in the Consolidated Income Statement, deferred tax relating to the retirement benefit scheme and cash flow hedges of 0.1m 2012: 0.3m was credited directly to the Consolidated Statement of Income and Other Comprehensive Income.
A further 0.6m 2012: 0.6m was credited to equity which relates to share-based payments made during the year.
This represented a current tax credit of 1.3m 2012: nil less a deferred tax debit of 0.7m 2012: 0.6m credit.
Factors affecting the tax charge for the year: The difference between the total tax charge calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax to the profit before tax and the amounts set out above is as follows: 2013 2012 m m Profit before tax 48.5 46.0 Tax on profit at UK effective corporation tax rate of 23.5% 2012: 25% 11.4 11.5 Effects of: change in UK tax rates 0.2 0.2 higher tax rates on overseas earnings 2.5 2.7 adjustments to tax charge in respect of previous years 0.3 0.1 other permanent differences 0.1 0.1 Total tax on profit for the year 13.7 14.4 The Group earns its profits in the UK and overseas.
The UK corporation tax rate was reduced from 24% to 23% on 31 March 2013: however as the Group prepares its consolidated financial statements for the year to 30 September, the effective tax rate for UK corporation tax in respect of the year ended 30 September 2013 was 23.5% 2012: 25% and this rate has been used for tax on profit in the above reconciliation.
The Groups net overseas tax rate is higher than that in the UK, primarily because the profits earned in the US are taxed at rates of up to 38%.
Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 23% to 21% effective from 1 April 2014 and a further reduction to 20% effective from 1April 2015 were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013.
These reductions in the UK corporation tax rate are likely to lead to a further reduction in the future UK current tax charge.
The UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at 30 September 2013 have been calculated based on the rate of 20% substantively enacted at 30 September 2013.

The total dividend for the current year, subject to approval of the final dividend, will be 15.7p per share 2012: 14.4p.
The Diploma Employee Benefit Trust holds 586,887 2012: 962,337 shares, which are not eligible for dividends.

Earnings Per Share Basic and diluted earnings per share Basic and diluted earnings per ordinary 5p share are calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 112,454,287 2012: 112,373,327 and the profit for the year attributable to shareholders of 34.5m 2012: 31.3m.
Thereare no potentially dilutive shares.
Adjusted earnings per share Adjusted earnings per share, which is defined in note 2, is calculated as follows: 2013 2012 pence pence 2013 2012 per share per share m m Profit before tax 48.5 46.0 Tax expense 13.7 14.4 Minority interests 0.3 0.3 Earnings for the year attributable to shareholders of the Company 30.7 27.9 34.5 31.3 Acquisition related charges 4.9 5.6 5.6 6.4 Fair value remeasurement of put options 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 Tax effects on goodwill, acquisition intangible assets and fair value remeasurements 1.0 0.6 1.1 0.7 Adjusted earnings 34.8 33.1 39.2 37.2 10.
Goodwill Life Sciences Seals Controls Total m m m m At 1 October 2011 45.3 14.2 14.9 74.4 Acquisitions 1.5 3.0 1.1 5.6 Exchange adjustments 0.8 0.7 0.3 0.2 At 30 September 2012 47.6 16.5 15.7 79.8 Transfers 1.9 1.9 Acquisitions note 22 0.5 0.5 Exchange adjustments 2.2 0.1 0.3 1.8 At 30 September 2013 47.3 16.6 14.6 78.5 The Directors carry out an impairment test on all goodwill generally twice a year.
Goodwill is ascribed to a business which, for the purpose of these impairment tests, is referred to as a cash generating unit.
The impairment test requires each cash generating unit to prepare value in use valuations using discounted cash flow forecasts.
The cash flow forecasts are based on a combination of annual budgets prepared by each business and on the Groups five year strategic plan.
The key assumptions used to prepare the cash flow forecasts relate to gross margin, growth rates and discount rates.
The gross margins are assumed to remain sustainable, which is supported by historical experience: growth rates generally approximate to the long term average rates for the markets in which the business operates, unless there are particular factors relevant to a business, such as start-ups.
The annual growth rates used in the cash flow forecasts in respect of the next five years vary between 2% and 5% in each of the Sectors: these annual growth rates then trend down towards 2% over the longer term.
The cash flow forecasts are discounted to determine a current valuation using a pre-tax discount rate of ca.
This rate is based on the characteristics of lower risk, non-technically driven, distribution businesses with robust capital structures, which is broadly consistent with each of the Groups businesses.
Based on the criteria set out above, no impairment in the value of goodwill was identified.
The Directors have also carried out sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions to determine whether a reasonably possible change in any of these assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill.
This analysis indicates that a reasonably possible change in these key assumptions would be unlikely to give rise to an impairment charge to goodwill in any of the businesses in the Life Sciences or Controls Sectors.
However, in the Seals Sector a reduction of 2% in revenue growth in the medium term in one of the businesses in this Sector would result in an impairment charge of up to 0.8m.
Before any sensitivities and based on the original assumptions in respect ofthis business in the Seals Sector, the headroom in the cashflow valuation was 1.0m.
In the prior year, the sensitivity analysis indicated that a reduction of 2% in revenue growth in the medium term in a business in the Controls Sector would have resulted in an impairment of0.3m.
This business is no longer at risk of impairment in 2013.

Financial Instruments The Groups principal financial instruments, other than a limited number of forward foreign currency contracts, comprise cash and short term deposits, investments, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables, borrowings and other liabilities.
Trade and other receivables and trade and other payables arise directly from the Groups day-to-day operations.
The financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of credit, liquidity, foreign currency, interest rate and capital management.
An explanation of each of these risks, how the Group manages these risks and an analysis of sensitivities is set out below and on page 35 within Principal Risks and Uncertainties, which has been audited.
a Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations: this arises principally from the Groups trade and other receivables from customers and from cash balances including deposits held with financial institutions.
The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government backed agencies and large public and private wholesalers, to small privately owned businesses and the underlying local economic risks vary throughout the world.
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the customer.
The Group establishes a provision for impairment that represents its estimate of potential losses in respect of specific trade and other receivables where it is deemed that a receivable may not be recoverable.
When the receivable is deemed irrecoverable, the provision is written off against the underlying receivable.
The Group has not had any material irrecoverable trade receivables in the past five years.
Exposure to financial counterparty credit risk is controlled by the Group treasury team in establishing and monitoring counterparty limits.
Centrally managed funds are invested entirely with counterparties whose credit rating is AA or better.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk was as follows: Carrying amount 2013 2012 m m Trade receivables 39.5 37.0 Other receivables 1.5 1.9 Cash and cash equivalents 19.3 11.4 60.3 50.3 There is no material difference between the book value of the financial assets and their fair value at each reporting date.
An analysis of the ageing and currency of trade receivables and the associated provision for impairment is set out in note 16.
An analysis of cash and cash equivalents is set out in note 18.
Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013 Financial Statements 83 19.
Financial Instruments continued b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group continually monitors net funds and forecast cash flows to ensure that sufficient resources are available to meet the Groups requirements in the short, medium and long term.
Additionally, compliance with debt covenants are monitored regularly and during 2013 all covenants have been complied with fully.
The Group is highly cash generative and uses monthly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements and to optimise its return on deposits.
Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on hand to meet foreseeable operational expenses, but the Group also has a committed 20m revolving bank facility with an option to increase its facility to 40m, subject to market pricing which expires on 30 June 2014.
Interest on this facility is payable at between 150 and 195 bps over LIBOR, depending on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
At 30 September 2013, none of the facility had been drawn down 2012: 3.5m.
The undrawn committed facilities available at 30 September are as follows: 2013 2012 m m Expiring within one year 20.0 Expiring after one year but within two years 16.5 The Groups financial liabilities are as follows: Carrying amount 2013 2012 m m Trade payables 23.2 20.5 Other payables 1.5 3.1 Other liabilities 3.0 3.8 Borrowings 3.5 27.7 30.9 The maturities of the undiscounted financial liabilities are as follows: Less than one year 26.8 26.4 One-two years 1.1 3.5 Two-five years 1.2 27.9 31.1 Less: Discount 0.2 0.2 27.7 30.9 There is no material difference between the book value of these financial liabilities and their fair value at each reporting date.
c Currency risk The Groups currency risk comprises translational and transactional risk from its exposure to movements in US dollars, Canadian dollars, Euros and Australian dollars.
The transactional exposure arises on trade receivables, trade payables and cash and cash equivalents and these balances are analysed by currency in notes 16, 17 and 18, respectively.
Net foreign exchange gains of 0.1m 2012: 0.1m losses were recognised in operating profit for the year.
The Group holds forward foreign exchange contracts in certain of the Groups businesses to hedge forecast transactional exposure to movements in the US dollar, Canadian dollar and Euro.
These forward foreign exchange contracts are classified as cash flow hedges and are stated at fair value.
The notional value of forward contracts as at 30 September 2013 was 15.4m 2012: 13.4m.
The net fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts used as hedges at 30 September 2013 was negligible 2012: 0.3m liability.
The amount removed from Other Comprehensive Income and taken to the Consolidated Income Statement in cost of sales during the year was 0.2m debit 2012: 0.5m debit.
The change in the fair value of cash flow hedges taken to Other Comprehensive Income during the year was negligible 2012: 0.4m debit.
The currency risk arising from both translational and transactional risks are described further on page 35 within Principal Risks and Uncertainties.
d Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will affect the Groups results.
The Groups interest rate risk arises primarily from its cash funds and borrowings.
The Group does not undertake any hedging of interest rates.
All cash deposits, held in the UK and overseas, are held on a short term basis at floating rates or overnight rates, based on the relevant UK Base Rate, or equivalent rate.
Surplus funds are deposited with commercial banks that meet the credit criteria approved by the Board, for periods of between one to six months at rates that are generally fixed by reference to the relevant UK Base Rate, or equivalent rate.
An increase of 1% in interest rates would not have a significant impact on the Groups adjusted profit before tax.
An analysis of cash and cash equivalents at the reporting dates is set out in note 18.
Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013 Diploma PLC 84 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the year ended 30 September 2013 19.
Financial Instruments continued e Fair values There are no material differences between the book value of financial assets and liabilities and their fair value.
The basis for determining fair values are as follows: Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are valued at year end spot rates adjusted for the forward points to the contracts value date, and gains and losses taken to equity.
No contracts value date is greater than 12 months from the year end.
Trade and other receivables payables As the majority of receivables payables have a remaining life of less than one year, the book value is deemed to reflect the fair value.
Other liabilities The carrying amount represents a discounted value of the expected liability which is deemed to reflect the fair value.
f Capital management risk The Groups policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, supplier and market confidence and to provide strong returns to shareholders which will support the future development of the business.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents, short term debt which includes bank borrowings and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings.
