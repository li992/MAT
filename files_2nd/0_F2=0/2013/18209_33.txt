Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amount ofassets andliabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxationpurposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is basedon the expected manner or realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assetsandliabilities, using tax rates enactedor substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset canbeutilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
e Share-based payments The cost of granting share options and other share-based remuneration to employees and directors is recognised through the profit and loss account.
