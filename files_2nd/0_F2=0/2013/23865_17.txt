Fidelity European Values PLC Annual Report 2013 42 FINANCIAL Notes to the Financial Statements 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Company has prepared its financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice: Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts SORP issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC, in January 2009. a Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of fixed asset investments and derivative assets and liabilities, and on the assumption that approval as an investment trust continues to be granted by HM Revenue & Customs.
b Income Income from equity investments is credited to the Income Statement on the date on which the right to receive the payment is established.
Overseas dividends are stated gross of withholding tax.
UK dividends are stated at the amount actually receivable, which is net of the attaching tax credit.
Interest receivable on short term deposits is credited on an accruals basis.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of the dividend foregone is recognised in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the dividend foregone is recognised in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Derivative income from dividends on long contracts for difference CFDs is included in Income and recognised in the revenue column of the IncomeStatement.
c Special dividends Special dividends are treated as a revenue receipt or a capital receipt depending on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged in full to the revenue column of the Income Statement with the exception of any performance fee which is charged wholly to the capital column, as it arises mainly from capital returns on the portfolio.
e Taxation Irrecoverable overseas withholding tax suffered is recognised at the same time as the income to which it relates.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the Balance Sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred.
A deferred taxation asset is recognised when it is more likely than not that the asset will be recoverable.
f Foreign currency The Directors, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its investors operate, have determined the functional currency to be UK sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated to UK sterling at the rate of exchange ruling as at the date of those transactions.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the Balance Sheet date.
All capital gains and losses, including exchange differences on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in the capital column of the Income Statement.
g Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the portfolio is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value, which is taken to be their cost, and subsequently the investments are valued at fair value, which is measured as follows: Listed investments are valued at bid prices, or last market prices, depending on the convention of the exchange on which they are listed, or otherwise at fair value based on published price quotations: and Unlisted investments, where there is not an active market, are valued using an appropriate valuation technique so as to establish what the transaction price would have been at the Balance Sheet date.
In accordance with the AIC SORP the Company includes transaction costs, incidental to the purchase or sale of investments, within gains on investments and has disclosed them in Note 9 on page 48.
Fidelity European Values PLC Annual Report 2013 43 FINANCIAL Notes to the Financial Statements 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued h Derivative instruments Some of the Companys exposure to European equities is through the use of long CFDs.
The gearing level is monitored and reviewed by the Board on a regular basis.
CFDs are measured at fair value which is the difference between the settlement price of the contract and the fair value of the underlying shares in the contract, which is calculated in accordance with policy 1 g. Gains and losses in the fair value of the CFDs are included in Gains on derivatives instruments held at fair value through profit or loss in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Income received from dividends on long CFDs is included in Income and interest paid on long CFDs is included in Finance costs, in the revenue column of the IncomeStatement.
i Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund plc The Company holds an investment in the Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund plc Euro Fund theFund.
The Fund invests in low risk short term investments.
It is a distributing fund and accordingly the interest earned within the Fund is treated as income.
j Capital reserve The following are accounted for in capital reserve: Gains and losses on the disposal of investments and derivative instruments: Changes in the fair value of investments and derivative instruments held at the year end: Foreign exchange gains and losses of a capital nature: Performance fees: Dividends receivable which are capital in nature: and Costs of repurchasing ordinary shares.
As a result of technical guidance by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in TECH 02 10: Distributable Profits, changes in the fair value of investments which are readily convertible to cash, without accepting adverse terms at the Balance Sheet date, can be treated as realised.
Capital reserves realised and unrealised are shown in aggregate as capital reserve in the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders Funds and the Balance Sheet.
At the Balance Sheet date all investments held by the Company were listed on a recognised stock exchange and were considered to be readily convertible tocash.
k Dividends In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date, dividends declared and approved by the Company after the Balance Sheet date have not been recognised as a liability of the Company at the Balance Sheet date.

This Note is incorporated in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 29: Financial Instruments: Disclosures FRS 29 and refers to the identification, measurement and management of risks potentially affecting the value of financial instruments.
The Companys financial instruments comprise: Equity shares held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies: Derivative instruments which comprise long CFDs: and Cash, liquid resources and short term debtors and creditors that arise from its operations.
The risks identified by FRS 29 arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk which comprises interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and other price risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk, credit risk and derivative instrument risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised in this Note.
These policies have remained unchanged throughout the reporting period.
MARKET PRICE RISK Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through share capital raised.
In addition, the Company has a geared exposure to European equities through the use of long CFDs which incur funding costs and provide collateral in Euros.
It is, therefore, exposed to a financial risk as a result of increases in Euro interest rates.
Fidelity European Values PLC Annual Report 2013 51 FINANCIAL Notes to the Financial Statements 18 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Interest rate risk profile The extent to which the Companys assets and liabilities are affected by changes in interest rates is shown below: 2013 2012 variable variable interest interest rate rate risk risk 000 000 Exposure to financial instruments that earn interest Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund plc 31 30 Cash at bank 21,326 20,450 21,357 20,480 Exposure to financial instruments that bear interest Gearing through long CFDs 52,706 87,235 Net exposure to financial instruments that bear interest 31,349 66,755 Foreign currency risk The Companys total return and total net assets can be affected by foreign exchange movements because the Company has assets and income which are denominated in currencies other than the Companys base currency, which is UK sterling.
Three principal areas have been identified where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: Movements in rates affecting the value of investments and long CFDs: Movements in rates affecting short term timing differences: and Movements in rates affecting the income received.
The Company does not currently hedge, by the use of derivative instruments, the value of investments, long CFDs and other net assets which are priced in other currencies.
The Company might also be subject to short term exposure from exchange rate movements, for example, between the date when an investment is bought or sold and the date when settlement of the transaction occurs.

It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Board meets quarterly to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objective.
The Manager is responsible for actively monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS RISK The risks and risk management processes which result from the use of derivative instruments are included within the other risk categories disclosed in this Note.
Derivative instruments are used by the Manager to gain unfunded long exposure to equity markets, sectors or single stocks.
Unfunded exposure is exposure gained without an initial outflow of capital.
The risk and performance contribution of these instruments to the Companys portfolio is overseen by a specialist derivative instruments team which draws on over forty years of experience in derivative risk management.
This team uses portfolio risk assessment tools to advise the Manager on portfolio construction.
LIqUIDITY RISK The Companys assets mainly comprise readily realisable securities and long CFDs which can be sold easily to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved by the use of overdraft facilities as required.
Fidelity European Values PLC Annual Report 2013 54 FINANCIAL Notes to the Financial Statements 18 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued COUNTERPARTY RISK All securities and derivative instruments are transacted with brokers and carry the risk that the counterparty to a transaction may not meet its financial obligations.
All counterparties for any type of trading are assessed by an independent Credit Research and Analysis Function.
Exposures to counterparties are monitored and reported frequently.
For the long CFDs, in accordance with terms outlined in the International Swap Dealers Associations ISDA market standard derivative legal contracts, collateral is used to reduce the credit risk exposure for both parties to the transaction.
Collateral is managed and monitored on a daily basis for all relevant transactions.

CREDIT RISK Investments may be adversely affected if any of the institutions with which money is deposited suffer insolvency or other financial difficulties.
All transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers and are settled on a delivery versus payment basis.
Limits are set on the amount that can be due from any one broker.
All security transactions are through brokers which have been approved as an acceptable counterparty.
This is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
At the year end, the exposure to credit risk includes cash at bank, outstanding securities transactions and the fair value of the long CFDs.
RISK SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis If the Companys exposures as at 31 December 2013 to bank balances, amounts held in the Fidelity Institutional LiquidityFund plc, and the long CFDs were held throughout the year, with all other variables remaining constant, then if interest rates had increased by 0.25%, total net assets and total return on ordinary activities would have decreased by 78,000 2012:167,000.
Adecrease in the interest rates by 0.25% would have had an equal but opposite effect.

Investments exposure sensitivity analysis An increase of 10% in the fair value of investments at 31 December 2013 would have increased total net assets and total return on ordinary activities by 66,922,000 2012: 58,394,000.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES As explained in Notes 1 g and 1 h on pages 43 and 44, investments are stated at fair value, which is bid or last market price, and long CFDs are stated at fair value, which is the difference between the settlement price and the value of the underlying shares in the contract.

In the case of cash, book value approximates to fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments.

Classification Input Level 1 Valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets Level 2 Valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 Level 3 Valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in Accounting Policies Notes 1 g and h on pages 43 and 44.
