A reduction in the rate from 24% to 23% effective from 1 April 2013 was substantively enacted on 26 March 2012 and further reductions to 21% effective from 1 April 2014 and 20% effective from 1 April 2015 were substantively enacted, on 3 July 2012 and 17 July 2013 respectively.
The effective tax charge borne by the Company and its UK subsidiaries will reduce accordingly in future years.
All UK deferred tax assets and liabilities that will unwind in the future have been recognised at the rate of 21%.
This is an average rate which has been calculated based on the future rate substantively enacted at the estimated timing of unwinding.
100 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial statements Factors affecting future tax charge The Groups overseas profits are subject to overseas tax rates, some of which are lower than the standard rate of UK corporation tax.
All other deferred tax assets and liabilities at 30 September 2013 have also been calculated based on the rate which will be substantively enacted that is expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability settled.
Future changes in tax rates will also impact deferred tax assets and liabilities.

com 101 Notes to the financial statements continued 11 Earnings per share The calculations of earnings per share are based on the following profits and numbers of shares.
Basic earnings per share figures are calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share figures are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the potentially dilutive shares into ordinary shares.
Underlying earnings per share figures are calculated by adjusting the profit to exclude amortisation of intangible assets and acquisition costs.
The purpose of providing the underlying earnings per share is to allow readers of the accounts to clearly consider trends without the impact of these non-cash items.

The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets are as follows: Group Company 2013 2012 2013 2012 m m m m Investment management 1,029.1 994.1 59.7 60.1 The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined by value-in-use calculations which use five year cash flow projections based on the Groups approved budget for the year to 30 September 2014 and which take into account the market conditions prevailing at the time.
A long-term growth rate is used to extrapolate the cash flows within the value-in-use calculations after the initial five year projections.
The long-term growth rate assumption of 2% is in line with the long-term nature of the Groups business and in line with the Boards view that the Group will operate as a going concern in the long term.
104 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial statements The principal assumptions are: 2013 2012 % % Annual increase in assets under management 6.0 6.0 Annual increase in operating costs 5.5 5.5 The assumed annual increases in operating costs include provision for inflation of salaries and other operating costs, as well as provision for the additional costs associated with the assumed increased levels of business.
There are no changes to assumed management fee margins.
The following discount rates have been used in the impairment analysis.
They are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital using a risk free interest rate, together with a beta for the sector and allied to an equity risk premium.
2013 2013 2012 2012 Post tax Pre tax Post tax Pre tax discount rate discount rate discount rate discount rate % % % % Investment management 9.75 11.40 9.50 11.20 The impairment review included a sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions underpinning the cash flow projections and the rate at which the projections were discounted to arrive at the final value-in-use.
The sensitivity analysis included testing assumptions relating to future revenue growth and the assumptions surrounding the level of operating costs and margins.
The assumptions are derived from past experience and consideration of current market inputs.
The absolute levels, on a standalone basis, of the key assumptions which most closely resulted in a match in the values-in-use to the carrying values of goodwill were: 2013 2012 % % Discount rate pre tax 30.8 27.6 Revenue growth rate 5.7 4.2 Operating cost growth rate 28.0 25.2 The value-in-use, calculated in accordance with the process described above, was compared with the carrying values of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant & equipment.
The comparison resulted in a surplus of value-in-use over the carrying value of these assets as shown in the table below, and therefore no impairment of goodwill has been recognised in the year.
2013 2012 m m Excess of recoverable amount over carrying value 4,242.0 3,163.0 aberdeen-asset.
com 105 Notes to the financial statements continued 12 Intangible assets continued Management contracts and distribution agreements The Group reviewed the management contracts and distribution agreements held at 30 September 2013 including contracts which are considered to have an indefinite life.
Management contracts at 30 September 2013 include 79.3 million 2012: 79.3 million of assets which are considered to have an indefinite life.
These assets comprise contracts for the management of open end funds which have no limit of time or termination provisions.
The Group also reviewed definite life assets for impairment indicators and performed impairment tests where required.
Impairment tests were performed using either value-in-use calculations using methods and assumptions described above in relation to goodwill or estimates of fair value less costs to sell, as considered appropriate, and the measures of value compared with the carrying value of the contracts.
The categories of management contracts and distribution agreements, their carrying amounts at the year end, remaining amortisation periods and estimated useful lives are as follows: 30 September 2013 30 September 2012 Net book Remaining Estimated Net book Remaining Estimated values amortisation useful life values amortisation useful life m period years years m period years years Definite life management contracts 232.9 1-7 2-10 231.4 1-7 2-10 Definite life distribution contracts 12.1 1-3 5 21.1 2-3 5 Indefinite life open end fund contracts 79.3 N A Indefinite 79.3 N A Indefinite 324.3 331.8 The main definite life management contracts held by the Group relate to contracts acquired from Credit Suisse in 2009 which have a net book value of 121.3 million at 30 September 2013, together with the contracts acquired in the current year as part of the Artio and SVG acquisitions which have a combined net book value of 57.6 million at 30 September 2013.
Company impairment review A review of goodwill and management contracts held by the Company was carried out on the same basis as the Group review described above.
There were no indicators of impairment in respect of the management contracts held by the Company.
No impairment of goodwill or management contracts has been recognised in the year.
At 30 September 2013, the Company held indefinite life open end fund contracts with a value of 3.4 million 2012: 3.4 million.
106 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial statements 13 Acquisitions a.
On 21 May 2013, the Group completed the purchase of Artio Global Investors Inc. Artio, a US listed asset manager, for a purchase consideration of 109.8 million $166.5 million.
The acquisition of Artio adds scale to our existing US fixed income business and will complement our organic efforts to expand distribution in the US.
In the four months to 30 September 2013, Artio contributed revenue of 8.5 million and profit before taxation of 4.1 million.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 October 2012, we estimate that consolidated revenues would have been increased by 24.2 million, and consolidated profit before taxation for the year would have been increased by 11.0 million.
This takes into account the post acquisition results.
In determining these amounts, we have assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the acquisition date would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 October 2012.
Acquisition-related costs of 16.3 million were incurred and have been included in exceptional costs.
10.8 million related to severance costs.
On 31 May 2013, the Group acquired 50.1% of the issued share capital of SVG Managers SVG, a fund of private equity specialist, for a cash consideration of 17.5 million plus the contribution of the Groups existing fund of private equity business.
This business has been combined with Aberdeens existing private equity capability to create a substantial private equity fund of funds business with around 5 billion of assets under management.
The Group has a call option to acquire, and SVG Capital plc a put option to sell, the remaining 49.9% stake at any time from the third anniversary of completion, at a price based on a valuation of the business at the time the option is exercised, subject to a minimum of 20 million and a maximum of 35 million.
As the exercise of the put option is outside the control of the Group, the option has been recognised as an other liability measured at fair value and the remaining 49.9% has been recorded as a non-controlling interest.
The fair value of the written put option has been recognised at 27.5 million.
This value is determined based on the expected payment of 35 million and calculated by discounting the expected future liability at a market related discount rate, expected future performance and assuming the option will be exercised after three years.
Acquisition-related costs amount to 2.9 million and have been included in exceptional costs.
These mainly relate to exiting the lease at SVGs previous premises.
SVG contributed 9.0 million revenue and 0.7 million to the Groups profit before taxation for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
If the acquisition of SVG had occurred on 1 October 2012, we estimate that consolidated revenues for the period would have been increased by 25.0 million and consolidated profit before taxation would have been 8.9 million.
c. Acquisition costs The following exceptional acquisition costs were incurred during the year in relation to the two acquisitions described above.
2013 m Redundancy and other severance costs 10.8 Transaction and deal costs 3.5 Lease termination costs 3.9 Other costs 1.0 19.2 aberdeen-asset.
com 107 Notes to the financial statements continued 13 Acquisitions continued d. Independent valuation specialists were engaged to carry out a valuation of the acquired goodwill and intangible assets.
The fair value adjustments from this allocation process are reflected in the table below.
Goodwill is mainly attributable to the skills of the workforce acquired and the synergies expected to be achieved from the acquisition.
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Fair value of the intangible assets has been valued based on the present value of expected cash flows of the underlying management contracts, with the exception of 1.7 million of internally developed software acquired in the SVG acquisition.
The fair value for the internally developed software has been determined based on managements best estimate of replacement cost.
The amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are as set out in the table below.

These are accounted for as cash settled awards and are revalued to market price at the end of each reporting period.
At 30 September 2013, the value of liabilities arising from cash settled deferred awards was 24.8 million 2012: 12.5 million.
The fair value movement of the awards from grant date to 30 September 2013 was a charge of 1.3 million 2012: 0.3 million.
LTIP 0.3million 2012: 2.2 million of the LTIP charge arises from 20,400,000 incentive options granted on 17 June 2008.
These awards vested, subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions, one third after 3 years, one third after 4 years and one third after 5 years.
The vesting in year 5 was subject to continued employment with the Group.
The performance criteria for the awards were linked to the growth in diluted earnings per share over the measurement period 3 years from date of award compared with the average movement in the stock markets in which assets managed by the Group are invested.
The share price at 17 June 2011 was 216.0p, compared to 130.25p at date of award.
23 Reserves Nature and purpose of reserves Share premium account The share premium account is used to record the issue of share capital above par value.
This reserve is not distributable and can only be reduced with court approval.
Capital redemption reserve The capital redemption reserve is created on the cancellation of share capital and the balance reflects the value of preference share capital redeemed by the Company.
This reserve is not distributable.
Merger reserve The merger reserve is used to record share premium on shares issued by way of consideration in respect of acquisitions.
The realised element of the merger reserve can be used to offset amortisation and impairment of intangible assets charged to the income statement.
Warrant and other reserve The warrant reserve was created on the issue of the convertible preference share units in June 2005.
Each convertible preference share unit issued comprised one preference share and one warrant to subscribe for ordinary shares, of which 800 related to the preference share and 200 to the warrant.
During the year, all remaining warrants were exercised or expired.
The equity element of the convertible bond, net of deferred tax, was shown within warrant and other reserves.
This element of reserves was transferred to retained earnings on conversion of the bonds note 25.
Foreign currency translation reserve The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries.
Fair value reserve This reserve records fair value changes on available for sale investments until the investments are derecognised or impaired, when fair value movement goes to retained profit.
Retained profit Retained earnings comprises: all realised gains and losses through the income statement less dividend distributions: actuarial gains and losses recognised in the pension liability, and related deferred tax: gains and losses on available for sale assets and deferred tax on these movements: 118 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial statements transactions relating to equity-settled share-based payments, and all deferred tax movements on share-based payments reflected through equity: the purchase and sale of own shares in respect of share-based payments: and the exchange difference arising on the settlement of equity related instruments note 24.
The total movements in retained earnings relating to the issue of the LTIP shares represent the value of the shares issued to participants in any period less the annual amortisation of these shares which is charged through the income statement.

Where investments are not listed, fair value is determined in accordance with independent professional valuers or International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines where relevant.
Interest bearing loans The fair value of borrowings has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The valuations have considered similar issues available in the market and the liquidity of liabilities.
Where discounted cash flow techniques are used, estimated cash flows are based on managements best estimates and the discount rate is a market related rate for a similar instrument at the balance sheet date.
Where other pricing models are used, inputs are based on market related data at the balance sheet date.
Trade receivables and payables Trade receivables and payables are typically settled in a short time frame.
As a result, the fair value of these balances is considered to be materially equal to the carrying value, after taking into account potential impairment losses.
Fair value of the written put option As described in note 13, the Group has the option to acquire, and SVG Capital plc the option to sell, the remaining 49.9% stake in Aberdeen SVG.
The option is exercisable by either party at or any time after the third anniversary of the transaction, except where shareholders are unable to resolve a significant disagreement known as a 'deadlock'.
In the event of a deadlock, either party can exercise the option.
Recognised within other liabilities, this represents the fair value of the remaining 49.9% stake in Aberdeen SVG.
The fair value of the written put option has been calculated by discounting the expected future liability based on managements best estimate of the option being exercised after three years and at a discount rate based on the Groups cost of capital.
Changes in fair value and the discount will be taken through reserves.
Financial instruments relating to unit linked contracts The Groups life assurance subsidiary provides unit linked wrappers which allow clients to benefit from investing in pooled funds.
As explained in note 18, the risks and rewards of managing these assets are the same as other assets under management as the financial risks and rewards attributable to these assets also fall to be borne by, or to the benefit of, clients.
Hence, while a number of significant financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the subsidiary, the key risk to the Group is the impact of the level of the fees which are earned from this entity which are directly impacted by the underlying value of the policyholder assets.
While by necessity this subsidiary company has some insurance risks, these risks are completely reinsured, thereby negating any ultimate insurance risk to the Groups equity holders.
The assets above are all unit linked and held for the sole benefit of the policyholders within Aberdeen Asset Management Life and Pensions Limited.
Investment and credit risk in respect of assets and liabilities held within unit linked funds is borne by the policyholders.
Accordingly, these assets are not included in fair value measurements disclosure below.
Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

Investments classified as level 3 principally comprise investments in property funds.
While the Group is not aware of significant differences between valuations received and reasonably possible alternatives, the value of these investments would be directly impacted by changes in the European and Asian property markets.
The Group estimates that a 10% increase decrease in the fair value of these investments will have a favourable unfavourable impact on equity of 3.7 million.
124 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial statements 30 Financial risk management Overview This note describes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Groups management of capital.
i Risk management The Group is exposed to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk: liquidity risk: market price risk: foreign exchange risk: and interest rate risk.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and ongoing management of the Groups risk management framework and the implementation and operation of the Boards policies are handled by the Groups risk management committee.
The Board risk committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Board has approved the risk appetite statement, which sets out the quantum and types of risk that the Group is willing to accept in pursuing its objectives.
The risk appetite statement is a top-down framework against which policies, systems and limits can be set.
The Groups risk committee monitors compliance with the risk appetite statement through a series of key performance indicators.
The Groups audit committee is responsible for overseeing financial reports and internal control.
Internal audit assist the Group audit committee in its oversight role by undertaking both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures and report the results of these reviews directly to the audit committee.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees are involved and understand their roles and obligations.
ii Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a client or counterparty to a financial instrument is unable to pay in full amounts when due, and arises principally from the Groups cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables and accrued income.
As detailed in note 29, the carrying value of financial instruments approximate their fair value, with the exception of interest bearing loans and borrowings.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of its financial assets.
A breakdown of the Groups relevant financial assets by credit rating is set out below.
As at 30 September 2013 As at 30 September 2012 Not Not AAA AA A rated Total AAA AA A rated Total Group m m m m m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 18.1 237.4 163.5 7.6 426.6 49.3 142.1 152.0 4.5 347.9 Company Cash and cash equivalents 100.6 101.4 202.0 37.2 30.1 113.2 180.5 No other relevant financial assets are rated.
com 125 Notes to the financial statements continued 30 Financial risk management continued The Group adopts a low risk strategy in respect of its treasury management, at all times ensuring, as far as possible, that its capital is preserved and financial risks are managed in line with the Groups treasury policy as approved by the audit committee.
The treasury function manage the cash resources on a daily basis in accordance with the treasury policy.
We continuously monitor the credit ratings of all institutions where we deposit money.
Trade receivables and accrued income represent amounts recognised in revenue in the Group income statement which have not been settled by clients.
Outstanding balances are monitored locally by senior management and historically the level of default has not been significant and in the majority of cases there is an ongoing relationship with the client.
An analysis of ageing of financial assets is shown below: As at 30 September 2013 As at 30 September 2012 Past due and not impaired Past due and not impaired Neither Neither past Between Between past Between Between due nor 30 and 90 days due nor 30 and 90 days impaired 90 days and 1 year Total impaired 90 days and 1 year Total Group m m m m m m m m Trade receivables 32.2 14.1 2.8 49.1 17.6 9.9 1.7 29.2 Company Trade receivables 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.1 0.1 0.5 All other financial assets are neither past due nor impaired.
Details of provisions against trade receivables at 30 September are as follows: 2013 2012 Group m m Trade receivables provision: Balance at 1 October 0.5 0.6 Bad debt charge release in the year 0.2 0.1 Balance at 30 September 0.7 0.5 This is a 100% provision held against gross trade receivable balances of 0.7 million at 30 September 2013 2012: 0.5 million.
Fees are billed to clients as soon as values are available and settlement is due within agreed contractual terms.
As a result, the average level for debtors and accrued income outstanding, at any point in time, will represent approximately 2.5 months revenue.
At 30 September 2013 the Group had three 2012: three individual clients with greater than 1 million outstanding.
The total outstanding was 5.3 million 2012: 4.6 million.
The Group, in some situations, may be exposed to a concentration of credit risk, particularly from some of its larger clients or groups of connected clients.
This may arise during the period from recognition of management fees in the income statement and settlement of fees by clients.
Very few clients have external credit ratings.
126 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial statements The Group operates and manages a number of open end funds and in doing so it seeks as far as possible to match the purchase and sale of investments in order to match the receipt or payment of funds from or to clients.
Where these positions are not matched the Group may be required to fund any shortfall, although due to the short settlement period for these transactions the risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered to be small.
In addition should any investor default on any payment due the Group would be entitled to recover any costs from the investor.
iii Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a significantly increased cost.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Groups facilities include 100 million of revolving credit facilities, which are undrawn.
The Group has cash balances of 426.6 million at 30 September 2013.
Therefore, the current headroom between available facilities and amounts drawn is substantial and the Groups intention will be to maintain the headroom at a healthy level in the future.
The expected cash flows related to the Group and Companys financial liabilities are as follows: As at 30 September 2013 As at 30 September 2012 Within Within Within 1 year or Within Within More 1 year or Within More 25 repayable 12 25 than repayable 12 than 5 years on demand years years 5 years Total on demand years years Total Group m m m m m m m m m m 3.5% convertible bonds 2014 88.6 88.6 Company Bank overdraft 442.1 442.1 370.4 370.4 3.5% convertible bonds 2014 88.6 88.6 442.1 442.1 459.0 459.0 All other Group and Company financial liabilities are repayable within one year or on demand.
iv Market price risk Market price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will change due to movements in market prices, other than foreign exchange rates or interest rates.
These financial instruments include the Groups investments in seed capital and is invested to support the launch of new funds.
Seed capital is typically invested in quoted funds for less than one year.
These investments have been measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Investments in property funds are usually for longer term e. g. five to seven years and are measured as available for sale.
These securities are managed on an individual basis and all material buy and sell decisions are approved by the GMB.
The objective of market price risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Board sets the limits for investing seed capital and regularly monitors the exposure.

Details of these assets are shown in note 32.
Sensitivity analysis is disclosed below in section vii.
v Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk at a transactional and translational level.
Transaction risk is the risk that the domestic value of a foreign currency denominated cash flow will vary adversely.
Translation risk arises from translating the balances of overseas subsidiaries which report their results in a currency other than sterling and therefore the sterling value of those balances could vary adversely.
Foreign currency transaction risk The Group undertakes transactions in a number of currencies and foreign currency risk arises through fluctuations in foreign currency changing the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments.
Revenues are earned principally from fees which are calculated on the basis of the value of AuM managed for clients and many mandates include investments valued in currencies other than sterling.
The fact that we operate on a global basis, with offices in a number of countries worldwide, means that a proportion of operating costs is also incurred in foreign currencies.
Further, coupons on the 7.0% perpetual cumulative capital notes and before redemption, the 7.9% perpetual capital securities are incurred in US dollars.
Variations in the sterling value of these operating costs and interest cost will, to an extent, offset any similar impact of fluctuating exchange rates on revenues.
The Board has therefore decided that it is not appropriate to undertake any specific hedging of the Groups revenues or costs, except under limited circumstances.

The risk is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix.
The Groups debt consisted of convertible debt and the revolving credit facilities, which were undrawn at 30 September 2013.
The convertible bonds, which carried interest at a fixed rate were fully redeemed in January 2013.
Interest on the revolving credit facilities, which have been undrawn throughout the year, is at LIBOR plus a margin.
The Group also receives variable rate interest on cash deposits.

The sensitivity analysis covers the financial instruments at each of the balance sheet dates and assumes changes in market variables.
It should however be noted that due to the inherent uncertainty in world financial markets the assumptions made may differ significantly from the actual outcome particularly as market risks tend to be interdependent and are therefore unlikely to move in isolation.
The following assumptions have been made in respect of the market risks: sterling exchange rates are assumed to increase or decrease by 10%: market interest rates are assumed to increase or decrease by 1%: and market prices are assumed to increase or decrease by 10% at each reporting date.
The impact of the assumptions on the financial assets and liabilities net of tax, are as follows: Group Impact Impact on profit on profit Impact on Impact on or loss or loss equity equity As at 30 September 2013 m m m m Exchange rate movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Currency Sterling US dollar 13.0 13.0 12.1 12.1 Sterling Euro 7.5 7.5 4.1 4.1 Sterling Nordic currencies 2.3 2.3 2.4 2.4 Sterling Singapore dollar 17.5 17.5 22.5 22.5 Market price movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Financial investments at fair value through profit or loss 5.7 5.7 Financial investments available for sale 3.2 3.2 Interest rate movement 1% -1% 1% -1% Sterling market interest rates 3.2 3.2 As at 30 September 2012 Exchange rate movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Currency Sterling US dollar 8.9 8.9 6.7 6.7 Sterling Euro 3.6 3.6 3.1 3.1 Sterling Nordic currencies 2.7 2.7 2.9 2.9 Sterling Singapore dollar 13.4 13.4 16.9 16.9 Market price movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Financial investments at fair value through profit or loss 3.3 3.3 Financial investments available for sale 2.7 2.7 Interest rate movement 1% -1% 1% -1% Sterling market interest rates 1.8 1.8 aberdeen-asset.

The Board receives monthly updates on headroom over regulatory capital and supervises key decisions that may impact the future capital position of the Group.
Further information on the Groups regulatory capital position is given below.
The Groups capital structure consists of equity instruments, retained earnings and other equity reserves including perpetual capital securities.
The perpetual capital securities satisfy the requirements of financial reporting standards for treatment as equity and are treated as an element of capital for regulatory purposes.
The Group uses cash generated from its operations to pay a progressive dividend.
The Board seeks to avoid further dilutive issuance of new shares and has, since 2010, satisfied vesting of deferred bonus awards by purchasing shares in the market through the Employee Benefit Trust EBT.
The EBT now holds sufficient shares to cover all outstanding awards as at 30 September 2013.
134 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial statements Regulatory capital requirements In accordance with the Capital Requirements Directive CRD, as implemented in the UK by the Financial Conduct Authority FCA, the Group is required to maintain a minimum level of capital.
In common with many other independent asset managers, the Group currently operates under the terms of a waiver from the requirement to meet the full consolidated supervision rules of the CRD.
The waiver was granted by the FCA with effect from January 2007 and is effective until August 2014.
During the year to 30 September 2013 the Group achieved its objective of eliminating reliance on this waiver.
The Group is required to undertake an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, under which the Board quantifies the level of capital required to meet operational risks: this is referred to as the Pillar 2 capital requirement.
The objective of this process is to ensure that firms have adequate capital to enable them to manage their risks which may not be adequately covered under the Pillar 1 requirements.
This is a forward looking exercise which includes stress testing for the effects of major risks, such as those discussed on pages 42 to 45.
These tests consider how the Group would cope with a significant market downturn, for example, and include an assessment of the Groups ability to mitigate the risks.
During the year to 30 September 2013 the acquisition of Aberdeen SVG added two regulated subsidiaries to the Groups existing three regulated subsidiaries in the United Kingdom.
Each of the subsidiaries is regulated by the FCA, except for Aberdeen Asset Management Life and Pensions Limited, which is regulated by the Prudential Regulatory Authority PRA.
There are a further 33 subsidiaries which are subject to regulation in a number of overseas jurisdictions.
With the exception of Aberdeen Asset Management Life and Pensions Limited, which is a regulated insurance firm, all others are regulated investment firms and are part of the Group consolidation for regulatory capital reporting purposes.
The overseas regulated companies are subject to regulatory capital requirements which are determined by the respective local regulators.
All the regulated companies in the Group maintained surpluses over their respective regulatory capital requirements throughout the year.
31 Related party transactions In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiary undertakings carry out transactions with related parties, as defined by IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures.
Material transactions for the year are set out below.
The principal subsidiary undertakings of the Company are shown in note 15.
During the year, the Group entered into the following transactions with related parties: a Compensation of key management personnel of the Group 2013 2012 m m Short-term employee benefits 10.1 9.2 Share-based payments 13.7 12.0 Pension contributions 0.5 0.4 Total 24.3 21.6 Deferred elements of employee benefits outstanding at the year end: Amounts owed to related parties including amounts deferred from previous years 40.7 34.6 The remuneration policy is described in more detail in the remuneration report on pages 64 to 78. aberdeen-asset.

The contribution to the CGA Staff Pension Fund in 2012 was to enable the trustees of the scheme to buy out the liabilities with an insurer.
The scheme is now in the process of being wound up and no further contribution will be payable.
d Asset management vehicles The Group provides investment management services for a number of collective investment schemes where Group companies directly sponsor or are investment advisors of underlying funds, which meet the criteria or related parties.
In return the Group receives management fees for provision of these services These asset management vehicles and the investment management fees are summarised below: Gross Revenues Outstanding at Gross Revenues Outstanding at 2013 30 Sep 2013 2012 30 Sep 2012 m m m m Collective investment schemes 281.3 26.8 256.4 23.6 136 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial statements 32 Retirement benefits The Groups principal form of pension provision is by way of three defined contribution schemes operated worldwide.
The Group also operates a small number of legacy defined benefit schemes: the Murray Johnstone Limited Retirement Benefits Plan, the Edinburgh Fund Managers Group plc Retirement & Death Benefits Scheme and the DEGI Pension Plan.
These defined benefit schemes are closed to new membership and to future service accrual.
The total contributions charged to the income statement in respect of the schemes operated by the Group were as follows: 2013 2012 m m i In respect of the Groups defined contribution schemes: Pension cost charged to operating profit: UK schemes 11.8 9.0 Overseas schemes 10.6 9.4 22.4 18.4 ii In respect of the Groups defined benefit schemes: Pension cost charged to operating profit: UK and DEGI schemes 1.2 1.9 Other schemes 1.5 1.3 2.7 3.2 Total pension expense 25.1 21.6 The pension obligations are recognised as non-current liabilities in the balance sheet and are stated before deduction of the related deferred tax asset.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted, based on the target asset allocation, to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions for the portfolio.

"33 Post balance sheet event We announced on 18 November 2013 that the Group has entered into an agreement to form a long-term strategic relationship with Lloyds Banking Group plc ""Lloyds"", as part of which Aberdeen will acquire Scottish Widows Investment Partnership Group Limited ""SWIP"" and SWIPs related private equity and infrastructure fund management businesses."
The completion of the transaction is subject to certain regulatory approvals.
The acquired business includes the Investment Solutions division of SWIP which is a separate investment group that is responsible for the design, development and management of investment solutions for Lloyds wealth clients.
The consideration for the acquisition of approximately 550 million calculated by reference to an Aberdeen share price of 420 pence per share will be satisfied by the issue of 131.8 million new Aberdeen shares to Lloyds, equivalent to an approximately 9.9% stake in the Group following completion of the acquisition.
In addition, there will be a performance-related five year earn-out payment of up to 100 million dependent on growth delivered by the strategic relationship with Lloyds in the Investment Solutions business.
The acquired business will add approximately 136 billion of assets under management.
