Financial instruments and risk management continued Other derivatives The groups policy is not to use derivatives for trading purposes.
However, due to the complex nature of hedge accounting under IAS 39, some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specically not designated as a hedge where natural offset is more appropriate.
Derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are held at fair value through profit and loss under IAS 39.
At 31 March 2013 the group held certain foreign currency forward and interest rate swap contracts which were not in hedging relationships.
These derivatives are disclosed on pages 157 and 158.
Foreign currency forward contracts were economically hedging operational purchases and sales.
The interest rate swap contracts became ineffective on first time adoption of IFRS.
The volatility arising from these swaps is recognised through the income statement but is limited due to a natural offset in their fair value movements.
