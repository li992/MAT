As a result, an impairment loss of US$604.6 million was recognised with respect to certain of the Companys investment in subsidiaries.
Except for investment in Minera Mexicana La Cinega, S. A. fide C. V. Cinega, the recoverable amount was estimated based on the fair value less cost to disposal of each of the subsidiaries, which generally hold one operating mine or development project.
Fair value less cost to disposal was based on the net present value of future cash flows related to each of the Companys subsidiaries.
In the case of Cinega the recoverable amount was determined based on value in use.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections was 6.77%.
Any further changes to gold and silver prices may result in changes to the value in use relating to Cinega and would, therefore, result in further impairment or a reduction in the impairment.
