Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
Accounting Policies Basis of preparation The Annual Report and Accounts of IP Group plc IP Group or the Company and its subsidiary companies together, the Group are for the year ended 31 December 2013.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below.
The policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting Standards and Interpretations collectively IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as adopted by the European Union adopted IFRSs.
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires Group management to exercise judgement in the most appropriate application in applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas where significant judgements and estimates have been made in preparing the financial statements and their effect are disclosed in note 3.
Changes in accounting policies i New standards, interpretations and amendments effective from 1 January 2013 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: which became effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, establishes principles for the preparation and presentation of consolidated financial statements when a reporting entity controls one or more other entities.
The new standard replaces the consolidation requirements in SIC-12 Consolidation Special Purpose Entities and IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements.
While IFRS 10 specifies new criteria for the assessment of control, it has not resulted in any conclusions differing to those reached under the previously applicable standards.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities: IFRS 12 sets out the disclosure requirements relating to an entitys interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and structured entities.
The standard requires a reporting entity to disclose information that helps users to assess the nature and financial effects of the reporting entitys relationship with other entities.
As the new standard affects only disclosure, there is no effect on the Groups financial position or performance.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement: IFRS 13 sets out the framework for determining the measurement of fair value and the disclosure of information relating to fair value measurement, when fair value measurements and or disclosures are required or permitted by other IFRSs.
As a result, the guidance and requirements relating to fair value measurement that were previously located in other IFRSs have now been relocated to IFRS 13.
While there has been some rewording of the previous guidance, there are few changes to the previous fair value measurement requirements.
Instead, IFRS 13 is intended to clarify the measurement objective, harmonise the disclosure requirements, and improve consistency in application of fair value measurement.
IFRS 13 did not materially affect any fair value measurements of the Groups assets or liabilities, with changes being limited to presentation and disclosure, and therefore has no effect on the Groups financial position or performance.
In addition, IFRS 13 is to be applied prospectively and therefore comparative disclosures have not been presented.
See note 3 Significant accounting estimates and judgements for more details and further references related to fair value measurement.
No other new standards, interpretations and amendments effective for the first time from 1 January 2013 have had a material effect on the Groups financial statements.
ii New standards, interpretations and amendments not yet effective The following new standards, which have not been applied in these financial statements, will or may have an effect on the Groups future financial statements: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: IFRS 9 will eventually replace IAS 39 in its entirety.
The process has been divided into three main components, being classification and measurement: impairment: and hedge accounting.
The Group provisionally assesses the potential effect to be immaterial given the majority of its financial assets are currently held at fair value through profit or loss.
The previous effective date of 1 January 2015 has been withdrawn and is now expected to be implemented in 2018.
Amendment to IFRS 10 Investment Entities: The amendments define an investment entity and require a parent that is an investment entity to measure its investments in particular subsidiaries at fair value through profit or loss, rather than consolidating them in its consolidated financial statements.
Measurement at fair value through profit or loss must also be applied to an investment entitys separate financial statements.
The amendments also introduce disclosure requirements for investment entities into IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities and amend IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements.
The Group, after a provisional examination expects to not qualify for the investment entity exemption and consequently, considers that the amendment is unlikely to result in changes to the preparation and presentation of the Groups subsidiaries, associates or Limited Partnerships.
The mandatory adoption starts for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014 following EU endorsement in November 2013.
None of the other new standards, interpretations and amendments not yet effective is expected to have a material effect on the Groups future financial statements.
IP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013 84 23002-04 Proof 8a 01-04-14 Our Financials Group Notes Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Where the Group has control over an entity, it is classified as a subsidiary.
As per IFRS 10 an entity is classed as under the control of the Group when all three of the following elements are present: power over the entity, exposure to variable returns from the entity and the ability of the Group to use its power to affect those variable returns.
Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control.
In situations where the Company has the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee without holding the majority of the voting rights, it considered that fide facto control exists.
In determining whether fide facto control exists the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including: The size of the Companys voting rights relative to both the size and dispersion of other parties who hold voting rights: Substantive potential voting rights held by the company and by other parties: Other contractual arrangements: and Historic patterns in voting attendance.
The consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries as if they formed a single entity.
Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the acquisition method.
In the statement of financial position, the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained.
They are consolidated until the date on which control ceases.
ii Associates Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but does not control, generally accompanied by a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
No associates are presented on the statement of financial position as the Group elects to hold such investments at fair value in the statement of financial position.
This treatment is permitted by IAS 28 Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures, which permits investments held by entities that are akin to venture capital organisations to be excluded from its scope where those investments are designated, upon initial recognition, as at fair value through profit or loss and accounted for in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Changes in fair value of associates are recognised in profit or loss in the period of the change.
The Group has no interests in associates through which it carries on its business.
iii Limited partnerships and limited liability partnerships Limited Partnerships Limited partnerships Group entities act as general partner and investment manager to the following limited partnerships: Interest in limited partnership Name % IP Venture Fund II L. P. IPVFII 33.3 IP Venture Fund IPVF 10.0 Top Technology Ventures IV LP TTV IV 1.0 The North East Technology Fund L. P. NETF The Group receives compensation for its role as investment manager to these limited partnerships including fixed fees and performance fees.
The directors consider that these amounts are in substance and form normal market rate compensation for its role as investment manager.
In order to determine whether these limited partnerships were required to be consolidated, the presence of the three elements of control noted in part i was examined.
The Groups significant stake in IPVFII creates a significant exposure to the variability of returns from those interests and the Groups ability to direct the operations of the fund would result in IP Group obtaining the benefits of its activities.
As such IPVFII meets the criteria in IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and is consequently consolidated.
com 85 23002-04 Proof 8a 01-04-14 Our Financials Group Notes Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued In the case of IPVF and TTV IV, the directors consider that the minority limited partnership interests do not create an exposure of such significance that it indicates that the Group acts as anything other than agent for the other limited partners in the arrangement.
Similarly, the lack of a stake in NETF indicates the Groups role as an agent for the limited partner.
As a result, the directors consider that the Group does not have the power to govern the operations of theses limited partnerships so as to obtain benefits from their activities and accordingly do not meet the definition of a subsidiary under IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
However the Group does have the power to exercise significant influence over its limited partnerships and accordingly the Groups accounting treatment for the interests in IPVF and TTV IV is consistent with that of associates as described earlier in this report, i. e. in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and designated as at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition.
Limited liability partnerships The Group has a 16.7% interest in the total capital commitments of Technikos LLP Technikos.
The general partner and investment manager of Technikos are parties external to the Group.
iv Non-controlling interests The total comprehensive income, assets and liabilities of non-wholly owned subsidiaries are attributed to owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests in proportion to their relative ownership interests.
Portfolio return and revenue Change in fair value Change in fair value of equity and debt investments represents revaluation gains and losses on the Groups portfolio of investments.
Gains on disposal of equity investments represent the difference between the fair value of consideration received and the carrying value at the start of the accounting period on the disposal of equity investments.
Change in fair value of limited partnership investments represents revaluation gains and losses on the Groups investments in limited partnership funds.
Changes in fair values of assets do not constitute revenue.
Revenue from services and other income All revenue from services is generated within the United Kingdom and is stated exclusive of value added tax.
Revenue from services and other income comprises: Advisory fees: Fees earned from the provision of business support services are recognised as the related services are provided.
Corporate finance advisory fees are generally earned as a fixed percentage of total funds raised and recognised at the time the related transaction is successfully concluded.
Fund management services: Fiduciary fund management fees are generally earned as a fixed percentage of total funds under management and are recognised as the related services are provided.
Dividends: Dividends receivable from equity shares are included within other portfolio income and recognised on the exdividend date or, where no ex-dividend date is quoted, are recognised when the Groups right to receive payment is established.
Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment.
Cost includes expenditure that is attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Depreciation on assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of each asset to its residual value over its estimated useful life, as follows: Fixtures and fittings Over 3 to 5 years Computer equipment Over 3 to 5 years The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets and allocated from the acquisition date to each of the Groups cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination.
Goodwill may be allocated to CGUs in both the acquired business and in the existing business.
Impairment of intangible assets including goodwill Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are tested for impairment when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and the value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairments, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows i. e. CGUs.
IP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013 86 23002-04 Proof 8a 01-04-14 Our Financials Group Notes Financial assets In respect of regular way purchases or sales, the Group uses trade date accounting to recognise or derecognise financial assets.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
The Group classifies its financial assets into one of the categories listed below, depending on the purpose for which the asset was acquired.
None of the Groups financial assets are categorised as held to maturity or available for sale.
i At fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are either financial assets held for trading or financial assets which are designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition.
This category includes equity investments, debt investments, equity rights, contingent value rights and investments in limited partnerships.
Investments in associated undertakings which are held by the Group with a view to the ultimate realisation of capital gains are also categorised as at fair value through profit or loss.
This measurement basis is consistent with the fact that the Groups performance in respect of investments in equity investments, limited partnerships and associated undertakings is evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with an established investment strategy.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value and any gains or losses arising from subsequent changes in fair value are presented in profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income in the period which they arise.
Fair value hierarchy The Group classifies financial assets using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the related fair value measurements.
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a financial asset is classified is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to that assets fair value measurement.
The fair value hierarchy has the following levels: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets.
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as prices from market transactions.
These are mainly based on prices determined from recent investments in the last twelve months.
Level 3 One or more inputs that are not based on observable market data.
Equity Investments The fair values of quoted investments are based on bid prices in an active market at the reporting date.
The fair value of unlisted securities is established using valuation techniques.
These include the use of recent arms length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis and earnings multiples.
Wherever possible the Group uses valuation techniques which make maximum use of market-based inputs.
Accordingly, the valuation methodology used most commonly by the Group is the price of recent investment contained in the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines the IPEVCV Guidelines endorsed by the British & European Venture Capital Associations.
The following considerations are used when calculating the fair value of unlisted securities: Cost Where the investment being valued was itself made recently, its cost may provide a good indication of fair value unless there is objective evidence that the investment has since been impaired, such as observable data suggesting a deterioration of the financial, technical, or commercial performance of the underlying business.
Price of recent investment The Group considers that fair value estimates that are based entirely on observable market data will be of greater reliability than those based on assumptions and, accordingly, where there has been any recent investment by third parties, the price of that investment will generally provide a basis of the valuation.
The length of period for which it remains appropriate to use the price of recent investment depends on the specific circumstances of the investment and the stability of the external environment.
Given the nature of the Groups investments in seed, start-up and early-stage companies where there are often no current and no short-term future earnings or positive cash flows it can be difficult to gauge the probability and financial impact of the success or failure of development or research activities and to make reliable cash flow forecasts.
Consequently, the most appropriate approach to determine fair value is a methodology that is based on market data, that being the price of a recent investment.
Where the Group considers that the price of recent investment, unadjusted, is no longer relevant and there are limited or no comparable companies or transactions from which to infer value, the Group carries out an enhanced assessment based on milestone analysis and or industry and sector analysis.
In applying the milestone analysis approach to investments in companies in early or development stages the Group seeks to determine whether there is an indication of change in fair value based on a consideration of performance against any milestones that were set at the time of the original investment decision, as well as taking into consideration the key market drivers of the investee company and the overall economic environment.
com 87 23002-04 Proof 8a 01-04-14 Our Financials Group Notes Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued Where the Group considers that there is an indication that the fair value has changed, an estimation is made of the required amount of any adjustment from the last price of recent investment.
Wherever possible, this adjustment is based on objective data from the investee company and the experience and judgement of the Group: however, any adjustment is, by its very nature, subjective.
Where a deterioration in value has occurred, the Group reduces the carrying value of the investment to reflect the estimated decrease.
If there is evidence of value creation the Group may consider increasing the carrying value of the investment: however, in the absence of additional financing rounds or profit generation it can be difficult to determine the value that a purchaser may place on positive developments given the potential outcome and the costs and risks to achieving that outcome and accordingly caution is applied.
Factors that the Group considers include, inter alia, technical measures such as product development phases and patent approvals, financial measures such as cash burn rate and profitability expectations, and market and sales measures such as testing phases, product launches and market introduction.
Other valuation techniques If there is no readily ascertainable value from following the price of recent investment methodology, or there is objective evidence that a deterioration in fair value has occurred since a relevant transaction, the Group considers alternative methodologies in the IPEVCV Guidelines, such as discounted cash flows DCF or price-earnings multiples.
DCF involves estimating the fair value of a business by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows, based on the most recent forecasts in respect of the underlying business.
Given the difficulty of producing reliable cash flow forecasts for seed, start-up and early-stage companies as described earlier, this methodology is generally used as a confirmatory indicator of the level of any adjustment that may need to be made to the last price of recent investment.
When using the earnings multiple methodology, earnings before interest and tax EBIT are generally used, adjusted to a maintainable level.
A suitable earnings multiple is derived from an equivalent business or group of businesses, for which the average price-earnings multiple for the relevant sector index can generally be considered a suitable proxy.
This multiple is applied to earnings to derive an enterprise value which is then discounted by up to 60% for non-marketability and other risks inherent to businesses in early stages of operation.
No reliable estimate Where a fair value cannot be estimated reliably the investment is reported at the carrying value at the previous reporting date unless there is objective evidence that the investment has since been impaired.
Equity rights The equity rights asset represent consideration paid to the University of Oxford between December 2000 and June 2001 that gives the Group contractual rights to the receipt of shares in unlisted spin-out companies or cash based on research carried out in the universitys Department of Chemistry.
It is considered to be a derivative financial asset and is designated as at fair value through profit and loss.
Further details on the treatment of this asset are included in note 14.
Debt investments Debt investments are generally unquoted debt instruments which are convertible to equity at a future point in time.
Such instruments are considered to be hybrid instruments containing a fixed rate debt host contract with an embedded equity derivative.
The Group designates the entire hybrid contract at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition and, accordingly, the embedded derivative is not separated from the host contract and accounted for separately.
The fair value of debt investments is established by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the instrument.
Contingent value rights In instances where the Group receives contingent financial consideration upon the disposal of a financial asset, the resulting asset shall be recognised and designated as at fair value through profit and loss, and treated accordingly.
ii Loans and receivables These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed and determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise principally through the provision of services to customers trade receivables and are carried at cost less provision for impairment.
Deposits Deposits comprise longer-term deposits held with financial institutions with an original maturity of greater than three months.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and short-term deposits held with financial institutions with an original maturity of three months or less.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are composed of trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities, which are recognised at amortised cost.
Unless otherwise indicated, the carrying amounts of the Groups financial liabilities are a reasonable approximation to their fair value.
IP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013 88 23002-04 Proof 8a 01-04-14 Our Financials Group Notes Share capital Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity if the holders have only a residual interest in the Groups assets after deducting all liabilities.
The objective of the Group is to manage capital so as to provide shareholders with above average returns through capital growth over the medium to long term.
The Group considers its capital to comprise its share capital, share premium, merger reserve and retained earnings.
Top Technology Ventures Limited, a Group subsidiary, is subject to external capital requirements imposed by the Financial Conduct Authority FCA and as such must ensure that it has sufficient capital to satisfy these requirements.
The Group ensures it remains compliant with these requirements as described in the financial statements of Top Technology Ventures Limited.
Employee benefits i Pension obligations The Group operates a company defined-contribution pension scheme for which all employees are eligible.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
The Group currently makes contributions on behalf of staff to this scheme or to employee personal pension schemes on an individual basis.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expenses when they are due.
ii Share-based payments The Group engages in equity-settled share-based payment transactions in respect of services receivable from employees, by granting employees conditional awards of ordinary shares subject to certain vesting conditions.
Conditional awards of shares are made pursuant to the Groups Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP awards.
The fair value of the shares is estimated at the date of grant, taking into account the terms and conditions of the award, including market-based performance conditions.
The difference between the fair value of the employee services received in respect of the shares granted and the price payable is recognised as an expense over the appropriate performance and vesting period.
The corresponding credit is recognised in retained earnings within total equity.
The fair value of services is calculated using the market value on the date of award and is adjusted for expected and actual levels of vesting.
Where conditional awards of shares lapse the expense recognised to date is credited to the statement of comprehensive income in the year in which they lapse.
Where the terms for an equity-settled award are modified, and the modification increases the total fair value of the share-based payment, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee at the date of modification, the incremental fair value is amortised over the vesting period.
Deferred tax Full provision is made for deferred tax on all temporary differences resulting from the carrying value of an asset or liability and its tax base.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or deferred tax liability settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the deferred tax asset will be recovered in the future.
Leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to administrative expenses in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Financial Risk Management As set out in the Principal risks and uncertainties section on pages 34 to 37, the Group is exposed, through its normal operations, to a number of financial risks, the most significant of which are market, liquidity and credit risks.
In general, risk management is carried out throughout the Group under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The following further describes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them.
Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is presented throughout these financial statements.
a Market risk i Price risk The Group is exposed to equity securities price risk as a result of the equity and debt investments, and investments in limited partnerships held by the Group and categorised as at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group mitigates this risk by having established investment appraisal processes and asset monitoring procedures which are subject to overall review by the Board.
The Group has also established corporate finance and communications teams dedicated to supporting portfolio companies with fundraising activities and investor relations.
com 89 23002-04 Proof 8a 01-04-14 Our Financials Group Notes Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Financial Risk Management continued The Group holds investments which are publicly traded on AIM or ISDX and investments which are not traded on an active market.
The net increase in fair value of the Groups equity and debt investments during 2013 of 82.4m represents a 45% change against the opening balance 2012: net increase of 38.0m, 31% and a similar increase or decrease in the prices of quoted and unquoted investments is considered to be reasonably possible.
The table below summarises the impact of a 1% increase decrease in the price of both quoted and unquoted investments on the Groups post-tax profit for the year and on equity.
2013 2012 Quoted Unquoted Total Quoted Unquoted Total m m m m m m Equity investments and investments in limited partnerships 1.4 1.5 2.9 0.8 1.0 1.8 ii Interest rate risk As the Group has no significant borrowings it has only a limited interest rate risk.
The primary impact to the Group is the impact on income and operating cash flow as a result of the interest-bearing deposits and cash and cash equivalents held by the Group.
The Group mitigates this risk, in co-ordination with liquidity risk, by managing its proportion of fixed to floating rate financial assets.
The table below summarises the interest rate profile of the Group.

b Liquidity risk The Group seeks to manage liquidity risk, to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
Accordingly, the Group only invests working capital in short-term instruments issued by reputable counterparties.
The Group continually monitors rolling cash flow forecasts to ensure sufficient cash is available for anticipated cash requirements.
IP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013 90 23002-04 Proof 8a 01-04-14 Our Financials Group Notes c Credit risk The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its deposits, cash and cash equivalents, debt investments and trade receivables.
The Group seeks to mitigate its credit risk on cash and cash equivalents by making short-term deposits with counterparties, or by investing in treasury funds with an AA credit rating or above managed by institutions.
Short-term deposit counterparties are required to have most recently reported total assets in excess of 3bn and, where applicable, a prime short-term credit rating at the time of investment ratings are generally determined by Moodys or Standard & Poors.
Moodys prime credit ratings of P1, P2 and P3 indicate respectively that the rating agency considers the counterparty to have a superior, strong or acceptable ability to repay short-term debt obligations generally defined as having an original maturity not exceeding 13 months.
An analysis of the Groups deposits and cash and cash equivalents balance analysed by credit rating as at the reporting date is shown in the table below.
All other financial assets are unrated.
2013 2012 Credit rating m m P1 14.2 14.8 P2 9.9 30.6 AA 2.5 Total deposits and cash and cash equivalents 24.1 47.9 The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The Group has detailed policies and strategies which seek to minimise these associated risks, including defining maximum counterparty exposure limits for term deposits based on their perceived financial strength at the commencement of the deposit.
The maximum single counterparty limit for deposits at 31 December 2013 was 10m 2012: 10m.
The Groups exposure to credit risk on debt investments is managed in a similar way to equity price risk, as described earlier, through the Groups investment appraisal processes and asset monitoring procedures which are subject to overall review by the Board.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for debt investments, receivables and other financial assets is represented by their carrying amount.
Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgements The directors make judgements and estimates concerning the future.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, such as expectations of future events, and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effects on the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities in the financial statements are discussed below.
i Valuation of unquoted equity investments The judgements required in order to determine the appropriate valuation methodology of unquoted equity investments have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities.
These judgements include making assessments of the future earnings potential of portfolio companies, appropriate earnings multiples to apply, and marketability and other risk discounts.
ii Impairment of goodwill The Group is required to test, at least annually, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment.
The recoverable amount is determined using a number of value-in-use and  calculations.
The use of these methods requires the estimation of future cash flows and the selection of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of these cash flows, as well as the selection of applicable and reasonable multiples.. iii Equity rights On initial recognition, the equity rights arrangement was considered in substance to be a derivative financial asset.
This conclusion was reached after considering that the assets value changes in response to a change in an underlying, being the number and value of spin-out companies created, the net investment was considered to be smaller than would be expected for other contracts with similar response to changes in market factors and it is to be settled at a future date.
As the asset is not quoted on an active market the fair value is determined using valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows.
The asset has historically been held at cost since no reliable estimate of fair value could be reached.
At 31 December 2013 the information available to the directors and the time remaining in the contract produced a sufficiently accurate estimate of fair value at balance sheet date.
In the discounted cash flow model the directors considered the historic asset performance, the spin-out pipeline and available economic data to estimate the unobservable inputs.
Those inputs include the average spin-out rate and the projected cash flows on IPO or trade sale from anticipated spin-out opportunities.
The discount rate used for valuing the equity rights asset is determined based on the Groups cost of capital.
Discussion of sensitivity analyses is included in the relevant note for each of the above estimates and judgements.

Revenue From Services All revenue from services is derived from the provision of advisory and venture capital fund management services.
Operating Segments For both the year ended 31 December 2013 and the year ended 31 December 2012 the Groups revenue and profit loss before taxation were derived almost entirely from its principal activities within the UK.
Though the Group has initiated operations in the US the associated revenues and costs are currently immaterial and accordingly no additional geographical disclosures are given.
For management reporting purposes, the Group is currently organised into three operating segments: i the commercialisation of intellectual property via the formation of long-term partner relationships with universities: ii management of venture funds focusing on early-stage UK technology companies: and iii the in-licensing of drugable intellectual property from research intensive institutions.
These activities are described in further detail in the Strategic report on pages 01 to 37.

This deferred tax asset would be recovered if there were future taxable profits from which the reversal of the underlying temporary difference could be deducted.
The directors believe that the Group qualifies for Substantial Shareholder Exemption and therefore no deferred tax is provided for in respect of the net uplift in valuation of the Groups equity investments.

In return for the non-refundable, non-interest bearing, advance totalling 20.1m, the Group has the right to receive from the University the following over its 15-year term: 50% of the universitys equity shares in any spin-out company created based on intellectual property created by academics that are considered to be part of the Department of Chemistry i. e. equity instruments in unlisted companies : and 50% of the universitys share of any cash payments received by the university from parties who have licensed intellectual property created by academics that are considered to be part of the Department of Chemistry.
The contract expires on 23 November 2015.
The directors consider that for each of the key variables which would be relevant in determining a fair value for this financial instrument, there is a range of reasonably possible alternative values.
The key variable ranges are set out below: 2013 2012 Number of spin-out companies per year from University of Oxfords Department of Chemistry 12 12 Initial equity stake acquired by the Group under the equity rights contract 20%25% 20%25% Proportion of spin-out companies failing 30%40% 30%40% Dilution rates prior to exit as a result of financing for spin-out companies 35%60% 35%60% Proportion of IPO exits 30%40% 30%40% IPO exit valuations 30m50m 30m50m Proportion of disposal exits 25%35% 25%35% Disposal valuations 30m40m 30m40m Discount rate 9%11% 9%11% These key variable ranges result in a wide range of fair value estimates for the equity rights agreement, from 2.3m to 4.4m using a range of reasonably possible variables, with the number of spin-outs being the variable giving rise to the widest variation in estimated fair values.
In order to calculate a more accurate valuation figure given the multitude of reliable scenarios generated when altering the discounted cash flows variables, a probability weighting expected return method is utilised.
Having applied probabilities to the various possible scenarios, the method returned an estimated asset value of 3.1m at 31 December 2013 2012: 8.1m.

Investments in 25 companies have been classified as Level 3 and the individual valuations for each of these have been arrived at using a variety of valuation techniques and assumptions.
For instances where the fair values are based upon the most recent market transaction but which occurred more than twelve months previously, the investments are reclassified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
However, if the assumptions used in the valuation techniques for the Groups holding in each company are varied by using a range of possible alternatives, there is no material difference to the carrying value of the respective spin-out company.
The effect on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the period is also not expected to be material.
The net increase in fair value for the year of 82.4m 2012: 38.0m includes a net decrease of 1.7m 2012: 9.9m increase that has been estimated using a valuation technique.
Further details are contained within the accounting policy for equity investments.
During the period then has been a net transfer between the level 2 heirarchy to level 3 of circa 12m.
This is due to a number of portfolio companies not receiving financing in the previous 12 months and subsequently being reclassified.
However these companies had previously raised sufficient capital to allow extended periods of development and continue to make good progress against technical milestones.

All receivables are interest free, repayable on demand and unsecured.
Other Financial Asset Other financial asset comprises a zero-cost forward contract giving the Group the right to receive sale proceeds when University of Leeds sells down its stake in specified spin-out companies subject to a maximum receivable of 0.7m following nil receipt of sale proceeds during 2013 2012: 0.7m receivable.
The asset has no set date of repayment or other rights of recourse.
This asset is classified as a financial asset held for trading initially measured at fair value with subsequent changes recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Fair value is determined by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing market rates of interest and accordingly, the Group considers this asset to be Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy throughout the current and previous financial years.
If the assumptions used in the valuation techniques are varied by using a range of possible alternatives, there is no material difference to the statement of financial position, nor the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Contingent Value Rights As a result of the disposal of Proximagen Group plc in August 2012, the Group received contingent consideration, in the form of contingent value rights CVRs, based upon future net revenues of two associated drug programmes.
In line with the Groups policies, these have been recognised as financial assets at fair value through profit and loss, and has been fair valued at 1.4m 2012: 1.4m.
The Group considers this asset to be Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy throughout the current and previous financial years.

The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry equal voting rights, equal rights to income and distributions of assets on liquidation or otherwise, and no right to fixed income.

Operating Lease Arrangements 2013 2012 m m Payments under operating leases recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for the year 0.4 0.4 At the reporting date, the Group had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: 2013 2012 m m Within one year 0.3 0.3 In the second to fifth years inclusive 0.6 0.9 0.9 1.2 Operating lease payments represent rentals and other charges payable by the Group for certain of its office properties.
Leases are negotiated for an average term of five years and rentals are fixed for an average of one year.
Share-Based Payments Annual Incentive Scheme In 2013, following the reduction in scope of the LTIP scheme, the Annual Incentive Scheme was introduced to provide an element of short-term incentive.
Some awards will include an element of IP Group shares, which will be subject to further time-based vesting over two years typically 50% after year 1 and 50% after year 2.
As at 31 December 2013 no such options or shares had been granted and there is no associated fair value.
However, as the number shares to be granted are based as a percentage of employees salary, the share-based payments line includes the associated expense incurred in 2013.
Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP awards Awards under the LTIP take the form of conditional awards of ordinary shares of 2p each in the Group which vest over the prescribed performance period to the extent that performance conditions have been met.
The Remuneration Committee imposes objective conditions on the vesting of awards and these take into consideration the guidance of the Groups institutional investors from time to time.
Further information on the Groups LTIP is set out in the Directors Remuneration Report set out on pages 53 to 70.
No LTIP awards were made in 2013.
The 2012 LTIP awards will ordinarily vest on 31 March 2015, to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
The awards are based on the performance of Groups Hard NAV and TSR.
Both performance measures are combined into a matrix format to most appropriately measure performance relative to the business, as shown in the Directors Remuneration report on page 63.
The total award is subject to an underpin based on the relative performance of the Groups TSR to that of the FTSE Small Cap index, which can reduce the awards by up to 50%.
The matrix is designed such that up to 100% of the award prior to the application of the underpin will vest in full in the event of both Hard NAV increasing by 15% per year on a cumulative basis from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2014 and TSR increasing by 15% per year on a cumulative basis from the date of award to 31 March 2015, using an industry-standard average price period at the beginning and end of the performance period.
Further, the matrix is designed such that 30% of the award shall vest again prior to the application of the underpin if the cumulative increase is 8% per annum for both measures over their respective performance periods threshold performance.
A straight-line sliding scale is applied for performance between the distinct points on the matrix of vesting targets.
The 2011 LTIP awards will ordinarily vest on 31 March 2014, to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
Deloitte LLP provided independent external advice to IP Groups Remuneration committee on the appropriate performance conditions to attach to the 2011 LTIP awards based on their experience of current market practice.
The 2012 awards were designed using on the same matrix structure, together with the FTSE small-cap index underpin, as was incorporated into the 2011 LTIP.
The 2010 LTIP awards partially vested on 16 April 2013 and on this date shares in IP Group were issued via the Groups employee benefit trust to the relevant members of the Companys staff accordingly.
50% of the awards were based on the increase in IP Groups Hard NAV, and 50% were based on IP Groups share price performance.
The table overleaf sets out the performance measures relating to the 2010 LTIP awards and the actual performance achieved.

Capital Management The Groups key objective when managing capital is to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
