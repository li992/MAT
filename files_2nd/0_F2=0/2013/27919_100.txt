What is Carbon Balanced Paper?
Carbon Balanced, put simply, is where the carbon impact of a product or service has been estimated and anequivalent amount of carbon dioxide is either prevented from being released or is absorbed from the atmosphere.
Carbon Balancing is facilitated by the World Land Trust, an ecological charity which ensures a companys peace of mind regarding the credibility and integrity of how carbon impacts are balanced offset.
Carbon Balancing is achieved through land purchase of ecologically important standing forests, under imminent threat of clearance, where carbon is locked that would otherwise be released.
These protected forests are then able to continue absorbing carbon from the atmosphere.
