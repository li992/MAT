Financial statements Section 4: Financial position Section 4 contains financial statement notes that relate to the financial position of the Group at 31 December 2013, along with the relevant accounting policies.
4.1 Goodwill Accounting policy Goodwill is measured on acquisition as the excess of the aggregate of consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and in the case of business combinations achieved in stages the acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
If the initial amount of goodwill is negative, the amount is recognised in profit or loss as a gain on a bargain purchase.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment tests, the goodwill arising from each business combination is allocated to cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the combination and which represent the lowest level within the Group at which management monitors goodwill.
The impairment test requires the Group to estimate the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the goodwill relates: this is performed with the assistance of external advisors.
Recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
The value in use of a CGU is measured by discounting the estimated future cash flows of the CGU to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate.
Fair value less costs to sell is generally measured using an earnings multiple approach using revenue and EBITA multiples obtained from comparable businesses and transactions.
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill Goodwill is allocated and monitored by management at a CGU level, consisting of the five business units operating across the Groups operating segments.
Not all business units are active in all segments: there are 11 CGUs at 31 December 2013 2012: 29 CGUs.
The reduction in CGUs in 2013 is due to the Delta sale 12 CGUs, the UBM Channel sale three CGUs, the merger of UBM Techweb and UBM Electronics three CGUs and the merger of UBM Live and UBM Built Environment one CGU.
For reporting purposes, the CGUs have been aggregated into the reportable segments, as shown in the tables below.
The CGUs are individually tested for impairment each year.
