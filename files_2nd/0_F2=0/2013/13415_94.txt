Other reserves reflect unrealised gains related to the transfer of investments between subsidiaries.
The profit and loss reserve of 865m 2012: 800m arose partly as a result of a provision of 214m against certain investments in subsidiaries in 2001 of which 156m was reversed in 2005.
Thedirectors consider the value of the remaining investments in subsidiaries is considerably more than their book value.
Accordingly, theremaining provision of 58m does not impact the distributable reserves of Rexam PLC which were 876m at 31 December 2013 2012: 808m after deducting 47m 2012: 50m in respect of share options capitalised in cost of investment.
