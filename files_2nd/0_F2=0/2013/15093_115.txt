31 Financial risk management The company and Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including: market risk including foreign currency risk and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures.
Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis except for credit risk relating to accounts receivable balances which each entity is responsible for managing.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, as well as credit exposures to Wholesale and to a lesser extent Retail customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For Wholesale customers, management assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors.
For those sales considered higher risk, the Group operates a policy of cash in advance of sale.
Sales to Retail customers are settled in cash, major credit cards or by PayPal.
The Group regularly monitors its exposure to bad debts in order to minimise exposure.
Credit risk from cash and cash equivalents is managed via banking with well-established banks with a strong credit rating.
