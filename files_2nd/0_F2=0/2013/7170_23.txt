OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL S FINANCIAL ST TA ATEMENT TEMENTS S SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 91 4 SEGMENTAL INFORMATION IFRS 8 Operating Segments IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identied on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources to the segment and to assess their performance.
As a result, the Group continues to segment the business into three regions, Asia Pacic, Continental Europe & Rest of World, and United Kingdom & Ireland.
There is no material difference between the segmentation of the Groups turnover by geographic origin and destination.
The Groups continuing operations comprise one class of business, that of qualied, professional and skilled recruitment.
Net fees and operating profit from continuing operations The Groups Management Board, which is regarded as the chief operating decision maker, uses net fees by segment as its measure of revenue in internal reports, rather than use turnover.
This is because net fees exclude the remuneration of temporary workers, and payments to other recruitment agencies where the Group acts as principal, which are not considered relevant in allocating resources to segments.
The Groups Management Board considers net fees for the purpose of making decisions about allocating resources.
The Group does not report items below operating profit by segment in its internal management reporting.
The full detail of these items can be found in the Group Consolidated Income Statement on page 83.
The reconciliation of turnover to net fees can be found in note 5.

Included in turnover in the prior year was an amount of approximately 587 million which arose from sales to the Groups largest customer, and was generated in the United Kingdom & Ireland.
This was the only customer to exceed 10% of the Groups turnover, however as it included a significant element of remuneration of temporary workers and other recruitment agencies, it represented less than 1% of the Groups net fees.

OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL S FINANCIAL ST TA ATEMENT TEMENTS S SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 97 13 GOODWILL In s million 2013 2012 Cost At 1 July 177.2 183.5 Exchange adjustments 0.1 6.3 At 30 June 177.3 177.2 Goodwill arising on business combinations is reviewed and tested on an annual basis or more frequently if there is indication that goodwill might be impaired.
Goodwill has been tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit CGU, including goodwill, with the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are as follows: Assumption How determined Operating profit The operating profit is based on the latest one-year forecasts for the CGUs approved by the Groups Management Board which are compiled using expectations of fee growth, consultant productivity and operating costs.
The Group prepares cash ow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by management and extrapolates cash ows in perpetuity based on the long-term growth rates and expected cash conversion rates.
Discount rates The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash ows is 12.5% 2012: 12.5% reecting current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the relevant CGUs.
The discount rate applied to the cash ows of each of the Groups operations is generally based on the weighted average cost of capital WACC adjusted for the risk free rate for ten year bonds issued by the government in the respective market.
Where government bond rates contain a material component of credit risk, high-quality local corporate bond rates may be used.
These rates are adjusted for a risk premium to reect the increased risk of investing in equities and where appropriate, the systematic risk of the specic Group operating company.
In making this adjustment, inputs required are the equity market risk premium that is the increased return required over and above a risk free rate by an investor who is investing in the market as a whole and the risk adjustment, beta, applied to reect the risk of the specic Group operating company relative to the market as a whole.
Growth rates The long-term growth rates are based on management forecasts, which are consistent with external sources of an average estimated growth rate of 2.0% 2012: 3.0%, reecting a combination of GDP expectations and long-term wage ination driving fee growth.
GDP growth is a key driver of the business, and is therefore a key consideration in developing long-term forecasts.
Wage ination is also an important driver of net fees as net fees are derived directly from the salary level of candidates placed into employment.
Based on past experience a combination of these two factors is considered to be an appropriate basis for assessing long-term growth rates.
Impairment reviews were performed at the year end by comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the recoverable amount of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
Management has determined that there has been no impairment to any of the CGUs and in respect of these a sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing recoverable amounts of goodwill.
This has been based on changes in key assumptions considered to be possible by Management.
This included a change in the discount rate of up to 1% and changes in the long-term growth rate from Year 2 onwards between 0% and 2% in absolute terms.
The sensitivity analysis shows no impairment would arise under each scenario for any of the CGUs.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: In s million 2013 2012 Asia Pacic 21.5 25.4 Continental Europe & Rest of World 62.7 58.7 United Kingdom & Ireland 93.1 93.1 177.3 177.2 98 HAYS PLC|ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2013 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 14 OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS In s million 2013 2012 Cost At 1 July 86.2 87.1 Exchange adjustments 0.2 0.5 Additions 1.4 6.1 Disposals 0.1 6.5 At 30 June 87.7 86.2 Amortisation At 1 July 30.7 24.2 Exchange adjustments 0.1 0.5 Charge for the year 12.6 13.5 Disposals 0.1 6.5 At 30 June 43.3 30.7 Net book value At 30 June 44.4 55.5 At 1 July 55.5 62.9 All other intangible assets relate to computer software.

Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to cash ow interest rate risk on oating rate bank loans and overdrafts.
At 30 June 2013 the Group had drawn down 145 million 2012: 170 million from its unsecured revolving credit facility.
In 2011 the Group entered into interest rate derivatives to partially hedge this risk.
The fair value of these derivatives at 30 June 2013 was 0.5 million 2012: 1.1 million.
The interest rate prole of bank loans and overdrafts is as follows: In s million 2013 2012 Floating rate sterling 145.2 171.6 The oating rate liabilities comprise bank loans and unsecured overdrafts bearing interest at rates based on local market rates.
Committed facilities The Group completed the renancing of a five-year 300 million unsecured revolving credit facility on 2 October 2012 which expires in October 2017.
The financial covenants, which are unchanged from the Groups previous facility, require the Groups interest cover ratio to be at least 4:1 and its leverage ratio net debt to EBITDA to be no greater than 2.5:1.
The interest rate of the facility is based on a ratchet mechanism with a margin payable over LIBOR in the range of 1.85% to 2.40%.
At 30 June 2013, 155 million of the committed facility was un-drawn.
Interest rates The weighted average interest rates paid were as follows: 2013 2012 Bank borrowings 2.8% 2.8% For each ten basis point fall or rise in the average LIBOR rate in the year there would be a reduction or increase in profit before tax by approximately 0.2 million.

Capital management The Boards priorities for free cash ow are to fund the Groups investment and development, maintain a strong balance sheet and deliver a sustainable dividend at a level that is affordable and appropriate.
The Board targets a dividend cover range of 2.0x to 3.0x, and remains committed to paying a sustainable and progressive dividend.
Further details can be found in the Financial Review on page 32.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which is represented by cash and cash equivalents note 18, bank loans and overdrafts note 19 and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 23 to 28.
The Group is not restricted to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Foreign currency risk The Group did not have a material income statement exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at 30 June 2013.
The Group does not use derivatives to hedge balance sheet and income statement translation exposure.
The Groups operating profit exposure to foreign currency translation is primarily in respect of the Euro and the Australian Dollar.

104 HAYS PLC|ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2013 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 21 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS Within the UK the Group operates one dened contribution scheme and two dened benefit schemes.
The majority of overseas arrangements are either dened contribution or government-sponsored schemes and these arrangements are not material in the context of the Group results.
a UK Dened Contribution Scheme The Hays Group Personal Pension Plan is funded via an employee salary sacrifice arrangement and, for eligible employees, additional employer contributions.
Employer contributions are in the range of 2% to 18% of pensionable salary depending on the level of employee contribution and seniority.
The total cost charged to the Consolidated Income Statement of 5.1 million 2012: 3.4 million represents employers contributions payable to the money purchase arrangements.
Contributions of 0.4 million 2012: 0.3 million were outstanding at the end of the year.
The assets of the money purchase arrangements are held separately from those of the Group.
b UK Dened benefit Schemes i The Hays Pension Scheme is a dened benefit scheme where the benets are based on employees length of service and final pensionable pay.
It is a funded approved dened benefit scheme which is funded through a legally separate trustee administered fund.
ii The Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme is a supplementary unfunded unapproved retirement benefit scheme for employees who were subject to HMRCs earnings cap on pensionable salary.
On 30 June 2012 the Group closed its UK dened benefit pension schemes to the accrual of future benets.
The closure resulted in a curtailment gain of 6.0 million which was recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the prior year see note 5.
Employees in these schemes became eligible to join the Hays Group Personal Pension Plan.
A formal actuarial valuation of the Hays Pension Scheme is carried out every three years.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the Hays Pension Scheme was performed at 30 June 2012.
Following this valuation, the deficit was 150 million and a revised deficit funding schedule was agreed with effect from 1 July 2012 which maintained the annual contribution at 12.8 million, subject to a 3% per annum xed uplift over a recovery period reduced to just under ten years.
During the year the Group made a contribution of 12.8 million to the Hays Pension Scheme 2012: 12.4 million in accordance with the agreed deficit funding schedule.
A roll forward of the actuarial valuation of the Hays Pension Scheme to 30 June 2013 and a valuation of the Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme have been performed by an independent actuary, who is an employee of Hymans Robertson LLP.
The key assumptions used at 30 June 2013 are listed below.
IAS 19 accounting valuation Hays plc has applied the accounting requirements of IAS 19 as follows: scheme assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date: scheme liabilities are measured using a projected-unit credit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high-quality corporate bonds of equivalent term to the liability: and actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, outside the Consolidated Income Statement, in retained earnings and presented in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The principal long-term assumptions are as follows: % 2013 2012 Discount rate 4.8 5.0 RPI ination 3.4 3.3 CPI ination 2.4 2.6 Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.4 3.3 Rate of increase of pensions in deferment 2.4 2.6 The discount rate has been constructed as a gilt yield plus a credit spread on high-quality debt instruments.
The RPI ination assumption is equivalent to valuing the liabilities on the government debt implied ination curve published by the Bank of England.
