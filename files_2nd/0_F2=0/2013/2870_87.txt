The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
In addition, within the 2008 LTIP is an average share price floor under which the share award will not vest.
This floor is based on the Companys average share price at the date of vesting.
No other features of options grant were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
