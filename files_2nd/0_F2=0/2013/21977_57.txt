Other derivatives Our policy is not to use derivatives for trading purposes.
However, due to the complex nature of hedge accounting under IAS 39, some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specically not designated as a hedge where natural offset is more appropriate.
Derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are held at fair value through profit and loss under IAS 39.
At 31 March 2013 the group held certain foreign currency forward and interest rate swap contracts which were not in hedging relationships.
These derivatives are disclosed on pages 83 and 84.
Foreign currency forward contracts were economically hedging operational purchases and sales.
The interest rate swap contracts became ineffective on first time adoption of IFRS.
The volatility arising from these swaps is recognised through the income statement but is limited due to a natural offset in their fair value movements.

The cumulative gains and losses are recycled to the income statement on disposal of the assets.
c The translation reserve is used to record cumulative translation differences on the assets and liabilities of foreign operations.
The cumulative translation differences are recycled to the income statement on disposal of the foreign operation.
d The merger reserve arose on the group reorganisation that occurred in November 2001 and represented the difference between the nominal value of shares in the new ultimate parent company, BT Group plc, and the aggregate of the share capital, share premium account and capital redemption reserve of the prior ultimate parent company, British Telecommunications plc.
