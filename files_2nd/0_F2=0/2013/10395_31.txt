Other items The group separately identifies and discloses restructuring and acquisition related items termed other items.
The results of the cyclical mechanical and electrical engineering contracting businesses which are being exited are also presented in other items.
During the year those businesses generated revenue of 139.9m 2012: 176.2m, and incurred a trading loss of 3.1m 2012: 0.9m and business closure costs of 22.1m 2012: nil.
The businesses being exited do not meet the definition of discontinued operations as stipulated by IFRS 5 Noncurrent Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations because the businesses have not been disposed of and there are no assets classified as held for sale.
Accordingly the disclosures within non-headline items differ from those applicable for discontinued operations.
Restructuring costs principally reflect the reorganisation of the overhead cost base in our Technical Facilities Management and Asset Management divisions.
Acquisition costs relate to the costs incurred as part of the acquisitions of Enara and Creativevents.
