Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
Basis of preparation Burberry Group plc and its subsidiaries the Group is a global luxury goods manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer.
The Group also licences third parties to manufacture and distribute products using the Burberry trade marks.
All of the companies which comprise the Group are controlled by Burberry Group plc the Company directly or indirectly.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC interpretations and parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
There have been no new standards, amendments or interpretations issued and made effective for the financial period commencing on 1 April 2012 that have had a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
As at 31 March 2013, the following new and revised standards, amendments and interpretations, which may be relevant to the Groups results, were issued but not yet effective: IFRS 9 Financial instruments This standard is the first step in the process to replace IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement, and introduces new requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets and financial liabilities.
The standard is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015 and has not currently been endorsed by the EU.
Any potential impact of this new standard will be quantified closer to the date of adoption.
IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements This standard establishes the principles for the presentation and preparation of consolidated financial statements and replaces similar principles set out in IAS 27 Consolidated and separate financial statements.
The standard is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 and has been endorsed by the EU.
The adoption of this new standard is not considered likely to have a material impact on the financial position or financial performance of the Group.
IFRS 11 Joint arrangements IFRS 11 updates the approach currently set out in IAS 28 Investments in associates by focusing on the rights and obligations of the arrangement rather than its legal form.
IFRS 12 Disclosures of interests in other entities This standard requires disclosure of information about the nature of, and risks associated with, the Groups interests in other entities, as well as the impact of these interests on the Groups financial position, financial performance and cash flows.
Any potential impact of this new standard will be limited to disclosure, and it is not considered likely to have a material impact.
IFRS 13 Fair value measurement This standard aims to provide a precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements to be used across all IFRSs.
The standard is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 and has been endorsed by the EU.
Amendment to IAS 1 Financial statement presentation The amendment requires entities to group items presented in Other Comprehensive Income on the basis of whether they will be recycled through profit or loss at a later date, when specific conditions are met.
The amendment is effective from 1 July 2012.
The amendments do not address which items are presented in Other Comprehensive Income, and as such the impact on the Group will be limited to presentation.
Basis of consolidation The Groups annual financial statements comprise those of Burberry Group plc the Company and its subsidiaries, presented as a single economic entity.
The results of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Company, using consistent accounting policies across the Group.
Subsidiaries are all entities including special purpose entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
Where there is a loss of control of a subsidiary, the consolidated financial statements include the results for the portion of the reporting period during which the Group had control.
Intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised profits on transactions between Group companies are eliminated in preparing the Group financial statements.
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group.
For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity.
Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.
113 Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
Basis of preparation continued Key sources of estimation and judgement Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires that management make certain judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities.
If in the future such estimates and assumptions, which are based on managements best judgement at the date of the financial statements, deviate from actual circumstances, the original estimate and assumptions will be updated as appropriate in the period in which the circumstances change.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The key areas where the estimates and assumptions applied have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities are discussed below: Valuation of the fragrance and beauty intangible The Group made a payment to Interparfums SA of 181.2m on 21 December 2012 to terminate the existing fragrance and beauty licence relationship 142.2m at the spot rate at the time of exercise.
This has resulted in the recognition of an intangible asset of 70.9m and an expense of 71.3m in the current period.
In order to identify the carrying value of the intangible asset acquired, management was required to estimate the incremental income that will be earned by the Group from 1 April 2013 to 31 December 2017, which represents the remaining period of the original licence, prior to its termination.
A value-in-use calculation has been performed, based on the key forecast assumptions including: sales of products until 2017, by product category: operating margins achieved on this activity: tax charged on the incremental profits: the working capital required to support this activity: and anticipated tax relief on the payment made to acquire the intangible asset.
Such forecast assumptions are inherently uncertain and the actual cash flows between 1 April 2013 and 31 December 2017 may differ materially from these assumptions.
Refer to notes 6 and 11 for further details of the accounting for this transaction.
Put option liability over non-controlling interest The calculation of the fair value of the put option over the non-controlling interest in the Groups business in China is based on the contractual agreement and requires the application of key assumptions around both the future performance of the Groups business in China and the future performance of the Group, the Burberry Group plc market capitalisation at the date of exercise and the risk free rate in China.
Refer to notes 19 and 25 for further details of the put option liability.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount of an asset or a cash generating unit is determined based on value-in-use calculations prepared on the basis of managements assumptions and estimates.
Refer to note 12 for further details of property, plant and equipment.
Inventory provisioning The Group manufactures and sells luxury goods and is subject to changing consumer demands and fashion trends.
As a result it is necessary to consider the recoverability of the cost of inventories and the associated provisioning required.
When calculating the inventory provision, management considers the nature and condition of the inventory, as well as applying assumptions around anticipated saleability of finished goods and future usage of raw materials.
Refer to note 16 for further details of the carrying value of inventory.
Income and deferred taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
Judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes in each territory.
There are many transactions and calculations during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due.
Where the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts which were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions and assets in the period in which such determination is made.
Refer to notes 8 and 14 for further details of income and deferred tax balances.
114 Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
Basis of preparation continued Key sources of estimation and judgement continued Impairment of trade receivables The Group is required to make an estimate of the recoverable value of trade receivables.
When assessing impairment of trade receivables, management considers factors including the ageing profile of debtors as well as any specific known problems or risks.
Given global economic conditions and the range of countries the Group trades in, unanticipated future events may occur that could impact the appropriateness of the assessment made as to the recoverability of the Groups trade receivables.
Refer to notes 15 and 25 for further details on the net carrying value and credit quality of trade receivables.
Impairment of goodwill The Group is required to test at least annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment.
The recoverable amounts of cash generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing operation of the cash generating unit and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
Refer to note 11 for further details of goodwill balances.
Accounting policies The principal accounting policies of the Group are: a Revenue Revenue, which is stated excluding Value Added Tax and other sales related taxes, is the amount receivable for goods supplied less returns, trade discounts and allowances and royalties receivable.
Wholesale sales are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer, with provisions made for expected returns and allowances.
Retail sales, returns and allowances are reflected at the dates of transactions with customers.
Provisions for returns on retail and wholesale sales are calculated based on historical return levels.
Royalties receivable from licensees are accrued as earned on the basis of the terms of the relevant royalty agreement, which is typically on the basis of production volumes.
In arrangements where the Group acts as a purchasing agent to facilitate the procurement of Burberry branded products on behalf of its licensees, the purchases and sales from the supplier to the licensee are not recorded as transactions by the Group.
Any costs incurred by the Group are recorded as operating expenses and any agency fees receivable are recorded as operating income.
b Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance, has been identified as the Board of Directors.
c Business combinations The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
Contingent payments are remeasured at fair value through the Income Statement.
All transaction costs are expensed to the Income Statement.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity, and are initially measured either at fair value or at a value equal to the non-controlling interests share of the identifiable net assets acquired.
The choice of the basis of measurement is an accounting policy choice for each individual business combination.
The excess of the cost of acquisition together with the value of any non-controlling interest over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the Income Statement.
115 Notes to the Financial Statements 2.
Accounting policies continued d Share schemes The Group operates a number of equity-settled share based compensation schemes, under which services are received from employees including executive directors as consideration for equity instruments of the Company.
The cost of the share based incentives is measured with reference to the fair value of the equity instruments awarded at the date of grant.
Appropriate option pricing models, including Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo, are used to determine the fair value of the awards made.
The fair value takes into account the impact of any market performance conditions, but the impact of non-market performance conditions is not considered in determining the fair value on the date of grant.
Vesting conditions which relate to non-market conditions are allowed for in the assumptions used for the number of options expected to vest.
The estimate of the number of options expected to vest is revised at each balance sheet date.
In some circumstances, employees may provide services in advance of the grant date.
The grant date fair value is estimated for the purposes of recognising the expense during the period between the service commencement period and the grant date.
The cost of the share based incentives is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the awards, with a corresponding increase in equity.
When options and awards are exercised, they are settled either via issue of new shares in the Company, or through shares held in an ESOP trust, depending on the terms and conditions of the relevant scheme.
The proceeds received from the exercises, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital and share premium accounts.
e Leases The Group is both a lessor and lessee of property, plant and equipment.
Determining whether an arrangement is or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement.
Leases in which substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Gross rental expenditure income in respect of operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the leases.
Certain rental expenses are determined on the basis of revenue achieved in specific retail locations and are accrued for on that basis.
Amounts paid to received from the landlord to acquire or transfer the rights to a lease are treated as prepayments accrued income on the lease contract.
Lease incentives, typically rent free periods and capital contributions, are held on the Balance Sheet in accruals and deferred income and recognised over the term of the lease.
Finance leases where the Group is a lessee are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the lower of fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Interest is charged to the Income Statement and credited to the lease liability using the effective interest rate method.
Lease liabilities are held in other payables on the Balance Sheet.
The capitalised leased assets are held in property, plant and equipment on the Balance Sheet, and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the useful life of the leased asset.
f Dividend distributions Dividend distributions to Burberry Group plcs shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividend becomes a committed obligation.
Final dividends are recognised when they are approved by the shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
116 Notes to the Financial Statements 2.
Accounting policies continued g Pension costs Defined contribution schemes Eligible employees participate in defined contribution pension schemes, the principal one being in the UK with its assets held in an independently administered fund.
The cost of providing these benefits to participating employees is recognised in the Income Statement as they fall due and comprises the amount of contributions to the schemes.
Defined benefit schemes Eligible employees of the Group participate in defined benefit schemes in France and Taiwan.
The liability recognised on the Balance Sheet in respect of defined benefit schemes represents the Groups share of the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised past-service costs.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the Projected Unit Credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised directly in Other Comprehensive Income.
h Intangible fixed assets Goodwill Goodwill is the excess of the cost of acquisition together with the value of any non-controlling interest, over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill on acquisition is recorded as an intangible fixed asset.
Fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that existed at the date of acquisition, reflecting their condition at that date.
Adjustments are also made to align the accounting policies of acquired businesses with those of the Group.
Goodwill is assigned an indefinite useful economic life.
Impairment reviews are performed annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Impairment losses recognised on goodwill are not reversed in future periods.
Trade marks, licences and other intangible assets The cost of securing and renewing trade marks and licences, and the cost of acquiring other intangible assets such as key money is capitalised at purchase price and amortised by equal annual instalments over the period in which benefits are expected to accrue, typically ten years for trade marks, or the term of the lease or licence.
The useful economic life of trade marks and other intangible assets is determined on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreement and the nature of the asset.
Computer software The cost of acquiring computer software including licences and separately identifiable external development costs is capitalised as an intangible asset at purchase price, plus any directly attributable cost of preparing that asset for its intended use.
Software costs are amortised by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful economic lives, which are up to five years.
117 Notes to the Financial Statements 2.
Accounting policies continued i Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment, with the exception of assets in the course of construction, is stated at cost or deemed cost, based on historical revalued amounts, less accumulated depreciation and provision to reflect any impairment in value.
Assets in the course of construction are stated at cost less any provision for impairment and transferred to completed assets when substantially all of the activities necessary for the asset to be ready for use have occurred.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated to write off the cost or deemed cost, less residual value, of the assets in equal annual instalments over their estimated useful lives at the following rates: Type of asset Category of property, plant and equipment Useful life Land Freehold land and buildings Not depreciated Freehold buildings Freehold land and buildings Up to 50 years Leaseholds Leasehold improvements Over the unexpired term of the lease Plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings Fixtures, fittings and equipment 3 8 years Retail fixtures and fittings Fixtures, fittings and equipment 2 5 years Office equipment Fixtures, fittings and equipment 5 years Computer equipment Fixtures, fittings and equipment Up to 5 years Assets in the course of construction Assets in the course of construction Not depreciated Profit loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment Profits and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment represent the difference between the net proceeds and net book value at the date of sale.
Disposals are accounted for when the relevant transaction becomes unconditional.
j Impairment of non-financial assets Assets that have an indefinite useful economic life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash generating units.
Non-financial assets, other than goodwill, for which an impairment has been previously recognised are reviewed for possible reversal of impairment at each reporting date.
k Investment properties Investment properties are freehold properties held to earn rentals and or for capital appreciation.
Investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and provision to reflect any impairment in value.
Cost includes the original purchase price plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
Investment properties are depreciated on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of up to 50 years.
l Discontinued operations and assets classified as held for sale A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that has been disposed of, has been abandoned or meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.
Discontinued operations are presented on the Income Statement as a separate line and are shown net of tax.
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continued use, and a sale within the next twelve months is considered to be highly probable.
Assets classified as held for sale cease to be depreciated and they are stated as the lower of carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.
m Inventories Inventories and work in progress are valued on a first-in-first-out basis at the lower of cost including an appropriate proportion of production overhead and net realisable value.
Where necessary, provision is made to reduce cost to no more than net realisable value having regard to the nature and condition of inventory, as well as its anticipated saleability.
118 Notes to the Financial Statements 2.
Accounting policies continued n Taxation Tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax charge.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense which are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items which are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates which have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liabilities method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, if the temporary difference arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, no deferred tax will be recognised.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entities or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
o Provisions Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, for which it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
When the effect of the time value of money is material, provision amounts are calculated based on the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.
The present value is calculated using forward market interest rates as measured at the balance sheet reporting date, which have been adjusted for risks reflected in future cash flow estimates.
Property obligations A provision for the present value of future property reinstatement costs is recognised where there is an obligation to return the leased property to its original condition at the end of an operating lease.
Where a leased property is no longer expected to be fully occupied or where the costs exceed the future expected benefits, an onerous lease provision will be recognised for that portion of the lease excess to the Groups requirements and not fully recovered through sub-leasing, or through value-in-use.
Restructuring costs Provisions for costs associated with restructuring programmes are recognised when a detailed formal restructuring plan has been approved and communicated.
Examples of restructuring related costs include employee termination payments, contract termination penalties and onerous contract payments.
p Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity attributable to owners of the Company until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to owners of the Company.
119 Notes to the Financial Statements 2.
Accounting policies continued q Financial instruments A financial instrument is initially recognised at fair value on the Balance Sheet when the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flow expire or substantially all risks and rewards of the asset are transferred.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Subsequent to initial recognition, all financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method except for derivatives, which are classified as held for trading, except where they qualify for hedge accounting, and are held at fair value.
Financial liabilities held at amortised cost include trade payables, accruals and borrowings.
The Group classifies its instruments in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through the profit or loss and loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables include trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Derivatives are classified as held for trading, unless in a hedging relationship, and are held at fair value.
Financial instrument category Note Classification Measurement Cash and cash equivalents 18 Loans and receivables Amortised cost Trade and other receivables 15 Loans and receivables Amortised cost Trade and other payables 19 Other financial liabilities Amortised cost Borrowings 21 Other financial liabilities Amortised cost Put option over non-controlling interest 19 Derivative instrument Fair value through profit and loss 1 Forward foreign exchange contracts 17 Derivative instrument Fair value through profit and loss Equity swap contracts 17 Derivative instrument Fair value through profit and loss Onerous lease 20 Other financial liabilities Amortised cost 1 Hedge accounting is applied to cash flow hedges to the extent it is achievable.
The Groups primary categories of financial instruments are listed below: Cash and cash equivalents On the Balance Sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term deposits with a maturity date of three months or less, held with banks and liquidity funds.
In the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents also include bank overdrafts, which are recorded under current liabilities on the Balance Sheet.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than twelve months after the balance sheet date.
Receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
The amount of the movement in the provision is recognised in the Income Statement.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are included in current liabilities, except for maturities greater than twelve months after the balance sheet date.
Payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, inclusive of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost and the difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the Income Statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the balance sheet date.
Put option liabilities over non-controlling interest Put options over shares in subsidiaries held by non-controlling interests are recognised initially at fair value through equity when granted.
They are subsequently re-measured at fair value at each reporting period with the change in fair value recorded in the Income Statement as other finance expenses and income.
120 Notes to the Financial Statements 2.
Accounting policies continued q Financial instruments continued Derivative instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates arising on certain trading transactions.
The principal derivative instruments used are forward foreign exchange contracts taken out to hedge highly probable cash flows in relation to future sales, royalty receivables and product purchases.
To manage interest rate risk the Group manages its proportion of fixed and floating rate borrowings to within limits approved by the Board using interest rate swap derivatives.
It designates foreign currency borrowings in a net investment hedge of the assets of overseas subsidiaries.
When hedge accounting is applied, the Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedging instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the trade date and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either: 1 hedges of the fair value of recognised assets and liabilities or a firm commitment fair value hedge : or 2 hedges of highly probable forecast transactions cash flow hedges : or 3 classified as held for trading.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Income Statement immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is deferred in Other Comprehensive Income.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Amounts deferred in Other Comprehensive Income are recycled in the Income Statement in the periods when the hedged item affects the Income Statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at the time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the Income Statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the Income Statement within other gains losses net.
If a derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge, the subsequent change to the fair value is recognised in the Income Statement within operating expenses or interest depending upon the nature of the instrument.
Where the Group hedges net investments in foreign operations through foreign currency borrowings, the gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and will be reclassified to the Income Statement when the foreign operation that was hedged is disposed of.
121 Notes to the Financial Statements 2.
Accounting policies continued r Foreign currency translation Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling which is the Companys functional and the Groups presentation currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies within each entity in the Group are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which are held at the year end, are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences on monetary items are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they arise, except where these exchange differences form part of a net investment in overseas subsidiaries of the Group, in which case such differences are taken directly to the foreign currency translation reserve.
Translation of the results of overseas businesses The results of overseas subsidiaries are translated into the Groups presentation currency of Sterling each month at the weighted average exchange rate for the month according to the phasing of the Groups trading results.
The weighted average exchange rate is used, as it is considered to approximate the actual exchange rates on the date of the transactions.
The assets and liabilities of such undertakings are translated at the year end exchange rates.
Differences arising on the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiary companies, and on the translation of their results, are taken directly to the foreign currency translation reserve.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.
The principal exchange rates used were as follows: Average rate Closing rate Year to Year to As at As at 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March 2013 2012 2013 2012 Euro 1.22 1.16 1.18 1.20 US Dollar 1.58 1.60 1.52 1.60 Chinese Yuan Renminbi 9.91 10.15 9.44 10.07 Hong Kong Dollar 12.25 12.38 11.79 12.41 Korean Won 1,758 1,775 1,691 1,811 The average exchange rate achieved by the Group on its Yen royalty income, taking into account its use of Yen forward foreign exchange contracts on a monthly basis approximately twelve months in advance of royalty receipts, was Yen 126.9: 1 in the year to 31 March 2013 2012: Yen 133.1: 1. s Adjusted profit before taxation and exceptional items Exceptional items include those items that are largely one-off and material in nature.
The Group presents these items in note 6 to the accounts in profit before taxation.
Fair value movements on options held over equity interests, which are held for the purpose of future business developments, rather than speculative purposes, are also considered to be exceptional items and are separately presented in the Income Statement.
These items are added back deducted from profit loss before taxation to arrive at adjusted profit loss before taxation.
These items and their related tax impacts are added back deducted from profit attributable to owners of the Company to arrive at adjusted earnings per share.
These measures are disclosed in order to provide additional consideration of the underlying performance of the Groups ongoing business.
122 Notes to the Financial Statements 3.
Segmental analysis The Chief Operating Decision Maker has been identified as the Board of Directors.
The Board reviews the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports used by the Board.
The Board considers the Groups business through its two channels to market, being retail wholesale and licensing.
Retail wholesale revenues are generated by the sale of luxury goods through Burberry mainline stores, concessions, outlets and digital commerce as well as Burberry franchisees, prestige department stores globally and multi-brand specialty accounts.
The flow of global product between retail and wholesale channels and across our regions is monitored and optimised at a corporate level and implemented via the Groups inventory hubs situated in Asia, Europe and the USA.
Licensing revenues are generated through the receipt of royalties from the Groups partners in Japan and global licensees of fragrances, eyewear, timepieces and European childrenswear.
The Board assesses channel performance based on a measure of adjusted operating profit.
This measurement basis excludes the effects of exceptional items.

Exceptional items Termination of licence relationship During the year ended 31 March 2013, a total of 82.9m has been recognised as an exceptional item relating to the termination of the fragrance and beauty licence relationship with Interparfums SA.
A tax credit of 19.1m has been recognised on this exceptional charge in the current period.
On 16 July 2012, the Group exercised its right to terminate its fragrance and beauty licence relationship with Interparfums SA in exchange for a payment of 181.2m 142.2m at the spot rate of 1.27: 1 on the date of exercise.
The payment was made on 21 December 2012 144.1m at the spot rate prevailing on the date of payment and the termination was effective from 1 April 2013.
The terms of the termination were set out in the licence agreement, as modified by a subsequent transition agreement signed on 10 October 2012.
If the licence relationship had not been terminated it would have expired on 31 December 2017.
70.9m of this payment has been capitalised as an intangible asset within the category trade marks, licences and other intangible assets refer note 11.
The remaining 71.3m, which does not qualify to be capitalised as an intangible asset, has been recognised as an expense in the current period.
The 71.3m expense has been recognised as an exceptional item, due to the size and nature of the transaction.
Other costs, which were incurred by the Group in the year as a result of the transaction, have been included within the total reported exceptional item of 82.9m relating to the termination of the fragrance and beauty licence relationship.
These other costs are separately presented in order to provide additional consideration of the underlying performance of the Groups ongoing business in the year.
The analysis of the exceptional item relating to the termination of the fragrance and beauty licence relationship and details of the other costs are as follows: Year to 31 March 2013 m Payment to Interparfums SA 71.3 Professional fees 0.5 Net foreign exchange loss 2.2 Set up costs 8.9 Total exceptional item relating to termination of licence relationship 82.9 Professional fees Professional fees of 0.5m were incurred as a result of the transaction, mainly relating to legal services, tax advice and valuation services.
Net foreign exchange loss The payment to Interparfums SA was hedged through taking out forward contracts, which matured on 21 December 2012.
These contracts had a combined effective average rate of 1.26: 1, compared to the 1.27: 1 used to initially record the transaction.
This has resulted in a difference of 2.2m between the Sterling equivalent of the amount to settle the creditor with Interparfums SA and the amount to settle the forward contract.
Set up costs Set up costs of 8.9m were incurred during the year.
These set up costs will not recur in future years, and solely represent expenses incurred as a result of transitioning the fragrance and beauty business from a licensed operation to a directly operated business.
The direct operation is effective from 1 April 2013 and hence these set up costs did not relate to the Groups ongoing business in the year.
Further costs incurred in relation to the fragrance and beauty business from 1 April 2013 will not be treated as exceptional, other than amortisation of the intangible asset relating to the termination of the licence relationship.
The set up costs include marketing costs which would have been borne by Interparfums SA if the licence relationship had not been terminated: the cost of employees hired in the current year to support the direct operation from 1 April 2013: rental costs for a new distribution centre for the Beauty business: system development expenses: consultancy fees, registration fees and contractual obligations in relation to equipment and inventory purchases arising from the transition agreement.

The payment was made on 21 December 2012 and the termination was effective from 1 April 2013.
The payment of 181.2m has given rise to an intangible asset of 70.9m and an expense of 71.3m at the spot rate of 1.27: 1 on 16 July 2012.
The intangible asset relates to the present value of the anticipated incremental income which will be earned by the Group, as a result of selling fragrance and beauty products through retail and wholesale channels rather than under licence, from 1 April 2013 to 31 December 2017, being the remaining period of the original licence, prior to its termination.
In order to identify the carrying value of the intangible asset acquired, a value-in-use calculation has been performed, based on key forecast assumptions including: sales of products until 2017, by product category: operating margins achieved on this activity: tax charged on the incremental profits: the working capital required to support this activity: and anticipated tax relief on the payment made to acquire the intangible asset.
The asset is presented within the intangible asset category trade marks, licences and other intangible assets.
It will be amortised on a straight-line basis over the period 1 April 2013 to 31 December 2017.
The remaining 71.3m, which does not qualify to be capitalised as an intangible asset, has been recognised as an expense in the current period refer to note 6.

Intangible assets continued Impairment testing of goodwill The carrying value of the goodwill allocated to cash generating units: As at As at 31 March 31 March 2013 2012 m m 1 China 44.7 41.9 Korea 24.4 22.8 Other 17.2 16.5 Total 86.3 81.2 1 The goodwill reported for China does not include any goodwill attributable to the non-controlling interest.
The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually or where there is an indication that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of all cash generating units has been determined on a value-in-use basis.
Value-in-use calculations for each cash generating unit are based on projected three year pre-tax discounted cash flows together with a discounted terminal value.
The cash flows have been discounted at pre-tax rates reflecting the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for country specific tax rates and risks.
Where the cash generating unit has a non-controlling interest which was recognised as its proportionate interest in the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the acquisition date, the carrying amount of the goodwill has been grossed up, to include the goodwill attributable to the non-controlling interest, for the purpose of impairment testing the goodwill attributable to the cash generating unit.
The key assumptions contained in the value-in-use calculations include the future revenues, the margins achieved, the assumed life of the business and the discount rates applied.
The value-in-use calculations have been prepared using managements approved financial plans for the three years ending 31 March 2016.
These plans contain managements best view of the expected performance for the year ending 31 March 2014 and the expected growth rates for the two years ending 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2016.
The plans are based on the performance achieved in the current year and managements knowledge of the market environment and future business plans.
A terminal value has been included in the value-in-use calculation based on the cash flows for the year ending 31 March 2016 incorporating the assumption that there is no growth beyond 31 March 2016.
For the material goodwill balances of China and Korea, a sensitivity analysis has been performed on the value-in-use calculations by assuming no growth beyond the year ending 31 March 2014.
This sensitivity analysis indicated significant headroom between the recoverable amount under this scenario and the carrying value of goodwill and therefore management considered no further detailed sensitivity analysis was required.
The discount rates for China and Korea were 15.6% and 13.1% respectively 2012: 14.4%: 12.5%.
No impairment has been recognised in respect of the carrying value of the goodwill balance in the year as, for each cash generating unit, the recoverable amount of goodwill exceeds its carrying value.

2 During the year ended 31 March 2012, 18.6m of assets were reclassified from fixtures and fittings to leasehold improvements as this was more representative of the nature of these assets.
During the year to 31 March 2013, a net impairment charge of 11.3m 2012: 3.8m was identified as part of the annual impairment review of the retail store assets.
Where indicators of impairment were identified, the impairment review compared the value-in-use of the assets to the carrying values at 31 March 2013.
The pre-tax cash flow projections were based on financial plans of expected revenues and costs of each retail cash generating unit, as approved by management, and extrapolated beyond the budget year to the lease exit dates using growth rates and inflation rates appropriate to each stores location.
The pre-tax discount rates used in these calculations were between 11.8% and 18.2% 2012: between 10.8% and 16.7%, based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for country-specific tax rates and risks.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the related benefit through the future taxable profits is probable.
The Group did not recognise deferred tax assets of 22.3m 2012: 20.3m in respect of losses and temporary timing differences amounting to 68.7m 2012: 57.8m that can be set off against future taxable income.
There is a time limit for the recovery of 14.1m of these potential assets 2012: 13.0m which ranges from six to ten years 2012: seven to ten years.
Included within other temporary differences above is a deferred tax liability of 0.6m 2012: 0.6m relating to unremitted overseas earnings.
No deferred tax liability is provided in respect of any future remittance of earnings of foreign subsidiaries where the Group is able to control the remittance of earnings and it is probable that such earnings will not be remitted in the foreseeable future, or where no liability would arise on the remittance.
The unrecognised deferred tax liability on unremitted earnings is 4.8m 2012: 2.0m.

Derivative financial instruments Cash flow hedges The Group Income Statement is affected by transactions denominated in foreign currency.
To reduce exposure to currency fluctuations, the Group has a policy of hedging foreign currency denominated transactions by entering into forward foreign exchange contracts.
These transactions are recorded as cash flow hedges.
The Groups foreign currency denominated transactions arise principally from royalty income, sales and purchases.
The Group manages these exposures through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.

Trade and other payables continued Following the acquisition of the Burberry retail and distribution business in China, Sparkle Roll Holdings Limited, a non-Group company, retains a 15% economic interest in the Groups business in China.
Put and call options exist over this interest stake which are exercisable after 1 September 2015 in the case of the call option, and after 1 September 2020 in the case of the put option.
The net present value of the put option has been recognised as a non-current financial liability under IAS 39.
The fair value of the put option has been derived using a present value calculation, incorporating observable and non-observable inputs Level 3.
The key inputs applied in arriving at the value of the put option are the future performance of the Group and that of the Groups business in China: the Burberry Group plc market capitalisation at the date of exercise: and the risk adjusted discount rate for China, taking into account the risk free rate in China.
The maturity of the Groups non-current financial liabilities excluding derivatives, retirement benefit obligations and onerous lease provisions, is as follows: As at As at 31 March 31 March 2013 2012 m m Between one and two years 1.2 1.9 Between two and three years 1.1 0.7 Between three and four years 0.5 0.3 Between four and five years 0.3 0.1 Over five years 57.0 59.8 Total 60.1 62.8 The fair value of trade and other payables approximate their carrying amounts and are unsecured.

Financial commitments The Group leases various retail stores, offices, warehouses and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements.
The leases have varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
The Group has commitments relating to future minimum lease payments under these non-cancellable operating leases as follows: As at As at 31 March 31 March 2013 2012 m m Amounts falling due: Within one year 139.9 118.6 Between two and five years 343.6 330.6 After five years 177.6 191.1 Total 661.1 640.3 The financial commitments for operating lease amounts calculated as a percentage of revenue revenue leases have been based on the minimum payment that is required under the terms of the relevant lease.
Under certain revenue leases, there are no minimums and therefore no financial commitment is included in the table above.
As a result, the amounts charged to the Income Statement may be materially higher than the financial commitment at the prior year end.
The total of future minimum payments to be received under non-cancellable leases on investment properties and subleases on land and buildings is as follows: Leases Subleases As at As at As at As at 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March 2013 2012 2013 2012 m m m m Amounts falling due: Within one year 0.7 0.7 1.2 0.7 Between two and five years 3.0 2.8 1.5 1.6 After five years 1.5 2.0 0.2 0.4 Total 5.2 5.5 2.9 2.7 141 Notes to the Financial Statements 24.

Financial risk management Other than derivatives, the Groups principal financial instruments comprise cash and short-term deposits, external borrowings, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables arising directly from operations.
The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risks including foreign exchange risk, share price risk and interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk.
Risk management is carried out by Group Treasury to reduce financial risk and to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest in cash assets safely and profitably.
This is done in close co-operation with the Groups operating units.
Group Treasury does not operate as a profit centre and transacts only in relation to the underlying business requirements.
The policies of the Group treasury department are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors.
The Group uses derivative instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Market risk Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures.
The Groups Income Statement is affected by transactions denominated in foreign currency.
To reduce exposure to currency fluctuations, the Group has a policy of hedging foreign currency denominated transactions by entering into forward foreign exchange contracts see note 17.
The Groups accounting policy in relation to derivative instruments is set out in note 2.
The Groups treasury risk management policy is to hedge anticipated cash flows in each major foreign currency that qualify as highly probable forecast transactions for hedge accounting purposes within the current or previous year.
The Group monitors the desirability of hedging the net assets of overseas subsidiaries when translated into Sterling for reporting purposes.
It has not entered into any specific transactions for this purpose within the current or previous year.
At 31 March 2013, the Group has performed sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of non-Sterling currencies strengthening weakening by 20% 2012: 20% against Sterling with all other variables held constant.
The effect on translating foreign currency denominated net debt, receivables, payables and financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss would have been to decrease increase post-tax profit for the year by 5.2m 2012: increase decrease 3.0m.
The effect on translating forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and Sterling denominated loans held in overseas subsidiaries would have been to increase decrease equity by 6.4m 2012: 12.1m.
The following table shows the extent to which the Group has monetary assets and liabilities at the year end in currencies other than the local currency of operation, after accounting for the effect of any specific forward foreign exchange contracts used to manage currency exposure.
Monetary assets and liabilities refer to cash, deposits, borrowings and amounts to be received or paid in cash.
Foreign exchange differences on retranslation of these assets and liabilities are recognised in the Income Statement.

To reduce exposure to fluctuations in the employers national insurance liability due to movements in the Groups share price, the Group has a policy of entering into equity swaps at the time of granting share options and awards.
The Group does not seek hedge accounting treatment for equity swaps.
The Group monitors its exposure to fluctuations in the employers national insurance liability on an ongoing basis.
An increase decrease in the share price of 50.0p would have resulted in an increase decrease in profit after tax of 1.2m 2012: 0.8m.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to cash, short-term deposits and external borrowings.
The floating rate financial liabilities at 31 March 2013 are 129.8m 2012: 208.6m.
This includes cash pool overdraft balances of 125.6m 2012: 204.7m which are offset by cash balances for the purpose of interest calculations.
At 31 March 2013, if interest rates on the remaining borrowings of 4.2m 2012: 3.9m had been 100 basis points higher lower 2012: 100 basis points with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been nil 2012: nil lower higher, as a result of higher lower interest expense on floating rate borrowings.
The fixed rate financial liabilities consist of amounts owed under a finance lease of 3.2m 2012: 1.8m.
The floating rate financial assets, being short-term deposits, are 191.7m as at 31 March 2013 2012: 284.3m.
At 31 March 2013, if interest rates on short-term deposits had been 100 basis points higher lower 2012: 100 basis points, with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 2.0m 2012: 2.8m higher lower, as a result of higher lower interest income on short-term deposits.
The Group has no other significant floating rate foreign currency borrowings and therefore is not materially exposed to movements in foreign currency interest rates.
Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The trade receivables balance is spread across a large number of different customers with no single debtor representing more than 7% of the total balance due.
The Group has policies in place to ensure that wholesale sales are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Sales to retail customers are made in cash or via major credit cards.
In addition, receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant and default rates have historically been very low.
An ageing of overdue receivables is included in note 15.
During the year the Group entered into a retail leasing arrangement in the Republic of Korea.
As part of this arrangement, a KRW 27bn 16.0m 15 year interest free loan was provided to the landlord.
The Group holds a registered mortgage over the leased property for the equivalent value of the loan which acts as collateral.
At 31 March 2013 the discounted fair value of the loan is 8.7m.
Other than this arrangement, the Group does not hold any other collateral as security.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date with respect to trade and other receivables is approximated by the carrying amount on the Balance Sheet.
143 Notes to the Financial Statements 25.
Financial risk management continued With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets, which comprise cash and short-term deposits and certain derivative instruments, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from the default of the counterparty with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying value of these instruments.
The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any financial institution and only deposits funds with independently rated financial institutions with a minimum rating of A.
The Group has deposited 0.1m 2012: 0.2m, CHF 0.3m 2012: CHF 0.3m, BRL nil 2012: BRL 0.6m, INR 0.2m 2012: INR 0.2m and AED 0.3m 2012: AED nil which is held as collateral at a number of European banks.
Liquidity risk The Groups financial risk management policy aims to ensure that sufficient cash is maintained to meet foreseeable needs and close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
For further details of this, see note 21.

K. to 71%, as a result of the exercise of an option over the 20% equity stake previously held by a minority interest partner, Mitsui and Co Limited refer note 30.

152 Notes to the Financial Statements 30.
Non-controlling interest in Burberry International K. K. On 29 March 2013, Burberry International Holdings Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Burberry Group plc, signed an amendment to the shareholder agreement for Burberry International Kabushiki Kaisha, a company in which Burberry International Holdings Limited held a controlling 51% interest at 31 March 2013.
The amendment entitles Burberry International Holdings Limited to the option to acquire the remaining equity in Burberry International K. K. from the minority interest partners, Mitsui and Co. Ltd and Sanyo Shokai Limited, at a nominal fixed price on or after 1 April 2013 and 1 April 2014 respectively.
The amendment also required the outstanding borrowings from Mitsui and Co. Ltd in Burberry International K. K. to be repaid, as described in note 21.
As a result of acquiring these call options, it is deemed that the risks and rewards of ownership of the non-controlling interest in Burberry International K. K. has transferred to Burberry International Holdings Limited.
Consequently, the non-controlling interest has been derecognised, resulting in a transfer of 4.2m in the year, from non-controlling interest to equity attributable to owners of the Company.
Contingent Liabilities The Group is subject to claims against it and tax audits covering, amongst others, valued added taxes, sales taxes, customs duties, corporate taxes and payroll taxes.
These arise in the normal course of business and in a number of jurisdictions.
These matters are inherently difficult to quantify.
Where appropriate, the estimated cost of known obligations have been provided in these accounts in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
While changes to the amounts that may be payable could be material to the results or cash flows of the Group in the period in which they are recognised the Group does not expect the outcome of these contingent liabilities to have a material effect on the Groups financial condition.
