The return on equities is 3.7% per annum in excess of the yield on government bonds.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The assumed long-term rate of return on each asset class is set out within this note.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class over the actual asset allocation at 31 March 2013.
