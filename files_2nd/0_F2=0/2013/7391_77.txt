the recoverable amounts of the cgus are determined from value-in-use calculations.
the value-in-use calculations are based on cash flows over three years grown at 2% in perpetuity.
the key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding the discount rates and compound annual cash flow growth rate for the three-year business plan.
management estimates discount rates using Wacc rates that reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cgus.
the discount rates used varied between 12.3% and 21.3% based on the markets in which the cgus operate.
the compound annual cash flow growth rates range from 4% growth to 55% growth.
the group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each cgus carrying value.
in each case the valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of the related goodwill.
Whilst there is some uncertainty regarding the short-term impact of the political events in mena, the group does not consider that the likelihood of impairment losses in the long-term has increased.
