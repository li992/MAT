The estimated impact of the amendment to IAS 19 for the year ended 28 June 2014, is a 10m reduction in net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent.
The effective dates stated above are those given in the original IASB standards and interpretations.
As the Group prepares its financial statements in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the European Union EU, the application of new standards and interpretations will be subject to their having been endorsed for use in the EU via the EU endorsement mechanism.
In the majority of cases this will result in an effective date consistent with that given in the original standard or interpretation.
Segmental analysis For management purposes, the Group is organised into four reportable segments: Deregulated Bus, Regulated Bus, Rail and Go-Ahead North America.
Operating segments within those reportable divisions are combined on the basis of their long term characteristics and similar nature of their products and services, as follows: The Deregulated Bus division comprises bus operations outside London.
The Regulated Bus division comprises bus operations in London under control of Transport for London TfL.
The Rail operation, Govia, is 65% owned by Go-Ahead and 35% by Keolis and comprises three rail franchises: Southern, Southeastern and London Midland.
The registered office of Keolis UK Limited is in England and Wales.
The Go-Ahead North America division comprises a 50% investment in a US school bus operation.
The Groups share of the profit of this division is currently nil 2012: nil, and it is therefore not shown separately within the tables below but aggregated within Deregulated Bus.
The information reported to the Group Chief Executive in his capacity as chief operating decision maker does not include an analysis of assets and liabilities and accordingly IFRS 8 does not require this information to be presented.
Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss excluding amortisation of goodwill and intangible assets and exceptional items.
Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arms length basis similar to transactions with third parties.
The following tables present information regarding the Groups reportable segments for the year ended 29 June 2013 and the year ended 30 June 2012.
