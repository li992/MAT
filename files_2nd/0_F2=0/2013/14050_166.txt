The impact of changes in statutory tax rates relates principally to the reduction of the UK corporation tax rate from 24% to 23% from 1 April 2013, which was enacted on 17 July 2012.
In addition, the UK corporation tax rate was reduced from 23% to 21% from 1 April 2014 and from 21% to 20% from 1 April 2015, which was enacted on 17 July 2013.
These changes have resulted in a deferred tax charge arising from the reduction in the balance sheet carrying value of deferred tax assets to reflect the anticipated rate of tax at which those assets are expected to reverse.
