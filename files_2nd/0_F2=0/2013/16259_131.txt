The defined benefit pension schemes included in the following disclosures are: i UK schemes: the United Pension Plan UPP, the United Magazines Final Salary Scheme UMFSS, the defined benefit section of the United Group Pension Scheme UGPS and the United Newspapers Executive Pension Scheme UNEPS : ii US schemes: the CMP Media LLC Cash Balance Retirement Plan and the CMP Post Retirement Medical Plan: and iii Retirement Indemnity Plans in France.
The UGPS, UMFSS and UPP schemes were merged on 30 December 2013 into a new scheme, the UBM Pension Scheme UBMPS.
All of the plans are final salary pension plans, which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided depends on members length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement.
The vast majority of the liabilities in the schemes relate to members who are no longer employed by the Group but are not yet retired deferred members, and pensions in payment.
Responsibility for governance of the plans including investment decisions and contribution schedules lies jointly with the Company and the Board of Trustees.
The Board of Trustees must comprise one-third nominated by the plan members and the remainder are appointed by the Company and can include independent appointees, in accordance with the plans regulations.
Deferred members benefits and pensions in payment are generally increased by a fixed amount or updated in line with the retail price index.
Plan assets are held in Trusts and are invested in accordance with the Statement of Investment Principles.
Every three years, in accordance with legislation, the Board of Trustees reviews the level funding of the pension plans and the level of contribution required by the Group to clear the deficit.
In 2012, the Group agreed to make special contributions to the UK pension schemes of 3.5m per annum until 31 January 2018.
This contribution schedule remains in place until the 2014 funding valuations are finalised expected in the first half of 2015.
UBM plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 113 Financial statements Section 7: Employee benefits continued 7.2 Retirement benefit obligations continued Revised accounting standard From 1 January 2013, the Group has adopted IAS 19 Employment benefits revised 2011 retrospectively.
As a result, the interest cost and expected returns on plan assets of defined benefit plans recognised in profit and loss have been replaced by the net interest on net defined benefit liability, calculated using the discount rate used to measure the net pension obligation.
Until 2012, the expected return on plan assets was based on an expected long-term out-performance of equities over government bonds.
Administration expenses are now recognised in the income statement rather than as part of the actuarial gains and losses.
Also, under the revised standard, unvested past service costs are recognised at the earlier of when the amendment occurs and when related restructuring and termination costs are recognised.
Previously, unvested past service costs were recognised by the Group as an expense on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
As there were no unvested past service costs as at 31 December 2012, there is no impact on the financial statements.
The impact on the consolidated financial statements is: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2013 2012 m m Increase in operating expenses 0.8 1.4 Increase in financing expenses 6.9 4.0 Decrease in current tax expense Net decrease in profit for the year continuing operations attributable to Owners of the parent entity 7.7 5.4 Increase in actuarial movements in other comprehensive income 7.7 5.4 Increase in tax effect on actuarial movements in other comprehensive income Net increase in other comprehensive income, net of tax 7.7 5.4 Net increase in total comprehensive income attributable to Owners of the parent entity Decrease in earnings per share Continuing operations basic and diluted 3.1 p 2.2 p Profit for the year basic and diluted 3.1 p 2.2 p There was no material impact on the statement of financial position or statement of cash flows.
Accounting policy For the defined contribution schemes, the contributions paid or payable in respect of employee service rendered during the accounting period are recognised as an expense in that period.
For the defined benefit pension schemes, the liability for the benefits earned by employees in return for service rendered in the current and prior periods is determined using the projected unit credit method as determined annually by qualified actuaries.
This is based upon a number of assumptions, the determination of which is significant to the valuation.
The following are charged to operating profit: the increase in the present value of pension scheme liabilities arising from employee service in the current period current service cost : the increase in the present value of pension scheme liabilities as a result of benefit improvements over the period during which such improvements vest past service cost : gains and losses arising on settlements curtailments: and scheme administration costs.
The pension schemes net finance expense recognised in the income statement is measured using the discount rate applied in measuring the defined benefit obligation.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Defined benefit pension surpluses are recognised when scheme rules indicate that such surpluses are recoverable as either an unconditional right to refund if the scheme were to be wound up or reductions in future contributions.
The availability of refunds or reductions of future contributions takes into account any minimum funding requirement of the UK defined benefit schemes.
Any tax expense arising on refunds is deducted from any surplus recognised.
Any gains or losses arising on the recognition of defined benefit plan surpluses or adjustments to such surpluses are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Defined contribution schemes The expense for the year for defined contribution schemes was 3.1m 2012: 4.2m.
Defined benefit schemes The most recent actuarial funding valuations for the majority of the UK scheme liabilities were carried out in 2011 and updated to 31 December 2013 for accounting purposes by independent qualified actuaries.
114 UBM plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 7.2 Retirement benefit obligations continued Assumptions and sensitivities Principal actuarial assumptions used in determining pension obligations for the Groups schemes: UK Other UK Other schemes schemes schemes schemes 2013 2013 2012 2012 % % % % Discount rate 4.40 n a 4.00 0.52 Future salary increases 3.75 n a 3.75 n a Weighted average pension increases 2.84 n a 2.70 n a Retail price inflation 3.10 n a 2.50 2.50 Consumer price inflation 2.35 n a 1.75 n a The discount rate has been based on available yields of AA rated corporate bonds of a similar duration to the scheme liabilities.
The inflation assumptions have been set by reference to the yield on the Bank of England implied inflation curve.
The mortality assumptions used at 31 December 2013 for UK schemes are consistent with those used for 31 December 2012.
The life expectancy rates used are 110% of the SAPS S1 tables based on the year of birth of scheme members, which is currently on average 1941 for pensioners and 1956 for non-pensioners.
Allowances for future improvements in mortality rates are in line with the CMI 2010 projections with a 0.75% p. a. long-term trend rate.
These projections allow for life expectancy to improve over time due to improvements in medical treatments and other lifestyle factors such that younger members who have not yet reached pensionable age are expected to live longer than current pensioner members.
The assumed average life expectancy of current pensioner members at age 65 is 21.3 years for males and 23.5 years for females 2012: 21.3 years and 23.5 years respectively.
For current non-pensioner members aged 45, the assumed average life expectancy at age 65 is 22.2 years for males and 24.6 years for females 2012: 22.2 years and 24.6 years respectively.
The average rate of improvement underlying the standard tables is an increase of approximately 0.6 years life expectancy in every ten years.
For the valuation of US scheme liabilities, RP 2000 tables projected using scale AA to 2019 2012: to 2019 are used in both years for all pensioner members.
The assumed average life expectancy of current pensioner members at age 65 is 19.1 years for males and 21.0 years for females 2012: 19.1 years and 21.0 years respectively.
Non-pensioner members are assumed to take cash lump sums at retirement.
Additional assumptions used for valuing the UK scheme liabilities are an allowance for all non-pensioners to take 15% of pension as tax free cash upon retirement 2012: 15%.
The discount rate, assumed salary increases and assumed mortality all have a significant effect on the measurement of the defined benefit obligation.
The sensitivity of the valuation to changes in these assumptions is as follows: Impact on Impact on deficit deficit 2013 2012 m m 0.25 percentage point decrease to discount rate 19.0 20.0 0.25 percentage point increase to discount rate 18.0 19.0 0.25 percentage point increase to inflation including pension increases linked to inflation 9.0 10.0 0.25 percentage point decrease to inflation including pension increases linked to inflation 9.0 9.0 One year increase to life expectancy 17.0 17.0 One year decrease to life expectancy 17.0 18.0 The sensitivity analyses above have been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on defined benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period.
Risks and uncertainties Plan assets are mainly invested in equities, bonds, gilts, property and diversified growth funds and are exposed to the risks outlined below: Asset volatility The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if plan assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
The plans hold a significant proportion of equities, which are expected to outperform bonds in the long-term while providing volatility and risk in the short-term.
The Group believes that due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities and the strength of the supporting group, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of the Groups long term strategy to manage the plans efficiently.
Some of the plans assets are invested in Diversified Growth Funds.
These funds invest in a wide range of assets including equities, bonds, commodities and cash.
These actively managed funds aim to provide equity-like returns over the medium to long term, but with less volatility.
The plan also holds fixed interest government and corporate bonds, the corporate bond funds contain allocations to sovereign and supranational bonds which are classified as fixed interest government bonds.
UBM plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 115 Financial statements Section 7: Employee benefits continued 7.2 Retirement benefit obligations continued Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans bondholdings.
Inflation Risk Some of the Group pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation.
Within the plans assets are some UK government bonds linked to inflation however the majority of the plans assets are either unaffected by inflation fixed interest bonds or loosely correlated with inflation equities, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy The majority of the plans obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans liabilities.

In March 2012, the Group agreed to replace previous letters of credit supporting scheme mergers with a guarantee for ten years issued by UBM plc to the Trustees of the UGPS.
Similarly, in June 2012, the Group agreed to put in place a guarantee for ten years issued by UBM plc and Wenport Limited to the Trustees of the UMFSS.
Under these guarantees, an amount up to the value of 35% of the aggregate liability of participating employers on the basis set out in Section 318 of the Pensions Act 2004 could be demanded by the Trustee in certain circumstances.
The main conditions under which the guarantees could be called upon relate to events which would imperil the interests of the scheme, such as insolvency, or the Group failing to make agreed payments.
