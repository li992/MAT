4 2 8.8p is the restated 2012 headline diluted earnings per share from continuing operations.
The Board believe that 9.4p is a more appropriate measure to use for 2012 to compare 2 against 2013 performance, being the headline diluted earnings per share from continuing operations assuming Elster was owned for the full year in 2012 unaudited, with an allowance for the finance costs of the acquisition for the period Elster was not owned and using a consistent number of shares in both years, at constant currency.
