A potential and corresponding deferred tax asset existed but was un-provided at the prior year end and will now not arise.
Therefore, there is a credit of 5.1m to the groups tax charge for the period, with no corresponding deferred tax debit, reducing the groups tax charge by 7.9%.
In addition, a prior year credit of 2.4m arose following the agreement of loss availability and settlement of other tax positions during the year.
The group works in an open and transparent manner and maintains a regular dialogue with HM Revenue & Customs.
This approach is consistent with the low risk rating we have been awarded by HM Revenue & Customs and to which the group is committed.
Strategic report Governance Financials Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 121 Movements in taxation during the year are set out below: Movements recognised Payments Movements in other Opening made in recognised in Exchange comprehensive Closing balance the year Transfers income adjustments income balance 2013 Movement in taxation m m m m m m m Current tax 24.4 16.4 5.9 13.9 Deferred tax Trading property uplift to fair value on acquisition 29.5 10.6 18.9 Investment property revaluation 6.1 1.5 0.3 4.9 Accelerated capital allowances 0.7 0.1 0.8 Short-term temporary differences 32.6 0.2 16.8 15.6 Actuarial gain deficit on BPT Limited pension scheme 0.7 0.2 0.5 Equity component of available-for-sale financial asset 1.2 0.2 1.0 Fair value movement in cash flow hedges and exchange adjustments 10.9 0.2 0.1 7.3 3.9 6.7 4.8 0.2 7.3 5.6 Total tax 2013 movement 17.7 16.4 10.7 0.2 7.3 19.5 2013 2012 m m Deferred tax balances are disclosed as follows: Deferred tax assets: non-current assets 20.1 44.5 Deferred tax liabilities: non-current liabilities 25.7 37.8 Deferred tax 5.6 6.7 Deferred tax has been predominantly calculated at a rate of 20% 2012: 23%.
In addition to the above the group has a contingent tax liability representing the difference between the carrying value of trading properties in the statement of financial position and their market value.
This contingent tax, which is not provided in the accounts, amounts to 86.1m 2012: 82.9m.
No benefit has been recognised in respect of unexpired trading losses carried forward with a tax value of nil 2012: 2.1m : or deductible temporary differences with a tax value of 1.1m 2012: 1.3m.
It is not possible for the group to identify the timing of movements in deferred tax between those expected within one year and those expected in greater than one year.
This is because movements in the main balances, both assets and liabilities, will be determined by factors outside the control of the group, namely the vacation date of properties and interest yield curve movements.
However, given the long-term nature of our property ownership, we anticipate that the balance will predominantly be crystallised in a period greater than one year.

Accordingly the groups results for this accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 23.5% and should be taxed at 22% in the 2014 period.
The change in tax rate has resulted in a 0.2m credit to the income statement in the current year.
Strategic report Governance Financials Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 123 The tax charge for the year is different to the charge for the year derived by applying the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 23.5% 2012: 25% to the profit before tax.
The differences are explained below: 2013 2012 m m Profit loss before tax 64.3 1.7 Profit loss before tax at a rate of 23.5% 2012: 25% 15.1 0.4 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 1.6 1.1 Goodwill impairment not tax deductible 1.1 Impact of tax rate change 0.2 0.2 Other losses and non-taxable items 0.6 0.1 Adjustment in respect of prior periods 7.5 2.9 10.7 2.1 As shown above, deferred tax has been taken directly to other comprehensive income in relation to the actuarial gain or loss on the BPT Limited pension scheme, the equity component of available-for-sale financial assets and the fair value movement in cash flow hedges and exchange adjustments.
The tax effect is shown separately within the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income on page 88.
Factors that may affect future tax charges In addition to the changes in rates of Corporation Tax disclosed above, a number of changes to the UK Corporation Tax system have been proposed or enacted.
A further reduction in the main rate has been enacted, reducing the main rate to 20% from 1 April 2015.
This reduction has been reflected in the deferred tax items in the balance sheet which are predominantly measured at this 20% rate.
This change is not therefore expected to further impact future tax charges.
