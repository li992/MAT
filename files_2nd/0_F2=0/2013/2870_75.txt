17 Business combinations 2013 acquisitions The Group made a number of acquisitions in 2013 which are shown in aggregate.
The fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired are disclosed in the table below: Fair value to Group recognised on acquisition Public sector subsidiary Other partnership acquisitions Total m m m Property, plant and equipment 3.9 26.0 29.9 Intangible assets 102.7 187.9 290.6 Trade and other receivables due in less than 1 year 3.7 50.9 54.6 Trade and other receivables due in more than 1 year 14.4 14.4 Corporation tax 1.6 1.6 Cash and cash equivalents 15.8 15.8 Trade and other payables excluding accruals due in less than 1 year 2.5 41.5 44.0 Accruals due in less than 1 year 10.9 54.9 65.8 Trade and other payables due in more than 1 year 2.0 2.0 Provisions 5.5 5.5 Deferred tax 2.1 23.0 25.1 Employee benefits liability 14.3 14.3 Finance leases 25.4 25.4 Public sector subsidiary partnership payment note 22 52.2 52.2 Long term debt 9.1 5.1 14.2 Net assets 33.5 124.9 158.4 Goodwill arising on acquisition 103.0 162.1 265.1 Non-controlling interest 66.9 66.9 69.6 287.0 356.6 Discharged by: Cash 34.9 232.9 267.8 Equity instruments 4.1 4.1 Contingent consideration accrued 26.1 26.1 Deferred consideration accrued 34.7 23.9 58.6 69.6 287.0 356.6 Public sector subsidiary partnerships represent a controlling interest in 3 public sector acquisitions in 2013, being 51% of the ordinary share capital of Axelos Limited and Entrust Support Services Limited and 100% of the ordinary share capital of Fire Service College Limited.
In all other cases 100% of the ordinary share capital was acquired.
The companies acquired have been mainly in the areas of IT and software, debt management, analytics, gamification, change management, and learning and development which complement or extend the Groups existing skill sets and provide opportunities for growth into these markets.
In addition, during the year the Group settled contingent consideration payments with regard to previous acquisitions amounting to 14.4m, all of which had been accrued.
Strategic report Governance Accounts Capita plc | 115 17 Business combinations continued Where this can be determined, the acquired subsidiaries contributed 11.6m to the profit before tax of the Group.
If these acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2013, Group revenue would have been an estimated 3,981.5m and Group profit before tax would have been an estimated 221.4m.
In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2013.
During the year, some of the acquired businesses have been completely integrated into the existing business of the Group and therefore their post-acquisition performance cannot be determined.
Goodwill has arisen on the acquisitions because the fair value of the acquired assets was lower than the consideration paid: the goodwill represents the value to the Group that can be driven from these underlying assets over the life of the acquired businesses, particularly from synergies, the capabilities of the acquired workforce, and commercialisation of formerly public sector assets.
The total amount of goodwill recognised in the period that is expected to be deductible for tax purposes is 103.4m 2012: 3.3m.
The fair value exercise has been completed on a provisional basis for acquisitions made in 2013.
The Group will complete this review in 2014 though any adjustment to the carrying value is likely to be insignificant to the individual acquisition.
In total, the effect of revisions made to fair value adjustments in the current year that had been determined provisionally at the immediately preceding balance sheet date increases goodwill by 16.9m, largely relating to an onerous contract provision acquired with the Reliance Secure Task Management acquisition.
These revisions increased provisions by 14.1m, accruals by 2.3m, and other payables by 0.5m as at 31 December 2012.
In respect of the acquisitions made in 2013, the Group has agreed to pay the vendors additional consideration dependent on the achievement of performance targets in the periods post acquisition.
These performance periods are of up to 4 years in duration and will be settled in cash and loan notes on their payment date on achieving the relevant target.
The range of the additional consideration payment is estimated to be between 20m and 35m.
The Group has included 26.1m as contingent consideration related to the additional consideration, which represents its fair value at the acquisition date.
Contingent consideration has been calculated based on the Groups expectation of what it will pay in relation to the post-acquisition performance of the acquired entities by weighting the probability of a range of payments to give an estimate of the final obligation.
Deferred consideration In respect of the acquisitions made in 2013, the Group has agreed to pay the vendors additional consideration post the year end period.
The Group has included 58.6m as deferred consideration, which represents its fair value at the acquisition date.
Acquisition related costs The Group incurred acquisition related costs of 14.3m related to professional fees paid for due diligence, general professional fees and legal related costs.
These costs have been included in non-underlying administrative expenses in the Groups consolidated income statement.
2012 acquisitions The Group made a number of acquisitions in 2012 which are shown in aggregate.
The fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired are disclosed in the table below: Fair value to Group recognised on acquisition m Intangible assets 81.3 Property, plant and equipment 4.8 Deferred tax 3.0 Bank loans and overdrafts 17.6 Trade and other receivables due in less than one year 59.0 Trade and other payables excluding Accruals due in less than 1 year 56.2 Accruals due in less than 1 year 44.4 Long term debt 57.1 Provisions 19.0 Corporation tax 5.1 Net assets 11.9 Goodwill arising on acquisition 146.9 135.0 Discharged by: Cash 126.6 Contingent consideration accrued 8.4 135.0 In all cases 100% of the ordinary share capital was acquired and the consideration satisfied in cash.
The companies acquired were mainly in the areas of pensions and employee benefits, security, health and travel and complement or extend the Groups existing skill sets and provide opportunities for growth into these markets.
In addition, during 2012 the Group settled contingent consideration payments with regard to previous acquisitions amounting to 12.0m, all of which had been accrued.
During 2012 some of the acquired businesses had been completely integrated into the existing businesses of the Group and therefore their post-acquisition performance could not be determined.
In aggregate for the year, the other acquired subsidiaries contributed 12.5m to the profit before tax of the Group.
If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2012, Group revenue would have been an estimated 3,478.2m and Group profit before tax would have been an estimated 295.5m.
In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2012.
The post acquisition revenue of Clinical Solutions benefited from a 5.6m release of deferred income included in the balance sheet at the date of acquisition arising from a change in the performance obligations and expected future costs of a significant contract.
