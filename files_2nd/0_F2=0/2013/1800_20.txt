12 DIsContInueD oPeRAtIons Rail disposal group Following a strategic review in light of low activity levels and the commoditisation of work, the Group decided to divest all of its Mainland European rail businesses over time.
The Group has been actively marketing its Mainland European rail businesses and accordingly, when it is probable that these businesses will be sold within a year and meet the criteria to be classified as an asset held for sale, or are sold or abandoned, they will form part of the Rail disposal group and be disclosed as discontinued operations.
To be classified as a discontinued operation, the businesses must represent a separate major line of business.
Other than the Mainland European rail businesses there are no significant Group operations in Mainland Europe and therefore by exiting these businesses, the Group is exiting from a separate major geographical operation and meets the criteria to classify these businesses as discontinued operations.
On 1 March 2013 the Group disposed of its interest in Rail Iberica SA Rail Spain to its local management for a cash consideration of 1 resulting in a net 4m loss on disposal.
On 28 June 2013 it was probable that Rail Germany and Rail Scandinavia would be disposed within a year and therefore met the criteria to be classified as an asset held for sale, with a 38m goodwill impairment.
Together with Rail Spain they constitute the Rail disposal group within discontinued operations.
On 1 August 2013, as the initial step in disposing of Rail Germany, the Group disposed of the Stassfurt Signalling Workshop to its local management for 1 resulting in a net loss of 1m and closed its Switches and Crossings manufacturing facility during the year.
On 10 December 2013, the Group announced that it had reached agreement to sell Rail Scandinavia to Strukton Rail BV resulting in a small gain.
This disposal is effective from 8 January 2014.
The Rail disposal group was part of the Construction Services segment.
uK facilities management disposal group Balfour Beatty WorkPlace BBW is the Groups only significant buildings facilities management business in the UK and represents a separate major line of business.
On 28 June 2013, it was probable that BBW would be disposed of within a year and therefore BBW met the criteria to be classified as an asset held for sale and consequently as a discontinued operation.
On 13 December 2013 the Group disposed of BBW to GDF Suez Energy Services for net cash consideration of 155m.

Cash flow forecasts are based on the expected workload of each cash-generating unit CGU giving consideration to the current level of confirmed and anticipated orders.
Cash flow forecasts for the next three years are based on the Groups 2014 budget and strategic roadmap.
The other key inputs in assessing each CGU are its revenue growth rate and discount rate.
The revenue growth rates have been applied to cash flows after three years into perpetuity and have been derived from estimated GDP growth rates based on published data for the economic environment of each CGU less 1.0% to reflect current economic uncertainties and their consequent estimated effect on public sector spending on infrastructure.
The cash flows assume a residual value based on a multiple of earnings before interest and tax.

The major assumptions that result in significant sensitivities are the discount rate and the long-term revenue growth rate.
Except as noted below, a reasonable possible change in a single assumption will not give rise to impairment in any of the Groups CGUs.
Using a pre-tax discount rate of 12.1% and revenue growth rate of 2.6% the recoverable amount of the remaining goodwill in the continuing Mainland Europe rail business is 25m based on value in use, with consequent headroom of 6m.
A 1.0% increase in the discount rate and a 1.0% reduction in the growth rate would lead to a further impairment of 1m.
The recoverable amount of the Blackpool International Airport goodwill is 4m with headroom of nil, based on the value in use of thetrading business and the fair value of the land.
Any decrease in the fair value of the land will lead to a commensurate impairment ofthe goodwill.

com ar2013 129 28 RetIReMent BeneFIt LIABILItIes 28.1 Group The Group, through trustees, operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
Defined contribution schemes are those where the Groups obligation is limited to the amount that it contributes to the scheme and the scheme members bear the investment and actuarial risks.
Defined benefit schemes are schemes other than defined contribution schemes where the Groups obligation is to provide specified benefits on retirement.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits Revised IAS 19 Revised prescribes the accounting for defined benefit schemes in the Groups financial statements.
Obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method and discounted to a net present value using the market yield on a high quality corporate bond.
The pension expense relating to current service cost is charged to contracts or overheads based on the function of scheme members and is included in cost of sales and net operating expenses.
The net finance cost arising from the expected interest income on plan assets and interest cost on scheme obligations is included in finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses are reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The IAS 19 Revised accounting valuation is set out in Note 28.2.
A different calculation is used for the formal triennial funding valuations undertaken by the scheme trustees to determine the future company contribution level necessary so that over time the scheme assets will meet the scheme obligations.
The principal difference between the two methods is that under the funding basis the obligations are discounted using a rate of return reflecting the composition of the assets in the scheme, rather than the rate of return on a high quality corporate bond as required by IAS 19 Revised for the financial statements.
Details of the latest formal triennial funding valuations are set out in Note 28.3.
The assets of the schemes do not include any direct holdings of the Groups financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, orother assets, of the Group.
Principal schemes The Groups principal schemes are the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund BBPF, which includes defined contribution and defined benefit sections, and the Balfour Beatty Shared Cost Section of the Railways Pension Scheme Railways Pension Scheme.
The defined benefit sections of both schemes are funded and closed to new members with the exception of employees where employment has transferred to the Group under certain agreed arrangements.
Pension benefits are based on employees pensionable service and their pensionable salary.
The schemes operate under trust law and are managed and administered by Trustees on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust deed and rules and relevant legislation.
Defined benefit contributions are determined in consultation with the Trustees, after taking actuarial advice.
The Trustees are responsible for establishing the investment strategy and ensuring that there are sufficient assets to meet the cost of current and future benefits.
These schemes expose the Group to investment and actuarial risks where additional contributions may be required if assets are not sufficient to pay future pension benefits: Investment risk: Equity returns are a key determinant of investment return but the investment portfolio is also subject to a range of other risks typical of the investments held, for example, credit risk on corporate bond holdings.
Actuarial risk: The ultimate cost of providing pension benefits is affected by inflation rates and members life expectancy.
The net present value of the obligations is affected by the market yield on a high quality corporate bond used to discount the obligations.
Changes in the principal actuarial assumptions based on market data, such as inflation and the discount rate, and experience, such as life expectancy, expose the Group to fluctuations in the net IAS 19 Revised liability and the net finance cost.
BBPF The investment strategy of the BBPF is to hold assets of appropriate liquidity and marketability to generate income and capital growth.
The BBPF invests partly in a diversified range of assets including equities and hedge funds in anticipation that, over the longer term, they will grow in value faster than the obligations.
The equities are in the form of pooled funds and are a combination of UK, other developed market and emerging market equities.
The remaining BBPF assets are principally fixed and index-linked bonds and swaps in order to match the duration and inflation exposure of the obligations and enhance the resilience of the funding level of the scheme.
The performance of the assets is measured against market indices.
Following the previous formal triennial funding valuation of the BBPF carried out as at 31 March 2010, the Group agreed to make ongoing deficit payments to the BBPF of 48m per annum from April 2010, increasing each year by CPI capped at 5% plus 50% of any increase in the Companys dividend in excess of capped CPI.
Following the merger of the Parsons Brinckerhoff Scheme with the BBPF the Group agreed to make additional deficit payments of 11m per annum, with the first payment made in October 2012.
During 2012 the Group also agreed to make additional conditional deficit contributions of 1m per month, payable quarterly in arrears, if the BBPF funding levels in any given month were below certain funding targets set out in the BBPF journey plan, with the first payment made in January 2013.
A formal triennial funding valuation of the BBPF was carried out as at 31 March 2013.
As a result the Group agreed with effect from April 2013 to make revised ongoing deficit payments of 50m per annum, increasing to: 55m per annum from April 2016: 60m per annum from April 2017: and 65m per annum from April 2018 to May 2020, increasing each year by CPI minimum 0% and capped at 5% plus 200% of any increase in the Companys dividend in excess of capped CPI.
If the Company makes any one-off return of value to shareholders such as a special dividend, share buy-back, capital payment or similar before the next actuarial valuation is agreed, there will be an additional increase in the deficit payment for the following year only, calculated as the regular deficit payment for that year multiplied by 75%, multiplied by the value of the one-off return of value, divided by the total of the regular dividends for the year in which the one-off return was made.
The Group has the ability to use surplus funds in the defined benefit section of the BBPF to pay its contributions towards future service benefits in the defined benefit and defined contribution sections of the scheme.
In 2012 a pension increase exchange PIE offer to certain current pensioners, widows and widowers of the BBPF, to forego their entitlement to future non-statutory inflation increases in return for a higher pension than their current entitlement, resulted in a 2m reduction to the pension liability and a consequential net past service cost credit of 2m.

During 2013 various group restructurings resulted in an additional 1m curtailment charge.
Railways Pension Scheme The economic interest of the Group in the Railways Pension Scheme is approximately 60% of the schemes assets and liabilities based on the relevant provisions of the trust deed and rules and trustee guidelines regarding future surplus apportionments and deficit financing.
The Railways Pension Scheme invests in a range of pooled investment funds intended to generate a combination of capital growth and income and as determined by the Trustee, taking account of the characteristics of the obligations and the Trustees attitude to risk.
The majority of the Railways Pension Schemes assets that are intended to generate additional returns, over the rate at which the obligations are expected to grow, are invested in a single pooled growth fund.
This fund is invested in a wide range of asset classes and the fund manager RPMI has the discretion to vary the asset allocation to reflect its views on the relative attractiveness of different asset classes at any time.
The remaining assets in the Railways Pension Scheme are principally fixed and index-linked bonds.
Following the formal triennial funding valuation carried out as at 31 December 2010, the Group agreed to make ongoing fixed deficit contributions of 1.3m per annum plus an additional 1% of the active members payroll costs.
Parsons Brinckerhoff Scheme During the year ended 31 December 2012, Parsons Brinckerhoff Ltd operated a defined benefit scheme Parsons Brinckerhoff Scheme which had been closed to new members since 31 July 2003.
On 30 June 2012 the Parsons Brinckerhoff Scheme merged with the BBPF and the Group agreed to make additional deficit payments of 11m per annum to the BBPF, with the first payment made in October 2012.
On 28 June 2012 the Parsons Brinckerhoff Scheme released its legal charge over a Group leasehold property with a book value of 4m at 31 December 2011 in return for a one-off deficit contribution of 2.5m.
The deficit contributions have been superseded by the deficit contributions agreed in the March 2013 BBPF formal triennial funding valuation.
Other schemes Other schemes comprise unfunded post-retirement benefit obligations in Europe and North America, the majority of which are closed to new entrants, and deferred compensation schemes in the US, where an element of employees compensation is deferred and invested in available-for-sale assets as disclosed in Note 19.1 in a trust, the assets of which are for the ultimate benefit of the employees but are available to the Groups creditors in the event of insolvency.

The reduction was applied following consideration of proposals made by the Office for National Statistics ONS to change the method to calculate RPI and independent advice received from the Groups actuaries.
This change in assumptions gave rise to a 25m actuarial increase in liabilities which was recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

As a result of this announcement and following independent advice received from the Groups actuaries, the Group reassessed the difference between RPI and CPI measures of price inflation from 0.7% to 1.0% in 2013 reducing the pension liability by 38m which was recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
In December 2013, following independent advice from the Groups actuaries based on further announcements by the ONS, the Group reassessed the difference between RPI and CPI measures of price inflation from 1.0% in January 2013 to 1.2% reducing the pension liability by a further 36m which was recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The BBPF actuary undertakes regular mortality investigations based on the experience exhibited by pensioners of the BBPF and due to the size of the membership of the BBPF 49,455 members at 31 December 2013 is able to make comparisons of this experience with the mortality rates set out in the various published mortality tables.
The actuary is also able to monitor changes in the exhibited mortality over time.
This research is taken into account in the Groups mortality assumptions across its various defined benefit schemes.
The mortality assumptions as at 31 December 2013 have been updated to reflect the experience of Balfour Beatty pensioners for the period 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2013.
The mortality tables adopted for the 2013 and 2012 IAS 19 valuations are the SAPS tables with a multiplier of 101% for male and for female members 2012: 90% for male and 103% for female members and 110% for female widows and dependants 2012: 103% : all with an improvement rate in line with the CMI core projection model to 2013 2012: flat 1.6% pa to 2013, plus future improvements from 2013 in line with the CMI core projection model applicable to each members year of birth with a long term rate of 1.25% pa for male and 1.00% pa for female members.

The 2013 investigation revealed that the life expectancy for these members is similar to other members of the BBPF, therefore mortality assumptions have been aligned in 2013.
The BBPF defined contribution employer contributions paid and charged to the income statement have been separately identified in the table below and the defined contribution section assets and liabilities amounting to 259m 2012: 200m have been excluded from the tables on pages 132 to 134.

The Groups financial risk management strategy seeks to minimise the potential adverse effect of these risks on the Groups financial performance.
Financial risk management is carried out centrally by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board.
Group Treasury liaises withthe Groups operating companies to identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks.
The Board provides written principles for overall financial risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is monitored through the Groups internal audit and risk management procedures.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
com ar2013 148 39 FInAnCIAL InstRuMents ContInueD 39.2 Group continued a Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, including: forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on trading activities transacted in a currency that is not the functional currency of the operating company interest rate swaps to mitigate the cash flow variability in Infrastructure Investments concessions arising from variable interest rates on borrowings.
There has been no material change to the Groups exposure to market risks and there has been no change in how the Group manages those risks since 2012. i Foreign currency risk management The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from exposure to various currencies, primarily to US dollars, euros, Australian dollars, Hong Kong dollars and United Arab Emirate dirhams.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future trading transactions, assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
Group policy requires operating companies to manage their transactional foreign exchange risk against their functional currency.
At31December 2013 no individual entities within the Group had material financial assets or liabilities in a functional currency other than their own.
Whenever a current or future foreign currency exposure isidentified with sufficient reliability GroupTreasury enters into forward contracts on behalf of operating companies to cover 100% of foreign exchange riskabove materiality levels determined by the Chief Financial Officer.
Refer to page 146 for details of forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the reporting date in respect of foreign currency transactional exposures.
As at 31 December 2013, the notional principal amounts of foreign exchange contracts in respect of foreign currency transactions where hedge accounting is not applied was 324m 2012: 274m receivable and 325m 2012: 287m payable with related cash flows expected to occur up to four 2012: five years.
The foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from fair valuing these unhedged foreign exchange contracts will affect the income statement throughout the same periods.
The Group has designated forward exchange contracts with a notional principal amount of 63m 2012: 21m receivable and 66m 2012: 23m payable as cash flow hedges against highly probable cash flows which are expected to occur in up to four 2012:four years.
Fair value gains on these contracts of nil 2012: nil have been taken to hedging reserves through other comprehensive income.
Thecumulative amount deferred in the hedging reserves relating to cash flow hedges at the reporting date is nil 2012: nil.
No significant amounts in relation to hedge ineffectiveness have been charged or credited to the income statement in relation to any foreign exchange cash flow hedges.
The Groups investments in foreign operations are exposed to foreign currency translation risks.
The Group does not enter into forward foreign exchange or other derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated net assets.
InMarch 2013 the Group raised US$350m through a US private placement which has been designated as a net investment hedge against changes in the value of the Groups US net assets due to exchange movements.
Exchange movements in the year totalled 19m 2012: nil.
The hedging policy is reviewed periodically.
At the reporting date the only change to the hedging policies since 2012 was to designate the US private placement as a net investment hedge.
ii Interest rate risk management Interest rate risk arises in the Groups Infrastructure Investments concessions which borrow funds at both floating and fixed interest rates and hold available-for-sale financial assets.
Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Groups policy to manage this risk is to swap floating rate interest to fixed rate, usinginterest rate swap contracts.
In an interest rate swap, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
The net effect of a movement in interest rates on income would therefore be immaterial.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curve at the reporting date.
During 2013 and 2012, the Groups PPP subsidiaries borrowings at variable rates of interest were denominated in sterling.
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding subsidiaries interest rate swaps outstanding at 31 December 2013 totalled 357m 2012: 404m with maturities that match the maturity of the underlying borrowings ranging from one year to 24 years.
At31December 2013, the fixed interest rates range from 4.3% to 5.1% 2012: 4.2% to 5.1% and the principal floating rates are LIBOR plusa fixed margin.
A 50 basis point increase decrease in the interest rate in which financial instruments are held would lead to a 2m increase 2012: 8m 3m decrease 2012: 9m in amounts taken directly to other comprehensive income by the Group in relation to the Groups exposure tointerest rates on the available-for-sale financial assets and cash flow hedges of its Infrastructure Investments subsidiaries.
Interest rate risk also arises on the Groups cash and cash equivalents, term deposits and other borrowings.
A 50 basis point increase decrease in the interest rate of each currency in which these financial instruments are held would lead to a nil 2012: nil increase 1m 2012: 2m decrease in the Groups net finance cost.
com ar2013 149 39 FInAnCIAL InstRuMents ContInueD 39.2 Group continued a Market risk continued iii Price risk management The Groups principal price risk exposure arises in its Infrastructure Investments concessions.
At the commencement of the concession an element of the unitary payment by the client is indexed to offset the effect of inflation on the concessions costs.
The Group is exposed to price risk to the extent that inflation differs from the index used.
b Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and credit exposures to clients, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
The Group has a policy of assessing the creditworthiness of potential clients before entering into transactions.
For cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments the Group has a policy of only using counterparties that are independently rated with a minimum long term credit rating of BBB.
At 31 December 2013 44m 2012: 37m did not meet this criterion due to the operational and relationship difficulties in transferring certain balances, however no losses are anticipated from these counterparties.
The credit rating of a financial institution will determine the amount and duration for which funds may be deposited under individual risk limits set by the Board of Directors for the Group and subsidiary companies.
Management monitors the utilisation ofthese credit limits regularly.
For trade and other receivables credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable using independent ratings where available or by assessment of the clients credit quality based on its financial position, past experience and other factors.
TheGroups most significant clients are public or regulated industry entities which generally have high credit ratings or areofa high credit quality due to the nature of the client.
The maximum exposure to credit risk in respect of the above at 31 December is the carrying value of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowance for losses.
c Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash balances and banking facilities, continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Details of undrawn committed borrowing facilities are set out in Note 26.1.
The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities is set out on page 147.
Fair value estimation The Group holds certain financial instruments on the balance sheet at their fair values.
The following hierarchy classifies each class of financial asset or liability in accordance with the valuation technique applied in determining its fair value.
Level 1 The fair value is calculated based on quoted prices traded in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
The Group holds available-for-sale investments in mutual funds which are traded in active markets and valued at the closing market price at 31 December.
Level 2 The fair value is based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows utilising yield curves at the reporting date and taking into account own credit risk.
Own credit risk for the Infrastructure Investment swaps is not considered material and is calculated using the following credit valuation adjustment CVA calculation: loss given default multiplied by exposure multiplied by probability of default.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates atthe reporting date and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the foreign exchange contracts.
Own credit risk for the other derivative liabilities is not considered material and is calculated by applying a relevant credit default swap CDS rate obtained from a third party.
Level 3 The fair value is based on unobservable inputs.
The fair value of the Groups PPP financial assets is determined in the construction phase by applying an attributable profit margin by reference to the construction margin on non-PPP projects reflecting the construction risks retained by the construction contractor, and fair value of construction services performed.
In the operational phase it is determined by discounting the future cash flows allocated to the financial asset at a discount rate which is basedon long term gilt rates adjusted for the risk levels associated with the assets.
The consequent movement in the fair value is taken to other comprehensive income.
There have been no transfers between these categories in the current or preceding year.

A reasonably possible change in the attributable profit margin would not have a significant effect on the value of the asset.
Refer to Note 20 for a reconciliation of the movement of the opening balance to the closing balance.
The carrying values less impairment provision of trade and other receivables and payables approximate their fair values due to their short term nature.
The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.

The Companys external forward foreign exchange contracts hedge the currency risk on foreign currency loans entered into with Group companies or are offset by forward foreign exchange contracts with the Groups operating companies where Group Treasury is hedging the exchange rate risk arising on trading activities ontheir behalf.
ii Interest rate risk management A 50 basis point increase decrease in the interest rate of each currency in which financial instruments are held would lead to a 10m 2012: 8m increase decrease in the Companys net finance cost.
This is mainly attributable to the Companys exposure to UK interest rates on its cash and cash equivalents and term deposits and amounts due to and from its subsidiaries.
There would be no effect on amounts taken directly by the Company to other comprehensive income.
b Credit risk The Company bears credit risk in respect to trade and other receivables and payables due from to subsidiaries.
There were no amounts past due atthe reporting date.
The maximum exposure is the carrying value of the financial assets recorded in the financial statements.

f Balfour Beatty Investments north America Military housing summary Balfour Beatty through its subsidiary Balfour Beatty Communities LLC is a manager, developer, and investor in a number ofUS military privatisation projects associated with a total of 54 US government military bases which includes 54 military family housing communities and one unaccompanied personnel housing community that are expected to contain approximately 42,500 housing units once development, construction and renovation are complete.
The projects comprise 11 military family housing privatisation projects with the United States Department of the Army Army, seven projects with the United States Department of the Air Force Air Force and two projects with the United States Department of the Navy Navy.
In addition, there is one unaccompanied personnel housing UPH project with the Army at Fort Stewart.
Contractual arrangements The first phase of the project, known as the initial development period, covers the period of initial construction or renovation of military housing on a base, typically lasting three to eight years.
With respect to Army and Navy projects, the government becomes a member or partner of the project entity Project LLC : the Air Force is not a named partner or member inBalfour Beatty Communities Project LLCs, however it contributes a commitment to provide a government direct loan to the ProjectLLC and has similar rights to share in distributions and cash flows of the Project LLC.
On each project, the Project LLC entersinto a ground lease with the government, which provides the Project LLC with a leasehold interest in the land and title to the improvements on the land for a period of 50 years.
Each of these military housing privatisation projects includes agreements covering the management, renovation, and development of existing housing units, aswell as the development, construction, renovation and management of new units during the term of the project, which, in the case of the Army, could potentially extend for up to an additional 25 years.
The 50-year duration of each project calls for continuous renovation, rehabilitation, demolition and reconstruction of housing units.
At the end of the ground lease term the Project LLCs leasehold interest terminates and all project improvements on the land generally transfer to the government.
Preferred returns The projects will typically receive, to the extent that adequate funds are available, an annual minimum preferred rateof return.
On most existing projects, this annual minimum preferred rate of return ranges from 9% to 12% of Balfour Beatty Communities initial equity contribution to the project.
During the initial development period, the project is precluded from distributing funds to pay the minimum preferred rate of return.
The unpaid amounts will generally accrue and accumulate, and can be used to fund renovation and construction costs, if necessary.
If the accumulated funds are not needed to fund renovation and construction costs, atthe end of the initial development period they are distributed to pay accrued preferred returns to Balfour Beatty Communities and the government in accordance with the terms of the project agreements.
com ar2013 156 41 PRInCIPAL suBsIDIARIes, joInt VentuRes AnD AssoCIAtes ContInueD f Balfour Beatty Investments north America continued Military housing continued Allocation of remaining operating cash flows Subsequent to the initial development period, any operating cash flow remaining after the annual minimum preferred rate of return is paid is shared between Balfour Beatty Communities and the reinvestment accountheld bythe project for the benefit of the government.
On most of the existing projects, the total amount that Balfour Beatty Communities is entitled to receive inclusive of the preferred return is generally capped at an annual modified rate of return, or cash-on-cash return, onits initial equity contribution to the project.
Historically, these caps have ranged between approximately 9% to18% depending on the particular project and the type of return annual modified rates of return or cash-on-cash.
However, in some of the more recent projects, there are either no annual caps or lower projected annual rates of return.
The total capped return generally will include the annual minimum preferred return discussed above.
The reinvestment account is an account established for the benefit of the military, but funds may be withdrawn for construction, development and renovation costs during the remaining life of a privatisation project upon approval by the applicable military service.
Return of equity Generally, at the end of a project term, any monies remaining in the reinvestment account are distributed to Balfour Beatty Communities and the Army, Navy or Air Force, in a predetermined order of priority.
Typically these distributions willhave the effect of providing the parties with sufficient funds to provide a minimum annual return over the life of the project and acomplete return of the initial capital contribution.
After payment of the minimum annual return and the return of a partys initial contribution, all remaining funds will typically be distributed to the applicable military service.
