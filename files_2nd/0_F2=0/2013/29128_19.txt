Pension Scheme The companys defined benefit pension scheme based on final salary is closed to new entrants.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the company.
The scheme is under the control of trustees and is administered by Punter Southall & Co, consulting actuaries.
Actuarial valuations are obtained triennially and are updated at each balance sheet date.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out in 2013 by Punter Southall & Co which disclosed a scheme deficit of 3,406,000 on 31 July 2013.
The company has agreed to meet this deficit over nine years by equal instalments.
It should be noted that this deficit differs from that disclosed by Financial Reporting Standard 17 FRS17 which is set out below and which is the liability required to be shown in the financial statements.
The main reason for the difference is that FRS17 requires future liabilities to be calculated actuarially using a rate of return based on the yield from investment grade corporate bonds which is lower than the expected rate of return on the equities in which the scheme is invested.
The FRS17 liability is separately disclosed in the balance sheet.
For the defined benefit scheme the amounts charged against revenue, as part of staff costs, are the actuarial estimation of current service costs that is, the increase in scheme liabilities arising from employee service for the current accounting period and gains and losses from settlements whereby the company is relieved of a pension obligation and from curtailments whereby the estimated years of future service are reduced in the period.
The cost of past service benefits which have vested are charged against revenue as they arise.
Where such benefits have not vested, costs are accrued until vesting occurs.
For employees who are not members of the defined benefit scheme, the company operates a defined contribution scheme under which the company has agreed to pay contributions as a percentage of salary, but has no obligation to pay further contributions.
For this scheme, the amount charged to revenue is the contributions payable for the year.
The following statement has been prepared for the defined benefit scheme in accordance with the requirements of FRS17, the purpose of which is to ensure that: 1. the companys financial statements show the assets of the scheme at fair value, and the liabilities arising from its obligations to employees on their retirement, actuarially estimated as prescribed by FRS17: 2. the operating costs of providing retirement benefits to employees, actuarially estimated, are charged against the profits of the years in which employees earn those benefits: and 3. the financial statements adequately disclose the cost of providing retirement benefits and the related gains, losses, assets and liabilities.

2013 2012 000 000 Return on ordinary activities before tax 147,061 53,921 Corporation tax at 23.42% 2012: 24.83% 34,442 13,389 Effects of: Non-taxable capital returns 30,653 9,753 Finance costs and expenses charged to capital 1,215 1,263 Non-taxable dividends 2,692 2,188 Non-taxable scrip dividends 29 Unutilised expenses 118 156 Overseas tax 1,314 1,085 1,314 1,085 There are unrelieved management expenses at 31 October 2013 of 98,149,000 2012: 87,122,000 but the related deferred tax asset has not been recognised.
This is because the company is not expected to generate taxable profits in a future period in excess of the deductible expenses of that future period and, accordingly, it is unlikely that the company will be able to reduce future tax liabilities through the use of existing unrelieved expenses.

During the year to 31 October 2012 a total of 4,000,000 nominal secured bonds due 2030 with a book value of 3,921,000 were repurchased at a cost of 5,265,000.
The debenture stocks and secured bonds are stated in the balance sheet at book value.
Restating them at market value of 119.9m 2012: 138.0m has the effect of decreasing the year end NAV per ordinary stock unit from 682.7p to 668.4p 2012 decreasing from: 561.6p to 531.3p.
Market value is the estimated fair value of the companys secured bonds and debenture stocks.
The current estimated fair value of the companys borrowings is based on the redemption yield of the relevant existing reference gilt plus a margin derived from the spread of BBB UK corporate bond yields 15 years over UK gilt yields 15 years.
At 31 October 2012 the margin was derived from the spread of AA UK corporate bond yields 15 years over UK gilt yields 15 years.
The reference gilt for the secured bonds is the 6% UK Treasury Stock 2028 and the reference gilt for the perpetual debenture stocks is the longest-dated UK Treasury stock listed in the Financial Times.

Financial Instruments continued Risk management policies and procedures As an investment trust, the company invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to secure its investment objective stated on page 1.
In pursuing its investment objective, the company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in a reduction in the companys net assets and a reduction in the profits available for dividend.
The main risks include investment and market price risk comprising foreign currency risk and interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The directors approach to the management of these risks is set out below.
The directors, the manager and the company secretary coordinate the companys risk management.
The companys policies and processes for managing the risks, and the methods used to measure the risks, which are set out below, have not changed from those applied in the previous year.
Investment and market price risk The holding of securities and investing activities involve certain inherent risks.
Events may occur which affect the value of investments.
The company holds a portfolio which is well diversified across industrial and geographical areas to help minimise these risks.
It may also use derivatives.
From time to time, the company may wish to use such instruments in order to protect against a specific risk or to facilitate a change in investment strategy such as the movement of funds from one area to another.
No such transaction may take place without the prior authorisation of the board.
Foreign currency risk Approximately 75% of the companys assets are invested overseas which gives rise to a currency risk.
From time to time, specific hedging transactions are undertaken.
The companys overseas income is subject to currency movements.
During the year, US dollar, Australian dollar and euro dividend income was hedged by forward sales of US dollars, Australian dollars and euros.
The currency profile of the companys monetary assets and liabilities is set out in Notes 8 and 12.
Management of the risk The manager monitors the companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis, and reports to the board at regular intervals.
The manager measures the risk to the company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Foreign currency borrowings and forward currency contracts may be used to limit the companys exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments or the income received from them.
These borrowings and contracts are limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the asset exposure to those currencies.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is receivable and its receipt.
Report & Accounts 2013 The Scottish Investment Trust PLC 39 Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year to 31 October 2013 17.
Financial Instruments continued Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the companys monetary items denominated in foreign currencies at 31 October 2013 and 31 October 2012 are shown below.
The companys equity and fixed interest investments which are priced in a foreign currency have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
US $ Euro Other 2013 000 000 000 Debtors amounts due from brokers, dividends receivable and accrued income 398 48 2,329 Cash and current asset investments 59,161 941 Foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 59,559 48 3,270 Equity investments at fair value through profit and loss 214,144 109,163 260,923 Total net foreign currency exposure 273,703 109,211 264,193 2012 Debtors amounts due from brokers, dividends receivable and accrued income 351 252 5,816 Cash and current asset investments 41,140 13,280 21,444 Foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 41,491 13,532 27,260 Equity investments at fair value through profit and loss 215,949 65,819 209,831 Total net foreign currency exposure 257,440 79,351 237,091 The above year-end amounts are not representative of the exposure to risk during the year, because the levels of monetary foreign currency exposure may change significantly throughout the year.
The maximum and minimum net monetary assets liabilities amounts for each currency were as follows.

Financial Instruments continued Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the total return for the year and the shareholders funds in regard to the companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities.
It assumes a 10% depreciation of sterling against both the US dollar and the euro at 31 October 2013.
These percentages have been determined based on the average market volatility in exchange rates in the previous twelve months.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the companys monetary foreign currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date.
2013 2012 US $ Euro US $ Euro 000 000 000 000 If sterling had weakened by 10% against the currencies shown, this would have had the following effect: Income statement return on ordinary activities after taxation: Revenue return 337 504 325 374 Capital return 27,330 10,916 25,744 7,986 Return attributable to shareholders 27,667 11,420 26,069 8,360 A 10% strengthening of sterling against the above currencies would result in an equal and opposite effect on the above amounts.
In the opinion of the directors, the above sensitivity analyses are broadly representative of the whole of the current and comparative years.
c. Interest rate risk The company finances its operations through a combination of investment realisations, retained revenue reserves, bank credit facilities, debenture stocks and secured bonds.
All debenture stocks and secured bonds are at fixed rates.
The company has undrawn short-term multicurrency credit facilities which can be drawn at variable rates of interest.
Details of interest rates on financial assets are included in Note 8.
Details of interest rates on financial liabilities are included in Note 12.
Management of the risk The company finances part of its activities through borrowings at levels which have been approved and are monitored by the board.
The company, generally, does not, otherwise than in exceptional market conditions, hold substantial cash balances.
Interest rate exposure The exposure, at the year-end, of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to floating interest rates.
2013 2012 Within More than Within More than one year one year Total one year one year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates Cash 8,785 8,785 24,709 24,709 Exposure to fixed interest rates Current asset investments 10,174 10,174 Short-term deposits 114,774 114,774 63,240 63,240 Long-term borrowings 104,167 104,167 104,051 104,051 Total exposure 123,559 104,167 19,392 98,123 104,051 5,928 Report & Accounts 2013 The Scottish Investment Trust PLC 41 Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year to 31 October 2013 17.
Financial Instruments continued Interest rate sensitivity If interest rates had decreased by 5%, with all other variables held constant, the return attributable to shareholders as shown on the Income Statement would have decreased by the amounts shown in the table below: 2013 2012 000 000 Return attributable to shareholders 7 11 A 5% increase in interest rates would result in an equal and opposite effect on the above amounts.
d. Liquidity risk Almost all of the companys assets comprise listed securities which represent a ready source of funds.
In addition the company has access to short-term borrowing facilities.
The maturity profile of the companys borrowings is included in Note 12.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not as significant as the other risks as most of the companys assets are investments in quoted equities and are readily realisable.
The manager reviews the liquidity of the portfolio when making investment decisions.
e. Credit risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the company suffering a loss.
Credit risk exposure The amounts shown in the balance sheet under debtors and cash and deposits represent the maximum exposure to credit risk at the current and comparative year ends.
Cash comprises balances held by banks with a satisfactory credit rating 2012: same.
Management of the risk This risk is managed as follows: by only dealing with brokers and banks which have been approved by the directors and which have credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies: and by setting limits on the maximum exposure to any one counterparty at any time, which are reviewed semi-annually at meetings of the audit committee.
f. Capital management policies and procedures The company carries on its business as a global growth investment trust.
Its objective is to provide investors, over the longer term, with above-average returns through a diversified portfolio of international equities and to achieve dividend growth ahead of UK inflation.
The levels of gearing and gross gearing are monitored closely by the board and manager.
The company applies a ceiling on gearing of 20%.
While gearing will be employed in a typical range of 0% to 20%, the company retains the ability to lower equity exposure to a net cash position if deemed appropriate.
The board, with the assistance of the manager, monitors and reviews the structure of the companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes the planned level of gearing which will take into account the managers view on the market, the need to buy back shares for cancellation and the level of dividends.
The companys policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the previous year.
