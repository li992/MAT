1 0 pensions the British land Group of companies Pension scheme the scheme is the principal pension scheme in the Group.
it is a defined benefit scheme which is externally funded and not contracted out of serPs state earnings-related Pension scheme.
the assets of the scheme are held in a trusteeadministered fund and kept separate from those of the company.
it is not planned to admit new employees to the scheme.
existing entitlements will be retained by the members, with freedom to transfer to a new defined contribution scheme.
contributions to this scheme are at a flat rate of 15% of salary and paid by the company.
in certain circumstances it may be necessary to pay higher contributions when recruiting senior executives.
the Group has three other small pension schemes.
the total net pension cost charged for the year was 5m 2011 12: 5m, of which 3m 2011 12: 2m relates to defined contribution plans.
a full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 31 march 2009 by consulting actuaries, aon hewitt associates ltd. the employers contributions will be paid in the future at the rate recommended by the actuary of 45.2% per annum of basic salaries.
the best estimate of employer contributions expected to be paid during the year to 31 march 2014 is 3m.
the major assumptions used for the actuarial valuation were: 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa discount rate 4.1 4.6 5.5 5.5 5.8 salary inflation 4.7 4.7 5.2 5.4 4.4 Pensions increase 3.1 3.1 3.7 3.9 2.9 Price inflation 3.2 3.2 3.7 3.9 2.9 the mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
the assumptions are that a member currently aged 60 will live on average to age 90 if they are male and to age 91 if they are female.
For a member who is currently 40 and retires in 2033 at age 60, the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 30 years after retirement to age 90 if they are male and for a further 33 years after retirement to age 93 if they are female.

historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
the assumed long-term rate of return on each asset class is set out within this note.
in 2013, the overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class over their allocation for the scheme at 31 march 2013. in 2014, upon adoption of ias 19 revised employee Benefits, expected returns will no longer be recognised, but will be replaced by recording interest income in the consolidated income statement calculated using the discount rate to measure the pension obligation.

Properties valued at 1,724m 2011 12: 1,827m were subject to a security interest and other properties of non-recourse companies amounted to 40m 2011 12: 49m.
included within the property valuation is 91m 2011 12: 86m in respect of accrued contracted rental uplift income, against which the Group holds a provision of 5m 2011 12: 5m.
the balance arises through the iFrs treatment of leases containing such arrangements which requires the recognition of rental income on a straight-line basis over the lease term, with the difference between this and the cash receipt changing the carrying value of the property against which revaluations are measured.
cumulative interest capitalised against investment properties amounts to 56m 2011 12: 78m.
included in investment properties are 904m of properties which are in the course of development 2011 12: 444m.

this approach involves applying market-derived capitalisation yields to current and market-derived future income streams with appropriate adjustments for income voids arising from vacancies or rent-free periods.
these capitalisation yields and future income streams are derived from comparable property and leasing transactions and are considered to be the key inputs in the valuation.
other factors taken in to account in the valuations include the tenure of the property, tenancy details and ground and structural conditions.
in the case of on-going developments, the approach applied is the residual method of valuation, which is the investment method of valuation as described above, with a deduction for all costs necessary to complete the development, together with a further allowance for remaining risk.
Properties held for future development are generally valued by adopting the higher of the residual method of valuation, allowing for all associated risks, or the investment method of valuation for the existing asset.

INTEREST RATE RISk MANAGEMENT the Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge exposure to the variability in cash flows on floating rate debt, such as revolving bank facilities and floating rate bonds caused by movements in market rates of interest.
at 31 march 2013 the market value of these derivatives, which have been designated as cash flow hedges under ias 39, is a net liability of 80m 2011 12: liability of 87m.
the cross currency swap of the 2015 Us Private Placement, which fully hedges the foreign exchange exposure of the issuance, has been designated as a cash flow hedge.
the market value of this is an asset of 5m 2011 12: nil.
the ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement on cash flow hedges in the year ended 31 march 2013 was nil 2011 12: nil.
the cash flows occur and enter into the determination of profit and loss until the maturity of the hedged debt.
the table below summarises foreign currency denominated debt and variable rate debt hedged at 31 march 2013.
CASH FLOw HEdGEd dEBT 2013 2012 m m outstanding: at one year 874 1,269 at two years 874 1,123 at five years 250 at ten years 250 250 the Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge exposure on fixed rate financial liabilities caused by movements in market rates of interest.
at 31 march 2013 the market value of these derivatives, which have been designated as fair value hedges under ias 39, was a net asset of 86m 2011 12: 72m.
the cross currency swaps of the 2018 2021 2023 2026 Us Private Placements fully hedge the foreign exchange exposure at an average floating rate of 146 basis points above liBor.
these have been designated as fair value hedges of the Us Private Placements.
INTEREST RATE PROFILE INCLUdING EFFECT OF dERIVATIVES 2013 2012 m m Fixed rate 1,848 1,976 Variable rate net of cash 189 327 Net debt 2,037 2,303 all the debt is effectively sterling denominated except for 185m 2011 12: 234m of euro debt of which 165m is at a fixed rate and the balance is floating 2011 12: 163m fixed.
at 31 march 2013 the weighted average interest rate of the sterling fixed rate debt was 5.01% 2011 12: 5.27%.
the weighted average period for which the rate is fixed is 11.6 years 2011 12: 12.1 years.
the weighted average interest rate for the euro fixed rate debt is 4.44% 2011 12: 4.44% and the weighted average period for which the rate is fixed is 3.1 years 2011 12: 4.2 years.
the floating rate debt is set for periods of the companys choosing at the relevant liBor or similar rate.
the proportion of net debt at fixed or capped rates of interest was 91% at 31 march 2013.
Based on the Groups interest rate profile at the balance sheet date a 576 bps increase in interest rates would decrease annual profits by 11m 2011 12: 19m decrease.
similarly, a 51 bps reduction would increase profits by 1m 2011 12: 2m increase.
the change in interest rates used for this sensitivity analysis is based on the largest annual change in three month sterling liBor over the last ten years.
the impact assumes liBor does not fall below 0%.
Upward movements in medium and long-term interest rates, associated with higher interest rate expectations, increase the value of the Groups interest rate swaps that provide protection against such moves.
the converse is true for downward movements in the yield curve.
the majority of the Groups interest rate swaps which provide such protection qualify as effective cash flow hedges under ias 39 therefore movements in their fair value are recognised directly in equity rather than the income statement.
a 204 bps shift represents the largest annual change in the seven year sterling swap rate over the last ten years.
at 31 march 2013 a 204 bps parallel upward shift in swap rates would increase the value of these interest rate swaps by 117m 2011 12: 141m.
a 204 bps downward shift in swap rates would reduce the value of the interest rate swap portfolio by 138m 2011 12: 173m.
Because the interest rate swaps are matched by floating rate debt, the overall effect on Group cash flows of such movements is minimal.
the 1.5% convertible bond is designated as fair value through profit or loss.
Principal components of the market value include British lands share price and its volatility, and market interest rates.
the fair value at 31 march 2013 was 407m.
at 31 march 2013 a 204 bps parallel upwards shift in interest rates would reduce the fair value by 26m, and a 204 bps downward shift in interest rates would increase the value by 34m.
Financial statements and other information the British land company Plc annual report and accounts 2013 139 Financial statements and other inFormation notes to the accounts continued 18 net debt continued FOREIGN CURRENCy RISk MANAGEMENT the Groups policy is to have no material unhedged net assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
the currency risk on overseas investments is hedged via foreign currency denominated borrowings and derivatives.
the Group has adopted net investment hedging in accordance with ias 39 and therefore the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity.
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the income statement.
the table below shows the carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
Provided contingent tax on overseas investments is not expected to occur it will be ignored for hedging purposes, as will the requirement to fair value interest rate swaps.
Based on the 31 march 2013 position a 33% appreciation largest annual change over the last ten years in the euro relative to sterling would result in a nil change 2011 12: 5m reduction in reported profits.

cash and short-term deposits at 31 march 2013 amounted to 135m 2011 12: 137m.
deposits were placed with financial institutions with a or better credit ratings.
at 31 march 2013, the fair value of all interest rate derivatives which had a positive value was 92m 2011 12: 73m.
at 31 march 2013, the fair value of liquid investments was nil 2011 12: 200m.
at 31 march 2013, prior to taking into account any offset arrangements, the largest combined credit exposure to a single counterparty arising from money market deposits, liquid investments and derivatives was 64m 2011 12: 230m.
this represents 0.8% 2011 12: 2.8% of gross assets.
the deposit exposures are with UK and international high street banks and branches.
the Groups exposure to credit risk in respect of its trade receivables is analysed in note 14. included within trade and other debtors is deferred consideration of 4m, which may fall due after one year.
management has made due consideration of the credit risk associated with this, resulting in no impairment being made.
Provisions are made taking account of historic credit losses and the creditworthiness of debtors.
LIqUIdITy RISk MANAGEMENT the Groups approach to liquidity risk management is discussed in the financial policies on pages 69 to 73. the following table presents a maturity profile of the contracted undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
the table includes both interest and principal flows.
Where the interest payable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest rates implied by yield curves at the reporting date.
For derivative financial instruments that settle on a net basis e. g. interest rate swaps the undiscounted net cash flows are shown and for derivatives that require gross settlement e. g. cross currency swaps the undiscounted gross cash flows are presented.
Where payment obligations are in foreign currencies, the spot exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date is used.
trade creditors and amounts owed to joint ventures, which are repayable within one year, have been excluded from the analysis.
the Group expects to meet its financial liabilities through the various available liquidity sources, including a secure rental income profile, asset sales, undrawn committed borrowing facilities and, in the longer-term, debt refinancings.
