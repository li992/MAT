The Groups main schemes are of the final salary pension type, which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided depends on members length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement.
In the UK plans, pensions in payment are generally updated in line with the retail price index, whereas in the US plans, pensions generally do not receive inflationary increases once in payment.
With the exception of this inflationary risk in the UK, the plans face broadly similar risks, as described on pages 102 and 103.
The majority of benefit payments are from trustee administered funds: however there are also a number of unfunded plans where the relevant Group company meets the benefit payment obligation as it falls due.
Plan assets held in trusts are governed by local regulations and practice in each country, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the trustees or equivalent and their composition.
Responsibility for governance of the schemes including investment decisions and contribution schedules lies jointly with the relevant Group company and the particular schemes board of trustees.
The board of trustees must be composed of representatives in accordance with each schemes regulations.

Total employer contributions to the schemes in 2014 are expected to be 30.1m.
The significant actuarial assumptions were as follows: 2013 2013 2012 2012 UK US UK US Discount rate 4.4% 4.5% 4.5% 3.7% Inflation rate 3.7% 2.5% 3.1% 2.5% Rate of increase in salaries 4.7% 4.0% 4.1% 4.0% Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.3% n a 3.0% n a Duration of liabilities i. e. life expectancy years 19.4 10.9 18.7 12.0 Remaining working life 15.0 11.0 15.3 11.0 The sensitivity of the defined benefit liability to changes in the assumptions is as follows: Impact on retirement benefit liability Sensitivity Of increase Of decrease Discount rate 0.5% -8.5% 9.8% Inflation rate 0.5% 5.1% -5.9% 1 year Mortality assumes all scheme members are one year younger 2.7% n a The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit liability to significant actuarial assumptions the same method present value of the defined benefit liability calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period has been applied as when calculating the retirement benefit liability recognised in the Group balance sheet.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit liability is 18.6 years.
Retirement benefit liabilities continued Post-employment medical benefits The Group operates an unfunded post-employment medical benefit scheme in the US.
The method of accounting, significant assumptions and the frequency of valuations are similar to those used for defined benefit pension schemes set out on the preceding pages with the addition of actuarial assumptions relating to the long-term increase in healthcare costs of 7.5% a year 2012: 7.8%.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet in respect of this scheme is as follows: 2013 2012 m m Present value of unfunded obligations US scheme 11.5 13.9 2013 2012 m m Movement in present value of post employment medical benefit obligations in the year Opening balance 13.9 13.1 Current service cost 0.4 0.4 Interest cost 0.5 0.5 Remeasurements Change in financial assumptions 1.4 1.1 Experience gains 1.3 - Benefits paid 0.5 0.7 Exchange differences on overseas schemes 0.1 0.5 11.5 13.9 Pension and medical benefits - risks and volatility Through its defined benefit pension schemes and post-employment medical schemes, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: Asset volatility The schemes liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if scheme assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
Both the UK and US plans hold a significant proportion of equities, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term while providing volatility and risk in the short-term.
Whilst our Dutch scheme is less mature, regulatory pressures result in lower equity holdings.
As the schemes mature, the Group intends to reduce the level of investment risk by investing more in assets that better match the liabilities.
However, the Group and the Trustees believe that due to the long-term nature of the scheme liabilities and the strength of the supporting Group, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of the Groups long term strategy to manage the schemes efficiently.
See below for more details on the Groups asset-liability matching strategy.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase scheme liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings.
Inflation risk Some of the Groups pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
However, the level of inflationary increases are usually capped to protect the scheme against extreme inflation.
The majority of the schemes assets are either unaffected by inflation in the case of fixed interest bonds or loosely correlated in the case of equities, meaning that an increase in inflation will thus increase the deficit.
In the US schemes, the pensions in payment are not linked to inflation, so this is a less material risk.
Life expectancy The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the schemes liabilities.
This is particularly significant in the UK scheme, where inflationary increases result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.
In the case of the funded schemes, the Group ensures that the investment positions are managed within an asset-liability matching ALM framework that has been developed to achieve long-term investments that are cognisant of the obligations under the pension schemes.
Within this framework, the Groups ALM objective is to match a portion of assets to the pension obligations by investing in long-term fixed interest securities with maturities that match the benefit payments as they fall due and in the appropriate currency.
The Group and Trustees actively monitor how the duration and the expected yield of the investments are matching the expected cash outflows arising from the pension obligations.
The Group has not changed the processes used to manage its risks from previous periods.

A large portion of assets in 2013 consists of equities and bonds, although the schemes also invest in property, cash and infrastructure funds.
The Group believes that equities offer the best returns over the long term with an acceptable level of risk.
Both the UK and Dutch schemes make use of a portfolio of derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate and inflation risk.
The next triennial valuation of the UK scheme is due to be completed as at 30 September 2014.
The Group considers that the schedule of contributions set at the 30 September 2011 valuation date remains sufficient to eliminate the deficit by 31 January 2016.
The draft annual funding update for the UK scheme showed a funding level of 94.2% as at 30 September 2013.
The funding review of our US scheme is undertaken annually.
As at 31 December 2012 the scheme was 102.6% funded, with the funding level allowing for contributions received during 2013.
The Groups Dutch scheme, as alluded to earlier, is subject to a more rigorous regulatory environment under the supervision of the Dutch National Bank DNB.
As at 31 December 2013 the scheme was 119.8% funded on an actuarial basis relative to the DNBs required level of 117.2% and a minimum funding requirement of 104.1%.
The expected distribution of the timing of benefit payments is as follows: Less than Between Between Beyond a year 1-2 years 2-5 years 5 years Total m m m m m Pension benefits 30.1 32.0 104.2 761.8 928.1 Post-employment medical benefits 0.6 0.6 1.9 8.4 11.5 30.7 32.6 106.1 770.2 939.6 Defined contribution schemes 2013 2012 m m 2.5 Contributions paid charged to operating profit 2.3 Adoption of IAS19 revised 2011 The revised employee benefit standard introduces changes to the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of post-employment benefits.
The standard also requires net interest expense to be calculated as the product of the net defined benefit liability and the discount rate as determined at the beginning of the year.
The effect of this is to remove the previous concept of recognising an expected return on plan assets.
The effects of the changes on prior years previously disclosed figures are as follows: 2012 as Impact of 2012 previously IAS19 stated revised restated m m m Income Statement Operating profit 255.4 0.5 254.9 Net finance costs 2.2 14.4 16.6 Profit before tax 253.2 14.9 238.3 Tax 78.1 4.0 74.1 Profit after tax 175.1 10.9 164.2 Loss after tax from discontinued operations 13.2 - 13.2 Profit for the financial year 161.9 10.9 151.0 Group Statement of Comprehensive Income Profit for the year 161.9 10.9 151.0 Other comprehensive expense income 13.9 Remeasurements of post-employment benefit obligations 1.0 14.9 Tax on items that will not be classified 3.5 4.0 7.5 Other 8.0 - 8.0 12.5 10.9 1.6 Total comprehensive income for the year 149.4 - 149.4 There is no impact on the Group balance sheet following the adoption of the revised IAS19.
In the Group statement of cash flows, as the revised standard has no impact on Group net debt, the reduction in operating profit above is offset by an increase in the adjustment for pension fund contributions in excess of service cost.
