OTHER INFORMATION ATTRIBUTABLE RETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED ROCE DEFINITION Attributable ROCE Definitions: Return on capital employed is a ratio that measures the efficiency and profitability of a companys capital investments.
It displays how effectively assets are generating profit for the size of invested capital.
ROCE is calculated as underlying operating profit divided by capital employed.
Adjusted ROCE calculation is underlying operating profit divided by adjusted capital employed.
Adjusted capital employed is net assets excluding net debt and financial asset investments, adjusted for remeasurements of a previously held equity interest as a result of business combinations and impairments incurred in the current year and reported since 10 December 2013.
Attributable ROCE is the return on the adjusted capital employed attributable to equity shareholders of Anglo American, and therefore excludes the portion of underlying operating profit and capital employed attributable to non-controlling interests in operations where Anglo American has control but does not hold 100% of the equity.
Joint ventures, joint operations and associates are included in their proportionate interest and in line with appropriate accounting treatment.
