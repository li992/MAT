We remain committed in our efforts to achieve zero harm and believe that we have the Performance with respect to ore development was correct strategy and, together with all stakeholders, positive resulting in the ore reserve position increasing will continue our journey on a positive trajectory by 14.7% from the level reported at the end of 2012 towards this goal.
The most significant increase was at the Middelkraal operations and is almost entirely due to the increase at Saffy shaft where the ore reserve position increased 108.7% from 2012 in line with plans to ramp up production at the shaft.
Westerns operations also delivered a significant year on year increase in ore reserves with a 36.6% increase at Rowland shaft.
The overall improvements are in line with Lonmins strategy of creating greater flexibility at these shafts.
The ore reserve position remained largely unchanged but healthy at the Karee operations and decreased as planned at the Easterns operations.

Grades at both Rowland and Newman learnership programmes as well as the learner official shafts remained unchanged during 2013 when and graduate programmes have begun to deliver compared to 2012.
Mining costs increased by 5.0% success as graduates of these programmes were to R712 per tonne.

Based on the successes to date, these Middelkraal programmes are set to continue and be further refined.
The Middelkraal operations, Saffy conventional and Hossy mechanised hybrid mined 2.20 million Best Practice Optimisation Teams tonnes for 2013 which represents an increase of The optimisation and best practice teams were 24.9%, or 439,000 tonnes from 2012.
This is largely strengthened during the year and have been deployed as a result of a more stable labour relations environment across the operations with the aim of assisting in during 2013 and the planned ramp up at Saffy.
Grade identifying the causes of underperformance and to at Saffy shaft reduced by 4.0% year on year as a assist in implementing the appropriate corrective result of higher dilution due to increased reef action.
The process also involves coaching of development.
At Hossy shaft, the grade increased by supervisors in supervisory best practice and coaching 3.0% as stoping production ramped up and the the mining teams in best practice mining cycles and diluting effect of the reef development was reduced.
Mining costs increased to R870 per tonne, or 4.0% as the operations continue to ramp up to the increased Absenteeism Project production targets.
Unplanned absenteeism remains a challenge in the operations and a number of projects are underway to Saffy shaft continued to ramp up production, increasing output by 28.1% when compared to 2012. mitigate the reasons for key team members not being at work.
Notwithstanding this increase in production, the ramp up has been slower than planned as challenges The inflationary cost pressures experienced by the continued with difficult ground conditions accompanied platinum industry continue to be of great concern by a stringent support regime.
The significant increase and productivity improvement programmes, as in the ore reserve position has introduced the flexibility outlined above, play an important role in reducing the required to address these challenges and additional impact.
Unit cost of production increases for mining stoping crews have been deployed to the additional operations, at 5.8% year on year, were successfully face length that became available towards the end of contained at below wage inflation.
This provides confidence that the further ramp up in production planned for 2014 can be realised.
