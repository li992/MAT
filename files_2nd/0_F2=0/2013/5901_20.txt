346.8 1 361.9 Fenner PLC Annual Report 2013 61 Overview Business Review Governance Remuneration Corporate Responsibility Financial Results Notes to the Group financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and IFRS interpretations as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Group financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of land and buildings and financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
The directors consider that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
In forming this view, the directors have reviewed the Groups cash flow projections against availability of financing.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in note 2.
There were no new standards, amendments or interpretations adopted by the Group and effective for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 September 2012 that were material to the Group.
The Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements was adopted for the first time for the financial year ended 31 August 2013.
This requires changes to the presentation of other comprehensive income on the basis of whether or not the respective items will be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss.
A number of new standards, amendments or interpretations are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 and consequently have not yet been applied in preparing the financial statements.
None of these are expected to have a significant impact on the Groups reported results or financial position.
The main change in 2014 will be the adoption of IAS 19 Revised Employee Benefits.
The principal impact of this standard is to replace the interest cost on defined benefit post-retirement scheme obligations and the expected return on scheme assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit post-retirement scheme deficit.
If this standard had been applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2013, the net impact would have been an additional charge of 1.5m to profit before taxation in the income statement and a 1.2m increase in net assets in the balance sheet.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements comprise the financial statements of Fenner PLC and subsidiaries controlled by the Group as at 31 August each year.
a Subsidiaries A subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has the power to control the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group at the date of completion.
Costs directly attributable to the acquisition are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
The subsidiarys identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are consolidated from the date that control is transfered or until control ceases respectively.
Where necessary, the accounting policies of acquired subsidiaries are adjusted to bring them into line with those used by the Group.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity.
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of acquisition and the non-controlling interests share of changes in equity since the date of acquisition.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
b Investments in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity.
The Groups interest in associates is incorporated in the financial statements using the equity method.
Investments in associates are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of investments.
Losses of associates in excess of the Groups interest in those associates are not recognised.
Where a Group entity transacts with an associate, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in that entity.
Foreign currencies a Functional and presentation currency The individual financial statements of each entity in the Group are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates the functional currency.
The Group financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the presentation currency of the Group.
Fenner PLC Annual Report 2013 62 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 1.
Significant accounting policies continued b Transactions and balances Transactions in currencies other than an entitys functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items measured at historical cost are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement and retranslation of monetary items are recognised in the income statement in the period.
c Net investment in foreign operations For the consolidation of operations where the functional currency is different to the Groups presentation currency, the assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date and income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising are recognised directly in equity in the exchange reserve.
On disposal of such operations, the cumulative exchange differences are included in the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign operations are treated as assets and liabilities of that operation and are retranslated at the closing rate at each balance sheet date.
The Group has adopted the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 to not apply this to goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 September 2004, the date of transition to IFRS.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer, principally on despatch on domestic sales and in accordance with shipping terms for export sales.
Revenue from short-term service contracts is recognised in the period in which the services are completed.
Interest income Interest income relates to bank interest or similar income and is recognised on an accruals basis using the effective interest method.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment at the lower of their fair value at the inception of the lease and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are recognised in the income statement.
Rentals payable under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Government grants Government grants in respect of property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income in the balance sheet and are recognised in the income statement over the expected useful life of the relevant asset.
Government grants in respect of revenue expenditure are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the related expenditure is incurred.
Share-based payments The Group operates equity-settled share schemes and previously operated a cash-settled share scheme for certain employees.
The cost of equity-settled share-based payments is measured at fair value at the date of grant, excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
The cost is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with the corresponding amount credited to equity, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
The estimate of the level of vesting is reviewed annually and the charge is adjusted accordingly in respect of non market-based vesting conditions.
The fair values are measured using the Binomial option-pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation approach.
The cost of cash-settled share-based payments was measured as per the equity-settled payments, except that it was recalculated at each subsequent reporting date.
In addition, the corresponding amount was credited to trade and other payables instead of equity.
Post-retirement benefits The Group operates various pension schemes.
The schemes are funded through trustee-administered funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations.
The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
For defined benefit schemes, the liability recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of scheme assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised past service costs.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is Fenner PLC Annual Report 2013 63 Overview Business Review Governance Remuneration Corporate Responsibility Financial Results determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Current service costs are recognised in the income statement.
Net finance costs or income are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement unless the changes to the pension scheme are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
For defined contribution schemes, payments are recognised in the income statement as they are incurred.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
Some Group companies provide post-retirement healthcare benefits to their retirees.
The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using the same accounting methodology as used for defined benefit pension schemes.
These obligations are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries.
The Group has adopted the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 to recognise in full the cumulative actuarial gains and losses at 1 September 2004, the date of transition to IFRS.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are items of income and expense that are material and relevant to an understanding of the Groups financial performance and may be operating or non-operating in nature.
In accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, such items are presented separately on the face of the income statement and analysed in the notes to the financial statements.
Taxation Taxation expense represents the sum of the current tax payable and deferred tax.
Current tax is the tax expected to be payable on taxable profit for the period using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, together with any adjustments in respect of previous years.
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are not taxable or deductible or are taxable or deductible in other years.
Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, unless specifically exempt.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
The resulting charge or credit is recognised in the income statement except when it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the charge or credit is also recognised directly in equity.
Dividends Dividends proposed by the Board are recognised in the financial statements when they have been approved by shareholders at the AGM.
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
Segmental reporting Segmental information is reported in a manner consistent with the information provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
This information is used for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use, including borrowing costs for qualifying assets.
The Group has adopted the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 to record the previously revalued freehold land and buildings as deemed cost at 1 September 2004, the date of transition to IFRS.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation on other assets is recognised in the income statement to write down the value of the asset to its residual value on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset from the date it is brought into use.
Estimated useful lives most widely applied are as follows: Freehold buildings 40 years Leasehold buildings Unexpired term of lease Plant, machinery and equipment 3-10 years Fenner PLC Annual Report 2013 64 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the term of the relevant lease.
Assets under construction are not depreciated until commissioned.
Assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
The carrying amount of goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Any excess of the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired entity over cost is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associate is included within the carrying amount of the investment.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 September 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, has been recorded at the previous UK GAAP carrying amount at that date, subject to any impairment required at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 continues to be included in reserves and is not included in any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially recognised at their fair value.
Other intangible assets are initially recognised at cost.
Intangible assets are subsequently stated at fair value or cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.
Estimated useful lives most widely applied are as follows: Computer software 3-5 years Order book within 1 year Brands and trademarks 3-20 years Leases 5-7 years Customer relationships 5-16 years Technology based assets 5 years Non-compete agreements 3-6 years Impairment The carrying amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of any impairment loss.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Goodwill is allocated to those cash-generative units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss previously been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit.
Any reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses on goodwill are not subsequently reversed.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value with allowance for obsolete or slow moving items.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Raw materials are generally determined on a first in, first out basis.
Fenner PLC Annual Report 2013 65 Overview Business Review Governance Remuneration Corporate Responsibility Financial Results Financial assets Financial assets are recognised in the balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
a Trade receivables Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business.
They are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due and this cost is recognised in the income statement.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the income statement.
b Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits available on demand and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents also includes bank overdrafts as they are an integral part of the Groups cash management.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
a Trade payables Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services acquired from suppliers in the ordinary course of business.
They are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
b Borrowings Bank loans and overdrafts and other loans are initially measured at fair value less direct transaction costs.
They are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowing using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments, including forward foreign currency contracts, options, currency swaps and non-derivative cash instruments, including foreign currency borrowings, to hedge its exposure to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates or interest rates.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently measured at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity.
Amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting or the ineffective portion of financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges are recognised in the income statement as they are incurred.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument in equity at that time is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to the income statement in the period.
Provisions Provisions in respect of restructuring costs, property and environmental costs, contingent and deferred consideration on acquisition and redemption liability on acquisitions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material using a suitable pre-tax rate which matches the maturity of and risks associated with that liability.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Equity instruments issued are recorded at the proceeds received net of directly attributable issue costs.
Fenner PLC Annual Report 2013 66 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 2.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires management to make certain assumptions, estimates and judgements that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
These are based on historical experience and any other factors, including expectations of future events, that are considered appropriate and these are continually reviewed.
Subsequent actual results may however differ from these estimates and judgements.
Areas where assumptions, estimates and judgements may give rise to risk of material adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are as follows: Taxation The Group is subject to taxation in various jurisdictions and uncertainties exist over the interpretation of the respective tax regulations and the ultimate determination by the tax authorities in those jurisdictions.
Taxation is calculated based on the best estimates of amounts expected to be due.
Where the final tax determination is different to the amounts initially recorded, they are subsequently adjusted in the period in which such determination is made.
Deferred taxation is recognised based on the estimated likelihood that future taxable profits will be available against which temporary differences can be utilised.
Impairment of goodwill Impairment testing for the carrying amount of goodwill is based on estimated recoverable amounts of cash-generating units, based on value in use calculations.
This is calculated using cash flow projections based on financial forecasts for a period of three years and, thereafter, extrapolated using estimated growth rates in the respective territories.
Cash flows are discounted using an appropriate pre-tax cost of capital for each respective territory.
Inventory provisions The provision for inventory write downs is based on managements estimate of the net realisable value of inventories.
Impairment of trade receivables Impairment of trade receivables is based on managements estimate of the recoverability of receivable amounts.
This is based on a variety of factors including past default experience.
Retirement benefit obligations Retirement benefit obligations are based on actuarial valuations that use a number of assumptions.
These include the discount rate, which is based on the interest rate of high quality corporate bonds denominated in the currency of the benefits and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related obligation, expected rates of return on assets, inflation rates, expected salary increases and mortality.
Provisions Provisions represent managements best estimate of expenditure required to settle obligations existing at the balance sheet date.
For certain obligations within contingent and deferred consideration on acquisitions and redemption liability on acquisitions, payments are contingent on the future performance of acquired businesses and this is estimated based on financial forecasts.
Where material, obligations are discounted using suitable rates based on borrowings that match the maturity of the consideration being discounted.

Segment information IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires segment information to be presented on the same basis as that used for internal management reporting.
For the purposes of managing the business, the Group is organised into two reportable segments: Engineered Conveyor Solutions and Advanced Engineered Products.
Engineered Conveyor Manufacture of rubber ply, solid woven and steel cord conveyor belting for mining, power Solutions generation and industrial applications with complementary service operations which design, install, monitor, maintain and operate conveyor systems for mining and industrial customers.
Advanced Engineered Manufacture of precision polymer products including: Products - precision drives for computer peripherals, copiers and ATMs: - problem-solving power transmission and motion transfer components: - silicone and complex hoses for heavy duty trucks, buses and off-road vehicles: - lay-flat hoses for firefighting, agriculture, water and gas industries: - seals and sealing solutions for the fluid power and oil & gas industries: - technical textiles for medical and industrial applications and silicone-based products for medical applications: - rollers for digital image processing and medical diagnostics: and - fluropolymer components for fluid, oil and gas handling and medical applications.
Operating segments within these reportable segments have been aggregated where they have similar economic characteristics with similar products and services, production processes, methods of distribution and customer types.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM for the purpose of IFRS 8 is the Board of Directors.
The financial position of the segments is reported to the CODM on a monthly basis and this information is used to assess the performance of the Group and to allocate resources on an appropriate basis.
Segment performance is reviewed down to the operating profit level.
Financing costs and taxation are managed on a Group basis so these costs are not allocated to operating segments.
Transfer prices on inter-segment revenues are on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.

The impairment charge on goodwill and brands and trademarks in 2013 relates to Fenner Precision Buffalo and Xeridiem.
The impairment review was triggered by a reduction in the projected cash flows in these cash-generating units.
This is classified within administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Fenner PLC Annual Report 2013 75 Overview Business Review Governance Remuneration Corporate Responsibility Financial Results Impairment testing for goodwill Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated at acquisition to the Groups cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units as follows: 2013 2012 m m Engineered Conveyor Solutions Fenner Dunlop Americas, Europe and Australia 14.

- 4 Advanced Engineered Products Fenner Advanced Sealing Technologies Process 16.
16.0 5 Fenner Advanced Sealing Technologies Fluid Power 27.
121.9 0 The carrying amount of goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are based on value in use calculations using discounted cash flow projections.
The key assumptions used to determine the value in use relate to profits derived from sales volumes, selling prices and costs, growth rates and pre-tax discount rates.
Cash flow projections are based on financial forecasts for a period of three years which have been approved by Group management.
The principal components of these forecasts: sales volumes, selling prices and costs, are based on recent history and expected future changes in operating conditions.
Cash flows beyond a period of three years are extrapolated using estimated growth rates in the respective territories.
These rates range from 0.7% to 3.9% for all cash-generating units except for Conveyor Belting India where a rate of 6.5% has been applied.
A range of discount rates between 10.1% to 13.8% were used for all cash-generating units except for Conveyor Belting India where a rate of 18.7% was used.
The discount rates reflect the risk profiles in the respective territories.
The above assumptions apply to all of the Groups cash-generating units.
At 31 August 2013, there is significant headroom between the value in use calculation and the carrying value for all of the cash-generating units in the above table except for Xeridiem and Fenner Precision Buffalo which were impaired during the year.
At 31 August 2013, the remaining goodwill held on the balance sheet in respect of Xeridiem and Fenner Precision Buffalo was 0.2m and 1.4m respectively.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset of current tax and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of certain tax losses amounting to 0.5m 2012: 0.3m since it is not envisaged that such profits will be available in the foreseeable future.
In addition, deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of UK capital losses of 0.4m 2012: 0.4m since it is not envisaged that suitable capital gains will be available in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries because the Group is in a position to control the timing of reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Financial risk management In the normal course of business, the Group is exposed to certain financial risks, principally foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
These risks are managed by the central treasury function in conjunction with the operating units, in accordance with risk management policies that are designed to minimise the potential adverse effects of these risks on financial performance.
The policies are reviewed and approved by the Board.
Foreign exchange risk The Group has operations around the world and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from net investments in foreign operations.
Where cost effective, the exposures arising from the translation of the net assets of the Groups foreign operations are managed through the use of borrowings or cross-currency swaps in the relevant foreign currency.
Some Group operations also enter into commercial transactions in currencies other than their functional currencies.
Exposures arising from the translation of foreign currency transactions are continually monitored and material exposures are managed through the use of forward contracts or options once cash flows can be identified with sufficient certainty.
Exposures arising from the translation of intra-group lending are managed through the use of borrowings in the relevant foreign currency.
The following table shows the impact due to the retranslation of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities in the Group's operations of a, reasonably possible, 10% movement in the Groups principal foreign currency exchange rates at the year end date.

The effect on shareholders equity is due to the effect on profit as well as the effect of financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies qualified as either cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
Further details of the currency profile of borrowings are given in note 22.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to interest rate risk arises on floating rate borrowings and cash and cash equivalents.
This is reviewed regularly and is managed through the use of an appropriate mix of fixed rate and floating rate instruments in response to market conditions.
The impact of interest rate risk on the Group's result is due to changes in interest rates on net floating rate cash and cash equivalents and borrowings.
At 31 August 2013, if interest rates on the Group's net floating rate cash and cash equivalents and borrowings had been 100 basis points higher, a reasonably possible movement, with all other variables held constant, the effect on profit before taxation in the year would have been a credit of 0.7m 2012: 0.8m.
A reduction of 100 basis points would have the equal and opposite effect.
There is no further impact on shareholders' equity.
Further details of the interest rate profile of borrowings are given in note 22.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity risk to ensure that sufficient resources are available for both short-term working capital and longer-term strategic requirements.
This is achieved through an appropriate mix of long and short-term borrowings and, as far as possible, the major part of the Groups total borrowings are managed so that they are drawn down using committed debt facilities which would not mature for at least one year.
The Groups principal loan facilities are raised and managed centrally but are supplemented by local overdraft and working capital facilities.
Committed debt facilities principally comprise bank loans and private placements.
The Group regularly monitors expected cash flows against availability of financing.
Regular updating of business forecasts, including cash flows, is a process embedded into the Groups internal financial reporting routines.
Forecasts are initially carried out at an individual operating unit Fenner PLC Annual Report 2013 80 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 20.
Financial risk management continued level, but are consolidated and reviewed by Group management.
The availability of financing, headroom over existing facilities and forward compliance with financial covenants are monitored against expected cash flows.
The process takes into account the shorter-term liquidity needs of individual operating units or territories as well as the availability of funding to fulfil longer-term strategic objectives such as major capital expenditure or business acquisitions.

Fenner PLC Annual Report 2013 81 Overview Business Review Governance Remuneration Corporate Responsibility Financial Results Credit risk Credit risk principally arises on short-term deposits, derivative financial instruments and trade and other receivables.
The credit risk arising on short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments is managed through the use of counterparties with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group only trades with recognised, creditworthy third parties.
It is the Group's policy that all customers who wish to take on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and the Group's exposure to bad debts is not significant.
The credit risk arising on trade receivables is spread across a large number of customers and across many countries.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying value of these instruments.
An analysis showing the ageing of trade receivables not impaired is given in note 17.
Capital management The primary objective of the Group's capital management of total equity and net debt is to ensure that it maintains healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares and vary the maturity profile of its borrowings.
The Group monitors capital using the following indicators: Net debt to EBITDA ratio 2013 2012 Net debt m 121.
107.6 5 Depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges m 43.
0.7 9 Net debt to EBITDA comprises net debt divided by operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges.
140.8 5 Net interest payable on bank overdrafts and loans, other loans and bank deposits m 14.
9.4 8 EBITDA interest cover comprises operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges divided by net interest payable on bank overdrafts and loans, other loans and bank deposits.
The Groups principal loan covenants are: EBITDA interest cover EBITDA being at least 3 times the net interest payable : and net debt to EBITDA ratio net debt being less than 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.
At 31 August 2013, the Group comfortably complied with its loan covenants.
EBITDA interest cover was 8.8 times 2012: 9.4 times while net debt to reported EBITDA was 0.9 times 2012: 0.7 times.
In addition, for compliance with loan covenants, reported EBITDA is adjusted for, inter alia, acquisitions and non-cash items: therefore, the measures improve when adjusted for these items.

Post-retirement benefits The Group operates a number of defined benefit post-retirement schemes for qualifying employees in operations around the world.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
The cost of the schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit method.
The principal scheme is the Fenner Pension Scheme which is based in the UK and was closed to new entrants in 1997.
The most recent triennial valuation of the Fenner Pension Scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2011.
The actuarial valuations for all schemes were updated as at 31 August 2013 by independent qualified actuaries.
The principal assumptions used to determine the assets and liabilities of the schemes are as follows: 2013 2012 UK Overseas UK Overseas scheme schemes scheme schemes Discount rate 4.5% 3.5% - 5.
3.5% 5% 2.0% - 4.5% Rate of increase in benefits in payment subject to Limited Price Indexation incre ases: - capped at 5.0% based on RPI 3.1% 2.5% - capped at 2.5% based on RPI 2.1% 1.8% - capped at 3.0% based on CPI 2.2% 1.8% The principal assumptions of the schemes are determined using appropriate expert advice and available market data.
The assumptions of the overseas schemes are given as a range of values in respect of the individual schemes.
The range of values is a consequence of the diversity of territories in which the Group operates defined benefit schemes.
The assumptions relating to longevity underlying the pension liabilities at the balance sheet date are based on standard actuarial mortality tables, with adjustments to reflect the schemes' actual mortality experience.
In respect of the Fenner Pension Scheme, the Group has used SAPS S1 mortality tables based on year of birth as published by the Institute of Actuaries for both pensioner and non-pensioner members, adjusted to reflect the results of an investigation into the actual mortality experience of Scheme members.
In addition, to allow for future improvements in longevity, the medium cohort tables published by the Institute of Actuaries have been used with a minimum long-term rate of future annual mortality improvement of 1%.

Share-based payments The Group operates two equity-settled share-based payment schemes and previously operated a cash-settled scheme.
a Fenner PLC 1996 Executive Share Option Scheme Share options were granted to certain employees within the Group.
The exercise price of options granted is set at the market price of the shares on the date of the grant.
The vesting period is generally 3 years.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of the grant the options expire.
Options can only be exercised upon satisfaction of performance criteria.
This requires that the overall growth of the Groups earnings per share before amortisation of intangible assets acquired and exceptional items over a consecutive three year period exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Price Index over the same period by at least 9%.
The last grant of shares under the Executive Share Option Scheme was made in November 2004.
Details of movements in outstanding share options are as follows: Weighted average Options share price number pence At 1 September 2011, at 1 September 2012 and at 31 August 2013 20,406 123.5 At 31 August 2013, 20,406 2012: 20,406 options were exercisable.
The following share options were outstanding at 31 August 2013: Options Option price number pence Dates exercisable 20,406 123.5 2007 to 2014 The remaining contractual life of outstanding share options at 31 August 2013 is 1.2 years.
b Performance Share Plan Conditional awards of shares are made to certain employees within the Group.
The conditional award is made to each employee at the start of a three year performance period and is based on a percentage of the basic annual salary of each employee.
The awards are subject to the satisfaction of performance criteria.
The proportion of the conditional share awards that vest is based on a combination of the Total Shareholder Return TSR measure and an earnings per share EPS measure.
The EPS measure accounts for 33% of the final allocation on vesting and the TSR measure for 67%.
The EPS performance target is set against underlying EPS growth in the Company measured over the three years from the end of the financial year preceding the year in which the award was made.
Fenner PLC Annual Report 2013 89 Overview Business Review Governance Remuneration Corporate Responsibility Financial Results Details of movements in conditional awards under the Performance Share Plan are as follows: Shares number At 1 September 2011 2,358,319 Conditional awards during the year 422,515 Dividend roll up awards applied 27,360 Final awards during the year 665,058 Lapsed during the year 882,938 At 1 September 2012 1,260,198 Conditional awards during the year 433,782 Dividend roll up awards applied 36,041 Forfeited during the year 77,673 Final awards during the year 426,445 At 31 August 2013 1,225,903 Dividend roll ups have been applied since 2008 in line with the PSP Rules.
They accrue over the Plan Cycle and are added to the original conditional award before the final award and allotment of shares is made.

An amount of 0.7m 2012: 0.9m has been recognised as a charge within administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement and a credit to retained earnings within equity.
Further details of the Performance Share Plan can be found in the Board Remuneration Report on pages 40 to 48. c Shadow Performance Share Plan Conditional awards of notional shares were made to certain employees within the Group between 2007 and 2009, the final conditional award being on 19 November 2008.

1 0 Notional finance charge on redemption liability - - 0.
38.2 2 Provisions represent the best estimate of obligations at the balance sheet date.
The property and environmental provision principally relates to onerous leases.
The provision for contingent and deferred consideration on acquisitions relates to the estimated value of earn-out payments and other obligations based on the future performance of acquired businesses or other non-performance related deferred payments.
The redemption liability on acquisitions relates to the obligation in respect of put and call options in relation to the purchase of non-controlling interests in acquisitions.
Where these amounts are material, they have been discounted at rates between 2.8% and 7.2%, representing a suitable pre-tax rate based on borrowings that match the maturity of the consideration being discounted, to reflect the risks associated with future cash flows.
Provisions are expected to be utilised within four years in respect of property and environmental, three years in respect of contingent and deferred consideration of acquisitions and four years in respect of redemption liability on acquisitions.

Acquisitions On 1 September 2012, the Group completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of American Industrial Plastics AIP, based in Florida, USA.
AIP is a precision machining company with the ability to machine advanced polymers for application in the oil & gas and medical markets as well as manufacturing performance precision components for a range of niche applications including aerospace.
The initial cash consideration was 16.7m with contingent deferred amounts estimated at 7.2m.
This is based on an assessment of the estimated profitability over a two year period and is discounted to net present value.
The range of potential outcomes on an undiscounted basis is between nil and 9.4m.
On 3 September 2012, the Group completed the acquisition of 100% of the share capital of Norwegian Seals, which has operations in Norway and the UK.
Norwegian Seals manufactures and distributes performance-critical seals into the oil & gas market.
This acquisition has increased FASTs presence in the North Sea market and is enabling Norwegian Seals to build its growing industry reputation and presence in new markets.
The initial cash consideration, net of debt acquired, was 11.8m with deferred amounts of 3.8m.
On 3 September 2012, the Group completed the acquisition of 100% of the share capital of Mandals, principally based in Norway with a smaller facility in Sweden.
Mandals is a leading manufacturer of innovative lay-flat and speciality hoses for use in demanding applications including in the exploitation of shale gas reserves, where its products have important cost and logistical advantages over traditional pipes.
The cash consideration, net of debt acquired, was 11.6m.
"On 30 November 2012, the Group completed the acquisition of 100% of the share capital of Australian Conveyor Engineering Pty Limited ""ACE"", based in New South Wales, Australia."
ACE specialises in supplying engineered conveyor solutions for the design, manufacture and installation of high capacity conveyor systems for both surface and underground mining.
The acquisition has enhanced Fenner Dunlop's service offering to mining customers, initially in Australia, with the expectation of this being rolled out elsewhere in the future.
The initial cash consideration, net of debt acquired, was 14.0m with contingent deferred amounts estimated at 5.8m.
This is based on an assessment of the estimated profitability over a three year period and is discounted to net present value.
The range of potential outcomes on an undiscounted basis is between nil and 12.6m.
Fenner PLC Annual Report 2013 93 Overview Business Review Governance Remuneration Corporate Responsibility Financial Results Details of the provisional aggregate assets and liabilities acquired, based on exchange rates at the dates of completion, are given below.

Goodwill arising on acquisition principally represents the workforce and anticipated synergies gained through the acquisitions.
Goodwill in respect of the acquisition of AIP is deductible for tax purposes.
Goodwill in respect of the acquisitions of Norwegian Seals, Mandals and ACE are not deductible for tax purposes.
The fair value of trade and other receivables acquired is 11.3m.
None of the trade receivables have been impaired.
Where material, contingent and deferred consideration has been discounted using suitable risk free, pre-tax rates based on borrowings that match the maturity of the consideration being discounted.
Provisional fair values of assets and liabilities represent the best estimate of the fair values at the dates of acquisition.
As permitted by IFRS 3 Revised Business Combinations, these provisional amounts can be amended for a period of up to 12 months following acquisition if subsequent information becomes available which changes the estimates of fair values at the dates of acquisition.
In respect of the current year acquisitions, only assets and liabilities in respect of ACE are provisional since the 12 month period has been completed for the other acquisitions.
Fenner PLC Annual Report 2013 94 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 33.
Acquisitions continued Contingent deferred consideration payable is re-assessed on all acquisitions at the balance sheet date.
During the year, as a result of an increase in estimated future profitability, the estimated deferred amounts payable on the Conveyor Services Corporation group of companies, which were acquired on 1 October 2008, increased by 0.4m.
Since this acquisition was made prior to the adoption of IFRS 3 Revised, this resulted in an increase in goodwill on acquisition.
From the dates of acquisition, the current year acquisitions contributed 63.3m to Group revenue, 12.3m to Group operating profit before amortisation of intangible assets acquired and 7.9m to Group operating profit.
If all of the acquisitions completed in the year had occurred on 1 September 2012, it is estimated that Group revenue would have been 827.8m, Group operating profit before amortisation of intangible assets acquired would have been 102.2m and Group operating profit would have been 85.9m.
These amounts have been calculated by adjusting the results of the acquired businesses to reflect the effect of the Groups accounting policies as if they had been in effect from 1 September 2012.
Disposals On 29 April 2013, the Group disposed of Svenska Brandslangfabriken AB, a non-core business in Sweden, which was acquired as part of the Mandals businesses on 3 September 2012.
Details of the assets and liabilities disposed of are given below.

Svenska Brandslangfabriken AB did not represent a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, did not form part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of such operations and was not acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
Consequently, the disposal has not been accounted for as a discontinued operation.
