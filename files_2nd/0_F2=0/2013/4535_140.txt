109 21 Financial risk management a Financial risks and treasury management The Group conducts its treasury activities within the remit of a treasury policy, which outlines approved policies, procedures and authority levels.
The board delegates its responsibility for reviewing and approving treasury policy to the Audit Committee.
Reports are prepared monthly covering all areas of treasury activity and policy compliance and are reviewed by the Chief Financial Officer.
The board and Audit Committee receive regular reports covering treasury activities and policy compliance.
Group treasury manages the Groups funding requirements and financial risks in line with the agreed treasury policies and procedures.
The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, primarily include borrowings, cash and liquid resources, available-forsale assets, trade receivables and trade payables.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage liquidity or raise finance for the Group.
Group treasury uses derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate risks associated with the Groups financing and currency risk arising from the Groups operations.
The derivatives used are mainly interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts.
The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, which include: Funding and liquidity risk Credit risk Foreign exchange risk Interest rate risk Other price risk The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The policies and strategies for managing these risks are summarised as follows: i Funding and liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, Group treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
The Group finances its operations by a combination of retained profits, debt finance and leases.
Group treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash or working capital facility to meet the cash flow and covenant requirements of the Group and the current business plan.
Surplus cash held by the operating entities over and above balances required for working capital management are transferred to Group treasury.
Group treasury invests surplus cash in interest bearing current accounts, term deposits, money market deposits and marketable securities, choosing instruments with appropriate maturities or sufficient liquidity to provide sufficient headroom as determined by the above-mentioned forecasts.
The table below shows the maturity analysis of the Groups net contractual undiscounted cash flows in respect of non-derivative financial liabilities and derivative assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Less than One to Two to More than one year two years five years five years m m m m At 31 August 2013 Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings 163.7 236.5 Interest payments due on borrowings 5.3 5.3 6.2 Finance lease liabilities 2.0 1.9 1.3 Trade and other payables 483.0 Derivative financial assets and liabilities Interest rate swaps Net settled derivative contracts payments 2.9 2.2 2.8 Forward foreign exchange contracts Gross settled derivative contracts receipts 343.8 84.2 Gross settled derivative contracts payments 337.9 83.2 Total 651.0 8.4 246.8 110 Notes to the financial statements continued 21 Financial risk management continued a Financial risks and treasury management continued i Funding and liquidity risk continued Less than One to Two to More than one year two years five years five years m m m m At 1 September 2012 Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings 164.4 250.0 Interest payments due on borrowings 5.7 5.7 6.7 Finance lease liabilities 2.4 1.8 1.7 1.2 Trade and other payables 473.1 Derivative financial assets and liabilities Interest rate swaps Net settled derivative contracts payments 3.0 2.5 2.3 Forward foreign exchange contracts Gross settled derivative contracts receipts 373.2 131.6 Gross settled derivative contracts payments 367.6 130.9 Total 643.0 9.3 260.7 1.2 ii Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the Group may suffer financial loss through default by customers or financial institutions.
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Sales to retail customers are made in cash or by credit and debit cards: wholesale sales of products to franchisees are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high credit-quality financial institutions.
The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
The Groups policy requires that cash surpluses are placed on deposit for no longer than three months and only with counterparties with a credit rating of Aor A3 or higher as assigned by Standard & Poors or Moodys respectively.
Exceptions to this policy require board approval.
The Group considers its maximum credit risk to be 75.0 million 2012: 97.0 million being the Groups total financial assets as shown in note 22. iii Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US dollar, the Euro, the Chinese yuan and to a lesser extent the Danish krone.
To manage the foreign exchange transaction risk, entities in the Group use forward currency contracts transacted by Group treasury.
Foreign exchange risk arises when commercial transactions are denominated in a currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
Group treasury is responsible for managing the exposure in each foreign currency by using external forward currency contracts with a settlement of up to two years.
Forecast cash flows are hedged to the extent that those cash flows are deemed highly probable.
The Group regularly reviews the need to hedge foreign exchange exposure arising from the profits, assets and liabilities of its non-sterling businesses, hedging those exposures to the extent that they are considered appropriate for hedging.
A gain of 7.6 million 2012: 1.9 million was reclassified from equity to the income statement within cost of sales during the year in respect of forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges.
The notional value of open forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 August 2013 was 420.4 million 2012: 503.7 million.
The net fair value gains on open forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 August 2013 were 5.3 million 2012: 5.0 million.
This will be recycled and adjusted against the initial measurement of the acquisition cost of inventory over the next two years.
During the current and prior financial years there were no contracts reclassified to held for trading due to cash flow hedges being ineffective.
111 iv Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
The Groups current borrowing facilities are issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The interest exposure of the Group is managed within the constraints of the Groups business plan and the financial covenants under its facilities.
The aim is to reduce exposure to interest rate movements and to take advantage of low interest rates by hedging an appropriate amount of interest rate exposure whilst maintaining the flexibility to minimise early termination costs.
The Groups interest rate hedging strategy is to achieve a target fixed percentage of 75%, with a 15% tolerance 60%-90%.
The impact of movements in interest rates is managed through the use of floating rate debt and interest rate swaps.
These are usually matched with specific loans for a period of time up to their maturity or call date.
The Groups main interest rate exposure is from the floating rate loans under the credit facilities.
At the year end the Groups hedged borrowings amounted to 330.0 million 2012: 330.0 million, being 81.4% 2012: 78.3% of the Groups total borrowings.
Interest rate swaps The Groups interest rate swaps switch interest from floating rates to fixed rates.
The Groups interest rate swap portfolio is summarised as follows: Notional Rate m % Maturity Interest rate swaps 330.0 0.94%-1.865% October 2013 to October 2015 The notional principal amount of interest rate swaps at 31 August 2013 was 330.0 million 2012: 330.0 million.
The net gains and losses on these swaps, which are deferred in equity, will reverse through interest in the income statement over the life of the swaps.
During the financial year a loss of 3.3 million 2012: 2.0 million was reclassified and reported in the income statement in respect of interest rate swaps.
Financial liabilities and assets The interest rate profiles of financial liabilities after taking account of interest rate swaps, swapped from floating to fixed rates, used to manage interest were as follows: 31 August 2013 1 September 2012 Fixed Floating Total Fixed Floating Total m m m m m m Financial liabilities 1 Sterling 334.9 70.3 405.2 336.7 84.4 421.1 1 Debt issue costs of 6.2 million 2012: 8.4 million are excluded from the financial liabilities above.
Fixed sterling financial liabilities comprise the hedged portion of the debt facility of 330.0 million 2012: 330.0 million and finance lease liabilities of 4.9 million 2012: 6.7 million at 31 August 2013.
The weighted average interest rate on the fixed rate borrowings as at 31 August 2013 was 3.3% 2012: 3.3%, with the weighted average time for which rates are fixed being 3.2 years 2012: 3.2 years.
Floating rate borrowings are interest bearing at interest rates based on LIBOR.
Cash deposits are interest bearing at rates based on LIBID or relevant base rates.
Non-interest bearing cash refers to cash in stores or in transit.
Floating rate borrowings have been classified as fixed if there were derivative financial instruments hedging the floating rate interest for more than one year.

The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to equity price risk at the reporting date.
At the year end, if the market value of equity investments had been 10% higher lower, when all other variables were held constant: Net profit would have been unaffected as the equity investments were classified as available-for-sale investments Other reserves would decrease increase by 0.1 million 2012: 0.2 million for the Group as a result of the changes in the fair value of available-for-sale investments The above movement in rates is considered to represent reasonable possible changes.
Other larger or smaller changes are also possible.
b Capital management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, provide returns for shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders and to maintain a structure to optimise the cost of capital.
The Group defines capital as debt and equity.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may consider: the amount of dividend paid to shareholders, the return of capital to shareholders, the issue or sale of shares or the sale of assets to reduce debt.
The Group routinely monitors its capital and liquidity requirements through leverage ratios consistent with industry-wide borrowing standards, maintaining suitable headroom to bank facility fixed charge and leverage covenants together with credit market requirements to ensure financing requirements continue to be serviceable.
c Fair value estimates The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The fair value of forward currency contracts has been determined based on discounted market forward currency exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to approximate to their book values.
In the case of the Groups loans due in more than one year, the fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rates available to the Group.
Note 22 shows the carrying value and fair value of financial assets and liabilities.
113 d Sensitivity analysis The Group monitors interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk by determining the effect on profit of a range of possible changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
The range of sensitivities chosen, being 1% movement in the interest rate or 5% movement in sterling when compared to US dollar, Chinese yuan, Danish krone and Euro, reflects the Groups view of reasonably possible changes to these risk variables which existed at the year end.
The table below illustrates the estimated impact on the Group as a result of market movements in interest rates in relation to all the Groups financial instruments that are expressed in currencies different to that of the functional currency.
The analysis has been produced assuming no changes in the borrowings and existing interest rate swaps portfolio when considering the interest rate movement.
31 August 2013 1 September 2012 Income Income statement Equity statement Equity loss gain loss gain m m m m 1% increase in interest rate 0.7 7.5 0.7 7.5 A 1% decrease in interest rate would result in an equal and opposite change in the income statement and equity respectively.
The table below illustrates the estimated impact on the Group as a result of market movements in foreign exchange rates in relation to all the Groups financial instruments.
