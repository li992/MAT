Impairment charges are included within impairment on the face of the Group income statement and all cumulative impairment losses relate to the Americas managed cash-generating unit CGU see below.
Goodwill has been allocated to CGUs for impairment testing as follows: Cost Net book value 2013 2012 2013 2012 $m $m $m $m AMEA franchised and managed operations 80 93 80 93 Americas managed operations 141 141 221 234 80 93 The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are any indications that an impairment may have arisen.
Therecoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
These calculations use pre-tax cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and strategic plans approved by management covering a five-year period or, in the absence of up-to-date strategic plans, the financial budget for the next year with an extrapolation of the cash flows for the following four years, using growth rates based on managements past experience and industry growth forecasts.
After the five-year planning period, the terminal value of future cash flows is calculated based on perpetual growth rates that do not exceed the average long-term growth rates for the relevant markets.
Pre-tax discount rates are used to discount the cash flows based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reflect the risks specific to the businessmodel and territory of the CGU being tested.
Asia, Middle East and Africa AMEA goodwill At 31 December 2013, the recoverable amount of the CGU has been assessed based on the approved budget for 2014 and strategic plans covering a five-year period, a perpetual growth rate of 3.5% 2012 3.5% and a discount rate of 15.5% 2012 14.3%.
In previous years, the goodwill was allocated to Asia Australasia franchised and managed operations but, due to a change in management structure, this CGU no longer exists as the business is now managed at the AMEA level.
Impairment was not required at either 31 December 2013 or 31 December 2012 and management believe that the carrying value of the CGU would only exceed its recoverable amount in the event of highly unlikely changes in the key assumptions.
Americas goodwill Goodwill relating to the Americas managed operations was impaired in full in 2009.
As goodwill impairment cannot be reversed, there is no sensitivity around any assumptions that could lead to further impairment adjustments.

There are no other assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis, or for which fair value is disclosed.
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates book value due to the short maturity of the investments and deposits, and the fair value of other financial assets approximates book value based on prevailing market rates.
The fair value of other borrowings approximates book value as interest rates reset to market rates on a frequent basis.
The fair value of trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and current provisions approximates to their carrying value, including the future redemption liability of the Groups loyalty programme.
Fair value hierarchy The following table provides the fair value measurement hierarchy of the above assets and liabilities, other than those with carrying amounts which are reasonable approximations of their fair values: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on fair value are observable, either directly orindirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable marketdata.

Fair value measurement continued The fair value of quoted equity shares and the bonds is based on their quoted market price.
Derivatives are fair valued using discounted future cash flows, taking into consideration exchange rates prevailing on the last day of the reporting period and interest rates from observable swap curves.
As the Groups derivatives are not cash collaterised, a valuation adjustment is made for credit risk, being counterparty risks in respect of derivative assets and own credit risks in respect of derivative liabilities.
At 31 December 2013, the interest rates used to fair value the derivative liabilities ranged from 1.4% to 2.5%, depending on the currency and the term of the derivative contract.
Finance lease obligations relate to the lease of the InterContinental Boston and are fair valued by discounting the future cash flows payable under the loan, which are fixed, at a risk adjusted long term interest rate.
The interest rate used to discount the cash flows at 31 December 2013 was 8.4% 2012 7.4%.
Unquoted equity shares are fair valued using the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines either by applying an average price-earnings P E ratio for a competitor group to the earnings generated by the investment or by reference to share of net assets if the investment is currently loss-making.
The average P E ratio for the year was 23.9 and anon-marketability factor of 30% is applied.
A 10% increase in the average P E ratio would result in a $5m increase 2012 $5m in the fair value of the investments and a 10% decrease in the average P E ratio would result in a $5m decrease 2012 $5m in the fair value of the investments.
A 10% increase in net assets would result in a $5m increase 2012 $2m in the fair value of the investments and a 10% decrease in net assets would result in a $5m decrease 2012 $2m in the fair value of the investments.

Retirement benefits UK UK retirement and death in service benefits are provided for eligible Group employees in the UK principally by the InterContinental Hotels UK Pension Plan, which is HM Revenue & Customs registered.
The defined benefit section of the plan, which provides benefits based on final salary and is funded, closed to new entrants in 2002 and closed to future accrual for current members with effect from 1 July 2013.
New members, including those who have been auto-enrolled since 1 September 2013, are provided with defined contribution arrangements as are members of the defined benefit section since 1 July 2013.
The assets of the plan are held in a self-administered trust fund which is governed by a Trustee Board who are responsible for the administration and investment strategy of the plan.
The Trustee Board comprises a combination of independent, company nominated and member nominated trustees, and is assisted by professional advisers as and when required.
As required by the Pensions Act 2004, the plan is required to meet a Statutory Funding Objective in respect of its defined benefit obligations and a formal recovery plan is required to meet a funding shortfall.
The overall operation of the plan is subject to the oversight of The Pensions Regulator.
On 15 August 2013, the Trustee Board completed a buy-in transaction whereby the assets of the plan were invested in a bulk purchase annuity policy with the insurer Rothesay Life, under which the benefits payable to defined benefit members are now fully insured.
The insurance policy was purchased using the existing assets of the plan and a final company contribution of 5m.
It is the intention of the Trustee Board that the plan will move to a full buy-out as soon as practical, following which the insurance company will become directly responsible for pension payments.
Under the most recent recovery plan, the company agreed to make additional contributions of 130m by 31 July 2014: inaddition to the 5m referred to above, 55m was paid in 2012 and a further amount of 60m was paid into a funding trust the IHG Funding Trust during the year.
30m of the funding trust payments occurred on the sale of the InterContinental London Park Lane in May 2013, over which there was previously a charge for the same amount in favour of the pension plan.
As the buy-in transaction has resulted in the defined benefit obligations being fully insured, the company has no further contributions to make and 57m has been returned to the company from the funding trust.
It is expected that the remaining 3m held in the funding trust will be returned to the company on completion of the planned buy-out.
In addition to the above, additional benefits are provided to certain members of the defined benefit section of the plan who are affected by lifetime or annual allowances through an unfunded pension arrangement.
The unfunded pension arrangement also held a charge over the InterContinental London Park Lane which, on sale of the hotel, was replaced with a charge over certain ring-fenced bank accounts totalling 31m see note 15.
US and other The Group also maintains the following US-based defined benefit plans: the funded Inter-Continental Hotels Pension Plan, unfunded Inter-Continental Hotels Non-qualified Pension Plans and unfunded Inter-Continental Hotels Corporation Postretirement Medical, Dental, Vision and Death Benefit Plan.
All plans are closed to new members.
In respect of the funded plan, an Investment Committee has responsibility for the oversight and management of the Plans assets, which are held in a separate trust.
The Committee comprises senior company employees and is assisted by professional advisers as and when required.
The company currently makes contributions that equal or exceed the minimum funding amounts required by the Employee Retirement Income and Security Act of 1974 ERISA.
The investment objective is to achieve full funding over time by following a specified glide path approach which results in a progressive switching from return seeking assets to liability-matching assets as the funded status of the plan increases.
During the year, the funded status reached 80% which triggered a further fide-risking of the investment portfolio.
The Group also operates a number of smaller pension schemes outside the UK, themost significant of which is a defined contribution scheme in the US: there is no material difference between the pension costs of, and contributions to, these schemes.
In respect of the defined benefit plans, the amounts recognised in the Group income statement, in administrative expenses, are: Pension plans US and Post-employment UK other benefits Total 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 1 1 1 1 1 1 2013 restated restated 2013 restated restated 2013 2012 2011 2013 restated restated $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m Current service cost 2 5 6 1 1 1 3 6 7 Past service cost 1 1 Net interest expense 1 6 3 3 3 1 1 1 4 5 10 Administration costs 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 Operating profit before exceptional items 3 7 13 6 5 5 1 1 1 10 13 19 Exceptional items: Settlement loss 147 147 Past service gain 28 28 150 7 15 6 5 5 1 1 1 157 13 9 1 Restated for the adoption of IAS 19R Employee Benefits see page 111.
The settlement loss results from the buy-in transaction described above and comprises a past service cost of $5m relating to additional benefits secured by the transaction, the difference between the cost of the insurance policy and the accounting value of the liabilities secured of $137m and transaction costs of $5m.
As the policy has been structured to enable the planto move to a buy-out and the intention is to proceed on this basis, the buy-in transaction has been accounted for as a settlement with the loss arising recorded in the income statement.
The past service gain in 2011 arose in respect of the UK pension plan and from the decision to close the defined benefit section to future accrual with effect from 1 July 2013.
The plan rules were formally amended to reflect this change in September 2011.

The current assumptions for the UK plan are based on the S1NA tables with long cohort projections and a 1.25% per annum underpin to future mortality improvements with age rated down by 1.75 years for pensioners and 1.5 years for non-pensioners.
In the US, the current assumptions are based on the RP2000 Generational with Scale BB 2D mortality tables.

2 Relates to assumptions based on longevity in years relating to an employee retiring in 2033.
The assumptions allow for expected increases in longevity.
Sensitivities Changes in assumptions used for determining retirement benefit costs and obligations may have a material impact on the income statement and the statement of financial position.
The key assumptions are the pension increases, discount rate, the rate of inflation and the assumed mortality rate.
The sensitivity analysis below is based on extrapolating reasonable changes in these assumptions, using year-end conditions and assuming no interdependency between the assumptions.

Deferred tax assets of $17m 2012 $22m are recognised in relation to legal entities which suffered a tax loss in the current or preceding period.
These assets are recognised based upon future taxable profit forecasts for the entities concerned.
A deferred tax provision was made during the year in respect of current and prior year earnings which are expected to be repatriated within the foreseeable future, consequent upon the disposal of the InterContinental London Park Lane hotel as the proceeds are not expected to be reinvested by the relevant subsidiaries.
The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets as follows: 2013 2012 $m $m Revenue losses 127 132 Capital losses 85 140 1 Total losses 212 272 Employee benefits 16 32 Foreign tax credits 34 2 Other 55 53 Total 283 391 1 These may be carried forward indefinitely other than $12m which expires after three years, $1m which expires after seven years, $1m which expires after eight years and $9m which expires after nine years 2012 $11m which expires after four years and $1m which expires after eight years.
These assets have not been recognised as the Group does not currently anticipate being able to offset these against future profits or gains in order to realise any economic benefit in the foreseeable future.
However, future benefits may arise as a result of resolving tax uncertainties, or as a consequence of case law and legislative developments which make the value of the assets more certain.
The Group has provided deferred tax in relation to temporary differences associated with post-acquisition undistributed earnings of subsidiaries only to the extent that it is either probable that it will reverse in the foreseeable future or where the Group cannot control the timing of the reversal.
The remaining unprovided liability that would arise on the reversal of these temporary differences is not expected to exceed $10m 2012 $20m.
