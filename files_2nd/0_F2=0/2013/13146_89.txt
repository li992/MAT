Historically, the major schemes have been of the defined benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The largest defined benefit schemes are in the UK, the US and the Netherlands.
The UK scheme is a final salary scheme and is closed to new hires.
Members accrue a portion of their final pensionable earnings based on the number of years of service.
The US scheme is a cash balance scheme and is closed to new hires.
Members earn pay credits dependent on age and years of service which are added to an account balance that accrues interest at a minimum rate of 4% per annum.
The Netherlands scheme is a career average salary scheme and remains open to new hires.
Members accrue a portion of their current salary at a rate calculated to enable them to reach a pension level based on their average salary.
Each of the major defined benefit schemes is administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from Reed Elsevier.
The trustees of the pension funds in the UK and the Netherlands and plan fiduciaries of the US scheme are required by law to act in the interest of the funds beneficiaries.
In the UK and in the Netherlands the trustees of the pension fund are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
The boards of trustees consist of an equal number of Reed Elsevier appointed and member nominated directors.
In the US, the fiduciary duties for the scheme are allocated between committees which are staffed by senior employees of Reed Elsevier: the investment committee has the primary responsibility for the investment and management of plan assets.
The funding of Reed Elseviers major schemes reflects the different rules within each jurisdiction.
In the UK the level of funding is determined by statutory triennial actuarial valuations in accordance with pensions legislation.
Where the scheme falls below 100% funded status, Reed Elsevier and the scheme trustees must agree on how the deficit is to be remedied.
The UK Pensions Regulator has significant powers and sets out in codes and guidance the parameters for scheme funding.
The US scheme has an annual statutory valuation which forms the basis for establishing the employer contribution each year subject to ERISA and IRS minimums.
Should the statutory funded status fall to below 100%, the US Pensions Protection Act requires the deficit to be rectified with additional contributions over a 7 year period.
In the Netherlands, the scheme funding level is determined by an annual actuarial valuation as prescribed by the Dutch Pension Act.
Ifthe funding level falls below the statutory minimum a short term recovery plan is negotiated between the plan trustees and filed with the Dutch Central Bank DCB.
An evaluation of the recovery plan is required to be filed at the DCB annually.
Total regular employer contributions to defined benefit pension schemes in respect of 2014 are expected to be approximately 46m.
