97 3 Segmental reporting IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires disclosure of the operating segments which are reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The CODM has been identified as the executive committee, which includes the executive directors and other key management.
It is the executive committee that has responsibility for planning and controlling the activities of the Group.
The Groups reportable segments have been identified as the UK and international.
The segments are reported to the CODM to operating profit level, using the same accounting policies as applied to the Group accounts.
The Group does not review the assets and liabilities by operating segment as these are reviewed on a Group-wide basis given their transposable nature.
As a result, no such analysis has been provided.
