Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Accounts For the year ended 31 December 2013 1 Corporate information The Consolidated Financial Statements of National Express Group PLC and its subsidiaries the Group for the year ended 31 December 2013 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 27 February 2014.
National Express Group PLC is a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales whose shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The principal activities of the Group are described in the Strategic Report that accompanies these Financial Statements.
2 Accounting policies Statement of compliance These Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC as adopted by the European Union EU, and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Basis of preparation These Financial Statements have been prepared on the going concern basis see Governance Report on page 62 under the historical cost convention, except for the recognition of derivative financial instruments and available for sale investments.
These Financial Statements are presented in pounds Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand pounds 0.1m except where otherwise indicated.
A summary of the Groups accounting policies applied in preparing these Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 is set out below.
Significant accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statement and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.
The key accounting estimates and judgements are: Goodwill impairment Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Details of the assumptions used and key sensitivities are set out in note 14 to these Financial Statements.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits Determining the amount of the Groups retirement benefit obligations and the net costs of providing such benefits requires assumptions to be made concerning long term interest rates, inflation, salary and pension increases, investment returns and longevity of current and future pensioners.
Changes in these assumptions could significantly impact the amount of the obligations or the cost of providing such benefits.
The Group makes assumptions concerning these matters with the assistance of advice from independent qualified actuaries.
Details of the assumptions made are set out in note 34.
Insurance The estimation of the insurance provisions is based on an assessment of the expected settlement on known claims together with an estimate of settlements that will be made in respect of incidents occurring prior to the Balance Sheet date but for which claims have not been reported to the Group.
Tax provisions Assessing the outcome of uncertain tax positions requires judgements to be made regarding the result of negotiations with and enquiries from tax authorities in a number of jurisdictions.
The assessments made are based on advice from independent tax advisors and the status of ongoing discussions with the relevant tax authorities.
102 National Express Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial Statements pp93-167 2 Accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation These Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the Financial Statements of National Express Group PLC and all its subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December each year.
Adjustments are made to bring any dissimilar accounting policies that may exist into line with the Groups accounting policies.
On acquisition of a business, the purchase method of accounting is adopted, and the Group Income Statement includes the results of subsidiaries and businesses purchased during the year from the date control is assumed.
The purchase consideration is allocated to assets and liabilities on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition.
On the sale of a business, the Group Income Statement includes the results of that business to the date of disposal.
Intra-Group transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of comprehensive income and equity in subsidiaries that is not attributable to the parent Company shareholders and is presented separately from parent shareholders equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Certain comparatives have been reclassified to be consistent with the current years changes in presentation.
Changes in accounting policies The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except for the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations which have been adopted in the current year.
Their adoption has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these Financial Statements.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 the standard defines fair value, and a framework for measuring fair value.
IAS 19 revised Employee Benefits effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 the standard has impacted the measurement of the various components representing movements in the defined benefit pension obligation and associated disclosures, but not the Groups total obligation.
Following the replacement of expected returns on plan assets with a net finance cost in the Income Statement, the operating profit for the period has been reduced and accordingly other comprehensive income increased.
Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements the amendments require items of other comprehensive income to be grouped by those items that may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss and those that will never be reclassified, together with their associated income tax.
The amendments have been applied retrospectively, and hence items of comprehensive income have been represented to reflect the change.
The effect of these changes is evident from the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Interests in joint ventures The Group has a number of contractual arrangements with other parties to share control of other entities which represent joint ventures.
The Group recognises its interest in the entitys assets and liabilities using the equity method of accounting.
The Group Balance Sheet includes the appropriate share of these joint ventures net assets or liabilities and the Income Statement includes the appropriate share of their results after tax.
Financial Statements of jointly controlled entities are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group.
Adjustments are made in the Groups Financial Statements to eliminate the Groups share of unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its jointly controlled entities.
The Group ceases to use the equity method from the date it no longer has joint control over the entity.
Interests in associates Companies, other than subsidiaries and joint ventures, in which the Group has an investment representing not less than 20% of the voting rights and over which it exerts significant influence are treated as associates.
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the appropriate share of these associates results and net assets based on their latest Financial Statements under the equity method of accounting.
Income Statement presentation The Group Income Statement has been presented in a columnar format to enable users of the Financial Statements to view the normalised results of the Group.
Normalised results are defined as the statutory results before the following, as appropriate: profit or loss on the sale of businesses, exceptional profit or loss on the sale of non-current assets and charges for goodwill impairment, amortisation of intangible assets, exceptional items and tax relief on qualifying exceptional items and intangibles.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are material items of income or expenditure which, in the opinion of the Directors, due to their nature and infrequency require separate identification on the face of the Income Statement to allow a better understanding of the financial performance in the year, in comparison to prior years.
com 103 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Accounts continued 2 Accounting policies continued Revenue recognition Rendering of services Revenue comprises income from road passenger transport, train passenger services and related activities in the UK, North America and Europe.
Where appropriate, amounts are shown net of rebates and sales tax.
Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the customers travel or services provided under contractual arrangements as a proportion of total services to be provided.
Rail revenue includes amounts attributed to the train operating companies TOCs, based principally on agreed models of route usage by Railway Settlement Plan Limited which administers the income allocation system within the UK rail industry, in respect of passenger receipts.
In addition, net franchise agreement receipts from the Department for Transport Rail Division DfT Rail and local Passenger Transport Executives PTEs are treated as revenue.
Net franchise agreement payments to DfT Rail are recognised in operating costs.
UK Coach revenue comprises amounts receivable generated from ticket sales.
UK Bus and Spanish Coach and Bus revenue comprises amounts receivable generated from ticket sales and revenue generated from services provided on behalf of local transport authorities, which is recognised as the services are provided.
For all the divisions noted above, the relevant share of season ticket or travelcard income is deferred within liabilities and released to the Income Statement over the life of the relevant season ticket or travelcard.
North American Bus revenue from school boards and similar contracts is recognised as the services are provided.
Rental income Rental income is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Finance income Revenue is recognised using the effective interest method.
Government grants Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are included in liabilities as deferred income and are credited to the Income Statement over the expected useful economic life of the assets concerned.
Other grants are credited to the Income Statement as the related expenditure is expensed.
Segmental reporting Each of the Groups business and geographical segments provides services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of the other business segments.
Due to the nature of the Groups operations the distinct business segments align directly with geographical segments which are operating in separate economic environments.
The Groups segments comprise: UK Bus: UK Coach: Rail: North American Bus: Spanish Coach and Bus: and Central functions.
These segments are described in more detail in the Business review accompanying these Financial Statements.
Leases Leases of property, plant and equipment where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the Group, are capitalised in the Balance Sheet as property, plant and equipment.
Finance leases are capitalised at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The capital element of future obligations under hire purchase contracts and finance leases is included as a liability in the Balance Sheet.
The interest element of rental obligations is charged to the Income Statement over the period of the lease and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Leases of property, plant and equipment where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Incentives received under operating leases and initial direct costs in negotiating the lease are amortised to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
All material arrangements and transactions entered into by the Group are reviewed to check whether they contain elements that meet the accounting definition of a lease, although they may not follow the legal form of a lease.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred except where they are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, in which case they are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.
104 National Express Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial Statements pp93-167 2 Accounting policies continued Current tax and deferred tax Current tax is provided on taxable profits earned according to the local tax rates applicable where the profits are earned.
Income taxes are recognised in the Income Statement unless they relate to an item accounted for in other Comprehensive Income or Equity, in which case the tax is recognised directly in other Comprehensive Income or Equity.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the current tax are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full in respect of all material temporary differences at the Balance Sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, apart from the following exceptions: where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill: where an asset or liability is recognised in a transaction that is not a business combination and that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: and in respect of investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences reverse based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that future taxable profits will be available against which the underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
Their carrying amount is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date on the same basis.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately that meet the recognition criteria of IAS 38 Intangible Assets, are capitalised at cost and when acquired in a business combination are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, finite life assets are amortised on a straight-line basis and indefinite life assets are not amortised.
The amortisation expense is taken to the Income Statement through operating costs.
Finite life intangible assets have a residual value of nil and are amortised over their estimated useful lives as follows: Customer contracts over the life of the contract between 1 and 33 years Right to operate TOC franchises over the life of the franchise between 1 and 7 years Contractual relationships over the life of the relationship between 8 and 20 years Brands over the life of the brand 5 years Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment.
The useful lives of finite life intangible assets are examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.
Finite life assets are reviewed for impairment where indicators of impairment exist.
The Groups only indefinite life intangible asset is goodwill.
Software Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset and is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Costs include software licences, consulting costs attributable to the development, design and implementation of the computer software and internal costs directly attributable to the development, design and implementation of the computer software.
Costs in respect of training are expensed as incurred.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method so as to charge the cost of the computer software to the Income Statement over its estimated useful life 3 to 7 years.
The carrying value of intangibles is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
com 105 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Accounts continued 2 Accounting policies continued Goodwill Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is stated at historic cost less any accumulated impairment.
If an acquisition gives rise to an excess of the acquirers interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over cost previously referred to as negative goodwill, this is credited immediately to the Income Statement.
In accordance with IFRS 3, goodwill is not amortised.
All goodwill is subject to an annual test of impairment and an impairment charge recognised as required.
Fair value accounting adjustments are made in respect of acquisitions.
Fair value adjustments based on provisional estimates are amended within one year of the acquisition if required, with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill, in order to refine adjustments to reflect further evidence gained post-acquisition.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and all or part of that unit is disposed of, the associated goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on the disposal of the operation.
Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment is stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Under the transitional arrangements of IFRS 1, the Group elected to deem the fair value of certain revalued assets to be equivalent to cost.
Land and buildings comprise mainly vehicle depots and garages, and offices.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings 30 to 50 years Long leasehold property 15 to 40 years improvements Public service vehicles 8 to 15 years Plant and equipment, fixtures 3 to 15 years and fittings Useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.
Repairs and maintenance are charged to the Income Statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Any gain or loss arising on the derecognition of the asset is included in the Income Statement in the period of derecognition.
Impairment of non-financial assets All non-current assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, except for indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill which are reviewed annually.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount which is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows.
In assessing value in use, the estimated risk adjusted future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Income Statement in expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Except for goodwill impairments, a review is made at each reporting date of any previous impairment losses to assess whether they no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated and any previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to assess the recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased, subject to a limit of the assets net book value had no previous impairment loss been recognised.
Such reversal is recognised in the Income Statement.
Future depreciation or amortisation is then adjusted to allocate the assets revised carrying amount over its remaining useful economic life.
Impairments to goodwill cannot be reversed.
106 National Express Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial Statements pp93-167 2 Accounting policies continued Financial instruments The Group determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition.
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, and available-for-sale.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading.
A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term.
Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges.
Assets in this category are classified as current assets.
Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the Income Statement.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss category are presented in the Income Statement within finance costs in the period in which they arise.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the Balance Sheet date which are classified as non-current assets.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the Balance Sheet date.
The Groups investments in entities that are not subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures are classified as available-for-sale financial assets.
After initial recognition these assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the previously reported cumulative gain or loss is included in the Income Statement.
Where there is no active market for the Groups investments, fair value is determined using valuation techniques including recent commercial transactions and discounted cash flow analyses.
In the absence of any other reliable external information, assets are carried at cost or amortised cost as appropriate.
The Group assesses at each Balance Sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
In the case of equity securities classified as available for sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered as an indicator that the securities are impaired.
If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the Income Statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the Income Statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the Income Statement.
Financial liabilities When a financial liability is recognised initially, the Group measures it at its fair value.
Financial liabilities include trade payables, accruals, other payables, borrowings and derivative financial instruments.
In the case of a financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, an adjustment is made for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of the financial liability.
Subsequent measurement depends on its classification as follows: Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Financial liabilities classified as held for trading and derivative liabilities that are not designated as effective hedging instruments are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
These liabilities are carried on the Balance Sheet at fair value with gains or losses being recognised in the Income Statement.
Other All other financial liabilities not classified as fair value through profit or loss are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
com 107 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Accounts continued 2 Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward exchange contracts, fuel derivatives and interest rate derivatives to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency, fuel price and interest rate fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value for the reported Balance Sheet.
The fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts, interest rate and fuel derivatives is calculated by reference to market exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices at the period end.
The Groups fuel derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.
The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity, and the ineffective portion in the Income Statement.
The gains or losses deferred in equity in this way are recycled through the Income Statement in the same period in which the hedged underlying transaction or firm commitment is recognised in the Income Statement.
The Groups interest rate derivatives are designated as fair value hedges.
The gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted through the Income Statement for the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, in this case movements in the risk free interest rate.
Foreign currency derivatives are used to hedge the Groups net investment in foreign currency denominated operations and to the extent they are designated and effective as net investment hedges are matched in equity against foreign exchange exposure in the related assets and liabilities.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the Income Statement when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.
Foreign currency forward contracts are also used to hedge transactional exposures.
These contracts are not hedge accounted and all gains and losses are taken directly to the Income Statement.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, gains or losses are taken directly to the Income Statement in the period.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value on a first in-first out basis, after making due allowance for obsolete or slow moving items.
Pre-contract costs Pre-contract costs associated with securing new rail franchises are expensed as incurred up to the point when a franchise is awarded.
From this point in time, appropriate costs are recognised as an asset and are expensed to the Income Statement over the life of the franchise.
Costs associated with the commencement of all new contracts other than rail franchises are expensed as incurred.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
Doubtful debts are provided for when collection of the full amount is no longer probable, whilst bad debts are written off when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents as defined for the cash flow statement comprise cash in hand, cash held at bank with immediate access, other short term investments and bank deposits with maturities of three months or less from the date of inception and bank overdrafts.
In the Consolidated Balance Sheet, cash includes cash and cash equivalents excluding bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts that have no legal right of set-off against cash and cash equivalents are included within borrowings in current liabilities.
Trade and other payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Interest-bearing borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost being the net fair value of the consideration received plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of the financial asset or liability.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
108 National Express Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial Statements pp93-167 2 Accounting policies continued Insurance The Groups policy is to self-insure high frequency claims within the businesses.
To provide protection above these types of losses, the Group purchases insurance cover from a selection of proven and financially strong insurers.
The insurance provision is based on estimated exposures at the year end principally for claims arising in the UK and North America prior to the year end date, subject to the overall deductible within the Groups insurance arrangements.
The majority of provisions will be utilised within five years, and the provisions have been discounted to take account of the expected timing of future cash settlements.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits The Group has a number of pension schemes, both of a defined benefit and defined contribution nature.
Full details are provided in note 34.
The Balance Sheet position in respect of defined benefit schemes comprises the net value for each scheme of the present value of the relevant defined benefit obligation at the Balance Sheet date less the fair value of plan assets.
The trustees complete a full actuarial valuation triennially, separately for each plan, but the obligation is updated annually for financial reporting purposes by independent actuaries, using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the obligation is determined by the estimated future cash outflows discounted using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds which have terms to maturity equivalent to the terms of the related liability.
The current service cost and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments are recognised in staff pension costs within operating costs in the Income Statement.
Past service costs are included in operating costs where the benefits have vested, otherwise they are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Net interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset and is recognised within finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Our TOCs participate in the RPS, a defined benefit scheme which covers the whole of the UK rail industry.
This is partitioned into sections and the Group is responsible for the funding of these sections whilst it operates the relevant franchise.
In contrast to the pension schemes operated by most businesses, the RPS is a shared cost scheme, which means that costs are formally shared 60% by the employer and 40% by the employee.
A liability is recognised in line with other defined benefit schemes in the Group, although this is offset by a franchise adjustment so that the net liability represents the deficit that the Group expects to fund during the franchise term.
The charges in respect of defined contribution schemes are recognised when they are due.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions into a defined contribution scheme if the fund has insufficient assets to pay all employees benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
Share-based payment The Group awards equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees, under which the Group receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments options of the Group.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market service and performance vesting conditions for example, profitability, sales growth targets and remaining an employee of the entity over a specified time period.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest.
The total amount expensed is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied.
At each Balance Sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the Income Statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the Balance Sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material using a pre-tax discount rate.
The amortisation of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
Contingent liabilities are obligations that arise from past events that are dependent on future events.
They are disclosed in the notes to the accounts where the expected future outflow is not probable.
com 109 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Accounts continued 2 Accounting policies continued Share capital, share premium and dividends Where either the Company or employee share trusts purchase the Companys equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any transaction costs, is deducted from total shareholders equity as own shares until they are cancelled or reissued.
Any consideration subsequently received on sale or re-issue is included in shareholders equity.
Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Groups Financial Statements on the date when dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised in the period they are paid.
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable.
They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell if their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group that has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale and it either represents a separate major line of business or geographical area: is part of a plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area: or was an acquired subsidiary intended for resale.
The resulting profit or loss from discontinued operations is reported separately in the Income Statement.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets once classified as held for sale are not depreciated or amortised.
Foreign currencies The trading results of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into Sterling, the presentation currency of the Group and functional currency of the parent, using average rates of exchange for the year as a reasonable approximation to actual exchange rates at the dates of transactions.
The balance sheets of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end and exchange differences arising are taken directly to the translation reserve in equity.
On disposal of a foreign currency denominated subsidiary, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in the translation reserve since 1 January 2004 under the transitional rules of IFRS 1 relating to that entity is recognised in the Income Statement.
All other translation differences are taken to the Income Statement, with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings and forward foreign currency contracts which are used to provide a hedge against the Group net investments in foreign enterprises.
These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in the Income Statement.
New standards and interpretations not applied At the date of authorisation of these Financial Statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these Financial Statements were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements the standard establishes the principles for the presentation of consolidated accounts when an entity controls one or more other entities.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements the standard determines the type of joint arrangement by assessing the rights and obligations, and accounts for those rights and obligations in accordance with that type of joint arrangement.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities the standard sets out the requirements to disclose information that enables users of accounts to evaluate the nature of, and risks associated with, its interests in other entities and the effects of these interests on its financial position, financial performance and cash flows.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments the standard deals with the classification, recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities, but has yet to be adopted by the EU.
IAS 36 Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets the amendment addresses the disclosure of information about the recoverable amount of impaired assets if that amount is based on the fair value less costs of disposal.
The Directors assess that the standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective are not likely to have a significant impact on future Financial Statements, with the exception of IFRS 9 which will impact both the measurement and disclosures of Financial Instruments.
110 National Express Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial Statements pp93-167 3 Exchange rates The most significant exchange rates to UK Sterling for the Group are as follows: 2013 2013 2012 2012 Closing rate Average rate Closing rate Average rate US dollar 1.66 1.56 1.63 1.59 Canadian dollar 1.76 1.61 1.61 1.59 Euro 1.20 1.18 1.23 1.23 If the results for the year to 31 December 2012 had been retranslated at the average exchange rates for the year to 31 December 2013, North American Bus would have achieved normalised operating profit of 59.8m on revenue of 584.8m, compared to normalised operating profit of 59.1m on revenue of 578.3m as reported, and Spanish Coach and Bus would have achieved a normalised operating profit of 87.7m on revenue of 559.5m, compared to normalised operating profit of 83.8m on revenue of 535.0m as reported.

Commentary on the segments is included in the Strategic Report.
All revenue in the Rail segment is generated in the UK.
Inter-segment sales in UK Bus represent internal commission on ticket sales.
Inter-segment sales in UK Coach represent rail replacement services provided to Rail.
Inter-segment trading is undertaken on standard arms length commercial terms.

com 115 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Accounts continued 7 Employee benefit costs continued b Share schemes continued i Executive Share Option Plan The Company operates tax approved and unapproved executive share option schemes open to Group employees in senior management positions.
Options granted by this Plan have a maximum term of ten years.
The options vest after three years subject to the satisfaction of certain performance criteria based on the achievement of a target growth in earnings per share.
If the performance criteria are not met when initially tested, in some instances they may be reassessed during the term of the option.
From 2005 executive share option grants have been replaced by awards made under the Long Term Incentive Plan, as described in ii.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.
ii Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP was introduced in 2005 on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee to replace the annual award under the Executive Share Option Plan to Executive Directors and to certain senior employees.
Under the LTIP, a Performance Award to acquire a specified number of free shares may be made to the employee or Director.
In addition, a Matching Award may be made, as described in iii.
Performance conditions are attached to the vesting of Performance and Matching Awards based on both the achievement of target growth in earnings per share and the relative total shareholder return TSR of the Company against a comparator group of companies.
If the performance conditions are met, Performance and Matching Awards vest on the third anniversary of the grant date and remain exercisable for a period of up to six months following the vesting date.
There are no cash settlement alternatives at present.
In 2011, 2012 and 2013 HMRC approved share option plans were added as an appendix to the LTIP Approved Plan.
A participant can only hold an option under the Approved Plan over shares with a market value of up to 30,000 at the grant date.
Options under the Approved Plan are granted in tandem with the usual options under the LTIP.
The options are structured such that on exercise, the proportion of the gain in respect of the first 30,000 worth of shares as measured at the date of grant will be delivered under the Approved Option and the LTIP option shall be scaled back to deliver the remaining gross gain that would have been delivered had the option been granted alone.
The excess shares under the LTIP will be forfeited such that both awards will never become fully vested.
Since 2012, a supplementary five-year long term incentive award was granted to the Chief Executive subject to targets linked to the Groups five-year plan.
This comprised a Performance Award with no matching element.
If performance conditions are met, the Performance award will vest on the fifth anniversary of the grant date and remain exercisable for a period of up to twelve months following the vesting date.
iii Share Matching Plan the Plan The Share Matching Plan was introduced in 2005 as part of the new Long Term Incentive Plan arrangements described in ii.
Under the Plan, a Matching Award to acquire a specified number of shares for free may be made if the employee pledges a number of shares as investment shares which are then matched by the Company on up to a 4:1 basis with the number of shares that could have been purchased with the gross-tax equivalent of the amount invested.
The Matching Awards vest on the third anniversary of the grant date and remain exercisable for a period of up to six months following the vesting date.
iv Deferred Annual Share Bonus Plan The Deferred Annual Share Bonus Plan is a discretionary scheme which forms part of the bonus arrangements for certain senior employees.
Under the scheme, part of any bonus may be received in cash whilst the remainder is used to make an award of nil cost options which vest three years after the award date.
The options must be exercised within six months of vesting.
v West Midlands Travel Ltd WMT Long Service Option Scheme The WMT Long Service Option Scheme utilises a fixed amount of shares set aside for this purpose following the acquisition of WMT in 1995 and is open to all WMT employees who have been in service for more than 25 years.
The options are exercisable between three and ten years following the grant date.
vi TWM Share Incentive Plan the SIP The TWM SIP exists for the benefit of WMT employees.
At the end of the year, 1,079 2012: 965 National Express Group PLC shares were held for the benefit of the Trustee.
Dividends on shares held in the SIP forfeited shares account are waived.

The deferred forfeitable ordinary shares are awarded under the terms of The National Express Group Executive Deferred Bonus Plan which was adopted by the Board of the Company on 10 March 2009.
The principal terms of awards under the Executive Deferred Bonus Plan are summarised below: awards under the Plan may be cash awards, conditional awards or forfeitable shares awards: awards normally vest one year from the date of grant, subject to the relevant Directors continued employment with the Company: the Committee may decide that participants shall be entitled to receive a benefit determined by reference to the value of the dividends that would have been paid on the vested shares in respect of dividend record dates occurring during the period between the grant date and the date of vesting: and the awards will normally lapse on cessation of employment save in certain compassionate good leaver circumstances eg death or disability.
In the event of a variation of the share capital of the Company, the Committee may make such adjustments to the awards as it considers appropriate.

During the year ended 31 December 2013, the Group had seven share-based payment arrangements, which are described in note 7 b.
For the following disclosure, share options with a nil exercise price have been disclosed separately to avoid distorting the weighted average exercise prices.
The number of share options in existence during the year was as follows: 2013 2012 Weighted Weighted average average Number exercise Number exercise of share price of share price options p options p Options without a nil exercise price: At 1 January 319,136 368 1,277,006 445 Granted during the year 14,840 252 26,660 252 Forfeited during the year 5,892 377 9,708 424 Exercised during the year 10,501 196 29,877 146 Expired during the year 39,126 276 944,945 475 Outstanding at 31 December 278,457 380 319,136 368 Exercisable at 31 December 225,895 411 211,343 430 Options with a nil exercise price: At 1 January 9,528,570 nil 7,285,150 nil Granted during the year 5,106,185 nil 4,754,977 nil Forfeited during the year 209,721 nil 333,117 nil Exercised during the year 1,426,737 nil 1,954,978 nil Expired during the year 786,426 nil 223,462 nil Outstanding at 31 December 12,211,871 nil 9,528,570 nil Exercisable at 31 December nil 197,069 nil Total outstanding at 31 December 12,490,328 9,847,706 Total exercisable at 31 December 225,895 408,412 The options outstanding at 31 December 2013 had exercise prices that were between 129p and 599p 2012: between 129p and 604p excluding options with a nil exercise price.
Options were exercised regularly throughout the year and the weighted average share price at exercise was 201p 2012: 225p.
118 National Express Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial Statements pp93-167 8 Share-based payments continued The weighted average fair value of the share options granted during the year was calculated using a stochastic model, with the following assumptions and inputs: Share options without nil exercise price Share options with nil exercise price 2013 2012 2013 2012 Risk free interest rate 1.19% 0.50%-1.16% 0.35%-0.84% 0.50%-0.55% Expected volatility 38.1% 36.8%-40.0% 29.2%-44.2% 40.0%-44.5% Peer group volatility 36.8%-44.3% 38.5%-45.5% Expected option life in years 7 years 3-6 years 3-5 years 3-5 years Expected dividend yield 4.73% 3.97%-4.16% 4.64%-4.88% 4.16%-4.56% Weighted average share price at grant date 206p 239p 201p 225p Weighted average exercise price at grant date 252p 252p nil nil Weighted average fair value of options at grant date 32p 49p 128p 171p Experience to date has shown that approximately 24% 2012: 24% of options are exercised early, principally due to leavers.
This has been incorporated into the calculation of the expected option life for the share options without nil exercise price.
Expected volatility in the table above was determined from historical volatility over the last eight years, adjusted for one-off events that were not considered to be reflective of the volatility of the share price going forward.
The expected dividend yield represents the dividends declared in the 12 months preceding the date of the grant divided by the average share price in the month preceding the date of the grant.
For share options granted during the year under the LTIP, the TSR targets have been reflected in the calculation of the fair value of the options above.

As a result of changes to tax legislation in 2009, overseas dividends received on or after 1 July 2009 are generally exempt from UK corporation tax, but may be subject to withholding tax.
There are no temporary differences 2012: nil associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised but for which a tax liability may arise.
e Unrecognised tax losses Deferred income tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit against future taxable profits is probable.
UK and overseas deferred tax assets that the Group has not recognised in the Financial Statements amount to 6.1m 2012: 9.4m, which arise in tax jurisdictions where the Group does not expect to generate sufficient suitable future taxable profits.
In addition, there are capital losses of 3.1m 2012: 5.9m which have not been recognised, recoverability of which is dependent on capital gains arising.
The 3.1m of unrecognised capital losses will expire at various dates from 2014 through to 2016, as follows: 2013 m 2014 1.4 2015 1.0 2016 0.7 3.1 f Deferred tax included in the Income Statement 2013 2012 m m Accelerated capital allowances 6.8 7.2 Other short term temporary differences 11.0 1.2 Utilisation of losses 5.6 5.6 Deferred tax credit charge 12.2 0.4 Details on the Balance Sheet position of deferred tax are included in note 27. g Factors that may affect future tax charges On 21 March 2012, the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a 1% reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 24% effective from 1 April 2012, along with two subsequent reductions to 23% from 1 April 2013 and 22% from 1 April 2014.
On 20 March 2013, in the Chancellors 2013 Budget Statement, further reductions to 21% on 1 April 2014 and 20% on 1 April 2015 were announced.
At the Balance Sheet date, a rate of 21% 2012: 23% was substantively enacted.
The change in rate from 23% to 21% has resulted in a tax credit of 0.1m to the income statement.
The proposed changes to reduce the UK corporation tax rate from 21% to 20% on 1 April 2015 will have a similar effect in future years.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year is adjusted to include the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
The reconciliation of basic and diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares is as follows: 2013 2012 Basic weighted average shares 511,114,989 510,552,927 Adjustment for dilutive potential ordinary shares 1,425,106 1,626,921 Diluted weighted average shares 512,540,095 512,179,848 The normalised basic and normalised diluted earnings per share have been calculated in addition to the basic and diluted earnings per share required by IAS 33 since, in the opinion of the Directors, they reflect the underlying performance of the business operations more appropriately.
The carrying value by cash-generating unit is as follows: 2013 2012 m m UK Coach 13.2 13.2 North American Bus 319.9 330.5 Spanish Coach and Bus 709.8 694.2 1,042.9 1,037.9 The recoverable amount of indefinite life intangible assets has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections based on financial budgets and forecasts approved by senior management covering a five-year period.
The assumptions, including growth rates and operating margins, are based on historical experience, detailed budget plans as well as managements assessment of current market and economic conditions.
Growth has then been extrapolated forward from the end of the forecasts.
124 National Express Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial Statements pp93-167 14 Intangible assets continued The calculation of value in use for each group of cash-generating units is most sensitive to the assumptions over discount rates and the growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the five-year period of the management plan.
The key assumptions used for the cash-generating units are as follows: Growth rate used to Pre-tax discount extrapolate cash flows rate applied to beyond five-year period of cash flow projections management plan 2013 2012 2013 2012 UK Coach 9.4% 11.9% 2.0% 2.0% North American Bus 9.1% 11.5% 2.5% 2.5% Spanish Coach and Bus 8.6% 9.0% 2.0% 2.0% The value in use of the North American Bus division exceeds its carrying amount by 161.1m 2012: 55.4m.
Sensitivity analysis has been completed on each key assumption in isolation, and this indicates that the value in use of the division will be equal to its carrying amount following an increase in the discount rate of 150 basis points 2012: 40 basis points or a reduction in the growth rates used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the five-year period of the management plan of 150 basis points 2012: 150 basis points.
The value in use of the Spanish Coach and Bus division exceeds its carrying amount by 212.9m 2012: 47.4m.
Sensitivity analysis has been completed on each key assumption in isolation, and this indicates that the value in use of the division will be equal to its carrying amount following an increase in the discount rate of 140 basis points 2012: 30 basis points or a reduction in growth rates used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the five-year period of the management plan of 150 basis points 2012: 130 basis points.
The headroom in both North American Bus and Spanish Coach and Bus has improved during the year due to the reduced discount rate and the reduced asset values.
It is believed that any reasonably possible movement on key assumptions will not lead to an impairment of goodwill allocated to UK Coach.
Sensitivities to other assumptions In North American Bus, a reduction in operating profit margin of 170 basis points 2012: 60 basis points will result in the value in use of the division being equal to its carrying amount.

The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to manage the impact of these risks on the financial performance of the Group by using financial instruments including borrowings, committed facilities and forward foreign exchange, fuel and interest rate derivatives.
The Board of Directors has delegated the responsibility for implementing the financial risk management policies laid down by the Board to the Group Finance Director and Group Treasurer.
The policies are implemented by the Group Treasury department with regular reporting to the Group Finance Director and the Audit Committee on its activities.
136 National Express Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial Statements pp93-167 30 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Foreign currency The Group has major foreign operations in the US, Canada and Spain and as a result is exposed to the movements in foreign currency exchange rates on the translation of these foreign currency denominated net assets and earnings.
These movements can have a significant impact on the Groups reported results.
The Group seeks to manage this foreign currency exchange movements risk by aligning its foreign currency denominated liabilities with the EBIT generated in each currency, such that some protection is afforded to the net debt: EBITDA covenant within the Groups core borrowing facility.
This is achieved by a combination of foreign currency borrowings and finance leases, and entering into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and foreign exchange swaps.
At the year end, the Group had outstanding foreign exchange derivatives of 170.0m and US$130.0m: swaps of US$75.0m, 4.9m, C$23.3m and finance leases of US$186.0m and 8.9m.
Derivative financial instruments are designated as net investment hedges of foreign currency assets.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income and recycled to the Income Statement at the same time as the underlying hedged net assets affect the income statement.
Any ineffectiveness is taken to the Income Statement.
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity of the Groups financial instruments to a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates, with all other variables held constant.
This would affect the Groups profit before tax and translation reserve.
The effect on the translation reserve represents the movement in the translated value of the foreign currency denominated loans and change in fair value of cross-currency swap contracts.
These movements would be offset by an opposite movement in the translated value of the Groups overseas net investments.
It is estimated that a 10% change in the corresponding exchange rates would result in an exchange gain or loss in the translation reserve of 3.5m.

It is the Groups policy to maintain an appropriate balance between fixed and floating interest rates on borrowings in order to provide a level of certainty to interest expense in the short term and to reduce the year on year impact of interest rate fluctuations over the medium term.
To achieve the desired fixed floating ratio, the Group has entered into a series of interest rate swaps that have the effect of converting fixed rate debt to floating rate debt.
The net effect of these transactions was that as at 31 December 2013 the proportion of Group net debt at floating rates was 33% 2012: 37%.
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity of the Groups financial instruments to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, on the Groups profit before tax and on the Groups hedging reserve.
The sensitivity analysis covers all floating rate financial instruments, including the interest rate swaps.
If the interest rates applicable to floating rate instruments denominated in Sterling were increased by 100bps, it is estimated that the Groups profit before taxation would decrease by approximately 1.8m.
If the interest rates applicable to floating rate instruments denominated in US$ were increased by 50bps, it is estimated that the Groups profit before taxation would remain unchanged.
If the interest rates applicable to floating rate instruments denominated in Euro were increased by 75bps, it is estimated that the Groups profit before taxation would reduce by 0.5m.
The analysis assumes that the amount and mix of floating rate debt, including finance leases, remains unchanged from that in place at 31 December 2013. www.

It is the Groups policy to hedge this exposure in order to provide a level of certainty as to its cost in the short term and to reduce the year on year impact of price fluctuations over the medium term.
This is achieved by entering into fuel derivatives.
At 31 December 2013, the Group had hedged approximately 100% of its 2014 expected usage and 86% of its expected usage in 2015 see the Group Finance Directors review for further details.
The table below demonstrates the effect of a reasonably possible variation in fuel prices, with all other variables held constant, on the fair value of the Groups financial instruments and accordingly on the Groups profit before tax and on the Groups hedging reserve.
The sensitivity analysis includes all fuel derivatives.
The effect on the hedging reserve arises through movements on the fair value of the Groups fuel derivatives.
For these derivative contracts the sensitivity of the net fair value to an immediate 20% increase or decrease in all prices would have been 41.2m at 31 December 2013.
The figure does not include any corresponding economic advantage or disadvantage that would arise from the natural business exposure which would be expected to offset the gain or loss on the derivatives.

This risk is mitigated by a number of factors.
Many of the Groups principal customers, suppliers and financial institutions with which it conducts business are public or quasipublic bodies, both national DfT Rail and Network Rail in the UK and local school boards in North America, municipal authorities in Spain and Morocco, Transport for London and Centro in the UK.
The Group does not consider these counterparties to pose a significant credit risk.
Outside of this the Group does not consider it has significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence.
The only elements of the Groups financial assets which are not impaired but are past due are certain trade receivable items.

The Group actively maintains a mixture of long term and medium term committed facilities that are designed to ensure the Group has sufficient available funds to meet current and forecast funding requirements.
In managing the liquidity risk, the Group has access to a range of funding sources through the banking and capital markets.
The Group reduced the size of the facility, which is primarily used for seasonal funding requirements, in light of its lower debt forecast.
At 31 December 2013, 393.4m of this facility remained unused 2012: 419.3m.
At 31 December 2013, the Group had committed bank borrowing and finance lease facilities of 542.9m 2012: 616.2m.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2013 based on the contractual undiscounted cash flows including interest cash flows.
As such the amounts in this table will not agree to the carrying amounts disclosed in the Balance Sheet or other Notes.
The table includes cash flows associated with derivative hedging instruments.
Their amounts reflect the maturity profile of the fair value liability where the instrument will be settled net, and the gross settlement amount where the pay leg of a derivative will be settled separately to the receive leg.

31 Financial instruments including cash, trade receivables and payables Fair values The table below illustrates the fair values of all financial assets and liabilities held by the Group at 31 December 2013.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method and the carrying value in all cases approximates to the fair value.
Available for sale investments are non-derivative assets that are either designated as available for sale, or are not classified as loans and receivables or held to maturity investments.
The Groups available for sale investments have no active market, and in the absence of any other reliable external information are carried at cost or amortised cost which approximates to the fair value.
The fair value of derivatives is either determined by the third-party financial institution with which the Group holds the instrument, in line with the market value of similar financial instruments or by use of valuation techniques using market data.
Derivatives, other than those designated as effective hedging instruments, are classified as fair value through profit or loss and are carried on the Balance Sheet at their fair value with gains or losses recognised in the Income Statement.
Derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge are carried on the Balance Sheet at their fair value.
For cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the Income Statement.
Amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the Income Statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss or when the foreign operation is sold or partially disposed.
For fair value hedges, all gains or losses are recognised in the Income Statement.
Derivatives are the only instrument which the Group holds at fair value.
The fair value measurement of these instruments is categorised within Level 2 ie the fair values are derived based on observable market inputs.
The Group has no financial instruments with fair values that are determined by reference to significant unobservable inputs ie those that would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, nor have there been any transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy.
There are no non-recurring fair value movements.
The Groups bonds are held at a hybrid amortised cost with a fair value adjustment.
After initial recognition at fair value, the bonds are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
A portion of the bonds are designated as the hedged item in an effective fair value hedging relationship.
As such the carrying value of this portion is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged.
This net carrying value will differ to the fair value depending on movements in the Groups credit risk, movements in interest rates on the un-hedged portion and unamortised fees.
All other liabilities including finance leases, bank loans, trade and other payables and other debt payable are held at amortised cost.
After initial fair value recognition, these instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The carrying value of these liabilities approximates to the fair value.

com 141 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Accounts continued 31 Financial instruments including cash, trade receivables and payables continued The Group assesses at each year end reporting date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
In the financial year 2013 there was no objective evidence that would have necessitated the impairment of loans and receivables or available-for-sale assets except the provision for impairment of receivables see note 22.
Hedging activities The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to market risk, such as movements in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and interest rates.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently re-measured at fair value.
In line with IAS 39 the Group classifies hedges as a fair value hedges used to hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability, b cash flow hedges used to hedge exposure to variability in cash flows associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction, and c hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.
In 2013 the Group applied cash flow hedge accounting for hedging floating fuel price risks in highly probable forecast purchase transactions and for hedging net investments in US dollar and Euro foreign operations.
The Group applied fair value hedge accounting for the fair value interest rate risk on 200m of the Groups fixed rate bonds and 78.5m Private Placement.

At 31 December 2013, the Group had designated 170m of synthetic debt in the form of foreign exchange derivatives: 20m of revolving credit facility drawings: and 78.5m Private Placement as net investment hedges of the net assets of its Spanish subsidiaries.
Similarly, $130m of synthetic debt in the form of foreign exchange derivatives were designated as a hedge of the net assets of the Groups US subsidiaries.
No ineffectiveness was recognised in relation to these hedges.
Fuel derivatives The Group has a number of fuel derivatives in place to hedge the different types of fuel used in each division.
Ultra low sulphur diesel is used in the UK Bus, UK Coach and Spanish Coach and Bus divisions and is hedged by swaps in the same type of fuel.
Diesel used in the North American division is hedged using the diesel market.
The timing of the swap cash flows match underlying fuel purchases from 2014 through to 2015.
There was no significant element of hedge ineffectiveness requiring recognition in the Income Statement.
During the year 2.7m of fair value gains 2012: 2.2m have been transferred to the hedging reserve due to movements in market fuel prices.
Fair value movements of 3.5m 2012: 20.2m have been transferred from the hedging reserve to the Income Statement following settlement of fuel trades, of which 5.8m was recognised in the hedging reserve at 1 January 2013 and the remainder was generated during the year due to the movement in market fuel prices.

These interest rate swaps all pay floating interest LIBOR a margin semi-annually, receive fixed interest annually with maturities matching the Groups Sterling bonds two swaps with total notional value 100m mature in January 2017, two swaps with notional value 100m mature in June 2020 and are designated as a fair value hedge of the interest rate risk on 200m of these bonds.
These swaps are measured at fair value through profit or loss, with any gains or losses being taken immediately to the Income Statement to offset any fair value gains or losses due to changes in the risk free interest rate on the swapped portion of the bonds.
As at 31 December 2013 a total fair value loss of 12.2m was recognised in the Income Statement in relation to these swaps.
This is offset by a fair value gain of 12.2m on the underlying hedged item, in this case changes in fair value on the 200m of the Groups bonds due to changes in the risk free interest rate.
In September 2012, the Group entered into two 39.25m denominated interest rate swaps equal in value to the Euro Private Placement.
These interest rate swaps all pay floating interest EURIBOR a margin semi-annually, receive fixed interest annually with maturities matching the Euro Private Placement and are designated as a fair value hedge of the interest rate risk on the Private Placement.
These swaps are measured at fair value through profit and loss, with any gains or losses being taken immediately to the Income Statement to offset any fair value gains or losses due to changes in the risk free rate on the Euro Private Placement.
As at 31 December 2013 a total fair value loss of 2.1m was recognised in the Income Statement in relation to these swaps.
This is offset by a fair value gain of 2.1m on the underlying hedged item, in this case changes in fair value of the Euro Private Placement due to changes in the risk free interest rate.

34 Pensions and other post-employment benefits a Summary of pension benefits and assumptions The UK Bus and UK Coach divisions operate both funded defined benefit schemes and a defined contribution scheme.
The majority of employees of the Rail companies are members of the appropriate shared-cost section of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS, a funded defined benefit scheme.
The assets of all schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
Contributions to the schemes are determined by independent professionally qualified actuaries.
Subsidiaries in North America contribute to a number of defined contribution plans.
The Group also provides certain additional unfunded post-employment benefits to employees in North America and Spain, which are disclosed in section c in the Other category.
The defined benefit pension schemes typically expose the Group to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary risk.
During the prior period, certain liabilities of the Travel West Midlands Pension Fund relating to current and deferred pensioners valued at 238m on an accounting basis, were insured at a cost of 272m at the transaction date.
As a result of this transaction, further assets due to the Travel West Midlands Pension Fund were identified and recovered which substantially offset these losses.
This insurance policy is a qualifying insurance policy, and therefore the value of the policy and the value of the liabilities have been recognised within actuarial losses in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
This buy-in has reduced risk and volatility, and brought greater stability to the Groups pension contribution commitments.
The UK Coach plan is now closed to all future accrual.
A funding plan aimed at bringing the plan to self-sufficiency over a six-year period was agreed in 2010: National Express contributes 4.2m annually to this scheme.
In 2011 UK Bus agreed a 5.5m annual deficit repayment plan with the trustees of the West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority Pension Fund to fund a 71m scheme funding deficit over 12 years.
The plan remains open to accrual for existing members only.
The total pension cost charged to operating profit in the year was 9.5m 2012: 6.9m, of which 3.3m 2012: 3.5m relates to the defined contribution schemes.

b Accounting for the Railways Pension Scheme The majority of employees of the Rail companies are members of the appropriate section of the RPS, a funded defined benefit scheme.
The RPS is a shared cost scheme, which means that costs are formally shared 60% employer and 40% employee.
To date, the Group has experienced 11 changes of Rail franchise ownership where the current owner has funded the scheme during the franchise term and the pension deficit at franchise exit has transferred to the new owner, without cash settlement.
By entering into the franchise contract, the TOC becomes the designated employer for the term of the contract and under the rules of the RPS must fund its share of the pension liability in accordance with the schedule of contributions agreed with the Scheme trustees and actuaries.
In determining the appropriate accounting policy for the RPS to ensure that the Groups accounts present fairly its financial position, financial performance and cash flows, management has consulted with TOC industry peers and has concluded that the Groups constructive obligations should be accounted for in accordance with IAS 19.
This accounting policy, which in all other respects is consistent with that set out in this note for the Groups other defined benefit schemes, means that the Groups accounts reflect that element of the deficits anticipated to be settled by the Group during the franchise term and will prevent gains arising on transfer of the existing RPS deficits to a new owner at franchise exit.
In calculating the Groups constructive obligations in respect of the RPS, the Group has calculated the total pension deficits in each of the RPS sections in accordance with IAS 19 and the assumptions set out above.
These deficits are reduced by a franchise adjustment which is that portion of the deficit projected to exist at the end of the franchise and which the Group will not be required to fund.
The franchise adjustment, which has been calculated by the Groups actuaries, is offset against the present value of the RPS liabilities so as to fairly present the financial performance, position and cash flows of the Groups obligations.
The franchise adjustment decreased from 18.1m at 31 December 2012 to 15.5m at 31 December 2013.
The principal reason for the decrease is the interest on the franchise adjustment of 0.7m and other net actuarial movements of 1.8m.
In the prior year, the franchise adjustment decreased from 59.6m at 31 December 2011 to 18.1m at 31 December 2012.
The principal reason for the decrease was the handback of the East Anglia franchise reducing the franchise adjustment by 49.0m.
In addition the adjustment increased due to interest on the franchise adjustment of 0.7m and other net actuarial movements of 6.8m.

The Directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRSs and taken directly to equity of 51.9m is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension schemes.
Consequently the Directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income before 1 January 2004. www.
