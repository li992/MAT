Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2013 continued The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the principal assumptions is: Impact on present value of scheme obligations m 0.1% increase in discount rates 4.0 0.1% increase in inflation rate 1.7 0.1% increase in salary increase rate 0.8 1 year increase in life expectancy 5.1 The above sensitivity analysis is based on a change in an assumption holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
Plan assets are comprised as follows: 2013 2012 Quoted Quoted m % m % Equity instruments 74.1 42% 61.8 41% Diversified growth funds 51.2 29% 42.4 28% Bonds 49.6 28% 46.9 31% Cash and cash equivalents 1.4 1% 0.6 Total 176.3 100% 151.7 100% No plan assets are the Groups own financial instruments or property occupied or used by the Group.
Through the defined benefit plan, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: Asset volatility The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if plan assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
The Plan holds a significant proportion of equities and diversified growth funds, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term while providing volatility and risk in the short-term.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Plans bond holdings.
Inflation risk Higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The majority of the Plans assets are either unaffected by or are loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy The majority of the Plans obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the Plans liabilities.
Expected contributions to post-employment benefit plans for the year ending 31 December 2014 are 10.0m.
The Company expects to contribute 0.6m.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 23 years.
