Rotork plc Annual Report 2013 110 Notes to the Group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2013 26. financial instruments Financial risk and treasury policies The Treasury department maintains liquidity, identifies and manages foreign exchange risk, manages relations with the Groups bankers and provides a treasury service to the Groups businesses.
Treasury dealings such as investments, borrowings and foreign exchange are conducted only to support underlying business transactions.
The Group has clearly defined policies for the management of credit, foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
The Group Treasury department is not a profit centre and, therefore, does not undertake speculative foreign exchange dealings for which there is no underlying exposure.
Exposures resulting from sales and purchases in foreign currency are matched where possible and the net exposure may be hedged.
a Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and cash on deposit with financial institutions.
Management has a credit policy in place and exposure to credit risk is both monitored on an ongoing basis and reduced through the use of credit insurance covering 80% to 90% of trade receivables at any time.
Credit evaluations are carried out on all customers requiring credit above a certain threshold, with varying approval levels set around this depending on the value of the sale.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Goods are sold subject to retention of title clauses, so that in the event of nonpayment the Group may have a secured claim.
The Group maintains an allowance for impairment in respect of noninsured receivables where recoverability is considered doubtful.
The Group Treasury Committee meets regularly and reviews the credit risk associated with institutions that hold a material cash balance.
As well as credit ratings, counterparties and instruments are assessed for credit default swap pricing and liquidity of funds.
Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: Carrying amount 2013 2012 Trade receivables 105,976 95,822 Other receivables 13,684 11,336 Cash and cash equivalents 68,873 59,868 Foreign exchange contracts 3,737 2,254 192,270 169,280 The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by currency was: Carrying amount 2013 2012 Sterling 13,166 9,273 US dollar 30,128 29,486 Euro 42,244 37,102 Indian rupee 3,528 3,744 Other 16,910 16,217 105,976 95,822 Strategic Report 01-41 111 Directors 42-45 Governance 46-71 Financial Statements 72-123 Company Information 124-126 26. financial instruments continued Provisions against trade receivables The aging of trade receivables and the associated provision for impairment at the reporting date was: Gross Provision Gross Provision 2013 2013 2012 2012 Not past due 73,493 225 63,581 102 Past due 030 days 15,873 56 17,716 16 Past due 3160 days 9,117 68 7,030 50 Past due 6190 days 3,107 143 3,244 123 Past due more than 91 days 6,211 1,333 6,064 1,522 107,801 1,825 97,635 1,813 b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group is highly cash generative, and uses monthly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements and to optimise its return on investments.
Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on hand to meet foreseeable operational expenses: it also maintains a 7m overdraft facility 2012: 7m on which interest would be payable at base rate plus 1.5%.
In January 2014 the Group extended its 15m committed loan facility until January 2015.
Interest is payable on this committed facility at LIBOR plus 1%.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments and excluding the impact of netting agreements: Analysis of contractual cash flow maturities Carrying Contractual Less than More than 31 December 2013 amount cash flows 12 months 12 years 25 years 5 years Bank loans and overdrafts 2,109 2,391 539 308 533 1,011 Finance lease liabilities 61 66 33 22 11 Trade and other payables 69,021 69,021 69,021 Foreign exchange contracts 32 32 32 Non-redeemable preference shares 40 40 40 71,263 71,550 69,625 330 544 1,051 Analysis of contractual cash flow maturities Carrying Contractual Less than More than 31 December 2012 amount cash flows 12 months 12 years 25 years 5 years Bank loans and overdrafts 92 92 30 30 32 Finance lease liabilities 40 42 28 11 3 Trade and other payables 68,244 68,244 68,244 Forward exchange contracts 96 96 96 Non-redeemable preference shares 40 40 40 68,512 68,514 68,398 41 35 40 Where a counterparty experiences credit stress then the foreign exchange contracts may be settled on a net basis but standard practice is to settle on a gross basis and the undiscounted gross outflow in respect of these contracts is 166,745,000 2012: 134,353,000 and the gross inflow is 170,588,000 2012: 136,625,000.
Rotork plc Annual Report 2013 112 Notes to the Group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2013 26. financial instruments continued c Market risk Market risk arises from changes in market prices, such as currency rates and interest rates, and may affect the Groups results.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk within suitable parameters.
i Currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the business units functional currency.
The currencies primarily giving rise to this risk are the US dollar and related currencies and the euro.
The Group hedges up to 75% of forecast US dollar or euro foreign currency exposures using forward exchange contracts.
In respect of other non-sterling monetary assets and liabilities the exposures may also be hedged up to 75% where this is deemed appropriate.
As part of the Groups cash management some of the overseas subsidiaries have loan and deposit balances where their intra-group counterparty is in the UK.
The balances are typically in local currency for the subsidiary so the UK holds a foreign currency current asset or liability which is usually hedged through the use of foreign exchange swaps.
At the balance sheet date only the forward part of the swap remains and this is designated as a cash flow hedge to match the currency exposure of the intercompany loan asset.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts that hedge both the forecast sale and purchase transactions and the intercompany loan and deposit balances as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The net fair value of foreign exchange contracts used as hedges at 31 December 2013 was a 3,705,000 asset 2012: 2,158,000 asset comprising an asset of 3,737,000 2012: 2,254,000 and a liability of 32,000 2012: 96,000.
Forward exchange contracts in place at 31 December 2013 mature in 2014 and 2015.
Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, and for which no hedge accounting is applied, are recognised in the income statement.
Sensitivity analysis It is estimated that, with all other variables held equal in particular other exchange rates, a general change of one cent in the value of euro against sterling would have had an impact on the Groups operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2013 of 325,000 2012: 350,000 and a change of one cent in the value of US dollar against sterling would have had an impact of the Groups operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2013 of 450,000 2012: 350,000.
The method of estimation, which has been applied consistently, involves assessing the transaction impact of US dollar and euro cash flows and the translation impact of US dollar and euro profits The following significant exchange rates applied during the year: Average rate Closing rate 2013 2012 2013 2012 US dollar 1.56 1.59 1.66 1.62 Euro 1.18 1.23 1.20 1.23 ii Interest rate risk The Group does not undertake any hedging activity in this area.
All cash deposits are made at prevailing interest rates and the majority is available with same day notice, though deposits are sometimes made with a maturity of no more than three months.
The main element of interest rate risk concerns sterling, US dollar, euro and renminbi deposits, all of which are on a floating rate basis.
The interest rate profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December was as follows: 2013 2012 Fixed rate financial liabilities 1,010 150 Floating rate financial liabilities 1,200 22 2,210 172 The fixed and floating rate financial liabilities comprise finance leases, preference shares and bank loans.
The floating rate lease obligations bear interest at rates determined by reference to the relevant LIBOR or equivalent rate.
The weighted average interest rate of the fixed rate financial liabilities is 1.6% or 2.0% excluding the zero rate debt 2012: 1.1% or 6.3%.
The weighted average period for which non zero interest rates on the fixed rate financial liabilities are fixed is 3.4 years.

The group has an asset-light business model and uses cash generated from operations to either invest organically or by acquisition.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic and market conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Group defines capital as net funds and equity attributable to shareholders see note 17.
There are no externally imposed restrictions on the Groups capital structure.
The Group monitors capital using the following indicators: i Group net funds 2013 2012 Total borrowings 2,210 172 Cash and cash equivalents note 16 68,873 59,868 Group net funds 66,663 59,696 ii Return on capital employed 2013 2012 Adjusted operating profit Operating profit 139,265 124,467 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 12,147 7,399 151,412 131,866 Capital employed Shareholders funds 332,079 269,323 Cash and cash equivalents note 16 68,873 59,868 Interest bearing loans and borrowings 2,210 172 Net cash 66,663 59,696 Pension deficit net of deferred tax 15,552 21,811 280,968 231,438 Average capital employed 256,203 213,090 Return on capital employed 59.1% 61.9% Rotork plc Annual Report 2013 114 Notes to the Group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2013 26. financial instruments continued e Fair values The fair values of financial assets and liabilities, together with the carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet, were as follows: Carrying Carrying Amount Fair Value Amount Fair Value 2013 2013 2012 2012 Loans and receivables Trade receivables 105,976 105,976 95,822 95,822 Other receivables 13,684 13,684 11,336 11,336 Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 68,873 68,873 59,868 59,868 Designated cash flow hedges Foreign exchange contracts: Financial assets 3,737 3,737 2,254 2,254 Financial liabilities 32 32 96 96 Financial liabilities at amortised cost Bank overdraft and borrowings 2,109 2,109 92 92 Trade and other payables 69,021 69,021 68,244 68,244 Contingent consideration 2,809 2,809 1,122 1,122 Preference shares 40 40 40 40 Finance lease liabilities 61 61 40 40 118,198 118,198 99,646 99,646 Fair value Hierarchy The fair value of the Groups outstanding derivative financial assets and liabilities consisted of foreign exchange contracts and swaps and were estimated using year end spot rates adjusted for the forward points to the appropriate value dates, and gains and losses are taken to equity estimated using market foreign exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
All derivative financial instruments are categorised at Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The other financial instruments are classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy and are valued as follows: i Trade and other receivables payables As the majority of receivables payables have a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
ii Contingent consideration As all the contingent consideration is contractually due for payment within 18 months, the carrying amount is equal to the fair value.
