The goodwill arising on the acquisitions of Human Genome Sciences, ID Biomedical, Sirtris Pharmaceuticals and Domantis has been split between the US, Europe, EMAP, Japan and Other Pharmaceutical and Vaccines cash generating units for impairment testing purposes as either the benefit of the acquired businesses is split between these cash generating units or the acquired businesses do not generate independent cash flows.
The total of goodwill allocated to US Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines amounted to 2,013 million 2012 1,878 million.
The amounts allocated to the other cash generating units were not significant relative to the total balance.
GSK Annual Report 2013 157 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 18 Goodwill continued The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are assessed using either a fair value less costs of disposal model or a value in use model.
Value in use is calculated as the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted post-tax cash flows plus a terminal value of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill is allocated.
Initially a post-tax discount rate is applied to calculate the net present value of the post-tax cash flows.
The discount rate used is based on the Group WACC of 7%, as most cash generating units have integrated operations across large parts of the Group.
The discount rate is adjusted where appropriate for specific country or currency risks.
Fair value less costs of disposal is calculated using a similar discounted cash flow approach.
A post-tax discount rate is applied to the projected risk-adjusted post-tax cash flows and terminal value.
The valuation methodology uses significant inputs which are not based on observable market data, therefore, this valuation technique is classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
Details relating to the discounted cash flow models used in the impairment tests of the Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare cash generating units are as follows: Valuation basis Higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use Key assumptions Sales growth rates Profit margins Terminal growth rate Discount rate Taxation rate Determination of assumptions Growth rates are internal forecasts based on both internal and external market information.
Margins reflect past experience, adjusted for expected changes.
Terminal growth rates based on managements estimate of future long-term average growth rates.
Discount rates based on Group WACC, adjusted where appropriate.
Taxation rates based on appropriate rates for each region Period of specific projected cash flows 5 years Terminal growth rate and discount rate Terminal growth rate Discount rate US Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines 1% p. a.
7% Europe Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines 1% p. a.
8% EMAP Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines 1.5% p. a.
10% Japan Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines 0.5% p. a.
10% Other Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines 1% p. a.
7% The terminal growth rates do not exceed the long-term projected growth rates for the relevant markets.
The terminal growth rates used in the fair value less costs of disposal calculations for the cash generating units reflect the impact of future generic competition and take account of new product launches.
The Pharmaceutical and Vaccines cash generating units comprise a collection of smaller cash generating units including assets with indefinite lives with a carrying value of 599 million 2012 609 million.
The Consumer Healthcare cash generating unit also comprises a collection of smaller cash generating units including brands with indefinite lives with a carrying value of 1.52 billion 2012 1.52 billion.
Details of indefinite life brands are given in Note 19 Other intangible assets.
In each case the valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of the related goodwill.
