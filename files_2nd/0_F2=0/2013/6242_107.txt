Silverstream contract On 31 December 2007, the Group entered into an agreement with Peoles through which it is entitled to receive the proceeds received by the Peoles Group in respect of the refined silver sold from the Sabinas Mine Sabinas, a base metals mine owned and operated by the Peoles Group, for an upfront payment of US$350 million.
In addition, a per ounce cash payment of $2.00 in years one to five and $5.00 thereafter subject to an inflationary adjustment commencing on 31 December 2013 is payable to Peoles.
Under the contract, the Group has the option to receive a net cash settlement from Peoles attributable to the silver produced and sold from Sabinas, to take delivery of an equivalent amount of refined silver or to receive settlement in the form of both cash and silver.
If, by 31 December 2032, the amount of silver produced by Sabinas is less than 60 million ounces, a further payment is due from Peoles of US$1 per ounce of shortfall.
The Silverstream contract represents a derivative financial instrument which has been recorded at fair value and classified within non-current and current assets as appropriate.
Changes in the contracts fair value, other than those represented by the realisation of the asset through the receipt of either cash or refined silver, are charged or credited to the income statement.
In the year ended 31 December 2013 total proceeds received in cash were US$63.8 million 2012: US$110.6 million of which, US$11.0 million was in respect of proceeds receivable as at 31 December 2012 2012: US$13.6 million.
Cash received in respect of the year of US$52.8 million 2012: US$97.0 million corresponds to 3.5 million ounces of payable silver 2012: 3.8 million ounces.
As at 31 December 2013, a further US$8.1 million 2012: US$11 million of cash corresponding to 560,465 ounces of silver is due 2012: 378,345 ounces.
The most significant drivers of the US$54.0 million unrealised loss taken to income statement 2012: US$117.7 million gain were the updating of assumptions utilised to value the Silverstream contract, most significantly the forward price of silver which was lower than expected given the cyclical nature of prices, the increase of the reference discount rate LIBOR and the difference between payments already received in 2013 and payments estimated in the valuation model as at 31 December 2012.
These were partially offset by an increase in the Sabinas mine reserves and resources.
