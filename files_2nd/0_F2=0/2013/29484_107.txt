FINANCIAL RISK Risk management objectives and risk policies The Group seeks to manage risk through the operation of unit linked business whereby the policyholder bears the financial risk.
In addition, shareholder assets are invested in highly rated investments.
Under IFRS 7, the Group is required to analyse their exposure to the following risks: Credit risk Liquidity risk Market risk Currency risk Credit risk is the risk of loss due to a debtors non-payment of a loan or other line of credit.
Credit risk also arises from holdings of cash and cash equivalents, deposits and formal loans with banks and financial institutions.
The Group has adopted a risk averse approach to such risk and has a stated policy of not actively pursuing or accepting credit risk except when necessary to support other objectives.
Risk Description Management Shareholders assets Loss of assets Shareholder funds are predominantly invested in AAA rated unitised money market funds and deposits with approved banks.
Maximum counterparty limits are set for each company within the Group and aggregate limits are also set at a Group level.
Investment matching of Loss of value of assets These liabilities are matched by fixed interest securities with minimum non-linked liabilities AAA credit ratings or UK Government Gilts: maximum counterparty limits for such holdings are again set for each company within the Group and at an aggregate Group level.
Reinsurance Failure of counterparty or Credit ratings of potential reinsurers must meet or exceed counterparty unable to meet minimum specified levels.
Consideration is also given to size, liabilities risk concentrations exposures and ownership in the selection of reinsurers.
The Group also seeks to diversify its reinsurance credit risk through the use of a spread of reinsurers.
Partner loans and advances Inability of Partners to repay loans Loans and advances are managed in line with the Groups secured or advances from SJP lending policy.
Loans are secured on the future renewals income stream expected from a Partners portfolio and loan advances vary in relation to the projected future income of the relevant Partner.
Outstanding balances are regularly reviewed and assessed on a conservative basis.
Support is provided to help Partners manage their business appropriately.
Appropriate provision is made where there is objective evidence of impairment.

FINANCIAL RISK continued liquidity risk is the risk that the Group, although solvent, either does not have available sufficient financial resources to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can secure such resources only at excessive cost.
The Group is averse to liquidity risk and seeks to minimise this risk by not actively pursuing it except where necessary to support other objectives.

market risk is the impact a fall in the value of equity or other asset markets may have on the business.
The Group adopts a risk averse approach to market risk, with a stated solvency policy of not actively pursuing or accepting market risk except where necessary to support other objectives.
However, the Group accepts the risk that the fall in equity or other asset markets will reduce the level of annual management charge income derived from policyholder assets and the risk of lower future profits.
The table below summarises the main market risks that the business is exposed to and the methods by which the Group seeks to mitigate them.

1 All financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are designated as such upon initial recognition.
2 Other financial assets exclude prepayments and unearned commission from other receivables.
The carrying value of the unit linked investment contract liabilities may differ from the amount contractually required to pay at maturity.
Maturity values of the financial liabilities vary with future policyholder investment and withdrawals as well as investment return, coupled with the impact of capital losses in the funds.
The contractual value required to be paid to policyholders as at 31December 2013 would be 38.9 million lower than the investment contract benefits stated above.

FINANCIAL RISK continued fair value estimation Financial assets and liabilities, which are held at fair value in the financial statements, are required to have disclosed their fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1.
Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices Level 2.
Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs Level 3.

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted bid prices at the reporting date, as described in the accounting policy m. These instruments are included in Level 1.
Instruments included in Level 1 comprise primarily listed equityinstruments.
03183415 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information St. Jamess Place plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 141 The Group closely monitors the valuation of assets in markets that have become less liquid.
Determining whether a market is active requires the exercise of judgement and is determined based upon the facts and circumstances of the market for the instrument being measured.
Where it is determined that there is no active market, fair value is established using a valuation technique.
The techniques applied incorporate relevant information available and reflect appropriate adjustments for credit and liquidity risks.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
The relative weightings given to differing sources of information and the determination of non-observable inputs to valuation models can require the exercise of significant judgement.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.
Note that all of the resulting fair value estimates are included in Level 2, except for certain equities and investments in Collective Investment Schemes CIS and investment properties as detailed below.
Specific valuation techniques used to value Level 2 financial assets and liabilities include: The use of observable prices for identical current arms length transactions.
Specific valuation techniques used to value Level 3 financial assets and liabilities include: The use of observable prices for recent arms length transactions.
Other techniques, such as discounted cash flow and historic lapse rates, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financialinstruments.
There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year.
transfers into and out of level 3 portfolios Transfers out of level 3 portfolios arise when inputs that could have a significant impact on the instruments valuation become market observable: conversely, transfers into the portfolios arise when consistent sources of data cease to be available.
Transfers in of certain equities and investments in Collective Investment Schemes CIS occur when asset valuations can no longer be obtained from an observable market price i. e. become illiquid, in liquidation, suspended etc.
The converse is true if an observable market price becomes available.
During 2013 IFRS 13 was adopted resulting in investment properties now being included within the Level 3 portfolio.
As this IFRS is to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the annual period in which it is initially applied the investment property opening balance has been presented within transfers into Level 3.
The following table presents the changes in Level 3 financial assets at fair value through the profit and loss: 2013 2012 million Million Opening balance 1.6 0.9 Transfer into Level 3 597.8 0.7 Additions during the year 213.8 Disposed during the year 67.7 Gains recognised in the income statement 5.1 Closing balance 750.6 1.6 Total gains for the year included in the statement of comprehensive income for assets held at the end of the reporting period 4.8 0.3 Additions include 194.1 million of investment properties and 19.7 million of renewal income.
Gains recognised in the statement of comprehensive income are included within investment return for certain equities and investments in Collective Investment Schemes and investment property, and within administration expenses for the renewal income.
142 St. Jamess Place plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Notes to the Consolidated Accounts under International Financial Reporting Standards continued 28.
FINANCIAL RISK continued sensitivity of level 3 valuations The valuation of certain equities and investments in Collective Investment Schemes CIS are based on the latest observable price available.
Whilst such valuations are sensitive to estimates, it is believed that changing the price applied to a reasonably possible alternative would not change the fair value significantly.
The valuation of renewal income is based on discounted cash flows and historic lapse rates.
The effect of applying reasonably possible alternative assumptions of a movement of 100bps on the discount rate and a 10% movement in the lapse rate would result in an unfavourable change in valuation of 1.6 million and a favourable change in valuation of 1.9 million, respectively.
The investment property valuation has been prepared using the market approach valuation technique using prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable i. e. similar assets, as such it is again believed that changing the price applied to a reasonably possible alternative would not change the fair value significantly.
Moreover, any change in the value of investment property is matched by the associated movement in the policyholder liability and therefore would not impact on the shareholder net assets.

Financial liabilities included under unit linked funds and attributable to unit holders are deemed to have a maturity up to one year as they are repayable or transferable ondemand.
sensitivity analysis to market risks The majority of the Groups business is unit linked and the direct associated market risk is therefore borne by policyholders although there is a secondary impact as shareholder income is dependent upon the markets.
Financial assets and liabilities held outside unitised funds primarily consist of fixed interest securities, units in money market funds, cash and cash equivalents, and other assets and liabilities.
The fixed interest securities are held to match non linked liabilities and the liability values move broadly in line with the matching asset values such that fair value interest rate risk is immaterial, although these is some residual risk due to imperfect matching.
Cash held in unitised money market funds and at bank is valued at par and is unaffected by movement in interest rates.
Other assets and liabilities are similarly unaffected by market movements.
As a result of these combined factors, the Groups financial assets and liabilities held outside unitised funds are not materially subject to market risk, and movements at the reporting date in interest rates and equity values have an immaterial impact on the Groups profit after tax and equity.
Future profits from annual management charges may be affected by movements in interest rates and equity values.
