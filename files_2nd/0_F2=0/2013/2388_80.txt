Financial risk factors The group is exposed to a number of different financial risks arising from natural business exposures as well as its use of financial instruments including: market risks relating to commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices: credit risk: and liquidity risk.
166 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2013 Financial statements 19.
Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued The group financial risk committee GFRC advises the group chief financial officer CFO who oversees the management of these risks.
The GFRC is chaired by the CFO and consists of a group of senior managers including the group treasurer and the heads of the group finance, tax and the integrated supply and trading functions.
The purpose of the committee is to advise on financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the group.
The committee provides assurance to the CFO and the group chief executive GCE, and via the GCE to the board, that the groups financial risk-taking activity is governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordancewith group policies and group risk appetite.
The groups trading activities in the oil, natural gas and power markets are managed within the integrated supply and trading function, while the activities in the financial markets are managed by the treasury function, working under the compliance and control structure of the integrated supply and trading function.
All derivative activity is carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision.
Theseteams are subject to close financial and management control.
The integrated supply and trading function maintains formal governance processes that provide oversight of market risk associated with trading activity.
A policy and risk committee monitors and validates limits and risk exposures, reviews incidents and validates risk-related policies, methodologiesand procedures.
A commitments committee approves value-at-risk delegations, the trading of new products, instruments and strategies and material commitments.
In addition, the integrated supply and trading function undertakes derivative activity for risk management purposes under a separate control framework as described more fully below.
a Market risk Market risk is the risk or uncertainty arising from possible market price movements and their impact on the future performance of a business.
The primary commodity price risks that the group is exposed to include oil, natural gas and power prices that could adversely affect the value of the groups financial assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows.
The group enters into derivatives in a well-established entrepreneurial trading operation.
In addition, the group has developed a control framework aimed at managing the volatility inherent in certain of its natural business exposures.
In accordance with the control framework the group enters into various transactions using derivatives for risk management purposes.
The major components of market risk are commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk, each of which is discussed below.
i Commodity price risk The groups integrated supply and trading function uses conventional financial and commodity instruments and physical cargoes available in the related commodity markets.
Oil and natural gas swaps, options and futures are used to mitigate price risk.
Power trading is undertaken using a combination of over-the-counter forward contracts and other derivative contracts, including options and futures.
This activity is on both a standalone basis and in conjunction with gas derivatives in relation to gas-generated power margin.
In addition, NGLs are traded around certain US inventory locations using over-the-counter forward contracts in conjunction with over-the-counter swaps, options and physical inventories.
The group measures market risk exposure arising from its trading positions using value-at-risk techniques.
These techniques make a statistical assessment of the market risk arising from possible future changes in market prices over a one-day holding period.
The value-at-risk measure is supplemented by stress testing.
Value-at-risk limits are in place for each trading activity and for the groups trading activity in total.
The board has delegated a limit of $100 million value at risk in support of this trading activity.
In addition, the group has embedded derivatives relating to certain natural gas contracts.
The net fair value of these contracts was a liability of $652 million at 31 December 2013 2012 liability of $1,112 million.
For these embedded derivatives the sensitivity of the net fair value to an immediate 10% favourable or adverse change in each key assumption is less than $100 million in each case.
ii Foreign currency exchange risk Where the group enters into foreign currency exchange contracts for entrepreneurial trading purposes the activity is controlled using trading value-atrisk techniques as explained above.
Since BP has global operations, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on the groups reported results.
The effects of most exchange rate fluctuations are absorbed in business operating results through changing cost competitiveness, lags in market adjustment to movements in rates and translation differences accounted for on specific transactions.
For this reason, the total effect of exchange rate fluctuations is not identifiable separately in the groups reported results.
The main underlying economic currency of the groups cash flows is the US dollar.
This is because BPs major product, oil, is priced internationally in US dollars.
BPs foreign currency exchange management policy is to limit economic and material transactional exposures arising from currency movements against the US dollar.
The group co-ordinates the handling of foreign currency exchange risks centrally, by netting off naturally-occurring opposite exposures wherever possible, and then managing any material residual foreign currency exchange risks.
The group manages these exposures by constantly reviewing the foreign currency economic value at risk and aims to manage such risk to keep the 12-month foreign currency value at risk below $400 million.
At no point over the past three years did the value at risk exceed the maximum risk limit.
The most significant exposures relate to capital expenditure commitments and other UK and European operational requirements, for which a hedging programme is in place and hedge accounting is claimed as outlined in Note 26.
For highly probable forecast capital expenditures the group locks in the US dollar cost of non-US dollar supplies by using currency forwards and futures.
The main exposures are sterling, euro, Norwegian krone, Australian dollar and Korean won.
At 31 December 2013 the most significant open contracts in place were for $723 million sterling 2012 $853 million sterling.
For other UK, European and Australian operational requirements the group uses cylinders purchased call and sold put options and currency forwards to manage the estimated exposures on a 12-month rolling basis.
At 31 December 2013, the open positions relating to cylinders consisted of receive sterling, pay US dollar cylinders for $2,770 million 2012 $2,886 million : receive euro, pay US dollar cylinders for $962 million 2012 $1,636 million : receive Australian dollar, pay US dollar cylinders for $401 million 2012 $522 million.
In addition, most of the groups borrowings are in US dollars or are hedged with respect to the US dollar.
At 31 December 2013, the total foreign currency net borrowings not swapped into US dollars amounted to $665 million 2012 $364 million.
iii Interest rate risk Where the group enters into money market contracts for entrepreneurial trading purposes the activity is controlled using value-at-risk techniques as described above.
Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued BP is also exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of its financial instruments, principally finance debt.
While the group issues debt in a variety of currencies based on market opportunities, it uses derivatives to swap the debt to a floating rate exposure, mainly to US dollar floating, but in certain defined circumstances maintains a US dollar fixed rate exposure for a proportion of debt.
The proportion of floating rate debt net of interest rate swaps at 31 December 2013 was 65% of total finance debt outstanding 2012 65%.
The weighted average interest rate on finance debt at 31 December 2013 was 2% 2012 2% and the weighted average maturity of fixed rate debt was four years 2012 four years.
The groups earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on the floating rate element of the groups finance debt.
If the interest rates applicable to floating rate instruments were to have increased by one percentage point on 1 January 2014, it is estimated that the groups finance costs for 2014 would increase by approximately $312 million 2012 $311 million increase in 2013. iv Equity price risk The group holds equity investments, typically for strategic purposes, that are classified as non-current available-for-sale financial assets and are measured initially at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income.
At 31 December 2013 the group had no significant exposure to the price of quoted equity instruments.
At 31 December 2012, an increase or decrease of 10% in quoted equity prices would have resulted in an immediate credit or charge to other comprehensive income of $1,502 million.
At 31 December 2012, 82% of the carrying amount of non-current available-for-sale equity financial assets represented the groups 1.25% stake in Rosneft, thus the groups exposure was concentrated on changes in the share price of this equity in particular.
The sensitivity analysis at 31 December 2012 includes the impact of a change in the share price on the valuation of the contracts to acquire Rosneft shares accounted for as cash flow hedge derivatives.
b Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to perform or fail to pay amounts due causing financial loss tothe group and arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with financial institutions and principally from credit exposures to customers relating to outstanding receivables.
Credit exposure also exists in relation to guarantees issued by group companies under which amounts outstanding at 31 December 2013 were $199 million 2012 $237 million in respect of liabilities of joint ventures and associates and $305 million 2012 $717 million in respect of liabilities of other third parties.
The group has a credit policy, approved by the CFO, that is designed to ensure that consistent processes are in place throughout the group to measure and control credit risk.
Credit risk is considered as part of the risk-reward balance of doing business.
On entering into any business contract the extent to which the arrangement exposes the group to credit risk is considered.
Key requirements of the policy include segregation of credit approval authorities from any sales, marketing or trading teams authorized to incur credit risk: the establishment of credit systems and processes to ensure that all counterparty exposure is rated and that all counterparty exposure and limits can be monitored and reported: and the timely identification and reporting of any non-approved credit exposures and credit losses.
While each segment of the group is typically responsible for its own credit risk management and reporting consistent with group policy, the treasury function holds group-wide credit risk authority and oversight responsibility for exposure to banks and financial institutions.
The maximum credit exposure associated with financial assets is equal to the carrying amount.
The group does not aim to remove credit risk entirely but expects to experience a certain level of credit losses.
As at 31 December 2013, the group had in place credit enhancements designed to mitigate approximately $13 billion of credit risk 2012 $12 billion.
Reports are regularly prepared and presented to the GFRC that cover the groups overall credit exposure and expected loss trends, exposure by segment, and overall quality of the portfolio.
For the contracts comprising derivative financial instruments in an asset position at 31 December 2013 it is estimated that over 80% 2012 over 70%, excluding the contracts with Rosneft accounted for as derivatives of the unmitigated credit exposure is to counterparties of investment grade credit quality.
For cash and cash equivalents, the treasury function dynamically manages bank deposit limits to ensure cash is well-diversified and to reduce concentration risks.
At 31 December 2013, 92% of the cash and cash equivalents balance was deposited with financial institutions rated at least Aby Standard & Poors and Fitch, and A3 by Moodys.
Of the total cash and cash equivalents held at year end, collateral of $5,450 million was held by third-party custodians in tri-partite repurchase agreements, which would only be released to BP in the event of repayment default by the borrower.
Trade and other receivables of the group are analysed in the table below.
By comparing the BP credit ratings to the equivalent external credit ratings, it is estimated that approximately 70-80% 2012 approximately 70-80% of the unmitigated trade receivables portfolio exposure is of investment grade credit quality.
Current assets, including trade and other receivables, in Egypt amount to $2.3 billion see page 241, of which over one third relates to trade receivables which are not impaired but are past the original due date.
Management is working with the counterparties to continue to collect these amounts.
$ million Trade and other receivables at 31 December 2013 2012 Neither impaired nor past due 37,201 33,053 Impaired net of provision 27 80 Not impaired and past due in the following periods within 30 days 1,054 1,337 31 to 60 days 249 286 61 to 90 days 216 225 over 90 days 883 981 39,630 35,962 Movements in the impairment provision for trade receivables are shown in Note 24.
Financial instruments subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements The following table shows the gross amounts of recognized financial assets and liabilities i. e. before offsetting and the amounts offset in the balance sheet.
Financial assets and liabilities are only offset when the group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and the group intends to either settle on a net basis or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
A right of set off is the groups legal right to settle an amount payable to a creditor by applying against it an amount receivable from the same counterparty.
The relevant legal jurisdiction and laws applicable to the relationships between the parties need to be considered when assessing whether a current legally enforceable right to set off exists.

Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued Furthermore, amounts which cannot be offset under IFRS, but which could be settled net under the terms of master netting agreements if certain conditions arise, and collateral received or pledged, are also shown in the table to show the total net exposure of the group.

The groups liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and currency requirements to the central treasury function.
Unless restricted by local regulations, subsidiaries pool their cash surpluses to treasury, which will then arrange to fund other subsidiaries requirements, or invest any net surplus in the market or arrange for necessary external borrowings, while managing the groups overall net currency positions.
The group has in place a European Debt Issuance Programme DIP under which the group may raise up to $30 billion of debt for maturities of one month or longer.
At 31 December 2013, the amount drawn down against the DIP was $13,854 million 2012 $14,043 million.
Since 5 February 2013, the group has had a US shelf registration with a limit of $30 billion.
This was converted from an unlimited shelf registration following the approval in December 2012 of the settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission in respect of Gulf of Mexico oil spill related claims.
Amounts drawn down since conversion total $6.9 billion.
In addition, the group has an Australian Note Issuance Programme of A$5 billion, and as at 31 December 2013 the amount drawn down was A$800 million 2012 A$500 million.
The groups long-term credit ratings are A positive outlook from Standard & Poors, and A2 stable outlook from Moodys Investor Services, both remaining unchanged during 2013.
During 2013, $8.6 billion of long-term taxable bonds were issued with terms ranging from 18 months to 10 years.
Commercial paper is issued at competitive rates to meet short-term borrowing requirements as and when needed.
As a further liquidity measure, the group continues to maintain suitable levels of cash and cash equivalents, amounting to $22.5 billion at 31 December 2013, primarily invested with highly rated banks or money market funds and readily accessible at immediate and short notice 2012 $19.6 billion.
At 31 December 2013, the group had substantial amounts of undrawn borrowing facilities available, consisting of $7,375 million of standby facilities, of which $6,975 million is available to draw and repay until the first half of 2018, and $400 million is available to draw and repay until April 2016.
These facilities were renegotiated during 2013 with 26 international banks, and borrowings under them would be at pre-agreed rates.
The group also has committed letter of credit LC facilities totalling $7,475 million with a number of banks, allowing LCs to be issued for a maximum one-year duration.
There were also uncommitted secured LC facilities in place at 31 December 2013 for $2,410 million, which are secured against inventories or receivables when utilized.
The facilities only terminate by either party giving a stipulated termination notice to the other.
The amounts shown for finance debt in the table below include future minimum lease payments with respect to finance leases.
The table also shows the timing of cash outflows relating to trade and other payables and accruals.
The group manages liquidity risk associated with derivative contracts, other than derivative hedging instruments, based on the expected maturitiesof both derivative assets and liabilities as indicated in Note 26.
Management does not currently anticipate any cash flows that could be of a significantly different amount, or could occur earlier than the expected maturity analysis provided.
The table below shows cash outflows for derivative hedging instruments based upon contractual payment dates.
The amounts reflect the maturity profile of the fair value liability where the instruments will be settled net, and the gross settlement amount where the pay leg of a derivative will be settled separately from the receive leg, as in the case of cross-currency swaps hedging non-US dollar finance debt.
The swaps are with high investment-grade counterparties and therefore the settlement-day risk exposure is considered to be negligible.
Not shown in the table are the gross BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2013 169
