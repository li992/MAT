Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting year.
ShareRetirement Other Total based Capital benefit temporary Restated million paymentsAllowances Losses obligations differences Note 1 At 1 January 2012 289.8 52.7 0.3 342.8 Credit charge to income 2.4 8.1 41.8 10.0 2.1 39.2 Credit to equity 2.5 13.5 16.0 At 31 December 2012 4.9 8.1 248.0 56.2 2.4 319.6 Credit charge to income 0.3 2.3 52.3 9.5 2.6 66.4 Credit charge to equity 3.7 10.3 6.6 At 31 December 2013 8.9 5.8 195.7 36.4 0.2 246.6 Closing deferred tax on UK temporary differences has been calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply for the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.
Accordingly, the majority of the temporary differences have been calculated at the rate of 20% 2012: 23%, the rate effective from 1 April 2015 but substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
The effect of the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 23% to 20% is a reduction in the net deferred tax asset at the end of 2013 of 28.3 million.
Of this 28.3 million, 6.5 million has been charged directly to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The net deferred tax balance is analysed into assets and liabilities as follows: million 2013 2012 Deferred tax assets 247.6 319.6 Deferred tax liabilities 1.0 246.6 319.6 The Group has not recognised temporary differences relating to tax losses carried forward and other temporary differences amounting to 17.4 million 2012: 148.3 million in the UK and 103.9 million 2012: 93.8 million in Spain.
The UK losses have not been recognised as they are predominantly non-trading in nature and sufficient uncertainty exists as to their utilisation.
The losses in Spain have not been recognised due to uncertainty of sufficient taxable profits existing against which to utilise the losses.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused UK capital losses of 255.3 million 2012: 252.8 million, all of which are agreed as available for offset against future capital profits.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining capital losses at 31 December 2013 because the Group does not believe that it is probable that these capital losses will be utilised in the foreseeable future.

In 2013 the Group has seen a sustained improvement in the UK housing market and the wider UK economy, with increased mortgage availability, lower interest rates and enhanced customer confidence.
This is partly as a result of the recently announced Help to Buy Government scheme.
The Group completed net realisable value assessments of inventory in June and December.
Given the continued improving market conditions supporting increased profitability on a number of our previously impaired sites in the UK, a net reversal of 62.3 million of impairment write-downs has been recorded in 2013.

Inventories continued The net reversal in the UK consists of a reversal of previous write-downs of 107.1 million and additional write-downs to the lower of cost and net realisable value of 44.8 million on previously impaired sites.
At the 2012 year end the Group identified 16.0 million of reversals of write-downs and 5.1 million of additional write-down of inventory, however due to the immaterial nature of the net adjustment and the lack of evidence of a sustainable market recovery these amounts were not recorded and no net realisable value adjustments had been recorded since 2009.
In the year 32% 2012: 46% of the Groups UK completions were from sites that had been previously impaired.
At the balance sheet date the Group held inventory in the UK that had been written down to net realisable value of 459.9 million 2012: 784.4 million with associated impairments of 206.8 million 2012: 351.5 million.
The UK net realisable value assessment of inventory is highly sensitive to small changes in judgements and the table below provides an indication of the impact to the inventory held on the balance sheet of 1% movements in selling prices and build costs.

In the year 95 plots 2012: 120 were completed in Spain that had previously been impaired.
In Spain there was inventory written down to net realisable value of 30.2 million as at 31 December 2013 2012: 50.1 million.
The table below details the movements recorded on the write-downs on impaired inventory recorded through the income statement in the year.

An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from trade receivables of 3.2 million 2012: 5.4 million.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
Included within trade receivables are mortgage receivables of 107.5 million 2012: 91.4 million including shared equity loans.
Shared equity loans are provided to certain customers to facilitate their house purchase.
They are accounted for as a host contract representing a loan receivable and a non-closely related embedded derivative asset, as allowed under IAS 39 Financial instruments.
The loan is measured at amortised cost and the embedded derivative is measured at fair value through the income statement.
The embedded derivative fair value movement is established by reference to two published national house price indices.
In the year the fair value of the derivative was determined to have increased by 5.5 million 2012: nil.
Cash and cash equivalents million 2013 2012 Cash and cash equivalents see Note 20 105.4 190.4 Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held by the Group and short term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value in both years.

The Group has designated the carrying value of 34.0 million 2012: 55.0 million foreign currency forward contracts as a net investment hedge.
The fair value of the forward contract is based on observable forward exchange rates at the end of the period level 2.
At the year end the carrying value is considered to approximate its fair value.
The Group has no financial instruments with fair values that are determined by reference to significant unobservable inputs level 3, nor have there been any transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy.
There are no non-recurring fair value measurements.

The fair values of the forward contracts are not materially different to their book values as they were entered into on or near 31 December in each year and mature not more than one month later.
Market risk The Groups activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in both foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group aims to manage the exposure to these risks by the use of fixed or variable rate borrowings, foreign currency borrowings and derivative financial instruments.
a Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as the Group borrows funds at both fixed and variable interest rates.
The exposure to variable rate borrowings varies during the year due to the seasonal nature of cash flows relating to housing sales and the less certain timing of land payments.
Group policy is to manage the volatility risk by a combination of fixed rate borrowings and interest rate swaps such that the sensitivity to potential changes in variable rates is within acceptable levels.
Group policy does not allow the use of derivatives to speculate against changes to future interest rates and they are only used to manage exposure to volatility.
This policy has not changed during the year.
In order to measure the risk, variable rate borrowings and the expected interest cost for the year are forecast on a monthly basis and compared to budget using managements expectations of a reasonably possible change in interest rates.
Interest expense volatility remained within acceptable limits throughout the year.
At the year end the Group had nil million 2012: 149.4 million of fixed rate exposure.

Group policy requires that transaction risks are hedged to the functional currency of the subsidiary using foreign currency borrowings or derivatives where appropriate.
The Group is also exposed to the translation risk of accounting for both the income and the net investment held in functional currencies other than Sterling.
The net investment risk is partially hedged using foreign currency borrowings and derivatives.
Assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies are retranslated each month using the latest exchange rates and resultant exchange gains or losses monitored each month.
Income is also measured monthly using the latest exchange rates and compared to a budget held at historical exchange rates.
Other than the natural hedge provided by foreign currency borrowings the translation risk of income is not hedged using derivatives.
The policy is kept under periodic review.
The Groups exposure to, and the way in which it manages, exchange rate risk has not changed from the previous year.
Hedge accounting The Group has designated the carrying value of 34.0 million 2012: 55.0 million foreign currency forward contracts held at the balance sheet date as a net investment hedge of part of the Groups investment in Euro denominated assets.
The change in the carrying amount of the derivatives which were effective hedging instruments and the change in the carrying value of the borrowings offset the exchange movement on the foreign currency net investments and are presented in the translation reserve.
Foreign currency sensitivity The Group is only exposed to the Euro due to its Spanish operations.
The following table details how the Groups income and equity would increase decrease on a before tax basis, to a 5% change in the respective currency against Sterling and in accordance with IFRS 7, all other variables remaining constant.

Financial instruments and fair value disclosures continued Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss where counterparties are not able to meet their obligations.
Group policy is that surplus cash when not used to repay borrowings is placed on deposit with the Groups main relationship banks and with other banks or money market funds based on a minimum credit rating and maximum exposure.
Land receivables arise from sales of surplus land on deferred terms.
A policy is in place such that if the credit risk is not acceptable then the deferred payment must have adequate security, either by the use of an appropriate guarantee or a charge over the land.
The fair value of any land held as security is considered by management to be sufficient in relation to the carrying amount of the receivable to which it relates.
Trade and other receivables comprise mainly amounts receivable from various housing associations and other housebuilders.
Management considers that the credit quality of the various receivables is good in respect of the amounts outstanding and therefore credit risk is considered to be low.
There is no significant concentration of risk.
A small allowance for credit losses against other receivables is held, however the balance is not material in relation to the gross carrying value of this particular class of financial asset.
Mortgages receivables, including shared equity loans, are in connection with the various promotion schemes to support sales on a selective basis.
The mortgages are mostly secured by a second charge over the property and are held at their fair value.
The carrying amount of financial assets, as detailed above, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date assuming that any security held has no value.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient financial resources available to meet its obligations as they fall due.
The Group manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, matching the expected cash flow timings of financial assets and liabilities with the use of cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, overdrafts and committed revolving credit facilities with a minimum of 12 months to maturity.
Future borrowing requirements are forecast on a monthly basis and funding headroom is maintained above forecast peak requirements to meet unforeseen events.
The Group has a range of maturities with an average life of 4.7 years 2012: 2.2 years.
In addition to fixed term borrowings the Group has access to committed revolving credit facilities and cash balances.
At the balance sheet date, the total unused committed amount was 550.0 million 2012: 550.0 million and cash and cash equivalents were 105.4 million 2012: 190.4 million.
The 100.0 million term loan has now extended to mature in November 2020, with repayments commencing in November 2017, following the redemption of the Senior Notes 10.375% due 2015, which occurred on 31 December 2013.
The maturity profile of the anticipated future cash flows, including interest using the latest applicable relevant rate based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis, is as follows: Overdrafts, Trade and Financial liabilities bank and Land other Debenture million other loans creditors payables loans Total On demand Within one year 5.1 214.7 512.0 731.8 More than one year and less than two years 5.1 78.3 30.8 114.2 More than two years and less than five years 63.7 59.5 9.6 132.8 In more than five years 53.5 14.8 1.1 69.4 31 December 2013 127.4 367.3 553.5 1,048.2 Excludes land creditors Overdrafts, Trade and Financial liabilities bank and Land other Debenture million other loans creditors payables loans Total On demand Within one year 5.2 244.3 471.5 15.5 736.5 More than one year and less than two years 5.2 65.6 29.5 15.5 115.8 More than two years and less than five years 102.6 62.6 17.3 164.6 347.1 In more than five years 23.4 1.1 24.5 31 December 2012 113.0 395.9 519.4 195.6 1,223.9 Excludes land creditors 110 Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 110 Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 Strategic Report p1-27 Directors Report: Governance p28-62 Financial Statements p63-111 Shareholder Information p112-121 Strategic Report p3-39 Directors Report: Governance p41-79 Financial Statements p81-131 Shareholder Information p132-141 21.
Retirement benefit schemes Retirement benefit obligation comprises defined benefit pension liability of 182.2 million 2012: 242.5 million and post-retirement healthcare liability of 1.6 million 2012: 1.7 million.
The Group merged the Taylor Woodrow Group Pension and Life Assurance Fund and the George Wimpey Staff Pension Scheme, creating the Taylor Wimpey Pension Scheme in 2013.
This scheme is closed to new members and future accrual.
The two legacy schemes are due to complete their winding-up in 2014.
The Group also operates defined contribution pension arrangements in the UK, which are available to new and existing UK employees.
Defined contribution pension plan A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays contributions to an independently administered fund such contributions are based upon a fixed percentage of employees pay.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions to the fund once the contributions have been paid.
Members benefits are determined by the amount of contributions paid by the Group and the member, together with investment returns earned on the contributions arising from the performance of each individuals chosen investments and the type of pension the member chooses to buy at retirement.
As a result, actuarial risk that benefits will be lower than expected and investment risk that assets invested in will not perform in line with expectations fall on the employee.
The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
The Groups defined contribution plan, the Taylor Wimpey Personal Choice Plan TWPCP, is offered to all new and existing monthly paid employees.
The Peoples Pension is used for auto enrolment purposes for weekly and monthly employees not participating in the TWPCP.
The Peoples Pension is provided by B&CE, one of the UK's largest providers of financial benefits to construction industry employers and individuals.
The Group made contributions to its defined contribution arrangements of 7.7 million in 2013 2012: 7.1 million, which is included in the income statement charge.
The Group expects to make contributions of around 8.0 million in 2014.
Defined benefit pension schemes The Groups defined benefit pension scheme in the UK is the Taylor Wimpey Pension Scheme TWPS which was formed on 7 March 2013.
On the 1 October 2013, the transfer of assets and obligations from the Taylor Woodrow Group Pension and Life Assurance Fund TWGP&LAF and the George Wimpey Staff Pension Scheme GWSPS took place.
The TWGP&LAF was closed to future pension accrual with effect from 30 November 2006 and the GWSPS was closed to future accrual with effect from 31 August 2010.
Consequently, the TWPS is closed to future accrual.
The member benefits provided by the TWPS are consistent with the two legacy schemes and as such it is a funded defined benefit pension scheme which provides benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided depends on members length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement or date of ceasing active accrual if earlier.
Pensions in payment are generally increased in line with inflation.
The Group operates the TWPS under the UK regulatory framework.
Benefits are paid to members from a Trustee-administered fund and the Trustees are responsible for ensuring that the scheme is sufficiently funded to meet current and future benefit payments.
Scheme assets are held in trust.
The TWPS Trustees other duties include managing the investment of scheme assets, administration of scheme benefits and exercising of discretionary powers.
The Group works closely with the Trustees to manage the TWPS.
The Trustees of the TWPS are required to act in the best interests of the TWPS beneficiaries.
The appointment of the Trustees is determined by the TWPS trust documentation.
The Group and the legacy schemes Trustees formed a Joint Investment Sub Committee which undertook a joint review of the schemes investment strategy.
This investment committee continues for the TWPS and implementation of the investment changes started during 2011 and monitoring of these changes is ongoing.
The Trustees must agree a funding plan with the Group such that any funding shortfall is expected to be met by additional contributions and investment outperformance.
In order to assess the level of contributions required, triennial valuations are carried out using prudent assumptions.
The first funding valuation of the TWPS is due as at 31 December 2013, and will be carried out during 2014.
The estimated amounts of contributions to be paid to the TWPS during 2014 are 46.0 million in respect of deficit repair contributions in accordance with the previous schedule of contributions for the legacy schemes and an additional 2.8 million in respect of expenses and the Pension Protection Funds levy, until the funding valuation has been agreed.

Retirement benefit schemes continued The table below sets out the details of the latest funding valuations for the two legacy schemes, carried out in March 2010.
The Group has agreed to maintain the same level of funding contributions into the TWPS as into the legacy schemes until the first valuation of the TWPS is completed.
The March 2013 valuation of the legacy schemes was deferred following the merger of the schemes.

The defined benefit obligation is measured using the projected unit actuarial cost method.
The duration, or average term to payment for the benefits due, weighted by liability, is approximately 15-16 years for the TWPS.
Accounting assumptions The assumptions used in calculating the accounting costs and obligations of the TWPS, as detailed below, are set by the Directors after consultation with independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
The basis for these assumptions is prescribed by IAS 19 and they do not reflect the assumptions that may be used in future funding valuations of the TWPS.
The discount rate used to determine the present value of the obligations is set by reference to market yields on high quality corporate bonds with regard for the duration of the TWPS.
The assumption for RPI inflation is set by reference to the Bank of Englands implied inflation spot curve with regard for the duration of the TWPS, with appropriate adjustments to reflect distortions due to supply and demand for inflation linked securities.
CPI inflation is set by reference to RPI inflation as no CPI-linked bonds exist to render implied CPI inflation directly observable.
The life expectancies have been derived using mortality assumptions that were based on the results of a recent investigation into the mortality experience of the two legacy schemes.
The base tables used are the PA92 series tables with appropriate age rating adjustments.
Future improvements in life expectancy are allowed for in the form of the medium cohort projections, with a 1% per annum underpin to future improvements in life expectancy.

These areas of risk, and the ways in which the Group has sought to manage them, are set out in the table opposite.
The risks are considered from both a funding perspective, which drives the cash commitments of the Group, and from an accounting perspective, i. e. the extent to which such risks affect the amounts recorded in the Groups financial statements.

Retirement benefit schemes continued Although investment decisions in the UK are the responsibility of the Trustees, the Group takes an active interest to ensure that pension scheme risks are managed efficiently.
The Group has regular meetings with the Trustees to discuss investment performance, regulatory changes and proposals to manage the deficit actively.
The key risks of the defined benefit pension scheme are detailed below along with the Groups approach to them.
Risk Description Asset volatility The funding liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to government bond yields, with allowance for additional return to be generated from the investment portfolio.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields.
The TWPS holds a large proportion of its assets in equities and other return-seeking assets.
The returns on such assets tend to be volatile and are not correlated to government bonds or corporate bonds.
This means that the funding level is likely to be volatile in the short-term, potentially resulting in short-term cash requirements and an increase in the net defined benefit liability recorded on the balance sheet.
However, the Group believes that equities offer the best returns over the long term with an acceptable level of risk.
The TWPS assets are well-diversified by investing in a range of asset classes, including property, government bonds and corporate bonds.
There are a number of hedging strategies in place these are mentioned below.
A summary of the target asset allocations of the legacy defined benefit schemes is shown below: TWGP&LAF GWSPS UK equities 7.6% 5.3% Non-UK equities 30.4% 21.2% Index-linked gilts 9.4% 20.3% Fixed-interest gilts 5.1% 8.7% Other bonds 25.0% 25.5% Alternatives GTAA: opportunistic credit: EMD: active commodities 20.5% 19.0% Property 2.0% Changes in bond Falling bond yields tend to increase the funding and accounting liabilities.
However, the investment in corporate and yields government bonds offers a degree of matching, i. e. the movement in assets arising from changes in bond yields partially matches the movement in the funding or accounting liabilities.
In this way, the exposure to movements in bond yields is reduced.
Investing in In order to maintain appropriate diversification of investments within the TWPS assets and to take advantage of overseas foreign currency investment returns a proportion of the underlying investment portfolio is invested overseas.
To balance the risk of investing in foreign currencies while having an obligation to settle benefits in GBP, a currency hedging programme, using forward foreign exchange contracts, has been put in place to reduce the currency exposure of these overseas investments to the targeted level.
Asset liability In order to maintain and increase the TWPS economic exposure to interest rates and inflation rates, a liability hedging mismatch programme has been put in place.
Repurchase agreements are being used to achieve the TWPS agreed target level of liability hedging in an unfunded way and hence to reduce the investment risk of the TWPS assets relative to the liabilities.
Illiquidity The majority of the TWPS assets are invested in liquid instruments and approximately 80% of total assets are managed either in segregated accounts or daily weekly dealt pooled funds and can therefore be realised within a few business days under normal market conditions.
The remaining investments with the exception of property are in pooled funds with monthly or quarterly redemption dates and could be redeemed within approximately three months of notification in normal market conditions.
Life expectancy The majority of the TWPS obligations are to provide a pension for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the TWPS liabilities.
The inflation-linked nature of the benefit payments from the TWPS result increases the sensitivity of the liabilities to changes in life expectancy.
Additional areas of risk management The creation of the TWPS from the two legacy schemes in 2013 will simplify scheme management, reduce administration costs by approximately 0.8 million per annum and improve the management of future deficit repair contributions.
During the last quarter of 2013, in conjunction with the transfer of assets and obligations into the newly formed TWPS, the Group conducted a trivial-commutation exercise, offering lump sums to deferred and pensioner members with total benefits small enough for this to be permitted by pensions legislation.
This resulted in an income statement settlement gain in 2013 of 4.1 million.

Retirement benefit schemes continued At the same time as creating the TWPS, the Group introduced a 100.0 million Pension Funding Partnership utilising show homes in a sale and leaseback structure.
The TWPS will benefit from the contingent funding structure should the Group be unable to meet the cash payments under the funding agreement.
As at 31 December 2013 there was 92.9 million of show homes and 18.1 million of cash held within the structure.
The Groups post-retirement liability also includes 1.6 million at 31 December 2013 2012: 1.7 million in respect of continuing post-retirement healthcare insurance premiums for retired long-service employees.
The liability is based upon the actuarial assessment of the remaining cost by a qualified actuary on a net present value basis at 31 December 2008.
The cost is calculated assuming a discount rate of 3.6% per annum 2012: 3.6% and an increase in medical expenses of 7.5% per annum 2012: 10.6%.
The premium cost to the Group in respect of the retired long-service employees for 2013 was 0.2 million 2012: 0.2 million.

The North America provision relates to the disposal of the North American business.
Following the settlement of various claims in the year 31.3 million was released.
Other provisions consist of a remedial work provision, provisions for legal claims, onerous leases and other contract-related costs.
The remedial work provision covers various obligations, including aftercare at Springfield Environmental Limited which has a legal responsibility of a long term nature for the management of old, completed sites relating to a former business and provisions for losses on construction contracts.
Also included in other provisions are amounts for legal claims and contract-related costs associated with various matters arising across the Group, the majority of which are anticipated to be settled within a three year period.
Onerous leases and empty property costs included in this provision are expected to be utilised within approximately six years.
