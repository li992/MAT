Factors affecting the tax charge for the year The tax rate assessed for the year is higher 2012: higher than the standard effective rate of corporation tax in the UK of 23.75% 2012: 25.5%.
The differences are explained below: 2013 2012 m m Pro t before tax 104.8 100.0 Pro t before tax multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax of 23.75% 2012: 25.5% 24.9 25.5 Effects of: Other items including non-deductible expenses 1.8 Loss on re-measurement of joint venture interest on acquisition of control 2.7 Additional tax relief for land remediation costs 1.4 2.0 Adjustment in respect of previous years 2.2 2.5 Tax in respect of joint ventures 0.2 0.2 Tax on share-based payments 0.8 0.4 Impact of change in tax rate on deferred tax asset 3.3 8.7 Tax charge for the year 29.8 32.6 Legislation reducing the main rate of corporation tax to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013 was enacted on 17 July 2012.
Accordingly, the current year tax charge has been provided for at an effective rate of 23.75% and the closing deferred tax asset has been provided for at a rate of 23% in these financial statements.
Additional reductions in the main rate of corporation tax from 23% to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014 and from 21% to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015 were enacted within the Finance Act 2013 on 17 July 2013.
As these reductions were not substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, their effect has not been re ected in these financial statements.
If the deferred tax assets and liabilities of the Group were all to reverse after 2015, the effect of the reduction from 23% to 20% would be to reduce the net deferred tax asset by 12.0m.
To the extent that the net deferred tax asset reverses more quickly than this, the impact of the rate reductions on the net deferred tax asset will be reduced.
