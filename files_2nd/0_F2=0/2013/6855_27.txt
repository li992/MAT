Notes to the accounts For the 52 weeks ended 28 April 2013 1 Accounting policies Corporate information The consolidated financial statements of Greene King plc for the 52 weeks ended 28 April 2013 were authorised for issue by the board of directors on 26 June 2013.
Greene King plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The companys shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Statement of compliance The groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted bythe EU as they apply to the financial statements of the group for the 52 weeks ended 28 April 2013 prior year 52 weeks ended 29 April 2012 and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
They are presented in pounds sterling, with values rounded to the nearest hundred thousand, except where otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Greene King plc, its subsidiaries and its related party, Greene King Finance plc.
Greene King Finance plc is a special purpose entity set up to raise bond finance for the group, which is consolidated as a quasi-subsidiary.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company with adjustments made to their financial statements to bring their accounting policies in line with those used by the group.
The results of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Changes in accounting policies The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
The following amendments to standards are effective for this financial year but have not had a significant impact on the reported financial performance or position of the group.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Amendment Disclosures of transfer of financial assets This amendment, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011, requires additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures relating to transfers of financial assets.
IAS 12 Income Taxes Recovery of underlying assets The amendment, effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2012, clarified the determination of deferred tax on investment property measured at fair value.
Significant accounting policies Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost on transition to IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated to their estimated residual values over periods upto 50 years, and short leasehold improvements are depreciated to their estimated residual values over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease or useful life of the asset.
Residual value is reviewed at least at each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value.
Plant and equipment assets are depreciated over their estimated lives which range from three to 20 years.
Residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed for all categories of property, plant and equipment and adjusted, ifappropriate, at each financial year end.
An item of property, plant and equipment is fide-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use.
Profit or loss on fide-recognition is calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, andis included in the income statement in the year of fide-recognition.
Business combinations and goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree.
The choice of measurement of non-controlling interest, either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets, is determined on a transaction by transaction basis.
Acquisition costs incurred are taken to the income statement.
When the group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.
This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts of the acquiree.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred to the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which are deemed to be an asset or a liability will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in the income statement or in other comprehensive income.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it should not be re-measured until it is finally settled within equity.
co. uk Annual report 2013 GREENE KING PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the accounts continued For the 52 weeks ended 28 April 2013 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting policies continued Business combinations and goodwill continued Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest over the net identifiable amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in exchange for the business combination.
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in transactions separate to the business combinations, such as the settlement of pre-existing relationships or post-acquisition remuneration arrangements, are accounted for separately from the business combination in accordance with their nature and applicable IFRS.
Identifiable intangible assets, meeting either the contractual-legal or separability criterion, are recognised separately from goodwill.
Contingent liabilities representing a present obligation are recognised  fair value can be measured reliably.
If the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest is lower than the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the fair value of any pre-existing interest held in the business acquired, the difference is recognised in the income statement.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment Property, plant and equipment Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash inflows independent of the cash inflows of other groups of assets.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is an indication of impairment.
If an indication exists, the group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount of each asset group.
An assets or cash-generating units recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
An impairment loss is recognised where the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of assets.
If there is an indication that any previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased, a reversal of the loss may be made only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amounts since the last impairment loss was recognised.
The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount only up to the carrying amount that would have resulted, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Impairment losses and any subsequent reversals are recognised in the income statement.
Details of the impairment losses recognised in respect of property, plant and equipment are provided in note 14.
Goodwill Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Impairment is determined by the recoverable amount of an operating segment.
Where this is less than the carrying value of the operating segment an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
This loss cannot be reversed in future periods.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the groups cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Each unit or group of units to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and cannot be larger than an operating segment before aggregation.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, any goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
Goodwill amortised prior to the conversion to IFRS on 3 May 2004 has not been reinstated and the net book value of goodwill at that date has been carried forward as the carrying value.
Prior to May 1998, goodwill was written off to reserves.
Such goodwill has not been reinstated and is not included in determining profit or loss on disposal.
Financial instruments Financial instruments are recognised when the group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are fide-recognised when the group no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, normally through sale or when all cash flows attributable to the instrument are passed to an independent third party.
Financial assets Financial assets are classified as either financial assets at fair value through the income statement, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments or available-for-sale financial assets.
The group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and, where appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at each financial year end.
The group makes trade loans to publicans who purchase the groups beer.
Trade loans are non-derivative and are not quoted in an active market and have therefore been designated as Loans and receivables, carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are fide-recognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
The group assesses at each balance sheet date whether any individual trade loan is impaired.
If there is evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of loss is measured as the difference between the loans carrying amount and the expected future receipts, excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred, discounted at the loans original effective interest rate.
The loss is recognised in operating profit.
66 GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2013 www.
co. uk 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting policies continued Trade receivables Trade receivables are recorded at their original invoiced amount less an allowance for any doubtful amounts when collection of the full amount is no longer considered probable.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Raw materials are valued at average cost.
Finished goods and work inprogress comprise materials, labour and attributable production overheads where applicable, and are valued at average cost.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Property, plant and equipment held for sale Property, plant and equipment is classified as held for sale only if it is available for sale in its current condition, management are committed to the sale and a sale is highly probable and expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification.
Property, plant and equipment classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and is no longer depreciated or amortised.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Finance costs and income Finance costs are expensed to the income statement using the effective interest method.
Finance income is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The group uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate loans, notes and bonds.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value, if any, and carried on the balance sheet as an asset or liability.
Subsequent measurement is at fair value determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
If a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting thegain or loss arising on the movement in fair value is recognised in the income statement.
Hedge accounting To qualify for hedge accounting the hedge relationship must be designated and documented at inception.
Documentation must include the groups risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and formal allocation to the item or transaction being hedged.
The group also documents how it will assess the effectiveness of the hedge and carries out assessments on a regular basis to determine whether it has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly effective.
Hedges can be classified as either fair value hedging exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability, or cash flow hedging the variability in cash flows attributable to an asset, liability, or forecast transaction.
The group uses its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.
Cash flow hedge accounting The effective portion of the gain or loss on an interest rate swap is recognised directly in equity, whilst any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period that the financial income or expense is recognised, unless the hedged transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability whereby the amounts are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, amounts previously recognised in equity are held there until the previously hedged transaction affects profit or loss.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Trade payables Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted to present value, where the effect of the time value of money is material, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market estimates of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The amortisation of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits Defined benefit pension schemes The group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes which require contributions to be made into separately administered funds.
The cost of providing benefits under the schemes is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial method on an annual basis.
The current service cost is charged to operating profit.
Any actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the group statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Past service costs are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period or immediately if the benefits have vested.
When a settlement or curtailment occurs the obligation and related scheme assets are remeasured and the resulting gain orloss isrecognised in the income statement in the same period.
co. uk Annual report 2013 GREENE KING PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the accounts continued For the 52 weeks ended 28 April 2013 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting policies continued Pensions and other post-employment benefits continued Defined benefit pension schemes continued The interest cost on scheme liabilities and the expected return on scheme assets are shown as a net amount in the group income statement.
The defined benefit asset or liability recognised on the balance sheet comprises the present value of the schemes obligations less the fair value of scheme assets.
Defined benefit assets are restricted to the extent that they are considered recoverable.
Defined contribution pension schemes The cost of the groups defined contribution pension schemes amounts to the value of contributions made.
Contributions are charged totheincome statement as they become payable.
Postemployment healthcare benefits The group also provided certain additional post-employment healthcare benefits to employees which are unfunded.
The cost of providing these benefits is determined on an estimated accruals basis.
Share-based payments Certain employees and directors receive equity-settled remuneration, whereby they render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
The fair value of the shares and options granted are measured using a Black-Scholes model, at the date at which they were granted.
No account is taken in the fair value calculation of any vesting conditions service and performance, other than market conditions performance linked to the price of the shares of the company.
Any other conditions that are required to be met in order for an employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered non-vesting conditions.
Like market performance conditions, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining the grant date fair value.
The fair value of shares and options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity spread over the period in which the vesting conditions are fulfilled ending on the relevant vesting date.
The cumulative amount recognised as an expense reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired, adjusted for the estimated number of shares and options that are ultimately expected to vest.
The periodic charge or credit is the movement in the cumulative position from beginning to end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest provided vesting is not conditional on market or non-vesting conditions.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in calculating earnings per share figures.
In accordance with the exemption allowed under IFRS 1 for first time adopters, no expense is recorded in respect of grants made under the above schemes prior to 7 November 2002 which had not vested by the date of transition to IFRS.
However, later modifications of such equity instruments are measured using IFRS 2.
Own shares Own shares consist of treasury shares and shares held within an employee benefit trust.
The group has an employee benefit trust for the granting of shares to applicable employees.
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from shareholders equity.
Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds from the original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on transactions in treasury shares.
Revenue Generally, revenue represents external sales excluding taxes of goods and services, net of discounts.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and is measured at the fair value of consideration receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes or duty relating to brewing and packaging of certain products.
Revenue principally consists of drink, food and accommodation sales, which are recognised at the point at which goods or services are provided, rental income, which is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term and machine income, where net takings are recognised as earned.
Operating leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership are classified as operating leases.
Lease payments arerecognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease premiums paid on entering into or acquiring operating leases represent prepaid lease payments and are held on the balance sheet as current the portion relating to the next financial period or non-current prepayments.
These are amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Taxes Income tax The income tax charge comprises both the income tax payable based on profits for the year and the deferred income tax.
It is calculated using taxation rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
Income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided for using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is recognised for all temporary differences except where the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss or, in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

co. uk 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting policies continued Taxes continued Deferred tax continued Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and carry forward of unused tax losses only to the extent that itis probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax losses can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured, on an undiscounted basis, at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when theasset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are defined as items of income or expense which, because of their nature, size or expected frequency, merit separate presentation to allow a better understanding of the financial performance in the period.
New standards and interpretations not applied As at 28 April 2013 there are a number of standards and interpretations issued by the IASB and IFRIC with an effective date after the date of these financial statements and which have not been early adopted by the group.
These are expected to be applied as follows: IAS 19 Employee Benefits Revised The revisions eliminate the corridor approach and requires immediate recognition of all actuarial gains and losses in other comprehensive income, immediate recognition of all past service costs and the replacement of interest cost and expected return on plan assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability asset.
The amendments are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
If the revised standard had been adopted at 28 April 2013 the group would have reported net pension finance costs of 2.5m rather than net finance income of 1.1m.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Amendment and IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation Amendment The amendment to IAS 32, which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, clarifies some of the requirements for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities on the group balance sheet.
The amendment to IFRS 7, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, will affect disclosure only and has no impact on the groups financial position or performance.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement The standard is the first phase in the IASBs work to replace IAS 39 and applies to the classification and measurement of financial instruments as defined in IAS 39.
The Boards work on other phases is on-going, and includes impairment of financial instruments and hedge accounting.
This standard, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015, establishes two primary measurement categories for financial assets: i amortised cost: and ii fair value.
The basis of classification depends on the entitys business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.
In relation to liabilities the change in the fair value of a liability that relates to credit risk must be presented in other comprehensive income.
The remainder of the change in fair value is presented in profit or loss, unless such presentation would create or enlarge the accounting mismatch in profit or loss.
In subsequent phases, the IASB will address hedge accounting and derecognition.
The group will quantify the effect in conjunction with the other phases, when issued, to present a comprehensive picture.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities The new standard, which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, sets out the required disclosures for entities reporting under IFRS 10 and IFRS 11 that were previously included in IAS 27, IAS 28 and IAS 31.
The standard includes disclosure requirements for all forms of interest in other legal entities, including subsidiaries joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off-balance sheet vehicles.
The impact on the group is on disclosure in the consolidated financial statements only, where summarised information may need to be provided.
The following standards and interpretations are relevant to the group though they have been assessed as having no financial impact oradditional disclosure requirements at this time: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement: IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements Revised : IAS 28 Associates and Joint Ventures Amendment : IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 Investment Entities: and Improvements to International Financial Reporting Standards 20092011 Cycle : IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment: and IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation.
co. uk Annual report 2013 GREENE KING PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the accounts continued For the 52 weeks ended 28 April 2013 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting judgments and estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting policies that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.
The group bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors deemed reasonable under the circumstances, including any expectations of future events.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and assumptions considered to be significant are detailed below: Taxation Judgment is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot be finally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities.
Assumptions are also made around the assets which qualify for capital allowances and the level of disallowable expenses and this affects the income tax calculation.
Provisions are also made for uncertain exposures which can have an impact on both deferred and current tax.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained and tax provisions are made if it is possible that a liability will arise.
The final resolution of these transactions may give rise to material adjustments to the income statement and or cash flow in future periods.
The group reviews each significant tax liability or benefit each period to assess the appropriate accounting treatment.
Share-based payments Judgment is required when calculating the fair value of awards made under the groups share-based payment plans.
Note 8 describes the key assumptions and valuation model inputs used in the determination of these values.
In addition estimates are made of the number of awards that will ultimately vest, judgment is required in relation to the probability of meeting non-market based performance conditions and the continuing participation of employees in the plans.
Pension liabilities The present values of pension liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and depend on a number of actuarial assumptions which are disclosed in note 9.
Any change in these assumptions will impact on the carrying amount of pension liabilities.
Note 9 describes the key assumptions used in the accounting for retirement benefit obligations.
Impairment of goodwill The group determines whether goodwill is impaired on at least an annual basis.
Details of the tests and carrying value of the assets are shown in note 13.
This requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.
Value-in-use calculations require assumptions to be made regarding the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
If the actual cash flows are lower than estimated, future impairments may be necessary.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment The group determines whether property, plant and equipment is impaired where there are indicators of impairment.
This requires an estimation of the value-in-use at a site level.
Note 14 describes the assumptions used in the impairment testing of property, plant and equipment together with an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in key assumptions.
Residual values Residual values of property are determined with reference to current market property trends.
If residual values were lower than estimated, an impairment of asset value and reassessment of future depreciation charge may be required.
Useful lives are reassessed annually which may lead to an increase or reduction in depreciation accordingly.
Business combinations The group identifies separate assets and liabilities upon acquisition and recognises those assets at their fair value.
The assessment of fair value, particularly for property, plant and equipment acquired, is undertaken with reference to current market conditions.
Note 17 describes the business combinations in the current year and provides details of the fair value adjustments made in arriving at the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired.
Property provisions The group provides for its onerous obligations under operating leases where the property is closed or vacant and for properties where rental expense is in excess of income.
The estimated timings and amounts of cash flows are determined using the experience of internal and external property experts.
However, changes to the expected method of exiting from the obligation could lead to changes in the level of provision recorded.

The fair value ofthe grants and model inputs used to calculate the fair values of grants during the period were as follows: 2013 LTIP SAYE Weighted average share price 596p 708p Exercise price 505p Expected dividend yield 4.5% 3.8% Risk-free rate of return 0.2% 0.6% Volatility 23.8% 22.0% Expected life years 3.0 3.3 Weighted average fair value of grants in the year 521p 168p 2012 LTIP SAYE Weighted average share price 455p 522p Exercise price 387p Expected dividend yield 4.9% 4.9% Risk-free rate of return 1.4% 0.6% Volatility 42.9% 33.2% Expected life years 3.0 3.3 Weighted average fair value of grants in the year 393p 133p Risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds with the same life as the expected option life.
Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the companys share price which assumes that the past trend in share price movement is indicative of future trends.
Expected life of options has been taken as the mid-point of the relevant exercise period.
This is not necessarily indicative offuture exercise patterns.
No other feature of the equity instruments granted was incorporated into the fair value measurement.

As from 3 May 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, goodwill is no longer amortised but is subject to annual impairment testing.
Goodwill has been allocated to operating segments, the lowest group of cash-generating units in the group at which goodwill is monitored internally, based on the extent that the benefits of acquisitions flow to that segment.
Goodwill disposed of in the year is the amount of goodwill allocated to parts of operating segments disposed of during the year.
The amount disposed is calculated based on the relative value of the operation disposed and the portion of the operating segment retained.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated 353.8m 2012: 354.0m to Retail, 156.5m 2012: 160.8m to Pub Partners, and 214.5m 2012: 214.5m to Brewing & Brands.
The recoverable amount of each segment was determined on a value-in-use basis, using cash flow projections based on one-year budgets approved by the board, and in all cases exceeded the carrying amount.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are budgeted EBITDA, the pre-tax discount rate and the growth rate used toextrapolate cash flows beyond the budgeted period.
Budgeted EBITDA is based on past experience adjusted to take account of the impact of expected changes to each cash-generating units pub estate or operations, sales prices and volumes, capital expenditure, business mix and margin.
Cash flows are discounted at 9.0% 2012: 9.0% which is used as an approximation for the risk-adjusted discount rate of the relevant operating segment.
A growth rate of 2.0% 2012: 2.0% has been used to extrapolate cash flows.
The growth rate is considered a conservative rate and is below the long-term average growth rate for the industry.

co. uk 13 Goodwill continued Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The calculation is most sensitive to changes in the assumptions used for budgeted cash flow, pre-tax discount rate and growth rate.
Management consider that reasonable possible changes in assumptions would be an increase in discount of 1% point, a reduction in growth rate of 1% point or a 10% reduction in budgeted cash flow.
As an indication of sensitivity, when applied to the value-in-use calculation none of these changes would have resulted in an impairment of goodwill in the period.

Arepresentative sample of properties was also valued by external valuers, Gerald Eve Chartered Surveyors and Property Consultants, whoconfirmed that the values were consistent with their appraisal.
Frozen revaluation has been taken as deemed cost on the transition toIFRS, therefore no historic cost analysis is provided.
Up to 1999 the brewery and depots were valued at depreciated replacement cost and other properties at open market value.
These valuations have been retained but they have not been updated.
Subsequent additions have been included at cost or, in the case of acquisitions, at fair value.
Charges over assets Included in land and buildings are properties with a net book value of 1,437.7m 2012: 1,433.9m over which there is a first charge infavour of the securitised debt holders as detailed in note 23.

Theseareanalysed between the groups principal reporting segments as shown below.
1.6m of the impairment recognised in the year for within the Retail estate is in respect of licensed properties damaged by fire.
Intheperiod the group has received 0.8m of insurance compensation to meet the costs incurred to date of restoring these properties: further compensation is expected to be received as the restoration projects progress.
2013 2012 m m Retail 3.8 2.5 Pub Partners 15.5 19.6 19.3 22.1 The group considers that each of its individual pubs is a cash-generating unit CGU.
Each CGU is reviewed annually for indicators ofimpairment.
When indicators of impairment are identified the carrying value of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount.
Therecoverable amount is the higher of the CGUs fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use.
The group estimates value-in-use using a discounted cash flow model.
The key assumptions used are the discount rate applied to cash flow projections of 9% 2012: 9% and the projected cash flows extrapolated using an average growth rate of 2% 2012: 2% which is below the long-term average growth rate for the industry.
Other commercial assumptions relating to individual CGUs have been made based on historic trends adjusted for managements estimates of medium-term trading prospects.
Estimates of fair value less costs to sell are based on valuations undertaken by in-house property experts.
The impairment recognised in the Retail and Pub Partners estates are primarily the result of the reduced trading performance of a relatively small number of pubs due to a combination of site specific trading circumstances and the general weakening of the UK consumer environment seen in the year.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The level of impairment is predominantly dependent upon judgments used in arriving at fair values, future growth rates and the discount rate applied to cash flow projections.
The impact on the impairment charge of applying different assumptions to fair values, the growth rates used to calculate cash flow projections and in the pre-tax discount rates would be as follows: Increased impairment resulting from a 10% reduction in fair value: 2013 2012 m m Retail 0.6 0.4 Pub Partners 3.8 3.6 4.4 4.0 Increased impairment resulting from a 1% increase in discount rate: 2013 2012 m m Retail 0.4 0.8 Pub Partners 3.2 3.3 3.6 4.1 84 GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2013 www.

Any amounts drawn down bear interest at a margin above LIBOR, with commitment payments on the undrawn portions.
Interest is payable at each renewal date which vary in maturity.
Although any individual draw-downs are repayable within 12 months of the balance sheet date, the group expects to renew this funding.
Immediate renewal is available under the 400m facility until April 2016.
Final repayment of the total drawn-down balance is due as one payment on the agreement repayment date.
Securitised debt The group has issued various tranches of bonds in connection with the securitisation of 2,035 of the groups pubs held in Greene King Retailing Limited at the date of the most recent tap.
The bonds are secured over the properties and their future income streams and were issued by Greene King Finance plc.
Includes the effect of interest rate swaps and future rate step-ups.
Carrying value is net of related deferred finance fees.
Since the year end the group has repurchased the AB1 floating rate band at par.
Repayment of nominal is made by quarterly instalments, in accordance with the repayment schedule, over the period shown above.
Payment of interest is made on quarterly dates for all classes of bond.
All of the floating rate bonds are fully hedged using interest rate swaps.
The Class A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5 bonds rank pari passu in point of security and as to payment of interest and principal, and have preferential interest payment and repayment rights over the Class AB1 and Class B bonds.
The Class B1 and B2 bonds rank pari passu in point of security, principal repayment and interest payment.
The Class AB1 bonds rank pari passu in point of security and as to payment of interest and principal, and have preferential interest payment and repayment rights over the Class B bonds.
The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Greene King Retailing Limited, a group company.
These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions on its ability to move cash to other group companies.

co. uk 24 Financial instruments The primary treasury objectives of the group are to identify and manage the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business needs, and provide secure and competitively priced funding for the activities of the group.
If appropriate, the group uses financial instruments and derivatives to manage these risks.
The principal financial instruments held for the purpose of raising finance for operations are bank loans and overdraft, securitised bonds, cash and short-term deposits.
Other financial instruments arise directly from the operations of the group, such as trade receivables, payables, and trade loans.
Derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, are used to manage the interest rate risks related to the groups operations and financing sources.
No speculative trading in derivative financial instruments is undertaken.
The main risks from the groups financial instruments are cash flow risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The policy for managing each of these risks is set out below.
Interest rate risk Exposure to changes in interest rates on the groups borrowings is reviewed with regard to the maturity profile and cash flows of the underlying debt.
The group uses a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate debt with exposure to market interest rate fluctuations primarily arising from the floating rate instruments.
The group operates a policy that no less than 95% of the overall interest exposure should be hedged.
The group enters into interest rate swaps to manage the exposure.
The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges at the date of contract included within the accounts, and tested for effectiveness every six months.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by changes in interest rates.
This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio of fixed to floating interest rates, and on the basis of the hedging instruments in place at 28 April 2013 and 29 April 2012.
The analysis relates only to balances at these dates and is not representative of the year as a whole.
The following assumptions were made: balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt and deposits doesnot change as interest rates move: gains and losses are recognised within equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies of the group: and cash flow hedges were assumed to be effective or ineffective on the same basis as those as at the year end.
An explanation for the split between those hedges that were effective at the year end and those that were ineffective is detailed within the cash flow hedging note.
Based on the groups net position at the year end, a 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would change the groups profit before tax byapproximately 0.2m 2012: 0.1m and the groups equity by 106.1m 2012: 101.9m.
Liquidity risk The group mitigates liquidity risk by managing cash generated by its operations combined with bank borrowings and long-term debt.
Thegroups objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts and bank loans.
The group also monitors the maturity of financial liabilities to avoid the risk of a shortage of funds.
The standard payment terms that the company has with its suppliers is 60 days following month end 2012: 60 days following month end.
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interest-bearing deposit with maturities fixed at no more than 1 month.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of short-term borrowing on the money markets.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the groups financial liabilities at 28 April 2013 and 29 April 2012 based on contractual undiscounted payments including interest.

Receivable balances are also monitored on an on-going basis and provided against where deemed necessary to limit the exposure to bad debts to a non-significant level.
Other financial assets includes trade loans and cash.
Credit risk is the risk of default by the counterparty to discharge their obligation andthe maximum exposure of the group is the carrying amount of these instruments.
There is no requirement for collateral and there are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the group.
Cash flow hedging At 28 April 2013 the group held 4 2012: 4 interest rate swap contracts for a nominal value of 140m 2012: 140m, designated as a hedge of the cash flow interest rate risk of the 177.9m 2012: 206.6m draw-down from the variable credit facility in the year.
The interest rate swaps are held on the balance sheet as a fair value liability of 4.0m 2012: 2.4m.
The cash flows occurred semi-annually based on avariable rate of interest based on LIBOR.
At 28 April 2013 the group held 5 2012: 5 interest rate swap contracts for a nominal value of 667.9m 2012: 695.7m, entered into as part of the securitisation and subsequent securitisation taps.
A fair value liability of 235.2m 2012: 198.4m has been recognised on the balance sheet in respect of these contracts which are designated cash flow hedges against 667.9m 2012: 695.7m of variable rate bonds, receiving a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR and paying a weighted average fixed rate of 5.1% 2012: 5.1%.
The contract maturity dates are December 2034 and March 2036.
The bonds and interest rate swaps have the same critical terms.
Changes in cash flow hedge fair values are recognised in the hedging reserve to the extent that the hedges are effective.
In anticipation ofthe repurchase of the 60.0m AB1 bond post-year end the cash flow hedge in respect of this bond has ceased to be effective and hedge accounting has been discontinued.
Accordingly an exceptional cost of 28.2m has been recognised in respect of the fair value of the interest rate swap no longer qualifying for hedge accounting which has been recycled from equity to the income statement.
The remaining interest rate swaps have been assessed as highly effective during the period and are expected to remain highly effective overtheir remaining contract lives.
The percentage of debt that was fixed as at the year end was 98.6% 2012: 97.4% in line with the groups policy of fixing at least 95% of all debt.

The interest on fixed rate financial instruments is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
Investments, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables are not included above as they are non-interest bearing and are not subject to interest rate risk.
Fair values Set out in the table below is a comparison of carrying amounts and fair values of all of the groups financial instruments.
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation or sale.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: Cash and cash equivalents comprising cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits approximates to the carrying amount stated inthe accounts.
Financial assets these are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method and fair value is deemed to be the same as this.
Short-term loans and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.

In a previous period the group received a refund of 7.0m from HMRC in respect of VAT on gaming machines following a ruling that the application of VAT to certain gaming machines contravened the European Unions principle of fiscal neutrality.
HMRC have appealed against the ruling and last year the case was referred from the European Court of Justice back to UK courts.
We are awaiting their final decision.
If HMRCs appeal is upheld the refund of 7.0m and associated interest of 1.0m would become repayable.
