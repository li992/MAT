In addition, goodwill arises on the recognition of deferred tax liabilities in respect of intangible assets for which amortisation does not qualify for tax deductions.
The fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired are provisional pending the completion of the valuation exercises.
Final fair values will be incorporated in the 2014 combined financial statements.
There were no significant adjustments to the provisional fair values of prior year acquisitions established in 2012.
The businesses acquired in 2013 contributed 32m to revenue, increased adjusted operating profit by 9m, increased adjusted net profit by 9m, decreased reported net profit by 1m, and contributed a net cash outflow of 4m from operating activities for the part year under Reed Elsevier ownership and before taking account of acquisition financing costs.
Had the businesses been acquired at the beginning of the year, on a pro forma basis the Reed Elsevier revenues, adjusted operating profit, adjusted net profit attributable to parent companies shareholders and net profit attributable to parent companies shareholders for the year would have been 7,159m, 2,066m, 1,415m and 1,312m respectively before taking account of acquisition financing costs.
