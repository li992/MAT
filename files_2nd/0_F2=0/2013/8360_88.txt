FInAnCIAl rIsk MAnAGeMent Financial assets comprise trade and other receivables excluding construction contracts, prepaid and accrued income, long-term debtors and cash and deposits.
Financial assets and liabilities have fair values not materially different to the carrying values.
Financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables excluding construction contracts, accruals, deferred income and other tax and social security, bank borrowings, finance leases, loan notes, long-term creditors and interest rate hedges.
The Group has the following categories of financial assets and liabilities: 31 December 31 December 2013 2012 million million Loans and receivables Cash and deposits 79.7 76.8 Trade and other receivables excluding construction contracts, prepaid and accrued income 269.1 252.0 Total financial assets 348.8 328.8 31 December 2013 31 December 2012 other Derivatives other Derivatives financial used for financial used for liabilities hedging total liabilities hedging Total million million million million million million Bank loans and overdrafts and finance leases 118.3 - 118.3 51.0 - 51.0 Trade and other payables excluding construction contracts, accruals, deferred income and other tax and social security 297.8 - 297.8 253.4 - 253.4 Interest rate hedge non-PFI investments - 0.3 0.3 - 1.2 1.2 Total financial liabilities 416.1 0.3 416.4 304.4 1.2 305.6 Trade and other receivables and trade and other payables are held at amortised cost.
The directors consider these values to approximate their fair values.
The interest rate hedges are held at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are grouped into three levels based on the degree to which the fair value is observable, as defined by IFRS 13: - Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: - Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and - Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Classification of financial assets liabilities held at fair value according to the definitions set out in IFRS 13: 31 December 31 December 2013 2012 million million Level 2 0.3 1.2 Derivatives used for hedging financial liabilities are considered to be within the grouping referred to as Level 2.
Their fair values are calculated based on the valuation models operated by the relevant counterparty bank, based on market interest rates in force on the date of valuation.
no financial instruments have been transferred between Levels during the year.
Exposure to credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is managed by the Groups requirement to trade with counterparties with strong credit ratings as determined by international credit rating agencies.
The transactional banking requirements are met by local banks in each location with significant cash balances being remitted to Group treasury where short-term cash surpluses or cash not available for use by the Group is deposited with investment grade rated banks.

Gains and losses arising on retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of individual Group companies are recognised in the income statement.
The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage material currency exposures that arise on cashflows from sales or purchases not denominated in functional currencies immediately those sales or purchases are contracted.
Taking into account the effect of forward contracts, Group companies did not have a material exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses on monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at 31 December 2013.
The Group does not hedge anticipated future sales and purchases.
Gains and losses arising on the retranslation of foreign operations net assets into the consolidation currency are recognised directly in equity.
The Group does not hedge these translation differences.

b Market price risk - interest rate hedges The Group seeks to control its exposure to changes in interest rates by using interest rate swaps to limit the impact on the interest charge in the income statement.
Contracts in place at the year end were as follows: 31 December 2013 31 December 2012 nominal nominal value value million Maturity strike price million Maturity Strike price Interest rate swaps Current 20.0 2015 1.50% Current 30.0 2013 3.56% Current 10.0 2015 1.58% Deferred 20.0 2015 1.50% Deferred 10.0 2015 1.58% The fair value of interest rate hedges at 31 December 2013 is estimated at 0.3 million 2012: 1.2 million.
The contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and to the extent that the hedges are effective hedges, changes in their fair value are recognised directly in equity.
The fair values of the hedge instruments are calculated using computer valuation models operated by counterparty banks.
no charges have gone through the income statement in the year 2012: nil in respect of changes in the fair value of the hedges.
A gain of 0.8 million 2012: loss of 0.1 million was charged through other comprehensive income in respect to changes in fair value of the hedges.
The use of interest rate caps and swaps, where appropriate, diminishes the impact of an interest rate change.
The impact of a 1% change in interest rate to the Groups results is shown in the table below: 31 December 31 December 2013 2012 million million A 1% change in exchange rates results in: Change in profit 0.9 0.2 c Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables and investments, which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
To manage this risk, credit references are taken and where appropriate parent company guarantees are sought along with monthly monitoring of age and recoverability of trade receivables.
Apart from receivables due from customers related to HM Government, the Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a number of counterparties and customers.
