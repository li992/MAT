ACCOUnTinG pOliCieS, eSTimATeS AnD JUDGmenTS Accounting policies Morgan Advanced Materials plc the Company formerly The Morgan Crucible Company plc is a company incorporated in the uK.
The group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the group, and include the groups interest in associates.
The parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its group.
These consolidated financial statements have been drawn up to 31 December 2013.
The group maintains a 12-month calendar fiscal year ending on 31 December.
The group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial reporting Standards as adopted by the Eu adopted IFrSs.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent Company financial statements in accordance with uK generally Accepted Accounting practice: these are presented on pages 138 to 147.
Where possible the group has set out individual accounting policies in the note to the consolidated financial statements most relevant to that accounting policy.
Except for the changes set out in the adoption of new and revised standards section the accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these group financial statements.
a Measurement convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: derivative financial instruments and financial instruments available-for-sale.
b Functional and presentation currency The group financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Companys functional currency.
c Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
ii Associates Associates are those entities in which the Company has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost.
iii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the groups interest in the associate.
unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
d Foreign currency i Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to pounds sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to pounds sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
ii Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to pounds sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to pounds sterling at an average rate for the period where this approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation since the adoption of IFrS are recognised directly in other Comprehensive Income oCI.

ACCOUnTinG pOliCieS, eSTimATeS AnD JUDGmenTS continued Accounting policies continued e Impairment The carrying amounts of the groups assets, other than deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated see i below.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units group of units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit group of units on a pro-rata basis.
When a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset has been recognised directly in oCI and there is objective evidence that the asset is permanently impaired, the cumulative loss that had been recognised directly in oCI is recognised in profit or loss.
A significant or prolonged decline in an available-for-sale financial assets fair value below its cost is objective evidence of impairment.
The amount of the cumulative loss that is recognised in profit or loss is the difference between the acquisition cost and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss.
i Calculation of recoverable amount The recoverable amount of the groups investments in receivables carried at amortised cost is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate ie the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition of these financial assets.
receivables with a short duration are not discounted.
The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
ii Reversals of impairment An impairment loss in respect of a receivable carried at amortised cost and other assets not listed below is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
An impairment loss in respect of an investment in an equity instrument classified as available-for-sale is not reversed through profit or loss.
If the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss, the impairment loss shall be reversed, with the amount of the reversal recognised in profit or loss.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
f Revenue revenue from the sale of goods in the course of ordinary activities is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates.
revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
If it is probable that discounts will be granted and the amount can be measured reliably, then the discount is recognised as a reduction of revenue as the sales are recognised.
g Dividends Dividends payable are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared and approved.
Accounting estimates and judgments Judgments made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have a significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed below.
Management discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the groups critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
The following accounting estimates are subject to significant uncertainty: Provisions Note 22 contains information about provisions.
provisions for closure and restructuring costs, environmental issues and settlement of litigation are judgmental by their nature.

ACCOUnTinG pOliCieS, eSTimATeS AnD JUDGmenTS continued Recognition of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill Note 12 contains information about intangible assets recognised on acquisition.
These primarily relate to technology and trademarks and customer relationships, which are supported by long-term relationships with key customers.
The group has estimated that the customer relationships have an economic life of 15-20 years.
Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill Note 12 contains information about the assumptions relating to goodwill impairment tests, including a sensitivity analysis.
Credit risk Note 20 contains information about the groups exposure to credit risk, including a sensitivity analysis.
The group establishes both specific and general allowances for impairment losses against receivables.
The general loss allowance is estimated based on historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets.
Foreign currency exposure Note 20 contains information about the foreign currency exposure of the group and risks in relation to foreign exchange movements, including a sensitivity analysis.
Pension assumptions The principal actuarial assumptions applied to pensions are shown in note 21, including a sensitivity analysis.
The actuarial evaluation of pension assets and liabilities is based on assumptions in respect of inflation, future salary increases, discount rates, returns on investments and mortality rates.
relatively small changes in the assumptions underlying the actuarial valuations of pension schemes can have a significant impact on the net pension liability included in the balance sheet.
Taxation The level of current tax and deferred tax recognised is dependent on the tax rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and on subjective judgments as to the outcome of decisions to be made by the tax authorities in the various tax jurisdictions around the world in which the group operates.
Deferred tax assets are recognised based on managements assessment of the extent to which they are recoverable.
Going concern The groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic report on pages 4 to 45.
The financial position of the group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Strategic report.
In addition, note 20 includes the groups policies and processes for managing financial risk, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through local banking arrangements that are supported by the flexibility provided by the group bank facility of 150 million unsecured five-year multi-currency revolving credit facility.
The bank facility headroom at 31 December 2013 was 150 million.
The groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the group is able to operate within the level of its committed facilities.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual report and Accounts.
Adoption of new and revised standards IAS 19 revised Employee Benefits During the period, the group has applied IAS 19 revised Employee Benefits.
This has led to a restatement of the comparatives for 2012.
The impact on the group of the revised standard is as follows: Interest cost and expected return on assets were replaced by a net interest cost which is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit obligation.
pension scheme administration costs have been reclassified from net finance charge to operating costs.
Such costs include the ppF levy and actuary, audit, legal and trustee charges which, under the previous IAS 19, were allowed to be included within the net finance charge.
past service costs are recognised immediately instead of being accrued over the vesting period.
The impact of the changes was a 5.1 million reduction in profit for the period 2012: 4.2 million, as follows: i a 1.4 million increase in operating costs before restructuring costs and amortisation of intangible assets 2012: 1.1 million : ii a 4.3 million increase in net financing costs 2012: 3.6 million : iii a 0.6 million reduction in income tax expense 2012: 0.5 million.
The changes resulted in a 5.1 million increase in other comprehensive income excluding profit for the period 2012: 4.2 million.

ACCOUnTinG pOliCieS, eSTimATeS AnD JUDGmenTS continued Adoption of new and revised standards continued The above changes reduced basic diluted earnings per share for 2012 by 1.5 pence, with basic earnings per share reducing from 20.2 pence to 18.7 pence and diluted basic earnings per share reducing from 19.9 pence to 18.4 pence.
The impact of the changes on the balance sheet was a 0.2 million increase in the net employee benefits obligation.
The increase in operating costs resulted in a decrease in regional EbITA for the groups new reportable operating segments see note 3 as follows: North America 0.6 million 2012: 0.5 million and Europe 0.8 million 2012: 0.6 million.
Other accounting standards: on 1 January 2013, the group applied the following accounting standards and amendments issued by the IASb: Amendments to IFrS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
The application of these accounting standards has not had any significant impact on the reported results or financial position of the group.
New standards and interpretations A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, and have not been applied in preparing the group financial statements.
Those which may be relevant to the group are set out below.
The group has not applied these standards early and does not expect the application of these standards to have a material impact on the groups financial statements.
IFrS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements introduces a single control model to determine whether an investee should be consolidated.
The objective of IFrS 10 is to establish principles for the presentation and preparation of consolidated financial statements when an entity controls one or more other entities.
under IFrS 11 Joint Arrangements, the structure of the joint arrangement, although still an important consideration, is no longer the main factor in determining the type of joint arrangement and therefore the subsequent accounting.
IFrS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 2011 brings together into a single standard all the disclosure requirements about an entitys interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and unconsolidated structured entities.
IFrS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 2011 requires the disclosure of information about the nature, risks and financial effects of these interests.
These standards are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
ACqUiSiTiOnS AnD DiSpOSAlS Accounting policies Step acquisitions Step acquisitions arise when the group acquires control of an entity through successive share purchases.
The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired are recorded at fair value on the date that control is acquired.
For step acquisitions occurring before 3 January 2010 the amount recognised as goodwill or negative goodwill is determined separately for each tranche acquired, calculated as the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, in accordance with IFrS 3 Business Combinations 2004.
Any changes in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired between the acquisition date and the date that control is obtained are recorded in other reserves in equity to the extent that they have not previously been recognised in the income statement.
Any future step acquisitions would be accounted for in accordance with IFrS 3 Business Combinations 2008.

ACqUiSiTiOnS AnD DiSpOSAlS continued Acquisitions In 2007 the group acquired 49% of the ordinary share capital of Clearpower Limited, a company that, via two intermediary holding companies, owns 100% of Np Aerospace Limited.
on 5 January 2009 the group acquired the remaining 51% of the ordinary share capital of Clearpower Limited for a total of 56.8 million, an amount contingent on the future performance of Clearpower Limited.
This comprised 12.2 million in cash for 11% of the ordinary share capital and 44.6 million in discounted deferred contingent consideration for 40% of the ordinary share capital.
The discounted deferred contingent consideration took the form of four synthetic forwards each to acquire 10% of the ordinary share capital of Clearpower Limited at future dates from 2010 onwards, the amount of which are based on a fixed EbITDA multiple of Clearpower Limited.
on 1 April 2010 the group agreed to pay 24.9 million.
of this amount 17.2 million related to the first of the four synthetic forwards noted above.
The remaining payment of 7.7 million related to deferred contingent consideration on the acquisition of 11% of Clearpower Limited in 2009.
12.4 million of the total was deferred for payment until 6 July 2010.
In addition to these payments the group paid 2.3 million to the Employee benefit Trust in accordance with the terms of the original acquisition agreement.
on 31 March 2011 and 28 March 2012 the group paid 9.1 million and 6.1 million respectively for the second and third synthetic forwards.
In addition to these payments on 31 March 2011 and 28 March 2012 the group paid 0.8 million and 0.6 million respectively to the Employee benefit Trust in accordance with the terms of the original acquisition agreement.
At 31 December 2013 the group anticipates acquiring the remaining 10% of Clearpower Limited for nil consideration and therefore has not recognised a liability for this.
The adjustment through goodwill since the date of acquisition as a result of the remeasurement is 9.6 million.
on 1 February 2013 the group purchased the remaining 25% of the share capital of beijing Morgan Ceramics Co. Ltd bMC not already held by the group for 0.3 million.
As a result the group now owns 100% of the share capital of bMC.
The adjustment to the non-controlling interest component of equity due to this transaction was 0.6 million.
During 2013 the group also made adjustments to goodwill purchase consideration totalling 3.7 million relating to historic acquisitions, for which IFrS 3 Business Combinations 2004 applied.
Disposals on 28 December 2013 the group disposed of 23.85% of the share capital of Assam Carbon products Ltd for nil consideration.
Details of this disposal are given in note 6 to the financial statements.
Other acquisitions in 2013 and 2012 There were no other business combinations in 2013 and 2012.

TAxATiOn inCOme TAx expenSe Accounting policies Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in oCI, in which case it is recognised in oCI.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

12. inTAnGible ASSeTS Accounting policies i Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is tested annually for impairment.
ii Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the group has sufficient resources to complete development, use and sale of products or processes.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and impairment losses.
other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
iii Other intangible assets other intangible assets that are acquired by the group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and impairment losses.
iv Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.

The table below shows restated comparative figures for the cash-generating units for the year ended 31 December 2012.
The restatements reflect the impact of changes the group made to its internal organisation changes during the year ended 31 December 2013, which caused the composition of its cash-generating units to change.
Assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or cash-generating units, primarily based on geographical basis to reflect this new structure.
goodwill is attributed to each cash-generating unit as follows: 2012 2013 restated m m North America 77.5 80.8 Europe 45.8 47.5 Asia rest of World 43.9 46.4 Composites and Defence Systems 16.4 16.4 183.6 191.1 Each cash-generating unit is assessed for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment.
As part of the annual impairment test review the carrying value of goodwill has been assessed with reference to its value in use, reflecting the projected discounted cash flows of each cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated.
The key assumptions used in determining value in use relate to growth rates and discount rates.
The cash flow projections in year one are based on budgeted operating results for the forthcoming year.
growth rates for the period not covered by budgets are specific to each cash-generating unit, ranging from 1.0% to 5.0% 2012: 2.0% to 5.0%.
The growth rates are also used to calculate a terminal value.
These growth rates reflect the products, industries and countries in which the operating segments operate.
These mediumto long-term growth rates have been reviewed by management during 2013 and are considered to be appropriate.
In 2013 the group has used the following pre-tax discount rates for calculating the terminal value of each of the new cash-generating units: North America 12.2%, Europe: 12.9%, Asia rest of World: 15.1%, Composites and Defence Systems: 12.4%.
These discount rates have been used as the group believes it suitably approximates the rates used by end-market participants.
In 2012 the group used a standard pre-tax discount rate of 13.3% for all of the groups former cash-generating units.
The Directors have considered the following individual sensitivities and are confident that no impairment would arise in any of the following three circumstances: if the pre-tax discount rate was increased by 1,100bps for each of the North America, Europe and Asia rest of World cash-generating units.
For Composites and Defence Systems no impairment would arise if the pre-tax discount rate was increased by 340bps: if no growth was assumed for years two to five and in the calculation of terminal value: and if the cash flow projections of all businesses were reduced by 25% 2012: 15%.
During the year ended 31 December 2013 the group recognised an impairment loss of 1.6 million on goodwill in relation to Morgan AM&T hairong Ltd, which was identified when undertaking the exercise to review the composition of the cash-generating units following the internal organisation changes.
It also recognised an impairment loss of 0.3 million on customer relationships and 1.4 million of technology and trademarks in relation to Morgan AM&T hairong Ltd. Further details are given in note 6.

Accounting policies Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Finance lease payments Leases where the group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases as if the asset had been purchased outright.
Assets acquired under finance leases are recognised as assets of the group and the capital elements of the leasing commitments are shown as obligations in creditors.
Depreciation is charged on a basis consistent with similar owned assets or over the lease term if shorter.
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

FinAnCiAl riSk mAnAGemenT This note presents information about the groups exposure to a variety of financial risks: credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, and the groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
Accounting policies Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group Financial instruments issued by the group are treated as equity ie forming part of shareholders funds only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: they include no contractual obligations upon the group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the group: and where the instrument will or may be settled in the Companys own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Companys own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Companys own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called-up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses.
Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the groups receivables from customers and investment securities.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: Carrying amount 2013 2012 m m Available-for-sale financial assets 2.7 3.9 Trade and other receivables 167.5 165.5 Cash and cash equivalents 76.0 80.0 246.2 249.4 Available-for-sale financial assets The group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a sound credit rating.
given these high credit ratings, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.

FinAnCiAl riSk mAnAGemenT continued Trade and other receivables The groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the groups customer base, including the default risk of the industries and countries in which customers operate, has less influence on credit risk.
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount.
The group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
The group serves thousands of customers.
Many of these have purchased the same product for several years and in some cases decades.
others have modified and enhanced designs or adopted the same components into new products, extending the lifecycle of the components that the group supplies.
The groups level of customer retention is very high, particularly with its major accounts, and, although the top 20 ranking will alter from year-to-year, many of the names remain consistent over time.
The group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments.
The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was: Gross Impairment gross Impairment 2013 2013 2012 2012 m m m m Not past due 121.7 0.4 125.5 0.5 past due 0-30 days 27.0 0.3 21.6 0.4 past due 31-60 days 9.2 0.4 8.9 0.5 past due 61-90 days 11.5 3.9 13.6 3.9 past due more than 90 days 11.2 8.1 8.5 7.3 180.6 13.1 178.1 12.6 The only movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables was an increase of 0.5 million 2012: 3.3 million.
A specific impairment allowance may be created in respect of an individual trade receivable for which full recovery is doubtful.
As at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 there were no specific impairment allowances that were significant to the group.
The allowances in the accounts in respect of trade receivables are used to record impairment losses unless the group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is possible: at the point the amount is considered irrecoverable it is written off against the financial asset directly.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash balances held by companies representing over 75% of the groups revenue are managed centrally through a number of pooling arrangements.
Cash balances throughout the group are held with high-credit-quality financial institutions.
liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by cash.
The groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions.
The group seeks a balance between certainty of funding and a flexible, cost-effective borrowing structure.
The policy is to ensure that the group has sufficient liquidity available to meet all foreseeable needs.

The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The group buys and sells derivatives in the ordinary course of business for hedging purposes, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks.
All such transactions are carried out in accordance with the Treasury policy, which has been approved by the Audit Committee.
generally the group seeks to apply hedge accounting in order to manage volatility in profit or loss.
interest rate risk At the reporting date the interest rate profile of the groups interest-bearing financial instruments was: Fixed rate instruments carrying amount 2013 2012 m m Fixed rate instruments Financial assets Financial liabilities 262.3 271.1 262.3 271.1 Variable rate instruments carrying amount 2013 2012 m m Variable rate instruments Financial assets 76.0 80.0 Financial liabilities 0.9 2.7 75.1 77.3 Interest rate risk is regularly monitored and reviewed taking into account the groups overall borrowing costs, interest cover ratio and the relevant interest rate markets.
The fixed rate financial liabilities comprise the currency equivalent of 261.6 million 2012: 270.1 million of uS private placement Debt.
The average cost of the groups fixed rate debt is 5.6% 2012: 5.7%.
An increase of 100 basis points in interest rates on the variable element of the groups net debt at the reporting date would have increased profit by 0.7 million 2012: 0.8 million.
A decrease of 100 basis points would have decreased profit by 0.5 million 2012: 0.4 million.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.

FinAnCiAl riSk mAnAGemenT continued Foreign currency risk The table below shows the groups currency exposures, being exposures on currency transactions that give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating company involved, other than certain non-gbp borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in overseas entities.

The group aims to hedge all material trade receivables and trade payables denominated in a foreign currency.
At any point in time the group also hedges up to 75% of its estimated foreign currency exposure in respect of forecasted sales and purchases over the following 12 months.
The group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency risk.
Almost all of the forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities held in currencies other than the currency of the reporting unit, the group ensures that the net exposure is kept to an acceptable level, by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates where necessary to address short-term imbalances.
The group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts used as hedges of forecasted transactions at 31 December 2013 was an asset of 0.8 million 2012: asset of 1.0 million.
The contractual cash flows associated with the forward exchange contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges are shown in the section on liquidity risk.
The impact on profit or loss is expected to occur at the same time as the associated cash flows.
The group maintains in-country local currency borrowings, and has designated certain forward foreign exchange contracts and other borrowings as hedges of the foreign exchange risk associated with investments in foreign operations.
In this way, the group seeks to manage the translation exposure of overseas net assets, but only to the extent that its gearing covenant under the terms of its loan documents, as well as its facility headroom, are likely to remain comfortably within limits, and provided the associated costs are not prohibitive.
The groups currency split of total borrowings after the impact of net investment hedges was as follows: 2013 2012 m m gbp 6.6 4.6 uSD 196.2 205.6 51.4 49.8 Japanese yen 8.0 10.0 other 0.3 2.8 262.5 272.8 The groups sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates on financial assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2013 is as follows: based upon the currency profile of the groups net financial assets and liabilities, if gbp had strengthened by 10%, reported equity would have increased by 18.1 million 2012: 18.9 million.
Conversely, if gbp had weakened by 10%, reported equity would have reduced by 22.1 million 2012: 22.7 million.
Assuming the change occurred on the balance sheet date, there would be no impact on reported profit.
The impact of a weakening in gbp on the groups financial assets and liabilities would be more than offset in equity and income by its impact on the groups overseas net assets and earnings respectively.
based on the 2013 results, if in isolation the uSD average exchange rate for 2013 were 10% weaker, reported revenue and profit before tax would be 33.4 million 2012: 34.0 million and 3.8 million 2012: 3.5 million lower.
based on the 2013 results, if in isolation the Eur average exchange rate for 2013 were 10% weaker, reported revenue and profit before tax would be 21.2 million 2012: 21.4 million and 2.7 million 2012: 2.8 million lower.

FinAnCiAl riSk mAnAGemenT continued Other market price risk Equity price risk arises from available-for-sale equity securities held for meeting partially the unfunded portion of the groups defined benefit pension obligations.
The primary goal of the groups investment strategy is to maximise returns in order to meet partially the groups unfunded defined benefit obligations.
Capital management The boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base total equity so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The board uses a number of measures, identified as key performance indicators KpI, to ensure the continued success of the group.
The main KpI for the group is the underlying operating profit margin.
The aim is to achieve mid-teen margins in good times and double-digit margins when the environment is more challenging.
The board encourages employees of the group to hold the Companys ordinary shares.
The group operates a number of employee share and share option schemes.
From time to time the Company purchases its own shares on the market: the timing of these purchases depends on market prices.
primarily the shares are intended to be used for issuing shares under the groups various share option incentive schemes.
The board seeks to maintain a balance between the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position, and the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings.
The group monitors capital using the following indicators: Debt to adjusted capital 2013 2012 m m Total interest-bearing loans and borrowings 262.5 272.8 Less: cash and cash equivalents and overdrafts 76.0 80.0 Net debt 186.5 192.8 Total equity 274.1 271.8 Less: amounts accumulated in equity relating to cash flow hedges 0.6 0.7 Adjusted capital 273.5 271.1 Debt to adjusted capital ratio 0.7 0.7 net debt to ebiTDA 2012 2013 restated m m Net debt to EbITDA 186.5 192.8 operating profit before specific adjusting items and restructuring costs 110.7 113.7 Depreciation and amortisation 37.6 38.3 EbITDA 148.3 152.0 Net debt to EbITDA ratio 1.3x 1.3x interest cover 2012 2013 restated m m EbITDA 148.3 152.0 Net finance costs excluding IAS 19 pension and discount on deferred consideration 17.0 16.9 Interest cover 8.7x 9.0x Net debt is defined as interest-bearing loans and borrowings, bank overdrafts less cash and cash equivalents.

equity securities Fair value is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are marked to market either using listed market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price and deducting the current spot rate.
interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
The interest rates used to determine the fair value of loans and borrowings are 2.1-4.1% 2012: 2.0-5.2% and finance leases 6.0% 2012: 6.0%.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease agreements.
The estimated fair values reflect changes in interest rates.
Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
All other receivables payables are discounted to determine the fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other payables and loans and receivables The group has disclosed the fair value of cash and cash equivalents, current loans and receivables and current payables at their carrying amount, given their notional amount is deemed to be their fair value.

ii Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan is any retirement plan which is not a defined contribution plan.
Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of retirement benefit that an employee will receive, usually depending on one or more factors such as age, years of service and earnings.
The groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA-credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
When the calculation results in a benefit to the group, the recognised asset is limited to the total of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
An economic benefit is available to the group if it is realisable during the life of the plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities.
remeasurement gains and losses, differences between the expected and actual returns, and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in oCI in the year in which they arise.
iii Long-term service benefits The groups net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than pension plans, is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method, or similar approximation, and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any related assets is deducted.
iv Share-based payment transactions The grant date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market performance conditions are met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
employee benefits The group operates a number of defined benefit arrangements as well as defined contribution plans.
The defined benefit plans are primarily in the uK, uSA and Europe and predominantly provide pensions based on service and career-average pay.
In addition post-retirement medical plans are operated in the uSA.

The two uK Schemes provide a benefit based upon an employees total service, and their career average earnings including allowance for Consumer price Inflation, although historically benefits were based upon an employees final salary.
once in payment, pensions receive increases as set out in the rules, at either a fixed level, or in line with the retail price Index.
The overall duration of the uK Schemes is around 16 years.
The uK Schemes assets are held in trustee-administered funds which are governed by uK regulations, as is the nature of the relationship between the group and the Trustees.
responsibility for the governance of the uK Schemes including investment decisions and contribution schedules lies with the board of Trustees, which must consult with the Company on such matters.
The board of Trustees must be composed of representatives of the Company, plan participants and an independent trustee in accordance with the uK schemes governing documents.
Funding legislation in the uK requires that schemes are fully funded on a scheme-specific basis as measured, and this must be assessed at least every three years.
To the extent that there is a deficit against this measure, a payment schedule must be agreed such that the deficit is removed over a period of time, typically around 10 years.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the uK Schemes were undertaken as at April 2011 and resulted in combined assessed deficits of 23 million.
on the basis of these full valuations, the Trustees of the uK Schemes, having consulted with the group, agreed past service deficit recovery payments totalling 5.5 million a year in 2013, increasing by 2.75% pa until 2021 and contributions in respect of future service as accrued.
New full valuations are currently in progress with effective dates of April 2013, and the Trustees are currently consulting with the group regarding the outcome of these valuations.
The outcome of those consultations will determine the groups future contribution requirements, with any new deficit arising needing to be met through the payment of additional contributions.
The uK Schemes were closed to new entrants on 1 August 2011, with any new employees receiving benefits through the Morgan group personal pension plan, a defined contribution arrangement.
US schemes In the uS, the group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes the uS Schemes.
The majority of these are qualified arrangements for tax purposes, although the group also operates a Supplemental Executive retirement plan SErp which is not tax approved.
With the exception of the SErp, the uS Schemes are all frozen, with employees accruing benefits within a 401k arrangement.
The uS Schemes provide a benefit based upon an employees service and earnings.
The benefits are level both prior to, and whilst in, payment.
overall, the uS Schemes duration is around 12 years.
The qualified uS Schemes assets are held in a trust separately from the groups assets.
For the SErp the group holds an asset to meet the obligations, however due to its nature this is accounted for as a group asset, rather than an asset of the SErp.
responsibility for the governance of the uS Schemes, including investment decisions and contribution schedules, lies with a management committee, all of whose members are appointed by the group.
The funding requirements in the uS, ErISA, require schemes to be fully funded at all times, and if not to target full funding within a period of seven years.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the uS Schemes were undertaken as at 1 January 2013 and resulted in combined assessed deficits of 26.1 million.
on the basis of these valuations, the group made a 9.2 million payment in 2013 and will make payments of 6.4 million in 2014, 3.2 million in 2015 and a total of 8.6 million over the following five years.
European schemes In Europe, the group operates a number of retirement schemes, with the bulk of the obligations relating to arrangements for employees in germany.
In line with local practice these arrangements are not funded for in advance, with benefits met by the group as they fall due.

The principal assumptions are the discount rate and inflation assumptions which are long-term and are measured on external factors, based upon each plans duration.
In addition to these, the mortality assumption in the uK and uS is material to the cost of the promised benefits.
In both the uK and Europe, the assumed increases in salaries and pensions in payment are derived from assumed future inflation.

In placing a current estimate on the groups past service benefit obligations, a number of assumptions about the future are required.
For defined benefit schemes, the Directors make annual estimates and assumptions in respect of discount rates, future changes in salaries, employee turnover, inflation rates and life expectancy.
In making these estimates and assumptions, the Directors consider advice provided by external advisers, such as actuaries.
The accounting assumptions noted above are used to calculate the year-end net pension liability in accordance with the relevant accounting standard, IAS 19 revised Employee Benefits.
Changes in these assumptions have no impact on the groups cash payments to their arrangements.
The payments due are calculated based on local funding requirements, or in the case of the groups unfunded arrangements on the incidence of benefit payments falling due.
The sensitivities of the groups net balance sheet to the principal assumptions are: 2013 2012 Increase Increase effect effect Change in assumption m m Discount rate Decrease by 0.1% 7.8 7.7 Inflation Increase by 0.1% 3.8 3.4 Mortality post-retirement pensioners live 1 year longer 15.1 12.5 Exchange rates gbp weakens against uSD by 10% 4.4 7.0 gbp weakens against Eur by 10% 3.1 3.2 These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in the net balance sheet in isolation, and assuming no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date.
This is unlikely in practice for example, a change in discount rate is unlikely to occur without any movement in the value of the assets held by the groups schemes.

The calculation of the surplus or deficit depends, therefore, on factors which are beyond the control of the group principally the value at the balance sheet date of equity shares in which the scheme has invested and long-term interest rates which are used to discount future liabilities.
The funding of the scheme is based on long-term trends and assumptions relating to market growth, as advised by qualified actuaries and investment advisers.
Investment returns: The groups net balance sheet, and contribution requirements, are heavily dependent upon the return on the assets invested in by the schemes.
Longevity: The cost to the group of the pensions promised to members is dependent upon the expected term of these payments.
To the extent that members live longer than expected this will increase the cost of these arrangements.
Inflation rate risk: In the uK, the pension promises are, in the main, linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The above risks have been mitigated for a large proportion of the uK Schemes population through the purchase of an insurance policy, the payments from which exactly match the promises made to employees.
remaining investment risks have also been mitigated to some extent by diversification of the return seeking assets and backing uninsured pensioner liabilities by bonds.
In addition, the IAS 19 defined benefit obligation is linked to yields on AA-rated corporate bonds, however the majority of the groups arrangements invest in a number of other assets which will move in a different manner from these bonds.
Therefore, changes in market conditions may lead to volatility in the net pension liability on the groups balance sheet and in other comprehensive income, and to a lesser extent in the IAS 19 pension expense in the groups income statement.

There were no changes to the performance conditions of the LTIp awards granted to the CEo, CFo and non-Divisional employees in 2012.

For the 2012 LTIp awards granted to other executives in the former Morgan Ceramics and Morgan Engineered Materials Divisions in 2012, it was decided that a single set of group performance metrics should apply to these participants.
The single set of group performance metrics blends the performance metrics originally set for the two Divisions over the performance period as set out below.
The group performance metrics are split into compound annual growth EbITA and group average roCE.
Vesting only occurs when group performance exceeds the threshold performance metrics under both measures.

Details of the original 2012 LTIP performance metrics for other executives in the former Morgan Ceramics and Morgan Engineered Materials Divisions are set out below: For the Coo who, at the time of the award, was CEo Morgan Ceramics, 1 3 of the award was to vest on relative TSr, with the remaining 2 3 to vest on a Divisional EbITA roCE matrix.
For the EbITA roCE element, there would have been no vesting unless EbITA growth in Morgan Ceramics was at least 6% pa and roCE is 41% in 2014: full vesting would have occurred for EbITA growth of 15% pa and roCE of 43.5%.
For LTIp awards granted to executives in the former Morgan Ceramics Division in 2012, 100% of awards were based on Morgan Ceramics Divisional performance, between the 2011 base financial year and the 2014 financial year: Divisional EBITA % of award that vests Divisional average ROCE % of award that vests 15% pa 50% 43.5% 50% 6% pa 15% 41% 15% 6% pa Nil 41% Nil For LTIp awards granted to executives in the former Morgan Engineered Materials Division in 2012, 100% of awards were based on Morgan Engineered Materials Divisional performance, between the 2011 base financial year and the 2014 financial year: Divisional EBITA % of award that vests Divisional average ROCE % of award that vests 15% pa 50% 37.10% 50% 5% pa 15% 34.70% 15% 5% pa Nil 34.7% Nil MorgAN ADVANCED MATErIALS ANNuAL rEporT 2013 ANNuAL rEporT 2013 MorgAN ADVANCED MATErIALS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 133 21. emplOyee beneFiTS continued 2013 lTip Awards For LTIp awards granted to all participants in 2013, the extent to which 33% of the awards vest depends on the Companys TSr ranking against an appropriate comparator group over the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015.

The best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation is the amount that an entity would rationally pay to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period or to transfer it to a third party at that time.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
i Restructuring A provision for restructuring is recognised when the group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly.
Future operating costs are not provided for.
ii Onerous contracts A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
iii Environmental In accordance with the groups Environmental policy a provision is recognised for known environmental issues which the group will rectify over the next few years.
