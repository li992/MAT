The LTIP measures performance targets over athree year period.
Options will normally vest, subject to performance targets being achieved, on thethird anniversary of the date of grant at a nominal cost to the employee.
Employees who leave with a right to exercise options must normally wait until the end of the measurement period.
If the option vests, the employee will receive an entitlement which normally will betime apportioned for the period from the start of the measurement period to the date on which employment ended.
Options granted in 2013 to executive directors and band 1 executives are subject to three performance conditions, compound annual growth in 1 1 underlying earnings per share EPS, return on capital employed ROCE and relative Total Shareholder Return TSR, in the proportion 33 3%, 33 3% and 1 33 3%, respectively.
Options granted in 2013 to other senior management are subject to two performance conditions, 2 1 EPS and ROCE, in the proportion 66 3% and 33 3% respectively.
These options are either equity settled or cash settled depending on the seniority of the employee.
Options granted in 2011, 2012 and 2013 include a dividend equivalent element whereby employees will be entitled to receive, in cash, the notional dividends paid during the measurement period on any options that vest.
For further details of the LTIP refer to the directors remuneration report.
ESOS Prior to 2009, annual grants of options over ordinary shares were made to certain senior management.

Noperformance targets were set for the 2007 and 2008 grants.
Options are exercisable three years after grant date and expire ten yearsafter grantdate.
The exercise price was set at market value using the market price of a Rexam share at the grant date.
Phantoms This cash settled scheme operates in the same way as the ESOS scheme and relates to certain senior management located outside the UK and Europe.
SAYE All employee SAYE schemes are open to eligible employees resident in the UK and Ireland.

Historical volatilities are arrived at using a period comparable with the expected life of the option.
The correlation coefficient for LTIP is calculated using the correlation matrix for the TSR simulation using threeyear daily historical stock price series for each company in the comparator group, including Rexam, from the beginning of the measurement period.
