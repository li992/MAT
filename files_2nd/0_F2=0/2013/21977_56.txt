The carrying amounts are included in the group balance sheet under the indicated headings.
The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of financial assets and liabilities are as follows: the carrying amount of investments classied as loans and receivables equates to fair value due to the short maturity of the investments held the carrying amount of trade receivables and payables approximates to their fair values due to the short maturity of amounts receivable and payable the fair value of the groups bonds and other long-term borrowings are estimated on the basis of quoted market prices for the same or similar issues with the same maturities where they exist, and on calculations of the value of future cash ows using the approximate discount rates in effect at the balance sheet date, where market prices of similar issues do not exist the fair value of the groups outstanding swaps and foreign exchange contracts are estimated using discounted cash ow models and market rates of interest and foreign exchange at the balance sheet date.

Financial instruments and risk management continued Fair value hierarchy Financial instruments measured at fair value at 31 March 2013 consist of derivative financial instruments and investments classied as available-for-sale or designated at fair value through profit and loss under IAS 39 and are further analysed by the level of valuation input.
The three levels of valuation methodology used are: Level 1 uses quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 uses inputs for the asset or liability other than quoted prices, that are observable either directly or indirectly Level 3 uses inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data, such as internal models or other valuation methods.
Derivative financial instruments The fair value of the groups outstanding derivative financial assets and liabilities consisted of swaps and foreign exchange contracts and were estimated using discounted cash ow models and market rates of interest and foreign exchange at the balance sheet date.
All derivative financial instruments are categorised at Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Investments Non-current investments analysed at Level 1 consisted of listed available-for-sale investments of 45m 2011 12: 50m and listed investments of 11m 2011 12: 10m designated at fair value through profit and loss.
The groups listed investments were measured at fair value using quoted market prices for identical assets.
530m 2011 12: 505m of current asset available-for-sale investments were measured using Level 2 valuation methods.
The fair value of 8m 2011 12: 31m of non-current investments classied as available-for-sale was determined using Level 3 valuation methods.
A reconciliation of the movements in balances measured using Level 3 valuation methods is presented below: Other investments m At 1 April 2011 and 1 April 2012 31 Disposals 23 At 31 March 2013 8 There were no losses recognised in the income statement in respect of Level 3 assets held at 31 March 2013.
Hedging activities Our hedging policies use derivative financial instruments to manage financial risk.
Derivatives that are held as hedging instruments are formally designated as hedges as defined in IAS 39.
Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes if they meet the criteria for designation as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges in accordance with IAS 39.
Fair value hedges Fair value hedges principally consist of interest rate and cross-currency swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair value of fixed-rate, long-term financial instruments due to movements in market interest rates.
Gains and losses arising on fair value hedges are disclosed in note 23.

Financial instruments and risk management continued Cash ow hedges Cash flow hedges principally consist of interest rate and cross-currency swaps that are used to hedge the variability in future interest and currency cash flows on assets and liabilities which bear interest at variable rates and or are in a foreign currency.
Forward foreign currency contracts are used to hedge anticipated and committed future currency cash flows.
Where these contracts qualify for hedge accounting they are designated as cash flow hedges.
