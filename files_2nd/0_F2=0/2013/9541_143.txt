01 Strategic Report 02 Governance 03 Financial Statements 04 A Deeper Look 05 Shareholder Information Lonmin Plc 175 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 A Deeper Look Reserves & Resources Revisions to the South African Mineral Resource estimates were confined to the Marikana and Pandora properties.
The Akanani, Limpopo and Loskop Mineral Resources were unchanged during 2013.
The Mineral Resources at Marikana excluding tailings increased by 3.9 Moz of 3PGE Au in 2013.
This increase is attributed to the extension of the Inferred Mineral Resources of 2.5 Moz and Indicated Mineral Resources of 2.0 Moz which was offset by a decrease of Measured Mineral Resources.
Measured Mineral Resources decreased by 0.6 Moz 3PGE Au.
Mining depletion accounted for a decrease of 1.5 Moz which was offset by an increase of 0.9 Moz converted from Indicated Mineral Resources.
There were no material changes in geological losses at Marikana.
The decrease of 0.05 Moz 3PGE Au to the Pandora Mineral Resource was due to mining depletion.
No revisions were made to the Mineral Resources in Sudbury and Kenya during 2013.
The following revisions to the Marikana Mineral Reserves were made in 2013, there being no changes to the Limpopo Reserves: The focus at Marikana in 2013 was on ore reserve management which resulted in an increase of 0.4 Moz 3PGE Au Proved Mineral Reserves compared with 2012.
The total UG2 Reef and Merensky Reef Mineral Reserves increased by 1.6 Moz to 42.9 Moz of 3PGE Au due to an increase in the Probable Mineral Reserves at K4 Shaft Merensky Reef as well as the inclusion of 0.7 Moz 3PGE from the Eastern Platinum Number One tailings dam.
A summary of the changes to Lonmins Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves are shown in the following tables and should be read in conjunction with the Key Assumptions section of this report.
Detailed breakdowns of these Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves into their respective confidence categories can be found in the sections specific to the individual areas.
Mineral Resources are reported Inclusive of Mineral Reserves.
3 Loskop and Sudbury PGM JV exclude Rh, due to insufficient assays, and therefore 2PGE Au are reported.
Tailings Dam exclude Au, due to assay values below laboratory detection limit, and therefore are reported as 3PGE.
4 Quantities and grades have been rounded to one or two decimal places, therefore minor computational errors may occur.

Key assumptions pertaining to the 2013 Lonmin Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Statement Mineral Resources are reported inclusive of Mineral Reserves.
Mineral Resources that are converted to Mineral Reserves are also included in the Mineral Resource statement.
All Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves quoted reflect Lonmins attributable portion only.
There have been no changes in the percentage attributable to Lonmin during the year.
The following percentages were applied to the total Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve for each property: Limpopo Limpopo Baobab & Sudbury Marikana Dwaalkop JV Doornvlei Akanani Pandora JV Loskop JV PGM JV Lonmin Attributable 82% 41% 82% 74% 34.85% 41% 50% Incwala Resources, Lonmins BEE partner, owns 18% of both Western Platinum Limited and Eastern Platinum Limited, and 26% of Akanani.
Lonmins 23.56% holding in the share capital of Incwala does not factor in the calculations of its attributable interest.
Limpopo includes Dwaalkop JV, which is a JV between Mvelaphanda Resources 50% and Western Platinum 50% that is managed by Lonmin.
Eastern Platinum Limited has an attributable interest of 42.5% in the Pandora JV together with Anglo Platinum 42.5%, Mvelaphanda Resources 7.5% and the Bapo Ba Mogale Mining Company 7.5%.
Western Platinum Limited has an attributable interest of 50% in the Loskop JV together with Boynton Investments 50%.
Lonmins share of the Sudbury PGM JV is currently a nominal 50%, of the product from any PGE deposit developed on the participating properties.
The agreement is that Lonmin will be allocated its pro-rata share in PGEs and Vale will be allocated its pro-rata share in Nickel, Copper, Cobalt, Gold and Silver.
The exchange of metals will be governed by prevailing metal prices at the time of the refined metal production.
Lonmin has a 49% attributable portion of the Bumbo Mineral Resource in terms of The West Kenya Earn-in and Joint Venture Agreement between African Barrick Gold Limited and AfriOre International Barbados Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lonmin Plc.
Where grades are reported as 3PGE Au these are a summation of the Platinum, Palladium, Rhodium and Gold grades.
Modelling of available assay information, obtained from drillhole core, indicates that the proportion of 3PGE Au contained in 5PGE Au, which includes Ruthenium and Iridium, is approximately as follows: UG2 Merensky Platreef Marikana 0.81 0.92 Marikana Tailings 0.78 Limpopo 0.86 0.93 Akanani 0.95 Pandora 0.81 01 Strategic Report 02 Governance 03 Financial Statements 04 A Deeper Look 05 Shareholder Information Lonmin Plc 177 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 A Deeper Look Reserves & Resources Where Nickel Ni and Copper Cu grade estimates are derived from sufficient reliable information for the various Mineral Resources, they are reported as average grades in percent.
These grades represent acid soluble proportions.
Acid soluble percentages of Ni and Cu are closely correlated to the metals present as sulphide minerals.
Mineral Resources are reported as in-situ tonnes and grade and allow for geological losses such as faults, dykes, potholes and Iron Rich Ultramafic Pegmatite.
Mineral Resources are estimated using a minimum true width of at least 90 cm and therefore may include some diluting material.
Proved and Probable Mineral Reserves are reported as tonnes and grade expected to be delivered to the mill, are inclusive of diluting materials and allow for losses that may occur when the material is mined.
Tailings dams are residual deposits comprised of the rejected material from the process that converts ore into concentrate.
Lonmins tailings dams contain quantities of PGEs, base metals and chromium.
Lonmin has historically and continues to assess the metal content and economic viability of reprocessing the metals in its tailings dams, and thus these residual deposits continue to form part of its future Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves.
Lonmin is currently assessing the Eastern Platinum Limited Number 1 tailings dam ETD1 dam that was formed from UG2 Reef tailings.
ETD1 is located within the Eastern Platinum mining right area.
A Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimate of the ETD1 has been included.
The remaining tailing dams will be considered as and when the appropriate assessments take place.
For economic studies and the determination of pay limits, consideration was made of both short and long-term revenue drivers.
The following long-term global assumptions were used: Precious Metals per Troy Ounce : Pt USD1,865, Pd USD888, Rh USD1,348, Ru USD95, Ir USD630, Au USD1,385.
Base Metals per metric tonne : Ni USD14,890, Cu USD7,233.
Average exchange rate of USD1 to ZAR9.0.
Dilutions are quoted as waste tonnes waste ore tonnes in percent.
Bumbo Mineral Resources are reported using a cut-off grade of 0.7% copper equivalent.
The copper equivalent formula for Bumbo was based upon commodity prices at the close of the market on 25 July 2011, namely: Copper: USD9,633 tonne $Cu Zinc: USD2,441 tonne $Zn Gold: USD1,614 ounce $Au Silver: USD40 ounce $Ag The copper equivalent CuEq is as follows: CuEq % Cu% Zn% $Zn 100 $Cu 100 Au g t $Au 31.1034768 $Cu 100 Ag g t $Ag 31.1034768 $Cu 100 Unless otherwise stated, the Lonmin Mineral Resources and Reserves estimates were prepared or supervised by various persons employed by Lonmin.
