Retirement benefit schemes The Group has accounted for pensions in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes and defined contribution schemes.
The pension charge for the year ended 31 December 2013 excluding joint ventures, was 108.6m 2012: 85.5m.
34 a Defined benefit schemes The Group operates defined benefit schemes for qualifying employees of its subsidiaries in UK and Europe.
The assets of the funded schemes are held independently of the Groups assets in separate trustee administered funds.
The trustees of the pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme.
The Trustees of the pension fund are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
The Groups major schemes are valued by independent actuaries annually using the projected unit credit actuarial cost method.
This reflects service rendered by employees to the dates of valuation and incorporates actuarial assumptions primarily regarding discount rates used in determining the present value of benefits, projected rates of salary growth, and long-term expected rates of return for scheme assets.
Discount rates are based on the market yields of high-quality corporate bonds in the country concerned.
Long-term expected rates of return for scheme assets are based on published brokers forecasts for each category of scheme assets.
Pension assets and liabilities in different defined benefit schemes are not offset unless the Group has a legally enforceable right to use the surplus in one scheme to settle obligations in the other scheme and intends to exercise this right.
The schemes in the UK typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as: investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary risk.
Investment risk The present value of the defined benefit schemes liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high quality corporate bond yields: if the return on plan assets is below this rate, a deficit will be created.
Interest risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the scheme liability but this will be partially offset by an increase in the return of the plans debt investments.
Longevity risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment.
An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plans liability.
Salary risk The present value of the defined benefit scheme liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants, as such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plans liability.
i Balance sheet values The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are grouped together as follows: Contract specific These are pre-funded defined benefit schemes.
The Group has obligations to contribute variable amounts to the pension schemes over the terms of the related contracts.
At rebid, any deficit or surplus would transfer to the next contractor.
The Group has recognised as a liability the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of scheme assets that it will fund over the period of the contracts with a corresponding amount recognised as intangible assets at the start of the contracts.
Subsequent actuarial gains and losses in relation to the Groups share of the pension obligations have been recognised in the SOCI.
The intangible assets are amortised over the term of the contracts.
Non contract specific These consist of a pre-funded defined benefit scheme which does not relate to any specific contract the funding policy is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as will achieve 100% funding on a projected salary basis and an unfunded defined benefit scheme, both of which do not relate to any specific contract.
Any liabilities arising are recognised in full.
ii Triennial funding valuation Among our non contract specific schemes, the largest is the Serco Pension and Life Assurance Scheme SPLAS.
The estimated actuarial deficit of SPLAS as at 31 December 2013 was approximately 13.0m 2012: 10.9m.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of this scheme was undertaken as at 5 April 2012 and resulted in an actuarially assessed deficit of 24m.
Following this review, the Group agreed with the Trustees to make a small increase in contributions, bringing cash contributions of up to 33% of members pensionable salaries until 2021.
The level of benefits and contributions under the scheme is kept under continual review in light of the needs of the business and changes to pension legislation.

Retirement benefit schemes continued 34 a Defined benefit schemes continued Liabilities in relation to unfunded schemes included above amount to 0.3m 2012: 0.2m.
Certain of the Groups non contract specific schemes have a Liability Driven Investment LDI strategy which aims to reduce volatility risk by better matching assets to liabilities.
The main asset classes that make up the LDI investments are gilts and corporate bonds with inflation and interest swap overlays.
The assumed expected rate of return is taken to be gilts 0.8% 2012: gilts 0.8%.
Virtually all equity and debt instruments have quoted prices in active markets.
Annuity policies and property assets can be classified as Level 3 instruments.
In some schemes, employee contributions vary over time to meet a specified proportion of the overall costs, including a proportion of any deficit.
The liabilities recognised in the balance sheet for these schemes are net of the proportion attributed to employees.
In addition, the amounts charged to the income statement for these schemes are net of the proportion attributed to employees.
The amounts attributed to employees are shown separately in the reconciliation of changes in the fair value of scheme assets and liabilities.

Retirement benefit schemes continued 34 a Defined benefit schemes continued Changes in the fair value of scheme assets are analysed as follows: Contract Non contract specific specific Total m m m At 1 January 2012 restated 152.8 1,065.3 1,218.1 Interest income on scheme assets employer 7.9 50.3 58.2 Interest income on scheme assets employee 0.1 1.1 1.2 Administrative expenses and taxes 0.7 1.3 2.0 Employer contributions 13.6 29.8 43.4 Contributions by employees 0.6 0.6 1.2 Benefits paid 3.8 38.4 42.2 Return on scheme assets less interest income 6.3 12.1 5.8 Arising on acquisition of a subsidiary 21.5 61.6 83.1 Eliminated on disposal of a subsidiary 1.1 1.1 At 31 December 2012 restated 198.3 1,155.8 1,354.1 At 1 January 2013 198.3 1,155.8 1,354.1 Interest income on scheme assets employer 9.2 48.0 57.2 Interest income on scheme assets employee 0.8 0.8 Administrative expenses and taxes 0.9 3.2 4.1 Employer contributions 13.4 34.0 47.4 Contributions by employees 0.8 0.9 1.7 Benefits paid 4.4 37.8 42.2 Return on scheme assets less interest income 10.8 26.8 16.0 Plan settlements 25.8 25.8 At 31 December 2013 227.2 1,145.9 1,373.1 Employer contributions for non contract specific schemes in 2013 include a 19.7m 2012: nil special contribution.
The special pension contributions of 19.7m relate to a 16.8m payment to fund the deficit on the Vertex pension fund prior to its transfer into the Groups largest defined benefit scheme, Serco Pension and Life Assurance Scheme SPLAS, and 2.9m in relation to deficit recovery funding of the Walsall defined benefit pension scheme.
The Vertex payment enables their separate defined benefit scheme to be closed and thereby reduces ongoing administration costs.
The normal contributions expected to be paid during the financial year ending 31 December 2014 are 27.3m financial year ended 31 December 2013: 32.3m.
The average duration of the benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period is 17.8 years 2012: 17.5 years.
Assumptions in respect of the expected return on scheme assets are based on market expectations of returns over the life of the related obligation.
Due consideration has been given to current market conditions as at 31 December 2013 in respect to inflation, interest, bond yields and equity performance when selecting the expected return on assets assumptions.
The expected yield on bond investments with fixed interest rates is derived from their market value.
The yield on equity investments contains an additional premium an equity risk premium to compensate investors for the additional anticipated risks of holding this type of investment, when compared to bond yields.
Management have concluded that an appropriate equity risk premium is 4.6% 2012: 4.6%.
Retirement benefit schemes continued 34 a Defined benefit schemes continued The overall expected return on assets is calculated as the weighted average of the expected returns for the principal asset categories held by scheme.
2013 2012 % % Main assumptions: Rate of salary increases 3.20 3.40 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.50 CPI and 3.30 RPI 2.20 CPI and 3.00 RPI Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.60 CPI and 3.40 RPI 2.20 CPI and 3.00 RPI Inflation assumption 2.60 CPI and 3.40 RPI 2.20 CPI and 3.00 RPI Discount rate 4.60 4.30 2013 2012 Years Years Post-retirement mortality: Current pensioners at 65 male 22.5 21.0 Current pensioners at 65 female 24.9 23.5 Future pensioners at 65 male 24.2 22.5 Future pensioners at 65 female 26.9 24.6 Management considers the significant actuarial assumptions with regards to the determination of the defined benefit obligation to be the discount rate, inflation, the rate of salary increases and mortality.
Sensitivity analysis is provided below, based on reasonably possible changes of the assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, assuming all other assumptions are held constant.
The sensitivities have been derived in the same manner as the defined benefit obligation as at 31 December 2013 where the defined benefit obligation is estimated using the Projected Unit Credit method.
Under this method each participants benefits are attributed to years of service, taking into consideration future salary increases and the schemes benefit allocation formula.
Thus, the estimated total pension to which each participant is expected to become entitled at retirement is broken down into units, each associated with a year of past or future credited service.
The defined benefit obligation as at 31 December 2013 is calculated on the actuarial assumptions agreed as at that date.
The sensitivities are calculated by changing each assumption in turn following the methodology above with all other things held constant.
The change in the defined benefit obligation from updating the single assumption represents the impact of that assumption on the calculation of the defined benefit obligation.
Change in present value of Assumption Change in assumption scheme liabilities Discount rate 4.6% 0.5% 9% 0.5% 10% Inflation 2.4% CPI 0.5% 9% 3.4% RPI 0.5% 8% Rate of salary increase 3.2% 0.5% 1% 0.5% 1% Mortality 20.7 27.8 Increase by one year 2% Post retirement mortality range for male and female, current and future pensioners.
Management acknowledges that the method used of presuming that all other assumptions remaining constant has inherent limitation given that it is more likely for a combination of changes, but highlights the value of each individual risk and is therefore suitable basis for providing this analysis.
34 b Defined contribution schemes The Group paid employer contributions of 86.9m 2012: 69.3m into UK and other defined contribution schemes and foreign state pension schemes.
Pre-funded defined benefit schemes treated as defined contribution Serco accounts for certain pre-funded defined benefit schemes relating to contracts as defined contribution schemes because the contributions are fixed until the end of the current concession and at rebid any surplus or deficit would transfer to the next contractor.
Cash contributions are recognised as pension costs and no asset or liability is shown on the balance sheet.
