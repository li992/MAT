STRATEGIC REPORT SPIRENT COMMUNICATIONS PLC GOVERNANCE ANNUAL REPORT 2013 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the parent Company financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified for measurement of derivative financial instruments at fair value and in accordance with applicable UK law and UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP.
As the Company is included in the consolidated financial statements, made up to 31 December each year, it is not required to present a separate profit and loss account as provided by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
Information on fees for non-audit services in respect of the parent Company accounts have not been disclosed as the Company prepares Group accounts which disclose information on fees for non-audit services on a consolidated basis.
Cash flow statement The Company is exempt under the terms of FRS 1 Cash Flow Statements from the requirement to publish its own cash flow statement, as its cash flows are included within the consolidated cash flow statement of the Group.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Purchased goodwill, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of assets acquired, is written off on a straight line basis from the date of acquisition over 20 years, being its anticipated useful life.
Tangible assets Depreciation is not provided on freehold land.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of all other assets, less residual value, on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives at rates which take into account commercial conditions at their location.
Usual asset lives are as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Plant and machinery 3 to 8 years Fixtures, fittings and equipment Building installations 20 years or lease period if less Fittings and equipment 3 to 8 years Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years Business systems software 4 years The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Investments Fixed asset investments, including investment in subsidiaries, are stated at cost and reviewed for impairment if there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Leases Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease on a straight line basis.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value.
Cost includes all costs in bringing each product to its present location and condition, being the full manufacturing cost on a first-in-first-out basis, including all attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity.
Net realisable value represents the selling price less further costs to be incurred to completion and on sale.
Trade and other debtors Trade debtors, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
123 SPIRENT COMMUNICATIONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 Notes to the parent Company financial statements continued 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Provisions Provisions are recorded when the Company has a present, legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event for which it is probable that it will be required to settle by an outflow of resources and for which a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision shall be the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Company, the revenue can be reliably measured and when the Company has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership.
In addition, revenue is only recognised when collectability is probable.
For the sale of services, revenue is recognised in accounting periods in which the service is rendered.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
All exchange gains and losses are taken to the profit and loss account.
Product development Expenditure is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Companys balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Equity instruments Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Company uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage exposures arising on receipts and payments in foreign currencies relating to firm commitments.
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the contract is entered into, and are subsequently re-measured to fair value at each reported balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The Company has not adopted the hedge accounting rules.
Consequently, all gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are taken to the profit and loss account.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts.
Pensions The Company operates two funded defined benefit pension plans.
All other plans are defined contribution in nature where the amount charged to the profit and loss account is the contributions paid or payable during the year.
For defined benefit pension plans full actuarial valuations are carried out every three years using the projected unit credit method, and updates are performed at each balance sheet date.
The cost of providing benefits under these plans is determined separately for each plan, and attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost, and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of defined benefit obligations.
Past services are recognised in the profit and loss account on a straight line basis or immediately if the benefits have vested.
When a settlement eliminating all obligations for benefits already accrued, or a curtailment reducing future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the plan membership or a reduction in future entitlement occurs, the obligation and related plan assets are re-measured using current actuarial assumptions and the resultant gain or loss recognised in the profit and loss account during the period in which the settlement or curtailment occurs.
124 STRATEGIC REPORT SPIRENT COMMUNICATIONS PLC GOVERNANCE ANNUAL REPORT 2013 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Significant accounting policies continued The interest element of the defined benefit pension plan cost represents the change in present value of plan obligations resulting from the passage of time and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening present value of the benefit obligation, taking into account material changes in the obligation during the year.
The expected return on plan assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of the year of long term market returns on plan assets, adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions received, and benefits paid during the year.
The difference between the expected return on plan assets and the interest cost is recognised in the profit and loss account as finance costs or finance income.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets, experience adjustments on liabilities and changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised immediately in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The defined benefit pension plan asset or liability in the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the present value of the defined benefit obligation using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds denominated in the same currency and whose term is consistent with the estimated term of the obligation.
Fair value is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price.
The value of a net pension benefit asset is restricted to the sum of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any amount the Company expects to recover, by way of reductions in the future contributions or refunds from the plan that have been agreed by the trustees.
Treasury shares Spirent Communications plc Ordinary Shares held by the Company are classified in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost and shown as a deduction from retained earnings.
Consideration received for the sale of such Ordinary Shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to retained earnings.
Employee benefits When an employee has rendered service to the Company during an accounting period, short term benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service are recognised in the same accounting period.
Dividends paid The interim dividend is included in the financial statements in the period in which it is paid, and the final dividend in the period it is approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.
Share-based payment The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined using the Hull-White Trinomial model.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised as a cost to the Company or as an addition to the cost of investment in the subsidiary in which the relevant employees work, over the vesting period of the equity-settled transactions with a corresponding adjustment to reserves.
Any payments received from the Companys subsidiaries in respect of these share-based payments result in a reduction in the cost of investment.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other vesting conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The Company has an employee share trust for the granting of certain share incentives to employees.
Shares are held by the employee share trust, treated as treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.
Tax The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
125 SPIRENT COMMUNICATIONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 Notes to the parent Company financial statements continued 1.
Significant accounting policies continued The tax currently payable represents the amount expected to be paid or recovered in respect of taxable profit for the year and is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided on an undiscounted basis on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date except as referred to below.
Amounts provided are calculated with reference to tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not provided on gains on the disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, unless there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned.
Provision will not be made where it is considered more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only when the replacement assets are sold.
Employees Please refer to the Report on directors remuneration on pages 58 to 76 for disclosures relating to the emoluments, share incentives and long term incentive interests and pensions of the directors.
Pensions Defined benefit plans The funded defined benefit pension plans are in the United Kingdom and comprise the Spirent Communications plc Staff Pension & Life Assurance Plan Staff Plan and the Spirent Communications plc Retirement Cash & Life Assurance Plan Cash Plan.
The Staff Plan is the Companys most significant plan.
There is in addition an unfunded plan.
The valuation used for these disclosures has been based on a full assessment of the liabilities of the plans as at 1 April 2012.
The present values of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and any past service costs were measured using the projected unit credit method.
i The key financial assumptions The assumptions used for both plans were as follows: 2013 2012 % % Inflation RPI 3.3 2.9 Inflation CPI 2.2 2.2 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.1 2.9 Rate of increase for pensions in payment pre 2001 service 3.6 3.6 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2001 to 5 April 2005 service 3.1 2.8 Rate of increase for pensions post 5 April 2005 service 2.2 1.9 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.2 2.2 Rate used to discount plan liabilities 4.5 4.3 Expected rate of return on plan assets weighted for both plans 4.6 5.0 Spirent Communications plc employs a building block approach in determining the long term rate of return on plans assets.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The assumed long term rate of return on each class of asset is set out within this note.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return of each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the plans.
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are such that a member currently aged 65 2012 aged 65 will live on average for a further 23.5 years 2012 23.3 years if they are male and for a further 25.6 years 2012 25.5 years if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2033 2012 in 2032 at age 65 2012 age 65 the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 24.3 years 2012 24.2 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 26.7 years 2012 26.6 years after retirement if they are female.
126 STRATEGIC REPORT SPIRENT COMMUNICATIONS PLC GOVERNANCE ANNUAL REPORT 2013 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3.
Pensions continued The approximate impact to the past service liabilities of changing these main assumptions is as follows: Reducing the discount rate by 0.1 per cent per annum would increase past service liabilities by 2.4 million.
Increasing the RPI inflation assumption by 0.1 per cent would increase the plans liabilities by 1.0 million.
Increasing the life expectancy of a member by one year by modifying the standard mortality tables using an appropriate scaling factor would increase past service liabilities by 6.5 million.
There will also be an impact on the future service cost but given the small active population in these plans this is likely to be insignificant.
ii The assets and the liabilities in the plans were as follows: Long term Long term rate of return rate of return expected 2013 expected 2012 % million % million Staff Plan Equities 7.4 53.9 8.3 44.5 Government bonds 2.5 32.8 Inflation-only LDI funds 1.3 14.4 Corporate bonds 3.6 24.9 Cash benchmarked bonds 3.0 72.5 3.5 30.8 Insured annuities 4.5 3.3 4.3 3.5 Property 5.5 15.3 7.3 14.0 Cash and other 1.3 0.5 1.0 0.6 Fair value of plan assets 4.6 159.9 5.1 151.1 Present value of defined benefit pension plan obligations 161.8 166.3 Deficit in the plan 1.9 15.2 Cash Plan Equities 7.4 2.7 8.3 2.3 Government bonds 3.2 2.0 2.5 2.2 Insured annuities 4.5 0.2 4.3 0.2 Cash and other 1.3 2.4 1.0 2.0 Fair value of plan assets 4.2 7.3 4.0 6.7 Present value of defined benefit pension plan obligations 6.9 6.7 Surplus in the plan 0.4 Total net deficit recognised 1.5 15.2 Unfunded plan Present value of unfunded obligations 0.5 0.5 Net pension plan deficit 2.0 15.7 Deferred tax asset note 11 0.4 3.6 Net pension plan deficit on the balance sheet 1.6 12.1 The plans are prohibited from investing in Spirents own financial instruments.

The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension plan deficit recognised on 1 January 2003 and taken directly to equity of 41.9 million in the Company is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension plans.
Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Companys statement of recognised gains and losses before 1 January 2003. v Movements in the present value of funded defined benefit obligations 2013 2012 million million At 1 January 173.0 158.4 Current service cost 0.1 0.2 Curtailment loss 0.8 Interest cost 7.3 7.2 Employee contributions 0.1 Benefit payments 7.5 6.9 Actuarial gain loss 4.2 13.2 Present value of funded defined benefit pension plans obligations 168.7 173.0 vi Movements in the fair value of plans assets 2013 2012 million million At 1 January 157.8 150.8 Expected return on plans assets 7.5 7.6 Employer contributions 3.4 1.8 Employee contributions 0.1 Benefit payments 7.5 6.9 Actuarial gain 6.0 4.4 Fair value of plans assets 167.2 157.8 128 STRATEGIC REPORT SPIRENT COMMUNICATIONS PLC GOVERNANCE ANNUAL REPORT 2013 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3.

The above plans are funded and have full UK HM Revenue & Customs HMRC tax-exempt approval.
Certain members, whose salaries were in excess of the HMRC statutory earnings cap, had their benefits increased through unapproved unfunded arrangements, to the level that would otherwise have applied in respect of basic salary only.
The Company has contractually agreed to pay the additional retirement benefits itself and a provision is made in respect of this obligation in the balance sheet at 31 December 2013 of 0.5 million 2012 0.5 million.
This represents the actuarial value, as confirmed by the Companys pension advisers, of the unapproved benefit entitlements accrued at that date.
The value is assessed and reviewed on a market value basis in line with the main plan valuation and adjusted each year.
There were no experience gains or losses on the unfunded plan in the period from 2009 to 2013.
