Financial risk management 33 a Fair value of financial instruments i Hierarchy of fair value The classification of the fair value measurement falls into three levels, based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
The levels are as follows: Level 1: derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: derived from other observable market data for the assets or liabilities: and Level 3: derived from valuation techniques using data that is not based on observable market data.
Based on the above, the derivative financial instruments held by the Group at 31 December 2013, are all considered to fall into Level 2.
There have been no transfers between levels in the year.
The Group held the following financial instruments which fall within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement at 31 December: Carrying amount Comparison Carrying amount Comparison measurement basis fair value measurement basis fair value Amortised Fair value Amortised Fair value cost Level 2 Level 2 cost Level 2 Level 2 2013 2013 2013 2012 2012 2012 restated restated restated m m m m m m Financial assets current Cash and bank balances 125.1 125.1 142.8 142.8 Derivatives designated as FVTPL Forward foreign exchange contracts 8.6 2.7 Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships Forward foreign exchange contracts 0.1 Loans and receivables Trade receivables note 24 210.7 210.7 275.0 275.0 Loan receivables note 24 2.5 2.5 1.1 1.1 Financial assets non-current Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships Forward foreign exchange contracts 0.1 Loans and receivables Loan receivables note 24 3.3 3.3 0.1 0.1 Financial liabilities current Derivatives designated as FVTPL Forward foreign exchange contracts 6.8 2.8 Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships Cross currency swaps 0.3 Forward foreign exchange contracts 13.1 11.0 Financial liabilities at amortised cost Trade payables note 27 169.9 169.9 147.9 147.9 Loans note 29 52.2 59.3 64.0 68.7 Obligations under finance leases note 28 14.9 14.9 10.7 10.7 Financial liabilities non-current Derivatives designated as FVTPL Interest rate swaps 0.1 0.1 Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships Cross currency swaps 0.3 0.6 Forward foreign exchange contracts 20.7 23.8 Financial liabilities at amortised cost Loans note 29 756.1 736.8 661.8 678.7 Obligations under finance leases note 28 53.1 53.1 39.5 39.5 152 Financial statements 33.
Financial risk management continued 33 a Fair value of financial instruments continued The Directors estimate that the carrying amounts of cash, trade receivables and trade payables approximate to their fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.
The fair values of loans and finance lease obligations are based on cash flows discounted using a rate based on the borrowing rate associated with the liability.
The fair value of derivatives is calculated using a discounted cash flow approach applying discount factors derived from observable market data to actual and estimated future cash flows.
Credit risk is considered in the calculation of these fair values.
ii Fair value of derivative financial instruments The fair valuation of derivative financial instruments results in a net liability of 32.6m 2012: 35.5m comprising non-current assets of nil 2012: 0.1m, current assets of 8.7m 2012: 2.7m, current liabilities of 20.2m 2012: 13.8m and non-current liabilities of 21.1m 2012: 24.5m.

The fair value of the derivatives and their credit risk adjusted fair value are not materially different, and are approximately equal to the amount contractually payable at maturity due to the short tenure of the instruments.
33 b Financial risk The Board is ultimately responsible for ensuring that financial and non-financial risks are monitored and managed within acceptable and known parameters.
The Board delegates authority to the executive team to manage financial risks.
The Groups treasury function acts as a service centre and operates within clearly defined guidelines and policies that are approved by the Board.
The guidelines and policies define the financial risks to be managed, specify the objectives in managing these risks, delegate responsibilities to those managing the risks and establish a control framework to regulate treasury activities to minimise operational risk.

Financial risk management continued 33 c Liquidity risk i Credit facilities The Group maintains committed credit facilities to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to maintain its ongoing operations.
As at 31 December, the Groups committed bank credit facilities and corresponding borrowings were as follows: Amount Drawn Undrawn Total facility 2013 2013 2013 2013 Currency Millions m m m Syndicated revolving credit facility GBP 730.0 175.0 555.0 730.0 Amount Drawn Undrawn Total facility 2012 2012 2012 2012 Currency Millions m m m Syndicated revolving credit facility GBP 730.0 177.6 552.4 730.0 The 730.0m syndicated revolving credit facility was signed in March 2012 and matures in March 2017.
It is unsecured and contains financial and non-financial covenants and obligations typical of these arrangements.
In addition to the banking facility the Group has outstanding US private placements of 574.8m, 46.4m of which will be repaid in equal instalments over 2014 and 2015, with the remaining 528.4m as bullet repayments between 2016 and 2024.
In addition to the bank and private placement facilities the Group has drawn receivable financing facilities of 27.1m 2012: 32.5m and total facilities of 60m 2012: 60m.
ii Maturity of financial liabilities The Groups financial liabilities will be settled on both a net and a gross basis over the remaining period between the balance sheet date and the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed below are the contractual undiscounted cash flows based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.

Financial risk management continued 33 c Liquidity risk continued The Groups derivative financial liabilities are settled on both a net and gross basis depending upon the terms of each derivative financial instrument.
The maturity of the Groups undiscounted derivative financial liabilities is as follows: Forward Cross foreign Interest currency exchange rate swaps contracts swaps Total At 31 December 2013 m m m m On demand or within one year 0.2 19.7 0.1 20.0 Between one and two years 0.4 13.9 14.3 Between two and five years 7.6 7.6 0.6 41.2 0.1 41.9 Forward Cross foreign Interest currency exchange rate swaps contracts swaps Total At 31 December 2012 m m m m On demand or within one year 14.6 14.6 Between one and two years 9.8 0.1 9.9 Between two and five years 0.7 18.3 19.0 0.7 42.7 0.1 43.5 33 d Foreign exchange risk i Transactional It is the Groups policy to hedge material transactional exposures using forward foreign exchange contracts to fix the functional currency value of non-functional currency cash flows.
At 31 December 2013, there were no material unhedged non-functional currency monetary assets or liabilities, firm commitments or highly probable forecast transactions.
ii Translational Where possible the Group will raise external funding to match the currency profile of its foreign operations in order to mitigate translation exposure.
If matched funding is not possible, currency derivatives may be used to protect against movements in foreign exchange.
iii Hedge accounting For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
Pages 122 to 123 detail the Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting under IAS 39.
At 31 December 2013, the Group held two cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges against the 2003 US Dollar private placement.
Fixed interest cash flows denominated in US Dollars are exchanged for fixed interest cash flows denominated in Sterling.
The profile of these cross currency swaps held by the Group is as follows: 2013 2012 Receivable Payable Receivable Payable Notional USD GBP interest Notional USD GBP interest amount interest rate rate amount interest rate rate Maturity USD m % % USD m % % August 2015 22.0 5.7 5.7 33.0 5.7 5.7 The Group also held a number of forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges.
The net notional amounts are summarised by currency below: 2013 2012 m m Sterling 99.7 176.3 US Dollar 4.9 47.2 Euro 4.5 9.5 Indian Rupee 93.5 190.7 All currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are highly effective and as at 31 December 2013 a net fair value loss of 33.2m 2012: 29.7m loss has been deferred in hedging reserve.
During the course of the year to 31 December 2013, 14.5m 2012: 13.8m of fair value losses were transferred to the hedging reserve, and 9.7m 2012: 9.7m reclassified to the consolidated income statement.
iv Currency sensitivity The Groups currency exposures in respect of monetary items at 31 December 2013 that result in net currency gains and losses in the income statement and equity arise principally from movement in US Dollar and Indian Rupee exchange rates.
At 31 December 2013, if both had weakened by 10% against Sterling, with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have increased by 0.6m 2012: 0.6m increase, comprising USD 0.2m and INR 0.4m and equity would have decreased by 13.1m 2012: 9.1m increase, comprising USD 0.9m and INR 12.2m.

Financial risk management continued 33 e Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to minimise the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings to provide an appropriate level of certainty to cost of funds.
Exposure to interest rate risk arises principally on changes to US Dollar and Sterling interest rates.
i Interest rate management An analysis of financial assets and liabilities exposed to interest rate risk is set out below: Financial assets Weighted Weighted Floating average fixed Floating average fixed rate Fixed rate interest rate rate Fixed rate interest rate 2013 2013 2013 2012 2012 2012 m m % m m % Cash and cash equivalents 125.1 142.8 Other loan receivables 1.1 4.7 3.30 1.2 126.2 4.7 144.0 Financial liabilities Weighted Weighted Floating average fixed Floating average fixed rate Fixed rate interest rate rate Fixed rate interest rate 2013 2013 2013 2012 2012 2012 m m % m m % Non recourse Canadian Dollar loans 7.5 5.27 Non recourse Sterling loans 20.3 3.62 17.6 3.64 Sterling loans 200.1 33.2 2.30 97.2 49.8 3.23 US Dollar loans 1.5 541.6 4.09 26.5 411.0 4.16 AU Dollar loans 79.4 4.49 Other loans 11.6 36.8 4.38 213.2 595.1 239.9 485.9 Exposure to interest rate fluctuations is mitigated through the issuance of fixed rate debt and the use of interest rate derivatives.
Excluded from the above analysis is 68.0m 2012: 50.2m of amounts payable under finance leases, which are subject to fixed rates of interest.
ii Interest rate swaps Interest rate swaps outstanding at 31 December 2013 relate to interest rate risk management on debt held locally within the Group.
Notional Payable USD Receivable USD Receivable JPY Value interest rate interest rate interest rate 2013 2013 2013 2013 Maturity USD m % % % March 2014 0.5 6.89 3 month JPY LIBOR 1.0 January 2015 2.5 6.30 3 month USD LIBOR 2.0 Notional Payable USD Receivable USD Receivable JPY Value interest rate interest rate interest rate 2012 2012 2012 2012 Maturity USD m % % % March 2014 2.1 6.89 3 month JPY LIBOR 1.0 January 2015 3.8 6.30 3 month USD LIBOR 2.0 The interest rate swaps were not designated as cash flow hedges.
The fair value loss of 0.1m has therefore been recorded in the income statement 2012: 0.1m loss.
iii Interest rate sensitivity The effect of a 100 basis point increase in LIBOR rates on the net financial liability position at the balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a reduction in post-tax profit for the year to 31 December 2013 of 0.7m 2012: 0.7m.
Financial risk management continued 33 f Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables.
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty could default on its contractual obligations.
In this regard, the Groups principle exposure is to cash and cash equivalents, derivative transactions and trade receivables.
The Groups trade receivables credit risk is relatively low given that a high proportion of our customer base are government bodies with strong sovereign, or sovereign like, credit ratings.
However, where the assessed credit worthiness of a customer, government or non government, falls below that considered acceptable, appropriate measures are taken to mitigate against the risk of contractual default using instruments such as credit guarantees.
The Groups Treasury function only transacts with counterparties that comply with Board policy.
The credit risk is measured by way of a counterparty credit rating and as a minimum any counterparty must have a long term public rating of Single A from any two recognised rating agencies.
Pre-approved limits are set based on a rating matrix and exposures monitored accordingly.
The Group also employs the use of set-off rights in some agreements.
33 g Capital risk The Group defines capital as equity, loans and borrowings and cash and cash equivalents.
The Articles of Association of Serco Group plc require that the net borrowings of Serco Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings shall not at any time without the previous sanction of an ordinary resolution exceed three and a half times adjusted capital and reserves.
The Group does not have any externally imposed requirements for managing capital, other than those imposed by its debt covenants and Company Law.
The Boards objective is to maintain a capital structure that supports the Groups strategic objectives, including but not limited to reshaping the portfolio through mergers, acquisitions and disposals.
In doing so the Board seeks to manage funding and liquidity risk, optimise shareholder return and maintain an implied investment grade credit position.
This strategy is unchanged from the prior year.
The Board reviews and approves at least annually a treasury policy document which covers, inter alia, funding and liquidity risk, capital structure and risk management.
This policy details targets for committed funding headroom, diversification of committed funding and debt maturity profile.
All targets were met throughout the financial year.
The Group ensures that sufficient funds and distributable reserves are held to allow payments of projected dividends to shareholders and it intends to pursue a policy of dividend growth that broadly reflects the increase in underlying earnings of the business.
The following table summarises the capital of the Group: 2013 2012 m m Cash and cash equivalents 125.1 142.8 Loans 802.5 724.6 Obligations under finance leases 68.0 50.2 Equity 1,095.9 1,128.9 Capital 1,841.3 1,760.9 157
