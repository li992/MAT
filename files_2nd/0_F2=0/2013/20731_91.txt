23 Financial instruments and Risk The Strategic Report details the Companys approach to investment risk management on pages 38 and 39 and the accounting policies on pages 79 to 83 explain the basis on which currencies and investments are valued for accounting purposes.
The Directors are of the opinion that the fair values of financial assets and liabilities of the Group are not materially different to their carrying values.
Capital Risk Management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group and the Company will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the use of debt and equity balances.
The Group and Companys overall strategy remains unchanged from the year ended 31 December 2012.
The capital structure of the Group and the Company consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 15, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the Company comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 17 to the financial statements.
101 | Alliance Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2013 23 Financial instruments and Risk Capital Risk Management The Board reviews the capital structure of the Company and the Group on an at least semi-annual basis.
The Group and the Company have decided that net gearing should at no time exceed 30% of the net assets of either the Group or the Company.

In pursuing these objectives the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for payment as dividends.
The principal financial instruments at risk comprise those in the Companys investment portfolio and this note addresses these risks below.
The Group has certain additional risks, and these are detailed in the appropriate sections below.
These risks and the Directors approach to managing them are set out below under the following headings: market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk, and other price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and gearing risk.
The Group has a risk management framework in place which is described in detail on pages 36 and 37.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks, and the methods used to measure the risks have not changed from the previous accounting year.
23.1 Market Risk Market risk embodies the potential for both losses and gains and includes currency risk see note 23.2, interest rate risk see note 23.3 and other price risk see note 23.4.
Market risk is managed on a regular basis by the Asset Allocation Committee.
The purpose of this executive committee is to manage the capital of the Company within parameters set by the Directors on investment and asset allocation strategies and risk.
The Companys strategy on investment risk is outlined in our statement of investment objectives and policy on page 68.
Details of the investment portfolio at the balance sheet date are disclosed on pages 27, 28 and 29.
23.2 Currency Risk Some of the Groups assets, liabilities and transactions are denominated in currencies other than its functional currency of Sterling.
Consequently the Group is exposed to the risk that movements in exchange rates may affect the Sterling value of those items.
The Groups currency holdings and gains losses thereon are reviewed regularly by the Directors, and the currency risk is managed on a regular basis by the Asset Allocation Committee within parameters set by the Directors on investment and asset allocation strategies and risk.
The Group enters into forward exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency exposure.
The currency exposure for overseas investments is based on the quotation currency of each holding, while the currency exposure for net monetary assets is based on the currency that each asset or liability is denominated in.
At the reporting date the Group had the following exposures: Currency Exposure Group Total Total Overseas Net monetary currency Overseas Net monetary currency investments assets exposure investments assets exposure 000 Dec 13 Dec 13 Dec 13 Dec 12 Dec 12 Dec 12 US dollar 1,168,156 266 1,168,422 829,861 4,123 833,984 Euro 353,747 856 354,603 237,484 983 238,467 Yen 67,523 - 67,523 28,975 - 28,975 Other non-Sterling 431,307 29 431,336 380,355 263 380,618 1,476,675 5,369 1,482,044 2,020,733 1,151 2,021,884 102 | Alliance Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2013 23 Financial instruments and Risk 23.2 Currency Risk Currency Exposure Company Total Total Overseas Net monetary currency Overseas Net monetary currency investments assets exposure investments assets exposure 000 Dec 13 Dec 13 Dec 13 Dec 12 Dec 12 Dec 12 US dollar 1,168,156 266 1,168,422 829,861 4,123 833,984 Euro 353,747 856 354,603 237,484 983 238,467 Yen 67,523 - 67,523 28,975 - 28,975 Other non-Sterling 431,307 29 431,336 380,355 263 380,618 1,476,675 5,369 1,482,044 2,020,733 1,151 2,021,884 Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts Date of contract Settlement date Currency Amount '000 Contract rate Fair value Dec 13 000 19 December 2013 30 June 2014 SGD 103,380 2.0676 536 19 December 2013 30 June 2014 USD 245,370 1.6358 1,821 The fair value of the forward foreign exchange currency contracts are included wthin Listed Investments in the Balance Sheet.

23.3 Interest Rate Risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in a number of ways.
A movement in interest rates may affect the fair value of investments in fixed interest rate securities, income receivable on cash deposits and interest payable on variable rate borrowings.
The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at levels which are approved and monitored by the Board.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows as a result of an interest rate change are taken into account when making investment or borrowing decisions.
The Company has a financial services subsidiary, Alliance Trust Savings Limited, which holds client deposits.
This subsidiary has detailed risk management policies, with treasury and cash management undertaken within a framework of banking policies.
These banking policies cover credit risk, counterparty exposure, capital adequacy and liquidity.
The Group Asset and Liabilities Committee reviews interest rate risk on a regular basis.
The Group uses interest rate swaps to exchange risk on the movement of interest rates where cashflows are exchanged.

As the majority of the Groups financial assets are carried at fair value with fair value changes recognised in the income statement, all changes in market conditions will directly affect gains and losses on investments and net assets.
The Directors manage price risk by having a suitable investment objective for the Company.
The Board reviews this objective and investment performance regularly.
The risk is managed on a regular basis by the Asset Allocation Committee within parameters set by the Directors on investment and asset allocation strategies and risk.
Concentration of exposure to other price risks An analysis of the Companys investment portfolio is shown on pages 27, 28 and 29.
This shows that the largest amount of equity investments by value is in North America, with significant amounts also in Asia, Europe and the UK.
It also shows the concentration of investments in various sectors.

105 | Alliance Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2013 23 Financial instruments and Risk 23.5 Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Group.
This risk is managed as follows: Investment transactions are carried out with a number of well established, approved brokers.
Investment transactions are done on a cash against receipt or cash against delivery basis The Company and ATS also minimise credit risk through banking polices which restrict banking deposits to highly rated financial institutions.
The policies also set maximum exposure to individual banks.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with credit worthy counterparties that have been approved by the Asset Allocation Committee and obtaining sufficient collateral where appropriate cash and gilts as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
At the reporting date, the Groups and Company's cash and cash equivalents exposed to credit risk were as follows: Group Company 000 Dec 13 Dec 12 Dec 13 Dec 12 Credit Rating Aaa - 26,990 - - Aa1 49,983 15,000 - - Aa2 70,175 33,135 1,170 - Aa3 102,175 70,488 - 5,445 A2 128,734 182,748 8,204 21,150 A3 121,988 116,555 15,862 6,741 473,055 444,916 25,236 33,336 Average maturity 36 days 11 days 1 day 1 day In addition the Company has seed funded the ATIF Monthly Income Bond Fund which is predominantly invested in corporate bonds.

Bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian may cause the Groups rights with respect to securities held by the custodian to be delayed or limited.
Credit derivatives are used by way of managing the aggregate credit exposure of the Group without buying or selling a physical bond or loan.
Credit default swaps are used by the Group for two key purposes.
Selling protection going long risk will increase the exposure to a particular reference entity.
In return for taking this credit risk the Group will receive a specified income over the life of the contract but is exposed to capital losses should the reference entity breach the terms of the contract in the intervening period.
The reference entity may be a named company, or in the case of iTraxx indices, a basket of credit exposures.
At the 31 December 2013 the gross exposure to single name credit default swaps and iTraxx indices was Nil and 55.5m respectively 7m and 21.5m.
106 | Alliance Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2013 23 Financial instruments and Risk 23.6 Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with financial liabilities.
This is not a significant risk for the Company as the majority of its assets are investments in quoted equities that are readily realisable.
It also has the ability to borrow, which give it access to additional funding when required.

23.8 Hierarchical Valuation of Financial Instruments The Group refines and modifies its valuation techniques as markets develop.
While the Group believes its valuation techniques to be appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions could result in different estimates of fair value at the balance sheet date.
Financial instruments excludes the Investment Property.
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method.
The different levels have been defined as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs The following table analyses the fair value measurements for the Group's Company's assets and liabilities measured by the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurement is categorised at 31 December 2013.
All fair value measurements disclosed are recurring fair value measurements.
Fair Value Assets in Level 1 The quoted market price used for financial investments held by the Group is the current bid price.
These investments are included within Level 1 and comprise of equities, bonds and exchange traded derivatives.
Fair Value Assets in Level 2 The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and with minimal reliance on entity specific estimates.
The following valuation techniques are relevant to the Level 2 instruments detailed above: The fair value of credit default swaps are calculated as a function of the principle and the accrual.
The principle is calculated as the present value of the future cash flows that result from the difference between the coupon of the contract and the current spread at which the contract is trading.
The accrual is calculated as the coupon multiplied by the day convention, which is further multiplied by the notional value of the contract.
The fair value of interest rate swaps are calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on changes in observable yield curves.
Fair Value Assets in Level 3 Level 3 valuations are reviewed at least annually by the Valuation Committee who are assigned responsibility by the Board of Alliance Trust PLC.
The Valuation Committee considers the appropriateness of the valuation models, inputs, using the various valuation methods in accordance with the Group's valuation policy.
The Committee will determine the appropriateness of any valuation of the underlying assets.
The following table shows the reconciliation from the beginning balances to the ending balances for fair value measurement in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

This includes Alliance Trust Savings Limited at 26.7m 24.6m, Alliance Trust Investments Limited at 12.8m 10.1m and Alliance Trust Finance Limited 16.8m 17.8m.
This represents the Directors' view of the amount for which the subsidiaries could be exchanged between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm's length transaction.
This does not assume that the underlying business is saleable at the reporting date or that the Company has any intention to sell the subsidiary business in the future.
The Directors have used 109 | Alliance Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2013 23 Financial instruments and Risk 23.8 Hierarchical Valuation of Financial Instruments several valuation methodologies as prescribed in the guidelines to arrive at their best estimate of fair value, including discounted cash flow calculations, revenue and earnings multiples and recent market transactions where available.
The following key assumptions are relevant to the fair valuation of our investment in our subsidiary companies, and are consistent with prior years: Alliance Trust Savings - This is valued as a trading business.
A discounted cash flow, revenue multiple and an earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation multiple approach have been adopted.
Alliance Trust Investments - This is valued based on third party funds only.
Given the stage of development of Alliance Trust Investments it is valued as a book of business rather than a trading business.
Both a discounted cashflow and revenue multiple valuation approach have been adopted.
Alliance Trust Finance - This is predominantly valued using the value of cash held in this entity.
The mutiples applied in valuing our subsidiaries are derived from comparable companies sourced from market data.
Mineral rights are carried at fair value and are valued in the Companys accounts at 13.2m 8.9m being the Directors' estimate of their fair value, using the guidelines and methodologies on valuation published by the Oklahoma Tax Commission and for non-producing properties, the Lierle US Price Report.
The table below details how an increase or decrease in the respective input variables would impact the valuation disclosed for the relevant Level 3 assets.

For Alliance Trust Savings, an increase in the revenue and EBITDA multiple or a decrease in the discount rate would lead to an increase in the estimated value.
For Alliance Trust Investments, an increase in the revenue and a decrease in the discount rate would lead to an increase in the estimated value.
For Mineral rights, an increase in the revenue multiple and average bonus multiple would lead to an increase in the estimated value.
Private equity, both fund-to-fund and direct investment, are included under level 3 is valued in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines issued in September 2009.
Unlisted investments in private equity are stated at the valuation as determined by the Valuation Committee based on information provided by the General Partner.
The General Partners policy in valuing unlisted investments is to carry them at fair value.
The General Partner will generally rely on the fund's investment managers fair value at the last reported period rolled forward for any cashflows.
However if the General Partner does not feel the manager is reflecting a fair value they will select a valuation methodology that is most appropriate for the particular investments in that fund and generate a fair value.
In those circumstances the General Partner believes the most appropriate methodologies to use to value the underlying investments in the portfolio are: Price of a recent investment Multiples Net assets Industry valuation benchmarks An entity is not required to create quantitative information to comply with this disclosure requirement if quantitative unobservable inputs are not developed by the entity when measuring fair value for example, when an entity uses prices from prior transactions or third-party pricing information without adjustment.
