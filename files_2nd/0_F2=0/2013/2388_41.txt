DAB Deferred annual bonus plan.
a Since 2010, vesting of the deferred shares has been subject to a safety and environmental sustainability hurdle, and this will continue.
If the committee assesses that there has been a material deterioration in safety and environmental performance, or there have been major incidents, either of which reveal underlying weaknesses in safety and environmental management, then it may conclude that shares should vest only in part, or not at all.
In reaching its conclusion, the committee will obtain advice from the SEEAC.
There is no identied minimum vesting threshold level.
b Bob Dudley and Dr Byron Grote received awards in the form of ADSs.
The above numbers reect calculated equivalents in ordinary shares.
One ADS is equivalent to six ordinary shares.
c The face value has been calculated using the market price of ordinary shares on 8 March 2012 of 4.94. d The market price at closing of ordinary shares on 11 February 2013 was 4.55 and for ADSs was $43.01 and on 12 February 2014 was 4.87 and for ADSs was $48.38.

The vesting of these shares is not subject to further performance conditions and he receives deferred shares at each scrip payment date as part of his election choice.
f The market price of each share used to determine the total value at vesting on the vesting dates of 15 January 2013, 9 January 2014 and 12 February 2014 were 4.58, 4.97 and 4.90 respectively and for ADSs on 12 February 2014 was $48.41.
h The face value has been calculated using the market price of ordinary shares on 15 March 2012 of 4.93. i All deferred and matched shares have been prorated to reect actual service during the performance period and these gures have been used to calculate the face value.
For awards under the 2011-2013 plan, performance conditions are measured 50% on TSR against ExxonMobil, Shell, Total and Chevron: 20% on reserves replacement against the same peer group: and 30% against a balanced scorecard of strategic imperatives.
For awards under the 2012-2014, 2013-2015 and 2014-2016 plans, performance conditions are measured one-third on TSR against ExxonMobil, Shell, Total and Chevron: one-third on operating cash ow: and one-third on a balanced scorecard of strategic imperatives.
Each performance period ends on 31 December of the third year.
There is no identied overall minimum vesting threshold level but to comply with UK regulations a value of 30%, which is conditional on the TSR, reserves replacement ratio and one of the strategic imperatives reaching the minimum threshold, has been calculated.
