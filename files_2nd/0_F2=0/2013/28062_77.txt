NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED Market Price Risk The fair value of equity and other financial securities held in the Companys portfolio fluctuates with changes in market prices.
Prices are themselves affected by movements in currencies and interest rates and by other financial issues including the market perception of future risks.
The Companys strategy for the management of market price risk is driven by the Companys investment policy as outlined within the Business Review on pages 911.
The Board sets policies for managing this risk and meets regularly to review full, timely and relevant information on investment performance and financial results.
The management of market price risk is part of the fund management process and is fundamental to equity investment.
The portfolio is managed with an awareness of the effects of adverse price movements in equity markets with an objective of maximising overall returns to shareholders.
Investment and portfolio performance are discussed in more detail in the Investment Advisers Report and the investment portfolio is set out on page 6.
Any changes in market conditions will directly affect the profit or loss reported through the Income Statement.
For instance, a 30% increase in the value of the equity exposure as at 30 April 2013 would have increased net return and net assets for the year by 77,446,000 2012: a 30% increase in the value of the equity exposure would have increased net return by 69,537,000.
A decrease of 30% 2012: 30% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
These calculations are based on investment valuations at the respective balance sheet date and are not representative of the year as a whole.
The Company continued to use forward currency contracts during the year.
Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter in realising assets or otherwise raising funds to meet financial commitments.
The risk of the Group not having sufficient liquidity at any time is not considered by the Board to be significant, given the liquid nature of the portfolio of investments and the level of cash and cash equivalents ordinarily held.
The Investment Adviser reviews liquidity at the time of each investment decision.
The Board reviews liquidity exposure at each meeting.
All of the Groups financial liabilities at 30 April 2013 had a maturity period of less than three months and were repayable at the date shown on the Balance Sheet.
Interest Rate Risk Some of the financial instruments held by the Group are interest bearing.
As such, the Group is exposed to interest rate risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing market rate.
Floating Rate When the Group holds cash balances, such balances are held on overnight deposit accounts and call deposit accounts.
The benchmark rate which determines the interest payments received on cash balances is the bank base rate, which at 30 April 2013 was 0.50% in the UK 2012: 0.50%.
Floating interest rate exposure at 30 April: 2013 2012 000 000 Singapore Dollar 42 4 Sterling 9,105 5,500 US Dollar 159 31 9,306 5,535 40 Personal Assets Trust PLC
