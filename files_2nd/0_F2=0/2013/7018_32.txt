NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 1 Segmental analysis Sector analysis The Group has four main reportable segments Process Safety, Infrastructure Safety, Medical and Environmental & Analysis, which are defined by markets rather than product type.
Each segment includes businesses with similar operating and marketing characteristics.
These segments are consistent with the internal reporting as reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer.
In the current year the reportable segments have been revised to provide greater understanding of the Groups activities.
The main change from the prior year is separating the former Health & Analysis sector into two sectors, namely the Medical and Environmental & Analysis sectors.
This separation reflects the Groups growing presence in the medical devices market, in particular in ophthalmology and blood pressure monitoring.
The Process Safety and Infrastructure Safety sectors, formerly named Industrial Safety and Infrastructure Sensors respectively are unchanged.
Prior year results have been restated to reflect the revised reportable segments.

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Groups accounting policies.
For acquisitions after 3 April 2010, acquisition transaction costs and movement on contingent consideration are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Segment profit, before these acquisition costs, the amortisation of acquired intangible assets and the profit on disposal of continuing operations is disclosed separately above as this is the measure reported to the Chief Executive Officer for the purpose of allocation of resources and assessment of segment performance.

2 Earnings per ordinary share Basic earnings per ordinary share are calculated using the weighted average of 377,597,126 shares in issue during the year net of shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares 2012: 376,926,013.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share are calculated using the weighted average of 378,009,506 shares 2012: 377,473,142, which includes dilutive potential ordinary shares of 412,380 2012: 547,129.
Dilutive potential ordinary shares are calculated from those exercisable share options where the exercise price is less than the average price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
Adjusted earnings are calculated as earnings from continuing operations excluding the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, acquisition transaction costs, movement on contingent consideration and profit on disposal of continuing operations after tax.
The Directors consider that adjusted earnings represent a more consistent measure of underlying performance.
A reconciliation of earnings and the effect on basic earnings per share figures is as follows: Per ordinary share 2013 2012 2013 2012 000 000 pence pence Earnings from continuing operations 95,216 86,714 25.22 23.01 Add back amortisation of acquired intangible assets after tax 9,978 7,561 2.64 2.00 Acquisition transaction costs after tax 2,252 691 0.60 0.18 Adjustments to contingent consideration after tax 385 786 0.10 0.21 Profit on disposal of continuing operations after tax 8,070 3,543 2.14 0.94 Adjusted earnings 98,991 92,209 26.22 24.46 100 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Overview 02-09 Business review 10-59 Go Gov five ern rnan ance ce 60 60- -8 86 6 Financial statements 87-147 3 Non-GAAP measures The Board uses certain non-GAAP measures to help it effectively monitor the performance of the Group.

Organic growth Organic growth measures the change in revenue and profit from continuing Group operations.
The effect of acquisitions and disposals made during the prior financial year, and acquisitions made in the current financial year has been equalised by adjusting the current year results for a pro-rated contributions based on their revenues and profits before taxation at the dates of acquisition and disposal.
The results of disposals made in the prior financial year have been removed from the prior year reported revenue and profit before taxation.
Organic growth has been calculated as follows: Revenue Profit before taxation 2013 2012 % 2013 2012 % 000 000 growth 000 000 growth Continuing operations 619,210 579,883 130,661 120,465 Acquired revenue profit 37,941 11,394 6,933 1,633 581,269 568,489 2.2% 123,728 118,832 4.1% Before amortisation of acquired intangible assets, acquisition transaction costs, movement on contingent consideration and profit on disposal of continuing operations.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 105 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 11 Goodwill continued Following the revision to the Groups reportable segments described in note 1, goodwill has been re-allocated to ten CGU groupings within the new segments.
This is to reflect: a the changing composition of the businesses within the Group: b companies increasingly collaborating and sharing resources: c the evolving markets in which the businesses operate and the long term growth drivers exhibited in those markets: and d the way that the Directors make decisions about continuing or disposing of lines of business.
In the prior year goodwill was allocated to 13 CGU groupings.
In the current year, the Group disposed of both businesses comprising the Asset Monitoring CGU grouping see note 29, and aggregated the Doors, Security and Elevator CGUs into a single CGU grouping.
Before recognition of any impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: Restated 2013 2012 000 000 Process Safety Gas Detection Bursting Discs 7,620 7,239 Safety Interlocks 7,609 7,466 Asset Monitoring 8,009 15,229 22,714 Infrastructure Safety Fire 11,675 11,350 Doors, Security & Elevators 69,988 68,966 81,663 80,316 Medical Health Optics 123,123 67,811 Fluid Technology 33,749 29,949 156,872 97,760 Environmental & Analysis Water 27,929 11,592 Photonics 57,855 55,089 Environmental Monitoring 12,237 98,021 66,681 Total Group 351,785 267,471 Goodwill values have been tested for impairment by comparing them against the value in use in perpetuity of the relevant CGUs.
The value in use calculations were based on projected cash flows, derived from the latest budget approved by the Board, discounted at the Groups pre-tax estimated short-term discount rate to calculate their net present value.
The re-allocation of goodwill described above did not have an impact on the outcome of impairment testing, which was carried out using a methodology consistent with prior periods.
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations The calculation of value in use is most sensitive in all cases to the following assumptions: Discount rates: Market share during the budget period for the financial year to March 2014: and Growth rates used to extrapolate risk adjusted cash flows beyond the budget period.
Discount rates are based on estimations of the assumptions that market participants operating in similar sectors to Halma would make, using the Groups economic profile as a starting point and adjusting appropriately.
The Directors do not currently expect any significant change in the present base discount rate of 10.51% 2012: 10.23%.
The base discount rate, which is pre-tax and is based on short-term variables, may differ from the Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC used in long-term return measures such as ROTIC.
Discount rates are calculated for each CGU, reflecting the size of each business and specific geographic and industry factors, resulting in the impairment testing using discount rates ranging from 9.36% to 14.59% 2012: 10.75% to 12.98%.
Market share assumptions are important because, as well as the growth rates as noted below, management assess how each units relative position to its competitors might change over the budget period.
Management expects each units position to be stable over the projected period.
Growth rate estimates of respectively 3.25% and 2.50% for the first and second year onwards into perpetuity following the budget year are based on management estimates keeping in view past performance growth.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions Management believes that no reasonable potential change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
2 Technical know-how assets are amortised over their useful economic lives estimated to be between three and ten years.
3 Trademarks, brands and patents which include protected intellectual property are amortised over their useful economic lives estimated to be between eight and ten years.
4 Other intangibles comprise license and product registration costs amortised over their useful economic lives estimated to be between three and five years.
In the current year acquired intangibles have been presented under three headings in order to show significant groups of assets by class, according to their expected useful lives and the manner in which the assets are expected to be used.

PSRM is treated as an associate, and not a subsidiary, because the party holding the remaining 50% is considered to exert more control.
Both associates have a 31 December year end, although results coterminous with the Groups year end have been consolidated according to the Groups share of ownership of each associate.

In the case of trade receivables that are past due, management makes an assessment of the risk of non-collection, taking into account factors such as previous default experience, any disputes or other factors delaying payment and the risk of bankruptcy or other failure of the customer to meet their obligations.
For trade receivables that are not past due, taking into account good historical collection experience, management records an impairment charge only where there is a specific risk of non-collection.
The fair value of trade and other receivables approximates to book value due to the short-term maturities associated with these items.
There is no impairment risk identified with regards to prepayments and accrued income or other receivables where no amounts are past due.
The ageing of trade receivables was as follows: Trade receivables net Gross trade receivables of doubtful debts 2013 2012 2013 2012 000 000 000 000 Not yet due 91,382 79,167 91,114 78,950 Up to one month overdue 17,415 14,996 17,289 14,986 Up to two months overdue 3,406 2,760 3,308 2,733 Up to three months overdue 1,891 1,521 1,746 1,457 Over three months overdue 4,074 3,536 2,266 1,691 118,168 101,980 115,723 99,817 17 Trade and other payables: falling due within one year 2013 2012 000 000 Trade payables 50,285 44,847 Other taxation and social security 6,189 5,349 Provision for contingent purchase consideration 13,856 18,480 Other payables 3,929 1,825 Accruals and deferred income 26,670 22,998 100,929 93,499 The 18,480,000 provision for contingent consideration from 2012 was mainly paid in the current year Medicel AG: 9,990,000 and Avo Photonics, Inc. : 7,059,000.

Dilapidations and empty property provisions Dilapidations and empty property provisions exist where the Group has lease contracts under which the unavoidable costs of meeting its obligations under the contracts exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under them.
The provisions comprise the Directors best estimates of future payments: a to restore the fabric of buildings to their original condition where it is a condition of the leases prior to return of the properties: and b on vacant properties, the rental costs of which are not expected to be recoverable from subleasing the properties.
These commitments cover the period from 2013 to 2028, though they predominantly fall due within five years.
Product warranty Product warranty provisions reflect commitments made to customers on the sale of goods in the ordinary course of business and included within the Group companies standard terms and conditions.
Warranty commitments cover a period of between one and five years and typically apply for a 12-month period.
The provision represents the Directors best estimate of the Groups liability based on past experience.
Legal, contractual and other Legal, contractual and other comprise mainly amounts reserved against open legal and contractual disputes.
The Company has on occasion been required to take legal or other actions to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties.
Provisions are made for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking into account professional advice received, and represent Directors best estimate of the likely outcome.
The timing of utilisation of these provisions is frequently uncertain reflecting the complexity of issues and the outcome of various court proceedings and negotiations.
Contractual and other provisions represent the Directors best estimate of the cost of settling future obligations.
Unless specific evidence exists to the contrary, these reserves are shown as current.
However, no provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties against Group companies unless the Directors, taking into account professional advice received, assesses that it is more likely than not that such proceedings may be successful.

The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2013 2012 000 000 Deferred tax liability 49,197 26,258 Deferred tax asset 28,749 11,039 Net deferred tax liability 20,448 15,219 112 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Overview 02-09 Business review 10-59 Go Gov five ern rnan ance ce 60 60- -8 86 6 Financial statements 87-147 21 Deferred tax continued Movement in deferred tax liability: 2013 2012 000 000 At beginning of year 15,219 13,490 Charge credit to Consolidated Income Statement: UK 2,261 760 Overseas 2,172 611 Credit charge to Consolidated statement of comprehensive income 4,930 11 Credit charge to equity 5 206 Acquired note 24 9,208 1,762 Business sold 94 37 Exchange adjustments 961 138 At end of year 20,448 15,219 The Finance Act 2013, which provides for a reduction in the main rate of corporation tax from 24% to 23% effective from 1 April 2013, was substantively enacted on 3 July 2012.
This rate reduction has been reflected in the calculation of deferred tax at the balance sheet date.
The Government intends to enact future reductions in the main tax rate down to 20% by 1 April 2015.
As this tax rate was not substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, the rate reduction is not yet reflected in these financial statements in accordance with IAS 10, as it is a non-adjusting event occurring after the reporting period.
However, for indicative purposes only, had the UK main corporate tax rate been reduced to 20% the net impact on recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities at 30 March 2013 would not have been material.
It is likely that the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries would qualify for the UK dividend exemption such that no UK tax would be due upon remitting those earnings to the UK.
However, 22,739,000 2012: 13,561,000 of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of the dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.
These tax liabilities are not expected to exceed 3,025,000 2012: 2,025,000 of which only 315,000 has been provided as the Group is able to control the timing of the dividends.
It is not expected that further amounts will crystallise in the foreseeable future.
Temporary timing differences in connection with interests in associates are insignificant.
At 30 March 2013 the Group had unused capital tax losses of 550,000 2012: 574,000 for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Changes during the year in the issued ordinary share capital were as follows: Issued and fully paid 000 At 1 April 2012 37,856 Share options exercised 32 At 30 March 2013 37,888 The total consideration received in cash in respect of share options exercised amounted to 453,000.
At 30 March 2013 options in respect of 1,261,444 2012: 2,160,900 ordinary shares remained outstanding.
Further details of these are given in note 23 to the accounts.
At the date of these accounts, the number of ordinary shares in issue was 378,880,622 including treasury shares of 1,303,209.
Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 113 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 23 Share-based payments The total cost recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of share-based payment schemes the employee share plans was as follows: 2013 2012  settled Total settled settled Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Share incentive plan 490 490 572 572 Share option plans 26 26 Performance share plan 2,723 429 3,152 2,373 436 2,809 3,213 429 3,642 2,919 436 3,355 The Group has recorded liabilities of 386,000 2012: 432,000 in respect of the cash settled portion of the awards granted under the performance share plan.
Share incentive plan Shares awarded under this Plan are purchased in the market by the Plans trustees at the time of the award and are held in trust until their transfer to qualifying employees, which is conditional upon completion of three years service.
The costs of providing this Plan are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the three-year vesting period.
Share option plans The Group has outstanding issued options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company under a share option plan, approved by shareholders in 1999.
This share option plan provided for the grant of two categories of option, both of which are subject to performance criteria.
No further awards have been made under the Company share option plan since 3 August 2005.
All options lapse if not exercised within 10 years from the date of grant.
Options in respect of 1,261,444 ordinary shares remained outstanding at 30 March 2013.
Options over 325,594 ordinary shares were exercised in the year and options over a further 573,862 ordinary shares lapsed in the year.
The weighted average option price of the 332,711 exercisable options at the end of the year was 140.6p: the remaining 928,733 options, which are not yet exercisable, have a weighted average option price of 138.8p.
Performance share plan The performance share plan was approved by shareholders on 3 August 2005 and replaced the previous share option plans from which no further grants can be made.
Awards made under this Plan vest after three years on a sliding scale subject to the Groups relative Total Shareholder Return against the FTSE250 excluding financial companies, combined with an absolute Return on Total Invested Capital measure.
Awards which do not vest on the third anniversary of their award will lapse.
A summary of the movements in share awards granted under the performance share plan is as follows: 2013 2012 Number of Number of shares shares awarded awarded Outstanding at beginning of year 4,133,342 4,385,681 Granted during the year 1,341,209 1,415,044 Vested during the year pro-rated for good leavers 1,558,091 1,513,266 Lapsed during the year 114,145 154,117 Outstanding at end of year 3,802,315 4,133,342 Exercisable at end of year The weighted average share price at the date of awards vesting during the year was 407.1p 2012: 369.4p.
The performance shares outstanding at 30 March 2013 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.4 years 2012: 1.3 years.
The fair value of these awards was calculated using an appropriate simulation method to reflect the likelihood of the market-based performance conditions, which attach to half of the award, being met, using the following assumptions: 2013 2012 2011 Expected volatility % 26% 27% 27% Expected life years 3 3 3 Share price on date of grant p 399.9 362.34 281.08 Option price p Nil nil nil Fair value per option % 55.3% 68.6% 66.9% Fair value per option p 223.25 248.57 188.04 The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three years.

The amount of gross contractual receivables not expected to be recovered is immaterial.
There are no material contingent liabilities recognised in accordance with paragraph 23 of IFRS 3 revised.
68,613,000 of the goodwill arising on acquisitions in the year is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Together, the six acquisitions contributed 41,310,000 of revenue and 7,429,000 of profit after tax for the period ended 30 March 2013.
If these acquisitions had been held since the start of the financial year, it is estimated the Groups reported revenue and profit after tax would have been 24,860,000 and 4,324,000 higher respectively.
Adjustments were made to the book values of the net assets of the companies acquired to reflect their provisional fair values to the Group.
Acquired inventories were valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value adopting Group bases and any liabilities for warranties relating to past trading were recognised.
Other previously unrecognised assets and liabilities at acquisition were included and accounting policies were aligned with those of the Group where appropriate.
There were no adjustments to prior year acquisitions.

Sensorex, based in California, USA, manufactures electrochemical sensors for water analysis applications.
Sensorex forms part of the Environmental & Analysis sector and was acquired for its range of sensors and associated accessories, which are incorporated by OEMs manufacturing single and multi-parameter probes and instruments for monitoring water quality, a market that is forecast to see continued growth.
The excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the assets acquired is represented by customer-related intangibles of 9,998,000 and technological know-how intangibles of 2,691,000 with residual goodwill arising of 9,739,000.
The goodwill represents: a the value of the acquired workforce: b potential synergies with other Halma companies within the Water market, especially the hubs in China and India: and c the ability to exploit the Groups existing distribution arrangements, particularly outside the USA.
There are no contingent consideration payment arrangements.

No complex derivative financial instruments are used, and no trading or speculative transactions in financial instruments are undertaken.
Where the Group does use financial instruments these are mainly to manage the currency risks arising from normal operations and its financing.
Operations are financed mainly through retained profits and, in certain geographical locations, bank borrowings.
Foreign currency risk is the most significant aspect for the Group in the area of financial instruments.
It is exposed to a lesser extent to other risks such as interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these policies are summarised below.
The Groups policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the financial year.
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the bases of recognition income and expenses for each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in the Accounting policies note.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 18 to the Accounts, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk as a consequence of both trading with foreign companies and owning subsidiaries located in foreign countries.
The Group earns a significant proportion of its profit in currencies other than Sterling.
This gives rise to translational currency risk, where the Sterling value of profits earned by the Groups foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with the strength of Sterling relative to their operating or functional currencies.
The Group does not hedge this risk, so its reported profit is sensitive to the strength of Sterling, particularly against the US Dollar and Euro.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures.
These arise on sales or purchases by operating companies in currencies other than the companies operating or functional currency.
Significant sales and purchases are matched where possible and a proportion of the net exposure is hedged by means of forward foreign currency contracts.
The Group has a significant investment in overseas operations in the USA and EU, with further investments in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland, China and India.
As a result, the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries exchange rates.
Where significant and appropriate, currency denominated net assets are hedged by currency borrowings.
These currency exposures are reviewed regularly.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and cash deposits.
Where bank borrowings are used to finance operations they tend to be short term with floating interest rates.
Borrowings used to provide longer term funding are drawn on the Groups loan facilities and have fixed interest rates with maturities of not more than one year.
Surplus funds are placed on short-term fixed rate deposit or in floating rate deposit accounts.
Credit risk Credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
Credit ratings are supplied by independent agencies where available, and if not available, the Group uses other publicly available financial information and its own trading records to rate its major customers.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed regularly.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased.
The carrying amount of trade, tax and other receivables, derivative financial instruments and cash of 183,653,000 2012: 160,736,000 represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk as no collateral or other credit enhancements are held.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high creditratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 123 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 26 Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk On 20 October 2011, the Group signed a new unsecured five-year revolving credit facility for 260m.
This replaced the previous 165m facility which was due to expire in February 2013.
This facility is the main source of long-term funding for the Group to October 2016, and is with a syndicate of five banks.
The Group has a strong cash flow and the funds generated by operating companies are managed regionally based on geographic location.
Funds are placed on deposit with secure, highly-rated banks.
For short-term working capital purposes, most operating companies utilise local bank overdrafts.
These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.
Because of the nature of their use, the facilities are typically on demand and as such uncommitted.
Overdraft facilities are typically renewed annually.
Currency exposures Translational exposures It is estimated, by reference to the Groups US Dollar and Euro denominated profits, that a one per cent change in the value of the US Dollar relative to Sterling would have had a 464,000 2012: 353,000 impact on the Groups reported profit before tax: and a one per cent change in the value of the Euro relative to the Sterling would have had a 186,000 2012: 227,000 impact on the Groups profit before tax for the year ended 30 March 2013.
Transactional exposures The Group has net foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities that are assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of the underlying company.
These comprise cash and overdrafts as well as certain trade receivable and payable balances.
These foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as a result of movement in exchange rates.
The exposures are predominantly Euro and US Dollar.
Group policy is for a significant portion of foreign currency exposures, including sales and purchases, to be hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts in the company in which the transaction is recorded.
Interest rate risk profile The Groups financial assets which are subject to interest rate fluctuations comprise interest bearing cash equivalents which totalled 1,703,000 at 30 March 2013 2012: 4,006,000.
These comprised Sterling denominated deposits of 2,000 2012: 4,002,000, and Euro, US Dollar and Renminbi deposits of 1,701,000 2012: 4,000 which are placed on local money markets and earn interest at market rates.
Cash balances of 48,020,000 2012: 41,299,000 earn interest at local market rates.
The financial liabilities which are subject to interest rate fluctuations comprise bank loans, bank overdrafts, a loan note and certain unsecured loans, which totalled 160,013,000 at 30 March 2013 2012: 64,014,000.
All bank loans and the loan note bear interest at floating rates or fixed rates where the fixed period is typically no more than three months.
Interest rates are based on the LIBOR of the currency in which the liabilities arise plus a small margin.
Bank overdrafts bear interest at local base rates.
2013 2012 000 000 Analysis of interest bearing financial liabilities Sterling denominated bank loans 109,000 47,000 US Dollar denominated bank loans 34,540 Swiss Franc denominated bank loans 13,958 17,014 Sterling denominated loan note 2,515 Total bank loans 160,013 64,014 At 30 March 2013 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would reduce the Groups profit before tax by 1,281,000 2012: 892,000.
Maturity of financial liabilities With the exception of the contingent purchase consideration, other payables, provisions and borrowings due after one year, all of the Groups financial liabilities mature in one year or less or on demand.
The total of the contractual contingent purchase consideration due after one year includes 7,030,000 2012: 10,452,000 due between one and two years, and the balance of 12,626,000 2012: 178,000 due between two and five years.
Other creditors due after more than one year include 1,231,000 2012: 1,017,000 due between one and two years, 1,126,000 2012: 1,088,000 due between two and five years, with the balance of 636,000 2012: 653,000 due after more than five years.

Short-term operational funding is provided by cash generated from operations and by local bank overdrafts.
These overdraft facilities are uncommitted and are generally renewed on an annual or ongoing basis and hence the facilities expire within one year or less.
UK companies have cross-guaranteed 17,025,000 2012: 17,370,000 of overdraft facilities of which nil 2012: nil was drawn.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities As at 30 March 2013 and 31 March 2012 there were no significant differences between the book value and fair value as determined by market value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities.
The fair value of floating and fixed rate borrowings approximate to the carrying value because interest rates are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow, using readily available market data and represents a level 2 measurement in the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.
Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 125 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 26 Financial instruments continued Hedging As explained previously, the Groups policy is to hedge significant sales and purchases denominated in foreign currency using forward currency contracts.
These instruments are initially recognised at fair value, which is typically nil, and subsequent changes in fair value are taken to the Consolidated Income Statement, unless hedge accounted.
The following table details the forward foreign currency contracts outstanding as at the year end, which mostly mature within one year and therefore the cash flows and resulting effect on profit and loss are expected to occur within the next 12 months: Average exchange rate Foreign currency Contract value Fair value 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 000 000 000 000 000 000 Forward contracts not in a designated cash flow hedge US Dollars 1.56 1.58 3,841 2,123 2,237 1,347 53 20 Euros 1.16 1.19 783 3,049 673 2,552 15 11 Other currencies 486 524 2 6 3,396 4,423 40 37 Forward contracts in a designated cash flow hedge US Dollars 1.59 1.57 8,051 6,878 5,069 4,391 243 87 Euros 1.22 1.16 9,651 10,949 7,878 9,476 294 335 Czech Koruna 30.15 28.74 93,595 90,000 3,105 3,132 67 114 Other currencies 155 524 30 2 9,687 10,211 500 306 Total forward contracts US Dollars 1.58 1.57 11,532 9,001 7,306 5,738 296 107 Euros 1.22 1.16 10,434 13,998 8,551 12,028 279 346 Czech Koruna 30.15 28.74 93,595 90,000 3,105 3,132 67 114 Other currencies 331 32 4 13,083 14,634 540 343 Amounts recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement 223 156 Amounts recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure 317 187 540 343 The fair values of the forward contracts are disclosed as a 256,000 2012: 469,000 asset and 796,000 2012: 126,000 liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk, including: forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the export of goods to and from the USA, mainland Europe and the UK: and foreign exchange loans to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on translation of the Groups investment in foreign operations which have the Euro and Swiss Franc as their functional currencies.
Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis as described below.
There has been no change to the Groups exposure to market risks or in the manner in which these risks are managed and measured.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group is mainly exposed to the currency of the USA US Dollar currency and the currency of Mainland Europe Euro currency.
The carrying amount of the Groups Euro and US Dollar denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Assets Liabilities 2013 2012 2013 2012 000 000 000 000 Euro 66,232 64,384 14,731 15,062 US Dollar 151,290 98,487 49,130 27,634 If Sterling increased by 10% against the US Dollar and the Euro, profits before taxation and other equity would decrease as follows: US Dollar Euro 2013 2012 2013 2012 000 000 000 000 Profit 4,263 3,246 1,708 2,081 Other equity 8,595 6,075 4,720 4,503 The profit sensitivity arises mainly from the translation of overseas profits earned during the year.
10% is the sensitivity rate which management assesses to be a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups profit sensitivity has increased against the US Dollar because more of the Groups profits are earned in this currency.
27 Commitments Capital commitments Capital expenditure authorised and contracted at 30 March 2013 but not recognised in these accounts amounts to 1,117,000 2012: 877,000.
Commitments under operating leases The Group has entered into commercial leases on properties and other equipment.
The former expire between April 2013 and November 2028 and the latter between April 2013 and January 2016.
Only certain property agreements contain an option for renewal at rental prices based on market prices at the time of exercise.
Total payments under non-cancellable operating leases will be made as follows: Land and buildings Other 2013 2012 2013 2012 000 000 000 000 Within one year 7,410 6,093 693 441 Within two to five years 17,424 15,274 602 695 After five years 3,374 4,558 28,208 25,925 1,295 1,136 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 127 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 28 Retirement benefits Group companies operate both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The Halma Group Pension Plan and the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan have defined benefit sections with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
Both of these sections were closed to new entrants during 2002 03 and a defined contribution section was established within the Halma Group Pension Plan.
Defined contribution schemes are mainly adopted in overseas subsidiaries.
Defined contribution schemes The amount charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of defined contribution schemes was 3,658,000 2012: 2,877,000 and represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
Where there are employees who leave the schemes prior to vesting fully in the contributions, the ancillary contributions payable by the Group are reduced by the amount of forfeited contributions.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operates defined benefit schemes for qualifying employees of its UK subsidiaries.
Under the schemes, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits of up to two-thirds of final pensionable salary on attainment of a retirement age of 60, for members of the Executive Board, and 65, for all other qualifying employees.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.
The schemes are funded schemes.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Halma Group Pension Plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation was carried out at 1 December 2011 by Mr Adrian Gibbons, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and the past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
Mr Gibbons also carried out the 1 April 2012 actuarial valuation of the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan on the same basis.
The projected unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the scheme liabilities make allowance for projected earnings.
The accumulated benefit obligation ABO is an actuarial measure of the present value for service already rendered but differs from the projected unit credit method in that it includes no assumptions for future salary increases.
At the balance sheet date the gross accumulated benefit obligation was 223m.
An alternative method of valuation is a solvency basis, often estimated using the cost of buying out benefits at the balance sheet date with a suitable insurance company.
This amount represents the amount that would be required to settle the scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date rather than the Group continuing to fund the ongoing liabilities of the scheme.
The Group estimates that this would amount to 370m 2012: 315m.

To reflect population characteristics a one year age deduction has been adopted for Halma but no adjustment was made for Apollo.
From 2013, a long-term improvement rate of 1.25% per annum was incorporated.

In July 2010, the UK government announced that CPI should be used as the basis for statutory minimum pension increases.
The impact of the change to CPI from RPI for the UK plan, where the pension rules mandate inflation according to the deemed statutory index, was a credit to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure of nil 2012: 1.0m.
In conjunction with the trustees, the Group conducts asset-liability reviews for its defined benefit pension scheme.
The results of these reviews are used to assist the trustees and the Group to determine the optimal long-term asset allocation with regard to the structure of the liabilities of the scheme.
They are also used to assist the trustees in managing the volatility in the underlying investment performance and risk of a significant increase in the defined benefit deficit by providing information used to determine the schemes investment strategy.
As a consequence, the Group is progressively giving more emphasis to a closer return matching of scheme assets and liabilities, both to ensure the long-term security of our defined benefit commitment and to reduce earnings and balance sheet volatility.

The levels of contributions are based on the current service cost and the expected future cash flows of the defined benefit scheme.
The Group estimates the scheme liabilities on average to fall due over 20 and 27 years, respectively, for the Halma and Apollo plans.
29 Disposal of business On 22 August 2012, the Group disposed of two businesses within its Process Safety sector, Tritech Holdings Limited and its subsidiary Tritech International Limited together known as Tritech, for an initial cash consideration of 18,900,000.
A further 839,000 was received in October 2012 in respect of cash and working capital held in the business at the time of sale.
In addition, 2,100,000 is retained in escrow and will be released to Halma on the anniversary of the transaction subject to any valid warranty indemnity claims being made by the purchaser.
The Directors estimate that the entire 2,100,000 will be received.
The profit on disposal is estimated to be 8,070,000, being the total 21,839,000 consideration above less 1,435,000 of transaction costs of which 86,000 related to a prior year disposal, 8,009,000 of goodwill and 4,325,000 of net assets.
The cash inflow in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement of 19,608,000 comprises 19,739,000 initial consideration for Tritech and 1,500,000 released from escrow for the prior year disposal of Volumatic Limited less 1,435,000 of transaction costs and 196,000 cash held by the disposed business.
The profit on disposal of 3,543,000 million and cash inflow of 3,554,000 in the 52 weeks to 31 March 2012 related entirely to the disposal of Volumatic Limited on 30 March 2012.
Tritech and Volumatic Limited have not been separately disclosed as discontinued operations as defined by IFRS 5 due to their nature and size.
30 Events after the balance sheet date On 11 April 2013 the Group acquired Talentum Developments Limited Talentum.
Contingent consideration of 250,000 is payable on or around April 2014 subject to the seller providing certain pre-agreed technical information and know-how to the Group.
