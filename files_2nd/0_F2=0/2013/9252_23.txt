Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 1 Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRS The Groups financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 27 February 2014 and the statement of financial position was signed on the Boards behalf by D C Lockwood and J C Silver.
Laird PLC is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales and its ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The Groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted for use in the European Union IFRS and the principal accounting policies adopted by the Group are set out in note 2.
2 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, that have been measured at fair value, and accounting for pensions.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand unless otherwise indicated.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the directors to make judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported income and expense during the reporting periods.
Although these judgements and assumptions are based on the directors best knowledge of the amount, events or actions, actual results may differ from these estimates.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are the measurement and impairment of goodwill, the measurement of defined benefit pension assets and obligations and the measurement of income and deferred taxes.
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired on an annual basis and this requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which the intangible assets are allocated.
This involves estimation of future cash flows and choosing a suitable discount rate see note 17.
Measurement of defined benefit pension obligations requires estimation of future changes in salaries and inflation, as well as mortality rates and the selection of a suitable discount rate see note 35.
The Group is subject to income taxes in a number of tax jurisdictions and judgements are applied in deciding the level of provisions for income taxes.
To the extent that the final outcome differs from the tax that has been provided, adjustments will be made to provisions held in the period the determination is made.
The directors continue to adopt the going concern basis for accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
The directors have areasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The accounting policies set out below have been used to prepare the financial information.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated Group comprises Laird PLC and its subsidiary undertakings the Group.
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared as of the same reporting date as the parent, using consistent accounting policies where appropriate.
Intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are included until the date on which the Group ceases to control them.
All business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of a business combination is measured as the aggregate of the fair values, at the acquisition date, of any assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group.
For acquisitions before 1 January 2010, costs directly attributable to the combination were capitalised.
The identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree are measured initially at fair value at the acquisition date.
The excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, including those of an intangible and tangible nature and liabilities is recognised as goodwill.

indd 96 07 03 2014 19:37 2 Accounting policies continued Currency translation The financial statements for each of the Groups subsidiaries are prepared using its functional currency.
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates.
The presentation currency of the Group is Sterling.
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
In the Group accounts the results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries are translated into Sterling using weighted average rates of exchange for the period.
Net investments in overseas subsidiaries are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising from retranslating opening net investments and the retained profits for the period of overseas subsidiaries, less exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against overseas investments, are shown as movements in equity.
All other exchange differences are dealt with in the income statement for the period.
Exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised as a separate component of shareholders equity.
On disposal of a foreign operation, any cumulative exchange differences held in shareholders equity that relate to the disposed operation are transferred to the income statement.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received and excludes intra-group sales and value-added taxes and represents net invoice value.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a third party, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group.
Retirement benefit obligations Under IAS 19 the assets and liabilities of defined benefit pension plans are recognised at fair value in the statement of financial position and the operating and financing costs of defined benefit pension plans are recognised in the income statement as operating costs and interest costs respectively.
Variations from expected costs, arising from the experience of the plans or changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of defined benefit obligation and is based on actuarial advice.
The assets of defined benefit plans are recognised at fair value in the statement of financial position and the liabilities are recognised at present value using a high quality corporate bond rate.
The Group applies IFRIC 14, which allows the Group to recognise a surplus in schemes where an unconditional right to a refund or benefit available in the form of reduced contribution rates exists.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they become payable.
The Group applied IAS 19 Revised 2011 retrospectively in the current period in accordance with the transitional provisions set out in the revised standard.
IAS 19 Revised 2011 changes, amongst other things, the accounting for defined benefit plans.
The interest cost and expected return on plan assets used in the previous version of IAS 19 are replaced with a net-interest amount under IAS 19 Revised 2011, which is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset at the start of each annual reporting period.
IAS 19 Revised 2011 also requires more extensive disclosures.
These have been provided in note 35.
IAS 19 Revised 2011 has been applied retrospectively, with following permitted exceptions: The carrying amounts of other assets have not been adjusted for changes in employee benefit costs that were included before 1 January 2012.
Sensitivity disclosures for the defined benefit obligation for comparative period year ended 31 December 2012 have not been provided.

indd 97 11 03 2014 18:08 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2013 2 Accounting policies continued Share based payments The fair value of Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, Medium Term Incentive Plan MTIP and Restricted Share Plan RSP shares awarded is estimated at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the LTIP, MTIP and RSP shares were awarded including market based performance conditions.
The fair value of share options granted is estimated at the date of grant using a binomial lattice method of calculation, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which share options were granted.
Non-market company performance and service conditions are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.
No expense is recognised for grants that do not vest and charges previously made are reversed except that an expense is recognised for grants where vesting is conditional upon a market condition and these are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided all the other vesting conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions, the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms for an equity settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share based payment, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
In circumstances where the equity settled grant is cancelled or settled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation or settlement, and any expense not yet recognised for the grant is recognised immediately.
Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets, including patents, trade secrets, brand names and customer relationships, are recognised separately from goodwill and capitalised at fair value and amortised over their estimated useful economic lives.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis.
The estimated useful life of an intangible asset ranges between 3 and 20 years depending on its nature.
Research and development Research and development expenditure is expensed as it is incurred, except for certain development costs, which are capitalised as intangible assets when it is probable that the development project will be commercially viable, and certain criteria, including commercial and technological feasibility, have been met.
Intangible assets arising in this manner are amortised over their useful economic lives, from the product launch date, which is typically around four years.
Intangible assets relating to products in the development phase, both internally generated and externally acquired, are subject to an impairment review at each balance sheet date, or earlier should indication of impairment arise.
Any impairment losses are written off immediately to the income statement.
Goodwill On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets acquired.
Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration given for a business exceeds the fair value of such net assets.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill set off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.

indd 98 07 03 2014 19:37 2 Accounting policies continued Income taxes Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions: where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction effects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement or statement of comprehensive income.
Dividends Dividends paid are charged to retained earnings on the earlier of the date of payment or the date on which they become a legal liability of the Company.
Interest Interest is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost comprises the purchase price and directly attributable costs, for example, initial delivery and handling costs and installation and assembly costs.
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated.
For all other property, plant, and equipment depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to allocate cost less residual values of the assets over their useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years or less Leasehold buildings 50 years or the lease term if less Computer equipment 5 years or less Motor vehicles 4 years Other plant and machinery 13 years or less A proportion of one years depreciation is charged in the year the asset comes into service or is sold.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at least at each financial year end.

indd 99 07 03 2014 19:37 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2013 2 Accounting policies continued Impairment of assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cash-generating units fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
This is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
If the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs is determined.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Leases Where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset subject to a lease, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
All other leases are treated as operating leases, and the related charges are expensed to the income statement evenly over the lease term.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and included in property, plant and equipment at fair value.
Each asset is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset.
The obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance charges in respect of future periods, are included as appropriate under current, or non-current, trade and other payables.
The interest element of the rental obligation is allocated to accounting periods during the lease term to reflect a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the obligation for each accounting period.
Segment reporting Segments are identified on the basis of management information which is presented to the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker to assess the performance of each segment.
Exceptional items These items are presented within the relevant income statement category.
The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide a better indication of the Groups underlying business performance.
Events which are considered to be material and one-off in nature, and therefore may give rise to the classification of items as exceptional, include the restructuring of businesses, the transaction costs of acquiring new businesses, gains or losses on the reassessment of estimated contingent consideration on acquired businesses, the integration of new businesses, gains or losses on the disposal of businesses, and asset impairments.
Financial assets Financial assets include cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables.
Trade and other receivables are recognised on the trade date, being the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset and are measured at amortised cost less any provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice.
The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account.
Impaired debts are derecognised when they are assessed as irrecoverable.
Trade and other receivables are discounted when the time value of money is considered material.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired.
Derivative financial assets are classified as held for trading, unless they are designated as hedging instruments.
These assets are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses in value being recognised in the income statement.
A financial asset or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is derecognised where: the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: or the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either a has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

indd 100 07 03 2014 19:37 2 Accounting policies continued Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less, in the case of a liability not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Measurement after initial recognition is at amortised cost, with the changes in the carrying amount being taken through the income statement.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income and finance expense.
All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging The Group may use derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the income statement.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
In accordance with the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7 these are Level 2 derivative financial instruments.
For those contracts designated as hedges the hedging relationship is documented at its inception.
This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration.
Such hedges are tested, both at inception to ensure they are expected to be effective, and periodically throughout their duration to assess continuing effectiveness.
Cash flow hedges These are used to hedge potential changes in cash flows of highly probable forecast transactions.
For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the fair value movement on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs.
Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are transferred to the income statement or to the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above.
If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to profit or loss.
Net investment hedges These are used to hedge exposure to changes in the value of the Groups interests in the net assets of foreign operations.
The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in shareholders equity, with any ineffective portion recognised in the income statement.
Fair value measurement IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements.
IFRS 13 does not change when an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under IFRS.
IFRS 13 defines fair value as an exit price.
As a result of the guidance in IFRS 13, the Group reassessed its policies for measuring fair values, in particular, its valuation inputs such as non-performance risk for fair value measurement of liabilities.
IFRS 13 also requires additional disclosures.
Application of IFRS 13 has not materially impacted the fair value measurements of the Group.
Additional disclosures where required, are provided in the individual notes relating to the assets and liabilities whose fair values were determined.
Fair value hierarchy is provided in note 28.

Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash in the statement of financial position comprises cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity in three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
For finished goods and work in progress, cost includes directly attributable costs and certain overhead expenses principally administration costs are excluded.
Net realisable value is determined as estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Provisions These comprise liabilities of uncertain timing or amount.
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted where the time value of money is material.

indd 114 07 03 2014 19:37 17 Intangible assets continued Capitalised development costs Internally generated assets arising from the capitalisation of qualifying development expenditure in 2013 typically have a finite expected useful life of around four years.
Capitalised development expenditure is amortised on a straight line basis.
All amortisation charges for the year have been charged against operating profits.
The total amount of research and development activity incurred during 2013 is 47.6m 2012, 37.4m of which 11.6m 2012, 8.5m was capitalised.
Goodwill Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed annually for assessment of impairment in accordance with IAS 36.
No impairment to goodwill was identified.
Goodwill was tested for impairment for the following cash generating units CGUs : Performance Materials division Wireless Systems division Performance Materials had a goodwill balance of 237.4m at the year end 2012, 227.6m.
Wireless Systems had a goodwill balance of 187.7m at the year end 2012, 190.7m.
All of the recoverable amounts are based on value in use.
The key assumptions were: a pre-tax discount rate of 11.6% 2012, 11.6%.
revenue growth rates for each CGU were based on relevant external market estimates and management knowledge.
The discount rate has been applied to cash flow forecasts for 2014 to perpetuity.
The forecast cash flows for 2014 and 2015 are based on what has been approved internally by the Board for the 2014 budget.
Revenue estimates which underpin the forecasts for 20162018, have been based on external market estimates for PCs, tablets, smartphones, transportation and telecoms but after reflecting managements views of average selling prices, product penetration trends and their impact on the size of the addressable market.
Cash flows for 2018 onwards for both divisions have been increased by 3% per annum 2012, 3% per annum.
Downside sensitivities have been applied to the cash flow estimates to assess the impact upon the headroom over the carrying value of the assets and provide further comfort that no impairment is required.
Performance Materials has the greatest amount of headroom and Wireless Systems the least.
Revenues would have to be some 15% less than forecast for each period before some form of impairment would have to be considered.
Other acquired intangible assets Assets in this class are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis.
The following useful lives have been determined for acquired intangible assets: Brand names 5 years Trade secrets 8 to 15 years Trade marks and names 5 to 15 years Patents the remaining duration of the 17-year legal right Licence the remaining duration of the 20-year legal right Customer relationships 10 to 20 years The expected life assigned to acquired customer relationships is an estimate and is not secured by any legal obligation on the customer to continue business with the Group for any finite period.
Other than goodwill, the Group does not hold any intangible assets with an indefinite life.

The maximum contingent consideration payable is 38.3m $60m if 95.8m $150m of revenue is achieved.
This purchase has been accounted for as an acquisition and all intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values.
The fair values are provisional.
The residual excess over the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.
Book and fair values of the net assets of the business acquired, stated at rates of exchange at the date of acquisition, were as follows: Provisional Book fair values values to the Group m m Property, plant and equipment 0.5 0.5 Intangible assets Trade and other receivables 0.1 0.1 Trade and other payables 0.8 0.8 Net liabilities acquired 0.2 0.2 Goodwill arising on acquisition 12.4 Consideration 12.2 Consideration satisfied by: Cash consideration Net cash acquired 0.1 Contingent consideration 12.0 11.9 Borrowings acquired 0.3 12.2 The Group has acquired a 100% interest in the acquisition noted above.
Revenue for the entity acquired was 0.2m following acquisition.
Loss before tax, on both an underlying and an IFRS basis, was 1.7 m following acquisition.
If the acquisition had been held for the full year, revenues would have been unchanged at 537.0m and the profit before tax would have been 0.5m lower at 42.7m.
Included in the 12.4m of goodwill recognised above are certain assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured due to their nature, including the expected value of synergies.
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The estimate of contingent consideration has been reduced to 6.9m as at 31 December 2013 after a reassessment of likely revenues over the four year measurement period from 2014 onwards.
The reduction in estimated contingent consideration of 4.7m at an average exchange rate against the US Dollar has been credited to the income statement.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised on other deductible temporary differences of 30.6m 2012, 24.5m where their use is restricted indefinitely.
Temporary differences associated with Group investments Deferred tax of 1.3m 2012, 1.3m has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries where it is likely there will be income tax consequences attached to the payment of dividends.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of temporary differences of 16.9m 2012, 21.5m relating to the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences at 31 December 2013 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by overseas tax jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.
Factors affecting future tax charges The UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 21% effective 1 April 2014 and 20% effective 1 April 2015.
Disclosure of deferred tax has been adjusted to reflect the enactment of the revised rates but with no significant impact on these financial statements.
These changes had been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are included in these financial statements.

The forward contracts have a principal value of 105.0m 2012, 70.0m and are mainly denominated in US Dollar and Chinese Renminbi.
These contracts have not been designated as cash flow hedges and the increase in fair value during 2013 of 1.3m 2012, 0.4m decrease has been taken to the income statement.
These are Level 2 derivative financial instruments and there has been no movement between levels during the year.

indd 124 07 03 2014 19:37 28 Financial instruments continued Contingent consideration The consideration to acquire Nextreme Thermal Solutions Inc. see note 18 included estimated contingent consideration of 12.0m based on future revenue targets being met.
m Initial fair value of the contingent consideration on acquisition 12.0 Fair value adjustment note 7 4.7 Exchange adjustment 0.4 Non-current liability for contingent consideration as at 31 December 2013 6.9 The key assumptions in estimating the fair value are revenue projections for Nextreme from 2014 to 2017, a potential earnout payment based on a multiple of 0.4 times revenue and a discount rate applied as at 31 December 2013 being a 4.5 year UK government bond yield.
The contingent consideration is sensitive to changes in these assumptions.
For example, an increase of 10% in revenue projections would result in an increase in contingent consideration of 0.7m and a decrease of 1% in the discount rate would result in an increase in contingent consideration of 0.2m.
This liability for contingent consideration is a Level 3 derivative financial instrument under IFRS 7.
Interest rate and currency profile The Groups policy is to maintain an appropriate balance between variable and fixed interest rate borrowings.
Interest rate swaps and similar instruments are used to manage interest costs.
At 31 December 2013 approximately 52% of debt is at fixed rate.
This position is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure it is still appropriate.
Interest rate risk The following table shows the sensitivity to a change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
There is no impact on the Groups equity.
The interest rates considered are Sterling, Euro and US Dollar, being the currencies in which the Group have historically issued debt and held investments.
The sensitivity analysis excludes all non-derivative fixed rate financial instruments carried at amortised cost but includes those recognised at fair value as well as all non-derivative floating rate financial instruments.

indd 125 07 03 2014 19:37 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2013 28 Financial instruments continued Credit risk The Groups customer base is largely focused in the global electronics market where it has leading positions in its principal products with customers who themselves have significant market shares.
Inevitably this results in levels of business and trade receivables that are material in the overall Group context.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying amount of the financial assets.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to transactional currency exposures on sales and purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US Dollar, Euro and Renminbi.
The Group policy is to match out the sales and purchases in these currencies wherever possible and then hedge out the residual exposures.
The following table shows the sensitivity to a possible change in US Dollar, Euro and Renminbi exchange rates against sterling with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets, liabilities and forward currency contracts and the Groups equity due to changes in the fair value of forward currency hedges and net investment hedges.
Effect on profit Effect on before tax equity m m 2013 10% appreciation of the US Dollar 6.2 12.1 10% appreciation of the Euro 0.6 2.9 10% appreciation of the Renminbi 1.4 2012 10% appreciation of the US Dollar 7.2 13.9 10% appreciation of the Euro 0.6 2.7 10% appreciation of the Renminbi 1.1 A 10% depreciation of the stated currencies would have an equal and opposite effect.
Net investment hedging Included in borrowings are US $200.8m 121.3m and EUR 34.5m 28.7m of debt which have been designated as a hedge of the net investments in the US and Europe subsidiaries.
This is being used to hedge the Groups exposure to foreign exchange risk on these investments.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries.
Liquidity risk The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2013 and 2012 based on contractual undiscounted payments.

The undrawn committed facilities available at 31 December were as follows: 2013 2012 m m Expiring between two and three years 158.1 Expiring between three and four years 144.6 158.1 144.6 Loan covenants The principal covenants in the Groups committed loan facilities and loan note agreements that place restrictions on net borrowings are based on UK GAAP and are set out below: Interest cover The interest cover covenant is for earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax and amortisation EBITA to be not less than 3.0 times interest payable.
Net borrowings: EBITDA ratio Net borrowings must not exceed 3.5 times earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA.
The Group was in compliance with the covenants detailed above at 31 December 2013.
Fair value of financial instruments The US Private Placement loans with a book value of 84.5m 2012, 86.1m have an estimated fair value of 88.8m 2012, 93.4m which has been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing coupon rates as at 31 December 2013.
There are no material differences between fair value and book value on any of the other financial instruments.

The performance conditions for these awards have been measured, for details of the outcome please see page 83, the Directors Remunerations Report.
Performance conditions for awards made in 2012 under the LTIP and Option Plan Performance conditions are measured over a single three-year period and there is no provision for re-testing therefore the awards lapse if the performance targets are not met.
Two measures were used to determine the extent to which awards made in 2012 would vest: achievement of a total shareholder return TSR target and an underlying earnings per share EPS target.

Expected volatility reflects the assumptions that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily prove to be the actual outcome.
Dividends are not payable on shares prior to vesting and this is taken into account in calculating the fair value.
For the share option schemes, no allowance is considered necessary for leavers pre-vesting.

35 Retirement benefit obligations Pension schemes The Group operates a number of pension schemes of both the defined benefit and defined contribution types.
29 employees 2012, 31 are members of four different defined benefit schemes and these schemes have approximately 1,600 2012, 1,600 deferred and current pensioners.
The employer contributions made to these schemes during the year were 0.3m 2012, 0.3m.
The total assessed value of the schemes assets at 31 December 2013, at their market value, is estimated at 103.3m 2012, 102.7m and the liabilities estimated at 104.4m 2011, 100.5m.
The Group has adopted IFRIC 14 which, depending on the rules of individual schemes, allows the Group to recognise pensions surpluses on the statement of financial position where there is an unconditional right to a refund or benefit available in the form of reduced contributions.
The resultant aggregate net pension liability under IAS 19 is 3.7m 2012, 1.5m liability.
Description of the schemes UK In the UK the Group supports the Laird Pension Scheme which is a funded arrangement providing defined benefits on a final salary basis.
The Group also operates an unapproved arrangement which provides unfunded defined benefits on a final salary basis to certain members who were previously subject to the HMRC pension schemes earnings cap.
Both of the UK arrangements are closed to new entrants.
The Laird Pension Scheme makes up approximately 96% of the defined benefit liabilities of the Group.
The Laird Pension Scheme operates under trust law and is managed and administered by the trustee on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed and Rules and relevant legislation.
The scheme is subject to the scheme-specific funding requirements as outlined in UK legislation.
The most recent scheme specific funding valuation was at 1 January 2012.
The Laird Pension Schemes investment strategy is to invest 25% in return-seeking assets and 75% in bonds and annuities.
This strategy reflects the schemes liability profile whilst aiming to minimise long-term costs by maximising return.
The schemes assets are held separately from those of the Group.
Belgium In Belgium the Group operates the Emerson and Cuming Pension Plan which is a funded, insured lump sum defined benefit scheme and the Emerson and Cuming Pre-Pension Plan which is an unfunded plan where the employer pays a monthly indemnity until the retirement date on top of the unemployment allowances paid by the social security.
Germany In Germany the Group operates the Cattron-Theimeg Europe GmbH & Co. KG Pension Plan.
This is a funded defined benefit scheme currently providing pension benefits to seven pensioners 2012, seven.
Sweden Within Sweden, the Group operates a scheme, included within a multiemployer plan, for its employees which is insured with Alecta.
This scheme is a defined benefit scheme, but Alecta is currently unable to provide sufficient information to report the Groups proportional share of the defined benefit commitments and the assets under management and expenses associated with the scheme.
Consequently, Alecta cannot provide the information regarding the Groups proportional share of the surplus or deficit in the scheme.
As a result the scheme is accounted for as if it were a defined contribution scheme, although it is actually a defined benefit scheme.
The benefits provided, the approach to funding and the legal basis of the non UK plans reflect their local environments.
IAS 19 requires that the discount rate is set according to the level of market yields on either corporate or government bonds in the relevant markets.

The mortality assumption used at the 2013 year end and 2012 year end is based on the SAPS all lives tables with a 90% multiplier for executives and directors and 110% for all other members, appropriate for each members year of birth.
Allowance is made for improvements in line with CMI 2011 projections with a 1.5% p. a. long term trend from 2002.

During 2012 the Group acquired Microwave Materials Group NV, which has a defined benefit scheme in Belgium.
The scheme has 24 active members.
Expected cash flows Over the year to 31 December 2014 the Group is expected to contribute 32.3% of pensionable salaries in respect of Ordinary Section members, 58.2% of pensionable salaries in respect of Directors Section members and 53.3% of pensionable salaries in respect of Executive Section members of the Laird Pension Scheme.
In addition, the Group will meet the cost of Pension Protection Levies, death in service premiums and other administration expenses associated with the Laird Pension Scheme.
The Group is expected to make contributions of approximately 0.1m to the Emerson and Cuming Pension Plan and 0.1m to the Swedish scheme insured with Alecta.
The Group estimates that the total value of contributions to the defined benefit schemes will be 0.3m in 2014.
The average duration of the liabilities of the Laird Pension Scheme is approximately 17 years.

indd 136 07 03 2014 19:37 35 Retirement benefit obligations continued Key risks The ultimate cost of the schemes to the Company will depend upon actual future events rather than the assumptions made.
Many of the assumptions made are unlikely to be borne out in practice and as such the cost of the schemes may be higher or lower than disclosed.
In general, the risk to the Group is that the assumptions underlying the disclosures, or the calculation of contribution requirements are not borne out in practice and the cost to the Group is higher than expected.
More specifically, some of the significant risks are detailed below: Asset volatility: The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields, whereas the schemes hold a mixture of investments: if assets underperform the corporate bond yield, this may create a deficit.
Inflation risk: The majority of the benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
Changes in corporate bond yields: A fall in corporate bond yields will lead to an increase in liabilities.
This will be only partially offset by an increase in the value of the corporate bonds held by the schemes.
Sensitivity analysis The results in these disclosures are inherently volatile, particularly the figures shown on the balance sheet.
The table below shows the approximate sensitivity of the balance sheet position to changes in assumptions to illustrate this volatility Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Decrease by 0.5% Increase by 7.5m Decrease by 0.5% Decrease by 6.0m Inflation Increase by 0.5% Increase by 6.5m 0.25% reduction in the long term trend of Assumed life expectancy at age 65 1.5% to 1.25% Decrease by 1.0m Methods and assumptions used in sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses shown above have been calculated based on approximate adjustments to the scheme liabilities using a consistent methodology with that used to calculate the liabilities.
The impact on the liabilities has been rounded to the nearest 0.5m.
The sensitivity analyses to price inflation include the impact of a change in both Retail Price Inflation and Consumer Price Inflation, as well as those assumptions which are derived relative to these measures revaluation of deferred pensions and increases to pensions in payment.
For this purpose it has been assumed that the differences between RPI CPI and these related assumptions remains the same unless there are any caps or floors on the pension increases, in which case these have been applied.
