Vesuvius plc 96 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
General information Vesuvius plc Vesuvius or the company is a public limited company registered in england and Wales and listed on the London Stock exchange.
the nature of the operations and principal activities of the company and its subsidiary and joint venture companies the Group is set out in the Strategic report on pages 10 to 47 and its registered address is shown on page 144.
Basis of preparation 2.1 Basis of accounting the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International financial reporting Standards as adopted by the european Union IfrS and, with the exception of defined benefit pension plans, certain provisions and derivative financial instruments, under the historical cost convention.
2.2 Impact of Cookson Group demerger on comparative financial information disclosure the effect of adopting the principles of reverse acquisition to account for the Scheme of arrangement, by which the demerger of cookson Group plc was implemented, results in a continuation of the consolidated financial statements of cookson, now renamed Vesuvius.
as a consequence of this, the comparative financial statements of Vesuvius include the full results of the alent group of companies up to the date of the demerger becoming effective on 19 december 2012.
In preparing the disclosure of the results of Vesuvius for 2012, the following approach has been applied: i the costs incurred by Vesuvius within its central headquarters for 2012 have been allocated in full between the underlying trading results of continuing and discontinued operations in arriving at the results for Vesuvius as a whole.
ii as Vesuvius holdings Limited formerly cookson Group plc remained with Vesuvius plc after the demerger, all of the borrowings and associated financial derivatives entered into by cookson in the period up to the date of demerger have been treated as belonging to Vesuvius in the comparative financial statements, with the consequence that all of the finance costs relating to those cookson borrowings have been reported as finance costs of Vesuvius.
borrowings and borrowing costs relating to local debt arrangements established by individual cookson Group companies other than cookson Group plc have been reported according to whether they were part of the alent or Vesuvius group structure.
this approach has also been applied to financial assets net cash and the related finance income.
iii tax charges in the comparative financial statements have been determined based on the tax charges recorded by Vesuvius companies in local statutory accounts, together with certain adjustments relating to those entities made for Group consolidation purposes.
the tax charges recorded in the Group income statement for 2012 have been affected by the tax arrangements within the former cookson Group and are not necessarily representative of the tax charges that would have been reported had Vesuvius been an independent group throughout 2012, nor of tax charges that may arise thereafter.
as a consequence of the above, the pre-demerger historical financial performance of Vesuvius in its comparative 2012 financial statements comprises the full consolidated financial performance of cookson Group plc, albeit that in the income statements the total Group results have been analysed between continuing Vesuvius companies only and discontinued alent and Precious metals Processing operations.
the demerger of alent was reflected in the Vesuvius financial statements as the sale, by Vesuvius, of the consolidated alent business on 19 december 2012. hence the 2012 income statement of Vesuvius includes, within discontinued operations, the trading performance of alent up to 19 december 2012, together with the profit on the sale of alent.
Similarly, the trading results of the Precious metals Processing division including the US operations, which were sold in 2012 have been included within discontinued operations in the comparative financial statements.
2.3 Basis of consolidation the consolidated financial statements of the Group incorporate the financial statements of the company and entities controlled by the company its subsidiaries.
control exists when the company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing whether control exists, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are taken into account.
the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Group income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those detailed herein to ensure that the Group financial statements are prepared on a consistent basis.
all intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups interest therein.
non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination together with the non-controlling interests share of profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income since the date of the combination.
total comprehensive income is attributed to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Basis of preparation continued 2.4 Going concern the directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for the Group for a period in excess of 12 months from the date of approval of the 2013 financial statements.
these forecasts reflect an assessment of current and future end-market conditions and their impact on the Groups future trading performance.
the forecasts show that the Group will be able to operate within the current committed debt facilities and show continued compliance with the companys financial covenants.
on the basis of the exercise described above and the Groups available committed debt facilities, the directors consider that the Group and company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
accordingly, they continue to adopt a going concern basis in preparing the financial statements of the Group and the company.
2.5 Functional and presentation currency the financial statements are presented in millions of pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the company, and rounded to one decimal place.
foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 30.1.
2.6 Disclosure of Separately reported items IaS 1, Presentation of financial Statements, provides no definitive guidance as to the format of the income statement, but states key lines which should be disclosed.
It also encourages the disclosure of additional line items and the reordering of items presented on the face of the income statement when appropriate for a proper understanding of the entitys financial performance.
In accordance with IaS 1, the company has adopted a columnar presentation for its Group income statement, to separately identify headline Performance results, as the directors consider that this gives a better view of the underlying results of the ongoing business.
as part of this presentation format, the company has adopted a policy of disclosing separately on the face of its Group income statement, within the column entitled Separately reported items, the effect of any components of financial performance for which the directors consider separate disclosure would assist both in a better understanding of the financial performance achieved and in making projections of future results.
In its adoption of this policy, the company applies an even-handed approach to both gains and losses and aims to be both consistent and clear in its accounting and disclosure of such items.
both materiality and the nature and function of the components of income and expense are considered in deciding upon such presentation.
Such items may include, inter alia, the financial effect of exceptional items which occur infrequently, such as major restructuring activity, initial recognition and subsequent increase, decrease and amortisation of deferred tax assets, together with items always reported separately, such as amortisation charges relating to intangible assets, profits or losses arising on the disposal of continuing or discontinued operations and the taxation impact of the aforementioned exceptional items and items reported separately.
2.7 New and revised IFRS during the year, the Group has adopted IaS 19 revised, employee benefits IaS 19 r which makes changes to the recognition, measurement and disclosure of defined benefit pension schemes.
the impact can be summarised as follows which has required a restatement of the prior periods consolidated results: the net finance cost relating to employee benefits plans has been previously presented gross within finance income and finance expense within the Group income statement.
the amount is now considered to be a single finance cost on the net pension liability.
Prior period comparatives have been restated.
IaS 19 r requires the net pension interest charge to be calculated by applying a high quality corporate bond yield to the net defined benefit liability asset.
this has resulted in the net pension interest charge for 2012 of 0.6m, as previously reported, to become 0.1m with an equal and opposite effect on the remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
the impact on the net pension interest charge for 2013 is broadly similar to that for 2012. operating costs have been increased by 1.5m for 2013 2012: 1.7m, as a result of the requirement to include pension scheme administration costs in operating costs.
Such costs include the PfI levy and actuarial, legal and trustee charges which, under the previous IaS 19, were allowed to be included within net finance costs.
In addition, during the period, the Group adopted a number of other new standards and amendments which became effective, none of which had a material impact on the Groups net cash flow, financial position, total comprehensive income or earnings per share.
a number of other new and amended IfrS were issued during the year which do not become effective until after 1 January 2014 and which have not been early adopted.
none of these are likely to have a material impact on the Groups net cash flows, financial position, total comprehensive income or earnings per share.

Critical judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty determining the carrying amount of some assets and liabilities requires estimation of the effect of uncertain future events.
the major sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities are noted below.
3.1 Goodwill and other intangible assets the directors use their judgement to determine the extent to which goodwill and other capitalised intangible assets have a value that will benefit the performance of the Group over future periods.
to assist in making this judgement, the directors undertake an assessment, at least annually, of the carrying value of the Groups capitalised goodwill and other intangible assets.
In the assessment undertaken as at 31 december 2013, further details of which are given in note 19, value in use was derived from discounted five-year cash flow projections, using a growth rate of 2.5% in the years beyond the projection period and pre-tax discount rates.
the projection period is, in the opinion of the directors, an appropriate period over which to view the future results of the Groups businesses for this purpose.
changes to the assumptions used in making these forecasts could significantly alter the directors assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets.
3.2 Employee benefits the Groups financial statements include the costs and obligations associated with the provision of pension and other post-retirement benefits to current and former employees.
It is the directors responsibility to set the assumptions used in determining the key elements of the costs of meeting such future obligations.
these assumptions are set after consultation with the Groups actuaries and include those used to determine regular service costs and the financing elements related to the plans assets and liabilities.
Whilst the directors believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, a change in the assumptions used could affect the Groups profit and financial position.
3.3 Liability reserves Vesuvius has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation and environmental matters.
Several of the Groups subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and are aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with tax authorities.
reserves are made for the expected amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims.
as the settlement of many of the obligations for which reserve is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing and amount of the associated outflows is subject to some uncertainty.
the directors use their judgement and experience to make reserves in the financial statements for an appropriate amount relating to such matters.
3.4 Taxation a Current tax tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits to the Group.
In assessing the amount of the benefit to be recognised in the financial statements, the directors exercise their judgement in considering the effect of negotiations, litigation and any other matters that they consider may impact upon the potential settlement.
any interest and penalties on tax liabilities are provided for in the tax charge.
the Group operates internationally and is subject to tax in many different jurisdictions.
as a consequence, the Group is routinely subject to tax audits and local enquiries which, by their very nature, can take a considerable period of time to conclude.
Provisions are made for known issues based upon the directors interpretation of country-specific tax law and their assessment of the likely outcome.
b Deferred tax the Group has recognised deferred tax assets in respect of unutilised losses and other timing differences arising in a number of the Groups businesses, further details of which are given in note 12.4. account has been taken of future forecasts of taxable profit in arriving at the values at which these assets are recognised.
If these forecast profits do not materialise or change, or there are changes in tax rates or to the period over which the losses or timing differences might be recognised, then the value of deferred tax assets will need to be revised in a future period.
the Group also has losses and other timing differences, analysed in note 12.4, for which no deferred tax assets have been recognised in these financial statements, relating either to loss-making subsidiaries where the future economic benefit of the timing difference is not probable or to where the timing difference is of such a nature that its value is dependent on certain types of profit being earned, such as capital profits.
If trading or other appropriate profits are earned in future in these companies, these losses and other timing differences may yield benefit to the Group in the form of a reduced tax charge.
Non-GAAP financial measures the company uses a number of non-Generally accepted accounting Practice non-GaaP financial measures in addition to those reported in accordance with IfrS.
the directors believe that these non-GaaP measures, listed below, are important when assessing the underlying financial and operating performance of the Group and its divisions.
4.1 Headline headline performance is from continuing operations and before items reported separately on the face of the income statement.
Non-GAAP financial measures continued 4.2 Underlying Underlying performance is adjusted to exclude the effects of changes in exchange rates, business acquisitions and disposals.
4.3 Return on sales return on sales is calculated as trading profit divided by revenue.
4.4 Trading profit trading profit is defined as operating profit before separately reported items.
the directors believe that trading profit is an important measure of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
4.5 Headline profit before tax headline profit before tax is calculated as the net total of trading profit, plus the Groups share of post-tax profit of joint ventures and total net finance costs associated with headline performance.
4.6 Effective tax rate the Groups effective tax rate is calculated on the income tax costs associated with headline performance, divided by headline profit before tax and before the Groups share of post-tax profit of joint ventures.
4.7 Headline earnings per share headline earnings per share is calculated as headline profit before tax and after income tax costs associated with headline performance and profit attributable to non-controlling interests, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
4.8 Operating cash flow operating cash flow is cash generated from continuing operations before restructuring, demerger payments and additional pension funding contributions but after deducting capital expenditure net of asset disposals.
4.9 Free cash flow free cash flow is defined as net cash flow from operating activities after net outlays for the purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment, dividends from joint ventures and dividends paid to non-controlling shareholders, but before additional funding contributions to Group pension plans.
4.10 Average working capital to sales ratio the average working capital to sales ratio is calculated as the percentage of average working capital balances to the total revenue for the year.
average working capital comprising inventories, trade receivables and trade payables is calculated as the average of the 12 previous month-end balances.
4.11 Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation EBITDA ebItda is calculated as the total of trading profit before depreciation charges.
4.12 Net interest net interest is calculated as interest payable on borrowings less interest receivable, excluding any item therein considered by the directors to be exceptional and therefore separately reported.
4.13 Interest cover Interest cover is the ratio of ebItda to net interest.
4.14 Net debt net debt comprises the net total of current and non-current interest-bearing borrowings and cash and short-term deposits.
4.15 Net debt to EBITDA net debt to ebItda is the ratio of net debt at the year-end to ebItda for that year.
4.16 Return on net assets RONA rona is calculated as trading profit plus share of post-tax profit of joint ventures, divided by average net operating assets being the average over the previous 12 months of property, plant and equipment, trade working capital and other operating receivables and payables.
4.17 Constant rates figures presented at constant rates represent december 2012 numbers retranslated to december 2013 exchange rates.

Segment information the segment information contained in this note makes reference to several non-GaaP financial measures, definitions for which can be found in note 4.
5.1 Accounting policy a Revenue recognition revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied and services rendered to customers after deducting rebates, discounts and value-added taxes, and after eliminating sales within the Group.
revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when persuasive evidence exists, usually in the form of an executed sales agreement, that the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, recovery of the consideration is probable, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
a provision for anticipated returns is made based primarily on historical return rates.
Where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more separate elements that can be provided to customers either on a stand-alone basis or as an extra, such as the provision of supplementary materials with equipment, revenue is recognised for each element as if it were an individual contractual arrangement.
b Research and development costs expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
all other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
5.2 Business segments Operating segments for continuing operations for reporting purposes, the Group is organised into two main business segments: Steel and foundry and the senior executive management of each of these business segments reports to the chief executive of the Group.
It is the Vesuvius board which makes the key operating decisions in respect of these segments.
the information used by the Vesuvius board to review performance and determine resource allocation between the business segments is presented with the Groups activities segmented between the two business segments, Steel and foundry.
taking into account the basis on which the Groups activities are reported to the Vesuvius board, the directors believe that these two business segments are the appropriate way to analyse the Groups results.
the principal activities of each of these segments are described in the Strategic report on pages 24 to 31.
Segment revenue represents revenue from external customers inter-segment revenue is not material.
trading profit includes items directly attributable to a segment as well as those items that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Discontinued operations discontinued operations in 2012 include the results of the alent group of companies for the period up to 19 december 2012, when they were demerged from Vesuvius, together with the results of the US Precious metals Processing business for the period up to 1 may 2012 when it was sold and the the results of the european Precious metals Processing business for the whole of the year.

Income tax 12.1 Accounting policy tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that they relate to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the associated tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
the Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

the Group operates in a number of countries that have differing tax rates, laws and practices.
changes in any of these areas could, adversely or positively, impact the Groups tax charge in the future.
continuing losses, or insufficiency of taxable profit to absorb all expenses, in any subsidiary could have the effect of increasing tax charges in the future, relative to 2013, as effective tax relief may not be available for those losses or expenses.
other significant factors affecting the tax charge are described in notes 3.4 and 12.1.

the asset of 29.2m represents the partial recognition of temporary differences arising prior to the demerger of alent in 2012 and was determined in the light of past and forecast future profit performance of the US businesses of Vesuvius, as required by IaS 12.
In view of its material size and nature, the tax credit arising from the recognition of this asset is presented separately from the tax charge on headline performance, in accordance with the principles outlined in note 2.6 above.
Subsequent increase, decrease and amortisation of the value of this asset would similarly be expected to be presented in this manner, as the directors consider that the separate identification of deferred tax for temporary differences arising prior to the demerger would assist both in a better understanding of the financial performance achieved and in making projections of future results of the Group.
tax loss carry-forwards and other temporary differences of 7.5m 2012: 7.0m were recognised by subsidiaries reporting a loss in 2012 or 2013. on the basis of approved business plans of these subsidiaries, the directors consider it probable that the tax loss carry-forwards and temporary differences can be offset against future taxable profits.
the total deferred tax assets not recognised as at 31 december 2013 were 280.0m 2012: 336.6m, as analysed below.
In accordance with the accounting policy in note 12.1, these items have not been recognised as deferred tax assets on the basis that their future economic benefit is not probable.

the above losses available relating to the rest of the world arise in a number of countries, each of which is not individually significant, reflecting the spread of the Groups operations.

from 1 april 2013, the UK corporation tax rate reduced to 23% from 24%.
further UK corporation tax rate reductions to 21% from 1 april 2014 and 20% from 1 april 2015 were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. accordingly, the Groups closing UK deferred tax liability has been provided using a tax rate of 20%.
the impact of using this lower tax rate was to increase the exceptional tax credit relating to the amortisation of intangible assets from 4.5m to 7.0m 2012: 4.7m to 6.7m.

Property, plant and equipment 17.1 Accounting policy freehold land is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
other items of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
costs are capitalised only when it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits flowing to the Group and when they can be measured reliably.
all other repairs and maintenance expenditure is charged to the Group income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
freehold land is not depreciated as it has an infinite life.
depreciation on other items of property, plant and equipment begins when the asset is available for use and is charged to the Group income statement on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost less residual value of the asset over its estimated useful life as follows: asset category estimated useful life freehold property between 10 and 50 years Leasehold property the term of the lease Plant and equipment motor vehicles and information technology equipment between 1 and 5 years other between 5 and 15 years the depreciation method used, residual values and estimated useful lives are reviewed and changed, if appropriate, at least at each year-end.
as described in note 19.1, an assets carrying amount is immediately written down to its recoverable amount if its carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses arising on disposals are determined by comparing sales proceeds with carrying amount and are recognised in the Group income statement.

Intangible assets Intangible assets comprise goodwill and other intangible assets that have been acquired through business combinations.
18.1 Accounting policy a Goodwill Goodwill arising in a business combination is initially recognised as an asset at cost, measured as the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest acquired over the net of the acquisition-date fair value amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses, with impairment testing carried out annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill has been allocated may be impaired.
on disposal of a business, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.
b Other intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill are recognised on business combinations if they are separable, or if they arise from contractual or other legal rights, and their value can be measured reliably.
they are initially measured at cost, which is equal to the acquisition-date fair value, and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation charges and accumulated impairment losses.
other intangible assets are subject to impairment testing when there is an indication that an impairment loss may have been incurred and are amortised over their estimated useful lives.

for the purposes of impairment testing, the directors consider that the Group has two cGUs: the Steel and foundry divisions.
these cGUs represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored.

Impairment of tangible and intangible assets 19.1 Accounting policy at each balance sheet date, the directors review the carrying value of the Groups tangible and other intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss.
Where it is not feasible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the directors estimate the recoverable amount of the cGU to which the asset belongs.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Groups cGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination and the directors carry out annual impairment testing of the carrying value of each cGU, to assess the need for any impairment of the carrying value of the associated goodwill and other intangible and tangible assets.
for the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of an asset or cGU is the higher of i its fair value less costs to sell and ii its value in use.
If the recoverable amount of a cGU is less than its carrying amount, the resulting impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cGU and then to the other assets of the cGU pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the cGU.
an impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
an impairment loss recognised in a prior year for an asset other than goodwill may be reversed where there has been a change in the estimates used to measure the assets recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised.
the value in use calculations of the Groups cGUs are based on detailed business plans covering a three year period from the balance sheet date, higher level assumptions covering a further two year period and perpetuity calculations beyond this five year projection period.
the cash flows in the calculations are discounted to their current value using pre-tax discount rates.
19.2 Key assumptions the key assumptions used in determining value in use are return on sales, growth rates and discount rates.
return on sales assumptions are based on historical financial information, adjusted to factor in the anticipated impact of restructuring and rationalisation plans already announced at the balance sheet date.
Growth rates are determined with reference to: current market conditions: external forecasts and historical trends for the Groups key end-markets of steel production and foundry castings: and expected growth in output within the industries in which each major Group business unit operates.
a perpetuity growth rate of 2.5% 2012: 2.5% has been applied based on the long-term growth rates experienced in the Groups end-markets and external forecasts.
the Groups projections are based on historical trends and external forecasts.
discount rates are calculated for each cGU, reflecting market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to each cGU.
the pre-tax discount rate used for the Steel cGU was 11.7% 2012: 12.2% and for the foundry cGU was 13.7% 2012: 15.4%.
Under a sensitivity analysis undertaken on the 2013 impairment testing, a 1.0% increase in each of the cGU discount rates, combined with a 2.0% perpetuity growth rate, still left each cGU with significant headroom of recoverable amount over its carrying value.
19.3 Goodwill impairment In assessing goodwill for potential impairment as at 31 december 2013, the directors made use of detailed calculations of the recoverable amount of the Groups cGUs as at 31 december 2013. those calculations resulted in recoverable amounts significantly higher than the carrying values of each of the Groups cGUs and consequently no impairment charges were recognised.
Trade and other receivables 20.1 Accounting policy trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less impairment losses.

Where objective evidence exists that a trade receivable balance may be impaired, provision is made for the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated cash that will be recovered.
evidence of impairment may include such factors as the customer being in breach of contract, or entering bankruptcy or financial reorganisation proceedings.
Impairment provisions are assessed on an individual customer basis for all significant outstanding balances and collectively for all remaining balances, based upon historical loss experience.
historical experience has shown that the Groups trade receivable provisions are maintained at levels that are sufficient to absorb actual bad debt write-offs, without being excessive.

there is no significant difference between the fair value of the Groups trade and other receivable balances and the amount at which they are reported in the Group balance sheet.
Inventories 21.1 Accounting policy Inventories are stated at the lower of cost using the first in, first out method and net realisable value.
cost comprises expenditure incurred in purchasing or manufacturing inventories together with all other costs directly incurred in bringing the inventory to its present location and condition and, where appropriate, attributable production overheads based on normal activity levels.
net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
the amount of any write-down of inventories to net realisable value is recognised as an expense in the year in which the write-down occurs.

Derivative financial instruments 22.1 Accounting policy the Group uses derivative financial instruments derivatives in the form of forward foreign currency contracts, and interest rate swaps to manage the effects of its exposure to foreign exchange risk, and interest rate risk.
the way in which derivatives are used to manage the Groups financial risk is detailed in note 30. derivatives are measured at fair value.
the fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated using market prices at the balance sheet date.
the fair value of an interest rate swap is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparty.
the method of recognising the gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting purposes and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
Strict conditions have to be satisfied in order to qualify for hedge accounting, including a determination both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis that the hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
the change in fair value of a derivative that is not designated as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting purposes is recognised immediately in the Group income statement.
no derivatives are held for speculative purposes.
Cash flow hedges the effective part of any gain or loss on a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity.
the ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately within trading profit, or within finance costs in the case of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges.
When the transaction that was being hedged is realised and affects profit or loss, the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative is removed from the hedging reserve and recognised in the income statement in the same period.
Fair value hedges the change in fair value of a derivative that is designated as a fair value hedge is recognised within trading profit in the Group income statement.
the carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in its fair value that is attributable to the hedged risk and this adjustment is recognised within trading profit in the Group income statement.
Net investment hedges the effective part of any gain or loss on a derivative that is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity, and is subsequently recognised in the Group income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately within trading profit in the Group income statement.

Financial risk management 30.1 Accounting policy a Non-derivative financial instruments Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs.
after initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
b Foreign currencies the individual financial statements of each Group entity are prepared in their functional currency, which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates.
for the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each entity are translated into pounds sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group.
Reporting foreign currency transactions in functional currency transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are initially recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
at each subsequent balance sheet date: i foreign currency monetary items are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
exchange differences arising on the settlement or retranslation of monetary items are recognised in the Group income statement: and ii non-monetary items measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Translation from functional currency to presentational currency When the functional currency of a Group entity is different from the Groups presentational currency pounds sterling, its results and financial position are translated into the presentational currency as follows: i assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date: ii Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the year, except where the use of such average rates does not approximate the exchange rate at the date of a specific transaction, in which case the transaction rate is used: and iii all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity and are reclassified to profit or loss in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of.
Net investment in foreign operations exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a reporting entitys net investment in a foreign operation are initially recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity and reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.
30.2 Financial risk factors the Groups treasury department, acting in accordance with policies approved by the board, is principally responsible for managing the financial risks faced by the Group.
the Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, the most significant of which are market risk and liquidity risk.
a Market risk market risk is the risk that either the fair values or the cash flows of the Groups financial instruments may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
the Group is principally exposed to market risk through fluctuations in exchange rates currency risk and interest rates interest rate risk.
Currency risk the Group is exposed to currency risk on its borrowings and financial assets being cash and short-term deposits that are denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling.
the Groups general policy is proportionally to match the currency profile of its core borrowings with the currency profile of its earnings and net assets.
this is achieved, where necessary, by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts fX swaps.
the currency profile of the Groups borrowings and financial assets, reflecting the effect of the fX swaps, is shown in the table below.

Financial risk management continued 30.2 Financial risk factors continued Interest rate risk the Groups interest rate risk principally arises in relation to its borrowings.
Where borrowings are held at floating rates of interest, fluctuations in interest rates expose the Group to variability in the cash flows associated with its interest payments and where borrowings are held at fixed rates of interest, fluctuations in interest rates expose the Group to changes in the fair value of its borrowings.
the Groups policy is to maintain a mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings, within certain parameters agreed from time to time by the board, in order to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings.
as at 31 december 2013, the Group had $310m and 30m 212.1m in total of US Private Placement Loan notes outstanding, which carry a fixed rate of interest, representing two-thirds of the Groups total borrowings outstanding at that date.
the interest rate profile of the Groups borrowings and net debt is detailed in the tables below.
Financial liabilities gross borrowings Floating Financial Fixed rate rate Total assets Net debt m m m m m Sterling 25.9 25.9 0.7 25.2 United States dollar 187.2 5.8 193.0 0.6 192.4 euro 24.9 76.4 101.3 6.3 95.0 chinese renminbi 18.6 18.6 other 7.6 7.6 42.2 34.6 capitalised borrowing costs 1.5 1.5 3.0 3.0 As at 31 December 2013 210.6 114.2 324.8 68.4 256.4 financial liabilities gross borrowings floating financial fixed rate rate total assets net debt m m m m m Sterling 176.4 176.4 14.9 161.5 United States dollar 153.8 3.0 156.8 4.8 152.0 euro 91.8 91.8 36.7 55.1 chinese renminbi 20.8 20.8 other 5.0 5.0 52.3 47.3 capitalised borrowing costs 1.2 4.0 5.2 5.2 as at 31 december 2012 152.6 272.2 424.8 129.5 295.3 the floating rate financial liabilities shown in the tables above bear interest at the inter-bank offered rate of the appropriate currency, plus a margin.
the fixed rate financial liabilities of 210.6m 2012: 152.6m have a weighted average interest rate of 4.6% 2012: 4.7% and a weighted average period for which the rate is fixed of 7.3 years 2012: 6.6 years.
the financial assets attract floating rate interest at the inter-bank offered rate of the appropriate currency, less a margin.
Financial risk management continued 30.2 Financial risk factors continued based upon the interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities shown in the tables above, a 1% increase in market interest rates would increase both the net finance costs charged in the Group income statement and the net interest paid in the Group statement of cash flows by 0.5m 2012: 1.4m and a 1% reduction in market interest rates would decrease both the net finance costs charged in the Group income statement and the net interest paid in the Group statement of cash flows by 0.5m 2012: 1.4m.
Similarly, a 1% increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of 12.6m 2012: 9.2m in the fair value of the Groups net debt and a 1% decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of 13.6m 2012: 9.8m in the fair value of the Groups net debt.
b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group might have difficulties in meeting its financial obligations.
the Group manages this risk by ensuring that it maintains sufficient levels of committed borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents to ensure that it can meet its operational cash flow requirements and any maturing financial liabilities, while at all times operating within its financial covenants.
the level of operational headroom provided by the Groups committed borrowing facilities is reviewed at least annually as part of the Groups three-year planning process.
Where this process indicates a need for additional finance, this is normally addressed 12 to 18 months in advance by means of either additional committed bank facilities or raising finance in the capital markets.
as at 31 december 2013, the Group had committed borrowing facilities of 637.1m 2012: 578.8m, of which 328.6m 2012: 157.7m were undrawn.
these undrawn facilities are due to expire in april 2016. the Groups borrowing requirements are met by US Private Placement Loan notes USPP and a multi-currency committed syndicated bank facility of 425.0m 2012: 425.0m.
the USPP facility was fully drawn as at 31 december 2013 and amounted to 212.1m $310m and 30m, of which $110m is repayable in 2017, $140m in 2020, 15m in 2021, $30m in 2023, 15m in 2025 and $30m in 2028. the syndicated bank facility is repayable in april 2016. the maturity analysis of the Groups gross borrowings is shown in the tables below.

Financial risk management continued 30.3 Capital management the company considers its capital to be equal to the sum of its total equity and net debt.
It monitors its capital using a number of key performance indicators, including free cash flow, average working capital to sales ratios, net debt to ebItda ratios and rona note 4. the Groups objectives when managing its capital are: to ensure that the Group and all of its businesses are able to operate as going concerns and ensure that the Group operates within the financial covenants contained within its debt facilities: to maximise shareholder value through maintaining an appropriate balance between the Groups equity and net debt: to have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver acceptable future returns to investors: and to maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.
the Group operated comfortably within the requirements of its debt covenants throughout the year and has substantial liquidity headroom within its committed debt facilities.
details of the Groups covenant compliance and committed debt facilities can be found in the Strategic report on page 14.
Employee benefits 31.1 Accounting policy the net surplus or net liability recognised in the Group balance sheet for the Groups defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of the plan assets.
the defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method and by discounting the estimated future cash flows using interest rates on high quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.
any asset recognised in respect of a surplus arising from this calculation is limited to the sum of unrecognised past service costs plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
the expense for the Groups defined benefit plans is recognised in the Group income statement as shown in note 31.7. actuarial gains and losses arising on the assets and liabilities of the plans are reported within the Group statement of comprehensive income: and gains and losses arising on settlements and curtailments are recognised in the Group income statement in the same line as the item that gave rise to the settlement or curtailment or, if material, separately reported as a component of operating profit.
31.2 Group post-retirement plans the Group operates a number of pension plans around the world, both of the defined benefit and defined contribution type, and accounts for them in accordance with IaS 19 r. the Groups principal defined benefit pension plans are in the UK and the US, the benefits of which are based upon the final pensionable salaries of plan members.
the assets of these plans are held separately from the Group in trustee-administered funds.
the trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plans beneficiaries.
the principal risks faced by these plans comprise: i the risk that the value of the plan assets is not sufficient to meet all plan liabilities as they fall due: ii the risk that plan beneficiaries live longer than envisaged, causing liabilities to exceed the available plan assets: and iii the risk that the market-based factors used to value plan liabilities changes materially adversely to increase plan liabilities over the value of available plan assets.
the Group also has defined benefit pension plans in other territories but, with the exception of those in Germany, these are not individually material in relation to the Group as a whole.
a Defined benefit pension plans UK the Groups main defined benefit pension plan in the UK the UK Plan is closed to new members and to future benefit accrual.
following the demerger of cookson Group plc, the UK Plan remains with Vesuvius.
the alent employers who participated in the UK Plan ceased to participate with effect from the demerger and their pension liabilities in the UK Plan were discharged in full by apportioning the pension liabilities of the alent participating employers to Vesuvius, combined with a mitigation payment into the UK Plan to compensate for the loss of support from the alent participating employers, which reduced the financial covenant of the employers supporting the UK Plan.
the mitigation payment agreed with the UK Plan trustee was equal to approximately 25% of the UK Plans Section 75 deficit calculated as at completion of the demerger and amounted to 38.0m, of which 34.0m was paid in december 2012 and 4.0m in January 2013. www.
Employee benefits continued 31.2 Group post-retirement plans continued a full actuarial valuation of the UK Plan is carried out every three years by an independent actuary for the UK Plan trustee and the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 december 2012. at that date, the market value of plan assets was 501.9m and this represented a funding level of 102% of the accrued plan benefits at the time of 490.4m.
calculated on a buy-out basis using an estimation of the cost of buying out the UK Plan benefits with an insurance company, the liabilities at that date were 610.1m, representing a funding level of 82%.
Under the rules of the UK Plan, the trustee has the power to set the funding contributions, having consulted with the company.
Under a schedule of contributions agreed by the company and trustee, the company made top-up payments of 7.0m per annum up to July 2013, after which they ceased as a result of the funding surplus evidenced by the 2012 funding valuation.
the level of top-up payments will be reviewed based on the UK Plans next triennial valuation as at 31 december 2015, which should be available in mid-2016.
notwithstanding the latest funding valuation surplus, the company has agreed to make voluntary contributions of 2.0m per annum at least until the next valuation date in recognition of the potential funding strain resulting from the ongoing fide-risking initiatives likely to be undertaken in the short term.
on 19 July 2012, the UK Plan trustee announced that it had entered into a pension insurance buy-in agreement with Pension Insurance corporation PIc to insure approximately 60% of the UK Plans total liabilities.
Under this arrangement, the UK Plan trustee paid an insurance premium of 318.8m to PIc, wholly from the assets of the UK Plan, which will secure a stream of income exactly matching future ongoing pension payments.
this arrangement eliminated the inflation, interest rate, investment and longevity risk for Vesuvius in respect of these liabilities.
Post buy-in, the UK Plan now carries an asset in the form of the insurance contract, which is valued in both the funding and IaS 19 r valuations at an amount which matches exactly that of the liabilities which it covers, thereby removing any funding or balance sheet volatility relating to this part of the UK Plans liabilities.
therefore, the only risks remaining in the UK Plan relate to deferred members and the small number of pensioner members not covered by the insurance policy.
the Group continues to fund the UK Plan on the basis of the funding valuation.
for plan funding purposes, the UK Plans pensioner liabilities are valued using more prudent assumptions than those required under IaS 19 r for accounting purposes.
on a funding basis sometimes called the economic or ongoing basis the insurance premium paid to PIc represented some 10m less than the amount reserved in the UK Plan against these liabilities.
this means that the funding level of the UK Plan the measure which determines the level of additional contributions required to be made by Vesuvius improved by some 10m as a result of the buy-in.
on an accounting basis, the pensioner liabilities are valued using a higher discount rate as required by IaS 19 r, which provides a much lower valuation of those liabilities.
as a consequence, the accounting valuation of the insurance contract compared with the actual premium paid to PIc resulted in a reduction in the asset portfolio valuation of some 50m.
IaS 19 r requires this loss to be reported in the Group statement of comprehensive income, not the income statement.
In december 2012, an extension to the PIc buy-in agreement was signed, under which the UK Plan trustee agrees to transfer to PIc all new pensioner liabilities arising from July 2012 to december 2015 for a premium payment by the UK Plan which is calculated to be consistent with the pricing terms of the original buy-in agreement, but reflecting changes in market conditions and differences in the duration of the liabilities transferred.
the agreement covers up to 30m of liabilities, with the future premium payments to be met from the existing assets of the UK Plan.
for 2013, the impact of this agreement extension has been an estimated increase of 1m to the UK Plan liabilities in respect of the pensioner benefits to be transferred to PIc in early 2014. the estimate of loss which this represents has been reported in the Group statement of comprehensive income for 2013. b Defined benefit pension plans US the Group has a number of defined benefit pension plans in the US, providing retirement benefits based on final salary or a fixed benefit.
the Groups principal US defined benefit pension plans are closed to new members and also to future benefit accrual for existing members.
actuarial valuations of the US defined benefit pension plans are carried out every year and the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 december 2012. at that date the market value of the plan assets was 69.4m, representing a funding level of 66% of funded accrued plan benefits at that date using the projected unit method of valuation of 104.6m.
funding levels for the Groups US defined benefit pension plans are normally based upon annual valuations carried out by independent qualified actuaries and are governed by US government regulations.
c Defined benefit pension plans Germany the Group has a number of defined benefit pension arrangements in Germany which are unfunded, as is common practice in that country.
the net liability of the German plans at 31 december 2013 was 32.6m.
d Defined contribution pension plans the total expense for the Groups defined contribution plans in the Group income statement amounted to 10.9m 2012 as restated: 11.5m continuing operations and represents the contributions payable for the year by the Group to the plans.

Employee benefits continued 31.3 Post-retirement liability valuation the main assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Groups defined benefit pension plans, as detailed below, are set by the directors after consultation with independent professionally qualified actuaries.
a Mortality assumptions the mortality assumptions used in the actuarial valuations of the Groups UK, US and German defined benefit pension liabilities are summarised in the table below and have been selected to reflect the characteristics and experience of the membership of those plans.
for the UK Plan, the assumptions used have been derived from the Self-administered Pension Schemes SaPS all table, with future longevity improvements in line with the core mortality improvement tables published in 2013 by the continuous mortality Investigation cmI, with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.5% per annum.
for the Groups US plans, the assumptions used have been based on the standard rP-2000 fully generational tables with projection scale bb, a change from 2012 when the tables used were the rP2000ch mortality tables, projected 64 years for non-pensioners and 33 years for pensioners using projection scale aa.
the change is aimed at allowing more explicitly for differences in mortality levels and future trends in mortality for people born in different years.
the Groups major plans in Germany have been valued using the heubeckrichttafein 2005G mortality tables.

the UK discount rate in the above table is based on the aon hewitt aa-rated corporate bond yield in conjunction with the most recent projected cash flow data relating to the UK Plan liabilities: the US discount rate is based on the citigroup pension discount curve: and the German discount rate is based on the yield on the iboxx over 10 year euro corporates aa index.
the assumptions for price inflation are set by reference to the difference between yields on longer-term conventional government bonds and indexlinked bonds, except for cPI, for which no appropriate bonds exist, which is assumed to be 1.0 point lower than rPI-based inflation.
c Sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in significant IAS 19 R actuarial assumptions the following table analyses, for the Groups main UK, US and German pension plans, the theoretical estimated impact on plan liabilities resulting from changes to the most significant actuarial assumptions used for IaS 19 r valuation purposes, whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
following the agreement of buy-in agreements for the UK plan pensioner liabilities in 2012, as noted above, and the fact that US pensions are not inflation linked, the rate of increase in pensionable salaries and of pensions in payment are not significant to the valuation of the Groups overall pensions liabilities.
Employee benefits continued 31.3 Post-retirement liability valuation continued c Sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in significant IAS 19 R actuarial assumptions continued as stated above, during 2012 the UK Plan entered into pension insurance buy-in agreements which eliminate the inflation, interest rate, investment and longevity risk in respect of the pensioner liabilities covered by the agreements.
therefore, for the liabilities so covered, which represent some 65% of the total liabilities of the UK Plan, any changes in the valuation assumptions which impact the value of those liabilities, also impacts on the associated annuity assets in an equal and opposite way, thereby fully mitigating the valuation risk.
this is also reflected in the following table.
Impact on plan liabilities Assumption Change in assumption UK US Germany discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% impact on plan liabilities decrease increase by 1.5% decrease increase by 1.1% decrease increase by 1.7% impact on plan assets decrease increase by 1.1% n a n a Price inflation Increase decrease by 0.1% impact on plan liabilities Increase decrease by 1.0% n a Increase decrease by 0.7% impact on plan assets Increase decrease by 0.8% n a n a mortality Increase by one year impact on plan liabilities Increase decrease by 3.5% Increase by 3.2% Increase by 3.0% impact on plan assets Increase decrease by 4.3% n a n a 31.4 Defined benefit obligation the liabilities of the Groups defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans for IaS 19 r accounting purposes are measured by discounting the best estimate of the future cash flows to be paid out by the plans using the projected unit method, in which the calculation of plan liabilities makes allowance, where appropriate, for projected increases in benefit-related earnings.
the average duration of the obligations to which the liabilities of the Groups principal pension plans relate is 18 years for the UK, 16 years for Germany and 10 years for the US.

Employee benefits continued 31.6 Balance sheet recognition continued a UK Plan asset allocation as at 31 december 2013, of the UK Plans total assets, excluding risk-mitigation derivatives, 53% were represented by the bulk annuity insurance contracts covering the UK Plans pension liabilities: 6% were allocated to equities: 10% to infrastructure and property investments: 26% to cash: and 5% to other assets.
In addition, the UK Plan holds a liability driven investment portfolio of financial derivative contracts which reduces the risk that the UK Plans assets would fall materially relative to the value of its economic liabilities.
b Defined benefit contributions in 2014 In 2014, the Group is expected to make aggregate contributions into its defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefits plans of around 8m: of this, 6m is voluntary.

as further required by IaS 19 r, the net finance cost relating to employee benefit plans must be calculated by applying a high quality corporate bond yield to the net defined benefit obligation, whereas previously it was usual for the expected return on pension plan assets to be a higher rate than the discount rate applied to the plan liabilities.
this has resulted in the net pension interest charge for 2012 of 0.6m, as previously reported, to become 0.1m, with an equal and opposite effect on the remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
the financial impact of implementing IaS 19 r on the results for 2013 has been broadly similar to that in 2012. www.

Leases 34.1 Accounting policy Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
all other leases are classified as operating leases.
rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
34.2 Operating lease commitments the future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are payable as follows: 2013 2012 m m not later than one year 8.4 9.5 Later than one year and not later than five years 17.6 18.8 Later than five years 6.4 10.1 Total operating lease commitments 32.4 38.4 the Groups property, plant and equipment assets are either purchased outright or held under lease contracts.
Where the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the Group, the asset is capitalised in the Group balance sheet and the corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised as a finance lease obligation.
Where all the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group, the lease is classified as an operating lease and neither the asset nor the corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised in the Group balance sheet.
the net book value of the Groups property, plant and equipment assets held under finance lease contracts at 31 december 2013 and 31 december 2012 was not material.
the cost incurred by the Group in the year in respect of assets held under operating leases, all of which was charged within trading profit, amounted to 14.4m 2012: 24.2m.

Provisions 35.1 Accounting policy Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects both the current market assessment of the time value of money and the specific risks associated with the obligation.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

the provision for disposal and closure costs includes the directors current best estimate of the costs to be incurred both in the fulfilment of obligations incurred in connection with former Group businesses, resulting from either disposal or closure, together with those related to the demolition and clean-up of closed sites.
the provision comprises amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims, including claims relating to product liability.
as the settlement of many of the obligations for which provision is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing of the associated cash outflows is subject to some uncertainty, but the majority of the amounts provided are expected to be utilised over the next ten years and the underlying estimates of costs are regularly updated to reflect changed circumstances with regard to individual matters.
the provision for restructuring charges includes the costs of all of the Groups initiatives to rationalise its operating activities.
the balance of 12.9m as at 31 december 2013 comprises 4.9m in relation to onerous lease provisions in respect of leases terminating between one and ten years, and 8.0m in relation to future expenditure on restructuring initiatives which is expected to be paid out over the next two years.
other provisions comprise amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims.
as the settlement of many of the obligations for which provision is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing of the associated outflows is subject to some uncertainty, but the majority of amounts provided are expected to be utilised over the next five years and the underlying estimates of costs are regularly updated to reflect changed circumstances with regard to individual matters.
Where insurance cover exists for any of these known or probable costs, a related asset is recognised in the Group balance sheet only when its realisation is virtually certain.
as at 31 december 2013, 10.4m 2012: 10.2m was recorded in receivables in respect of associated insurance reimbursements, of which 8.1m 2012: 7.9m is non-current.
the amounts reported in the table above as charged to the Group income statement represent only that part of the total income statement charge reported as a movement on provisions.
other components of the charge, such as asset write-offs, are reported as a reduction in the carrying value of the relevant balance sheet item.
Off-balance sheet arrangements In compliance with current reporting requirements, certain arrangements entered into by the Group in its normal course of business are not reported in the Group balance sheet.
of such arrangements, those considered material by the directors include: future lease payments in relation to assets used by the Group under non-cancellable operating leases note 34 : and trade receivable balances that have been subject to non-recourse factoring arrangements.
Under its non-recourse factoring arrangements, the Group sells trade receivables balances to a third-party factoring company in exchange for a cash payment from the factoring company, net of fees.
all the risks and rewards of the trade receivables subject to these arrangements are transferred to the factoring company and, accordingly, the trade receivables are derecognised in the Group balance sheet.
Such arrangements are used from time to time by the Group to manage the recovery of cash from its trade receivables.
as at 31 december 2013, the Group balance sheet included 11.9m 2012: 18.6m of cash that would otherwise have been reported as trade receivables if these arrangements were not in place.
factoring fees incurred during the year ended 31 december 2013, which are written off to the Group income statement within ordinary finance costs, amounted to 0.4m 2012: 0.5m.
Contingent liabilities Guarantees given by the Group under property leases of operations disposed of amounted to 2.7m 2012: 3.4m.
details of guarantees given by the company, on behalf of the Group, are given in note 10 to the company financial statements.
Vesuvius has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation and environmental matters.
Several of Vesuvius subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and the directors are aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with tax authorities.
as the settlement of many of the obligations for which reserve is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing and amount of the associated outflows is subject to some uncertainty see note 35 for further information.
certain of Vesuvius subsidiaries are subject to lawsuits, predominantly in the US, relating to a small number of products containing asbestos manufactured prior to the acquisition of those subsidiaries by Vesuvius.
these suits usually also name many other product manufacturers.
to date, Vesuvius is not aware of there being any liability verdicts against any of these subsidiaries.
a number of lawsuits have been withdrawn, dismissed or settled and the amount paid, including costs, in relation to this litigation has not had a material adverse effect on Vesuvius financial position or results of operations.
cookson Precious metals Ltd, a subsidiary of Vesuvius, was engaged in transactions involving the purchase of scrap platinum between august 2007 and october 2009.
Vesuvius had been informed by hmrc that, in hmrcs view, certain external third parties within the supply chain for those transactions deliberately failed to account to hmrc for Vat.
Such fraud is commonly known as missing trader Intra-community fraud.
hmrc have undertaken an investigation to assess whether, as a consequence of any fraudulent actions of those third parties, they could argue that the ability of Vesuvius to retain Vat recovered on the relevant transactions should be limited.
hmrcs investigation has been concluded in respect of most of the Vat loss under investigation, with no associated liability for Vat or interest or penalties arising.
certain subsidiary companies of Vesuvius plc and alent plc are defendants in two actions, brought by macdermid incorporated in the United States, which are pending in the connecticut Superior court and arising out of corporate activity involving the parties in the autumn of 2006. the first action was commenced in 2009 and the second action was commenced in august 2012. macdermid claims damages of approximately $62m, plus punitive or exemplary damages, costs and interest which are currently unquantifiable.
both Vesuvius and alent believe these claims have no merit and are vigorously defending these actions.
each of Vesuvius and alent anticipates filing motions for summary judgment in both cases by mid-2014 and, if any claims remain pending decisions on those motions, a trial in the first action is anticipated in the first half of 2015. any liability relating to the macdermid claim arising following the demerger of cookson Group will be split equally between alent plc and Vesuvius plc.
