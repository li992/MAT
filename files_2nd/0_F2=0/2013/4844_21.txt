Such excluded items are described as Nonunderlying.
Further information on these items is shown in notes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 27.
Underlying figures for the 52 weeks ended 28 April 2012 have been re-presented to exclude the trading results of businesses exited to be exited for which the decisions were made or executed in 2012 13 and in respect of finance income and costs, to exclude the expected return and interest in respect of defined benefit pension schemes.
Businesses exited to be exited comprise businesses which have either been sold, were sold post 30 April 2013, or have been closed or the decision to close the businesses was taken during the period.
Such businesses do not meet the definition of discontinued operations as stipulated by IFRS 5 and accordingly the disclosures within non-underlying items differ from those for applicable discontinued operations.
