Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2013 1 Segmental reporting In accordance with IFRS 8, Operating Segments, the Group has derived the information for its operating segments using the information used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker the Executive Committee.
Operating segments are consistent with those used in internal management reporting.
The measure used by the Executive Committee is the adjusted operating profit for the Group as a whole note 4.
The Group has operating segments relating to the three geographic regions.
The Executive Committee has delegated responsibilities for directly managed costs to the Regional Presidents of the three geographic regions of the Group and then allocated centrally managed costs to those regions, consequently for the three operating segments the Group measures Adjusted Operating Profit note 4.

Visibroker previously included in Niche 2012: $26.1m, our own CORBA based product, has been combined with Iona to form a new CORBA Product Portfolio.
We have also transferred some of the products acquired from Compuware in 2009 2012: $12.6m that were previously included within Borland Test to Niche as their characteristics are now closer to this Product Portfolio.
We exited during the year the Java related Consultancy business in Brazil 2012: $5.6m and these revenues are now included in Niche.
We have also transferred TM ART 2012: $0.3m from Niche to Borland Test.
As a result of the above the comparatives for Borland Test, Niche and CORBA have been restated.

The release resulted mainly from lower settlements paid to staff made redundant by the restructuring, from our ability to avoid repaying a grant and settlement of property lease liabilities at lower levels than originally expected.
Severance costs included within reorganization costs in 2012 are not included within staff costs disclosed in note 29.

The tax for the year is lower 2012: lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 23.9% 2012: 25.8%.
The differences are explained below: 2013 2012 $000 $000 Profit before taxation 153,366 149,250 Tax at UK corporation tax rate 23.9% 2012: 25.8% applicable to profits in the respective countries 36,654 38,507 Effects of: Adjustments to tax in respect of previous years current tax 2,643 6,557 Adjustments to tax in respect of previous years deferred tax 3,331 3,069 Adjustment for foreign tax rates 2,236 3,165 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 4,749 4,132 Tax loss utilization 267 294 Effect of change in tax rates 440 906 Research and development tax benefit 1,344 935 Other permanent differences 5,412 5,413 Total taxation 30,202 28,630 The movement in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period is provided in note 22.
The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 24% to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013: as this reduction was substantively enacted by the balance sheet date it is reflected in the annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2013.
Accordingly the Companys profits for this accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 23.9% and will be taxed at 23% in the future.
Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 51 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2013 continued 6 Taxation continued In addition to the changes in rates of corporation tax disclosed above, the Government intends to enact a number of further changes to the UK corporation tax system to reduce the main rate of corporation tax to 20% by 1 April 2015.
As this rate reduction has not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, the rate reduction is not yet reflected in the financial statements in accordance with IAS10, as it is a non-adjusting event occurring after the reporting period.
It is estimated that the future rate change to 20% would further reduce the recognized UK deferred tax liability at 30 April 2013 by $1.2m.
The actual impact will be dependent on the Companys deferred tax position at the time.

Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to each individual cash generating unit CGU.
The Group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the net present value on the recoverable amount of the CGU to which goodwill has been allocated.
It has been determined that the Group has three CGUs being the three geographical segments North America: International: and Asia Pacific and Japan.
An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of the CGU with their recoverable amount, where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
The Group has carried out its annual impairment testing at 30 April each year.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined based on the value in use VIU calculations.
The determination of whether or not goodwill has been impaired requires an estimate to be made of the VIU of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
The VIU calculation includes estimates about the future financial performance of the CGUs.
In all cases the approved budget for the following financial year forms the basis for the cash flow projections for a CGU.
The cash flow projections in the three financial years following the budget year reflect managements expectation of the medium and long-term operating performance of the CGU and growth prospects in the CGUs market.
Key assumptions The key assumptions in the VIU calculations are the discount rate applied, the long-term operating margin and the long-term growth rate of net operating cash flows.
In determining the key assumptions, management has taken into consideration the current economic climate, the resulting impact on expected growth and discount rates, and the pressure this places on impairment calculations.
Discount rate applied The discount rate applied to each CGU represents a pre-tax rate that reflects market assessment of the time value of money at the balance sheet date and risks specific to the CGU.
The discount rate applied to each CGUs operations was: 2013 2012 North America 16.4% 17.0% International 13.3% 13.9% Asia Pacific and Japan 14.9% 15.5% Long-term operating margin The long-term operating margin for each CGU is primarily based upon past performance adjusted as appropriate where management believes that past operating margins are not indicative of future operating margins.
The long-term EBITDA margins applied to each CGU is 42.5% 2012: 40.0%.
Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 53 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2013 continued 9 Goodwill continued Long-term growth rates of net operating cash flows The long-term growth rates of net operating cash flows are assumed to be no greater than the long-term growth rate in the gross domestic product of the countries in which the CGU operates and were 2.0% 2012: 2.0%.
The long-term growth rate is applied consistently across all CGUs as: t 5IF CVTJOFTTFT XJUIJO UIF $ 6T IBWF TJNJMBS USBEJOH DIBSBDUFSJTUJDT t 'VUVSF GPSFDBTUT BSF DPOTJEFSFE UP CF TJNJMBS BDSPTT BMM $ 6T BOE t #VTJOFTT SJTLT BSF DPOTJEFSFE UP CF UIF TBNF BDSPTT BMM $ 6T Summary of results During the year, all goodwill was tested for impairment, with no impairment charge resulting 2012: nil.
As the VIU calculation is most sensitive to a change in the long-term operating margin, the directors are of the opinion that it would take a systematic change to the market for long-term operating margins to fall to the level where an impairment would be required.
The directors consider that a reduction of 4.0% 2012: 4.0% in the absolute value of long-term operating margins across all CGUs would be the limit of what could be considered to be reasonably possible on the basis that the Groups cost base is flexible and could quickly respond to market changes.
The Group is spread across a range of geographies and sectors and also offers customer cost saving solutions, which help to insulate it from more significant changes.
If the long-term margins used in the VIU calculations for all CGUs were 4.0% 2012: 4.0% lower in absolute terms than managements estimates, the Group would not have any impairment charge.
If the operating margins remain in perpetuity at the current year levels then there would also not be any impairment charge.
The Group bases its estimate for the long-term pre tax discount rate on its weighted average cost of capital WACC using long-term market data and industry data to derive the appropriate inputs to the calculation.
The Directors have assessed that a 2.0% 2012: 2.0% change in the absolute discount rate is the maximum change that could be considered as reasonably possible and this would represent a 12.0% 2012: 12.0% reduction in the assumption.
If the estimated pre-tax discount rates applied to the discounted cash flows of all CGUs were 2.0% 2012: 2.0% higher in absolute terms than the managements estimates, the Group would not have any impairment charge.
The Group considers that the long-term growth rates could change and that a 1.0% 2012: 1.0% change is reasonably possible.
If the absolute value of the long-term growth used in the VIU calculations for all CGUs were 1% lower than managements estimates, the Group would not have recognized any goodwill impairment charge.
The directors have considered combinations of a reduction in the long-term operating margins across all CGUS combined with a reasonably possible increase in the absolute discount rate and a reasonably possible decrease in the long-term growth rates and no impairment would occur in these scenarios.
The medium-term Adjusted EBITDA for each CGU is primarily based upon past performance adjusted as appropriate where management believes that past Adjusted EBITDA margins are not indicative of future Adjusted EBITDA margins.
The medium-term Adjusted EBITDA margins applied to each CGU is 42.5% 2012: 40.0%.
The medium-term growth rates of net operating cash flows are assumed to be 4.0% for each CGU 2012: 4.0%.
Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic life see accounting policy IH d. The additions to Technology and Customer Relationships in the year relate to the acquisition of the Iona business note 34.
At 30 April 2013, the unamortized lives of technology assets were in the range of three to seven years and for customer relationships in the range of two to eight years.
Amortization of $7.6m 2012: $7.3m is included in selling and distribution costs, $26.9m 2012: $24.6m is included in research and development expense and $0.6m 2012: $0.9m is included in administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The Group carried out a review of the fixed assets in the year and made some reclassifications as a result between categories.

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers the ageing of each debtor and any change in the circumstances of the individual receivable.
Due to this, management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful receivables.
At 30 April 2013 and 2012, the carrying amount approximates the fair value of the instrument due to the short-term nature of the instrument.
At 30 April 2013, trade receivables of $11.0m 2012: $12.9m were past due but not impaired.
These relate to a large number of independent companies for whom there is no recent history of default.
The amounts are regarded as recoverable.
The average age of these receivables was 28 days in excess of due date 2012: 33 days.
As at 30 April 2013, trade receivables of $2.1m 2012: $2.8m were either partially or fully impaired.
The amount of the provision was $2.1m 2012: $2.8m.
The ageing of these receivables is as follows: 2013 2012 $000 $000 Three to four months 72 152 Over four months 2,065 2,605 Total 2,137 2,757 Movements in the Group provision for impairment of trade receivables were as follows: 2013 2012 $000 $000 At 1 May 2,757 4,416 Provision for receivables impairment 860 959 Acquisition of the Iona business 1,173 Receivables written off as uncollectable 890 2,501 Exchange adjustments 43 117 At 30 April 2,137 2,757 The creation and release of provision for impaired receivables have been included in selling and distribution costs in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Amounts charged in the allowance account are generally written off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.

Interest on the facility was payable at US Dollar LIBOR plus 2.1% from 2 December 2011 for a period of approximately six months.
The rate then payable is dependent upon the Groups net debt to RCF EBITDA ratio on a periodic basis.
The range payable is 1.75% to 2.35% over US Dollar LIBOR.
The facility can be used on an ongoing basis for the payment of distributions to shareholders, acquisitions and general corporate purposes.
Borrowings are stated after the deduction of unamortized prepaid facility costs.
Facility arrangement costs are being amortized over the expected life of the facility.
The amortization of facility arrangement costs was accelerated in the year, as the Group is anticipating refinancing the existing bank facility in the near future.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at 30 April 2013 was: 2013 2012 $000 $000 Trade and other receivables 82,227 81,278 Cash and cash equivalents 37,943 30,410 Total 120,170 111,688 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 59 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2013 continued 21 Financial instruments continued Risk management The Groups treasury function aims to reduce exposures to interest rate, foreign exchange and other financial risks, to ensure liquidity is available as and when required, and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
The Group does not typically engage in speculative trading in financial instruments.
The treasury functions policies and procedures are reviewed and monitored by the audit committee and are subject to internal audit review.
Foreign exchange risk The Groups currency exposures comprise those that give rise to net currency gains and losses to be recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as well as gains and losses on consolidation which go to reserves.
Such exposures reflect the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved and the Groups investment in net assets in currencies other than US$.
Note 3 shows the impact on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income of foreign exchange gains in the year.
Sensitivity analysis The Groups principal exposures in relation to market risks are the changes in the exchange rates between the US dollar and the Euro and to changes in US LIBOR interest rates.
The table below illustrates the sensitivities of the Groups results to changes in these key variables as at the balance sheet date.
The analysis covers only financial assets and liabilities held at the balance sheet date.

The strategy is designed to maximize shareholder return over the long-term.
The relative proportion of debt to equity will be adjusted over the medium-term depending on the cost of debt compared to equity and the level of uncertainty facing the industry and the Group.
The Groups committed credit facilities contain two principal financial covenants.
The Group has complied with these covenant requirements during the year ended 30 April 2013.
Further details on the covenant requirements and Group performance against these can be found on page 4 of the Business Review.

Incentive Plan 2005 On 27 April 2005 the remuneration committee approved the rules of the Incentive Plan 2005 LTIP which permits the granting of share options to executive directors and senior management.
The total number of options they receive is determined by the performance criteria set by the remuneration committee over a three year performance period.
Prior to 18 April 2011 performance conditions required that cumulative EPS growth over a three year vesting period is at least equal to RPI plus 11% at which point 25% of awards will vest, 60% of shares will vest for cumulative EPS growth of RPI plus 13% and for full vesting the cumulative EPS growth will be required to be RPI plus 15% per annum.
Straight-line vesting will apply between these points.
Awards granted on or after 18 April 2011 are subject to either Absolute Shareholder Returns ASR over a three year period, cumulative EPS growth or a combination of both.
Where the cumulative EPS growth over a three year period is at least equal to RPI plus 3% per annum 25% of awards will vest with full vesting is achieved when the cumulative EPS growth is RPI plus 9% per annum.
Straight line vesting will apply between these points.
Where the award is subject to ASR the resulting level of vesting will be reduced by 25% if the ASR is below 150 pence or increased by 50% if ASR is 300 pence or more.
Further details are provided in the remuneration committee report.
For certain options issued during the year ended 30 April 2011 to Kevin Loosemore, the performance condition provides for awards to vest by reference to the percentage increase in the Companys total shareholder return over the performance period.
The level of vesting is the percentage increase and is not capped.
No return will be delivered on these options unless there is an absolute return for shareholders.
