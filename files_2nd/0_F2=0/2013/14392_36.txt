Provisions Provisions for warranties and product liability, disposal indemnities, restructuring costs, vacant leasehold property and legal claims are recognised when: the Company has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event: it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are discounted where the time value of money is material.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, for example where a warranty has been given, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole.
A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
Assets and businesses held for sale Assets and businesses classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale and gains or losses on subsequent remeasurements are included in the income statement.
No depreciation is charged on assets and businesses classified as held for sale.
Assets and businesses are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered or settled principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
The asset or business must be available for immediate sale and the sale must be highly probable within one year.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand and highly liquid interest-bearing securities with maturities of three months or less.
In the cash-flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank overdrafts, which are included as current borrowings in liabilities on the balance sheet.
Financial assets The classification of financial assets depends on the purpose for which the assets were acquired.
Management determines the classification of an asset at initial recognition and re-evaluates the designation at each reporting date.
Financial assets are classified as: loans and receivables, available for sale financial assets or financial assets where changes in fair value are charged or credited to the income statement.
Financial assets are initially recognised at transaction price when the Group becomes party to contractual obligations.
The transaction price used includes transaction costs unless the asset is being fair valued through the income statement.
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Available for sale financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses being recognised in other comprehensive income.
Financial assets where changes in fair value are charged or credited to the income statement are subsequently measured at fair value.
Realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through the income statement category are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash-flows from the assets has expired, or has been transferred, and the Company has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership.
When securities classified as available for sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments previously taken to reserves are included in the income statement.
Financial assets are classified as current if they are expected to be realised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Financial liabilities Borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the proceeds, net of related transaction costs.
These transaction costs, and any discount or premium on issue, are subsequently amortised under the effective interest rate method through the income statement as interest over the life of the loan, and added to the liability disclosed in the balance sheet.
Related accrued interest is included in the borrowings figure.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least one year after the balance sheet date.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The method of recognising any resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Fair value hedge Changes in the fair values of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair values of the hedged assets or liabilities that are attributable to the hedged risk.
Net investment hedge Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash-flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income: the gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
When a foreign operation is disposed of gains and losses accumulated in equity related to that operation are included in the income statement.
Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2013 113 Accounts Governance Risks and responsibility Business review Chairman and Chief Executive Group overview Accounting policies Continued Cash-flow hedge The effective portions of changes in the fair values of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash-flow hedges are recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in the hedge reserve are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged items will affect profit or loss for instance when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place.
If a forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset for example, inventory or a liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in the hedge reserve are transferred from the reserve and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in the hedge reserve at that time remains in the reserve and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in other comprehensive income is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are the amounts at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
IFRS 7: Financial instruments: Disclosures requires fair value measurements to be classified according to the following hierarchy: level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: level 2 valuations in which all inputs are observable either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices : and level 3 valuations in which one or more inputs are not based on observable market data.
The Group uses the following methods to estimate the fair values of its financial instruments: cash, trade receivables and payables and floating rate borrowings the carrying value is a good approximation of the fair value: government bonds quoted market prices level 1 : fixed rate borrowings quoted market prices of equivalent instruments level 2 : and forward exchange contracts, currency swaps, interest rate instruments and embedded derivatives net present value of the future cash-flows, calculated using market data at the balance sheet date principally exchange rates and yield curves level 2.
Borrowings are carried on the balance sheet at amortised cost adjusted for fair value interest rate hedging.
The fair value of fixed rate borrowings is only used for supplementary disclosures.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are authorised.
The interim dividend is recognised when it is paid and the final dividend is recognised when it has been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Recent accounting developments The following standards and interpretations have been issued by the IASB and may affect future annual reports and accounts.
IFRS 9: Financial instruments IFRS 10: Consolidated financial statements IAS 27 Revised 2011 : Separate financial statements IFRS 11: Joint arrangements IAS 28 Revised 2011 : Investments in associates and joint ventures IFRS 12: Disclosure of interests in other entities IFRS 13: Fair value measurement IAS 19 Revised 2011 : Employee benefits Amendment to IAS 36: Impairment of assets on recoverable amount disclosures.
A review of the impact of these standards and interpretations is being undertaken, and the impact of adopting them will be determined once this review has been completed.
Based on the work completed to date, the changes are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups reported position or performance, except for the implementation of IAS 19 Revised 2011 : Employee benefits.
An estimate of the impact of adopting this standard, which is expected to be implemented in the year ending 31 July 2014, is provided at the end of note9.

This measure of profit is described as headline and is used by management to measure and monitor performance.
The following items have been excluded from the headline measure: exceptional items, including income and expenditure relating to material litigation in respect of products no longer in production: amortisation and impairment of intangible assets acquired in a business combination the charge is a non-cash item, and the directors believe that it should be added back to give a clearer picture of underlying performance: other financing gains and losses, which represent the potentially volatile gains and losses on derivatives and other financial instruments which do not fall to be hedge accounted under IAS 39: and financing credits and charges relating to retirement benefits.
The excluded items are referred to as non-headline items.

This programme, which involves redundancy, relocation, and consolidation of manufacturing, is considered exceptional by virtue of its size.
Gains on changes to post retirement benefits comprise a settlement gain of 2.2m on the closure of a defined benefit pension scheme which is net of professional costs of 0.8m, and a past service gain of 2.1m on a scheme which has been closed to future accruals.
The agreement of the Cross Match Technologies, Inc closing balance sheet and tax position has generated a 0.6m additional profit on disposal of businesses.
The profit on disposal of property has arisen from the sale of two sites which were formerly occupied by businesses which are no longer owned by Smiths.
Professional fees of 3m have been incurred in relation to potential acquisitions and disposals.
A charge of 6.8m has been made by Titeflex Corporation in respect of changes to the estimated cost of future claims including those from insurance companies seeking recompense for damage allegedly caused by lightning strike, net of gains of 2.6m relating to changes in discounting.
The operating charge in respect of John Crane, Inc. litigation comprises 22.6m in respect of increased provision for adverse judgments and legal defence costs, 0.5m in respect of legal fees in connection with litigation against insurers, less 8.8m arising from the increase in US risk free rates.
Year ended 31 July 2012 Restructuring costs comprised 12.6m in respect of the improvement programme in Smiths Detection announced in September 2011 and 2.8m in respect of the divisional reorganisation which began in 2008.
These two programmes, which involve redundancy, relocation and consolidation of manufacturing, were considered exceptional by virtue of their size.
A charge of 7.8m was made by Smiths Medical to reflect a change to the historical basis of estimating the accrual for rebates to distributors.
This change arose due to the availability of improved data from distributors.
Had this approach been used in previous years, there would have been no material impact on the revenue or operating profits of Smiths Medical in any of the prior five financial years and no material impact is expected on future revenue or profit.
The charge, which was recognised as a reduction in revenue, was treated as an exceptional item on the basis that it was an unusual non-recurring item that distorts trading performance for the year ended 31 July 2012.
The profit on disposal of businesses comprised 26.8m profit on the sale of the Groups interest in Cross Match see note 13, 0.1m relating to small non-core business sold in the year and 3.9m from the resolution of indemnities in respect of disposals in previous years.
A charge of 54.5m was made by Titeflex Corporation in respect of the estimated cost of future claims from insurance companies seeking recompense for damage allegedly caused by lightning strikes.
The operating charge in respect of John Crane, Inc. litigation comprised 28.3m in respect of increased provisions for adverse judgments and legal defence costs, 0.9m in respect of legal fees in connection with litigation against insurers, and 10.4m arising from the reduction in US risk free rates.
At 31 July 2011 the Group recognised UK tax assets relating to revenue losses brought forward and deferred capital allowances of 37.7m.
The value of these assets is reviewed regularly and is dependent on the ability to recover them against forecast UK taxable profits.
Having considered the impact of the increased pension deficit on the outlook for the UK tax base, the Group decided to derecognise the tax assets at 31 July 2012 as an exceptional non-headline tax charge because it was no longer probable that they would be recovered.

Of this asset, 60.7m 2012: 51.1m relates to the John Crane, Inc. litigation provision, and 24.9m 2012: 23.0m relates to Titeflex Corporation.
See note 21 for additional information on provisions: and a deferred tax asset of 22.2m 2012: 15.1m relating to inventory where current tax relief is only available when the inventory is sold.
The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets relating to tax losses of 392.9m 2012: 380.4m and pensions and other long term liabilities of 284.5m 2012: 504.3m due to uncertainty as to their recoverability.
This includes 71.5m 2012: 327.1m relating to the UK pension deficit.
In 2012 deferred tax of 23.5m on UK losses and 14.2m on other assets was derecognised as potentially higher contributions to retirement benefit schemes mean the UK is unlikely to generate sufficient taxable profits to utilise the deductible temporary differences related to the deferred tax assets, The resulting charge of 37.7m was treated as an exceptional tax item note 4.
These tax allowances remain available to the Group and can be utilised should the UK tax base improve.

The arrangements include defined benefit and defined contribution plans and, mainly in the United Kingdom UK and United States of America US, post retirement healthcare.
Defined contribution plans The Group operates a number of defined contribution plans across many countries.
In the UK a defined contribution plan has been offered since the closure of the UK defined benefit pension plans.
In the US a 401k defined contribution plan operates.
The total expense recognised in the income statement in respect of all these plans was 29.9m 2012: 29.0m.
Defined benefit and post retirement healthcare plans The principal defined benefit pension plans are in the UK and in the US and these have been closed so that no future benefits are accrued.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent,  actuaries.
The most recent actuarial valuations of the two principal UK schemes SIPS and TIGPS were performed using the Projected Unit Method as at 31 March 2012 and 5April2012.
The most recent valuations of the six principal US pension and post-retirement healthcare plans were performed at 1January2010.
These valuations have been updated by independent qualified actuaries in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 31July2013.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values.
Contributions to the schemes are made on the advice of the actuaries.
The principal assumptions used in updating the valuations are set out below: 2013 2012 UK US Other UK US Other Rate of increase in salaries n a n a 2.7% n a n a 3.1% Rate of increase for active deferred members 4.3% n a n a 3.7% n a n a Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.4% n a 0.9% 2.8% n a 0.8% Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.4% n a 1.0% 2.8% n a 0.8% Discount rate 4.4% 4.8% 4.0% 4.1% 3.8% 4.1% Inflation rate 3.4% n a 1.7% 2.8% n a 1.6% Healthcare cost increases 5.0% n a 2.6% 5.0% n a 2.3% The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
For countries outside the UK and USA these are disclosed as a weighted average.
The mortality assumptions used in the principal UK schemes are based on the recent actual mortality experience of members within each scheme.
The assumptions are based on the new SAPS All birth year tables with relevant scaling factors based on the experience of the schemes.
The assumption also allows for future improvements in life expectancy in line with the 2012 CMI projections blended to a long term rate of 1.25%.
The mortality assumptions used in the principal US schemes are based on the RP 2000 table projected to 2025.
The table selected allows for future mortality improvements and applies an adjustment for job classification blue collar versus white collar.
The assumptions give the following: Expected further years of life UK US Male Female Male Female Member who retires next year at age 65 23 25 20 21 Member, currently 45, when they retire in 20 years time 25 27 20 21 The assets in the scheme and the expected rates of return as at 31 July 2013 were: 31 July 2013 UK schemes US schemes Other countries Total Long-term Value Long-term Value Long-term Value rate of return m rate of return m rate of return m m Equities 7.2% 1,618.3 7.9% 311.2 8.0% 19.4 1,948.9 Government bonds 3.3% 187.2 3.4% 29.1 5.5% 11.2 227.5 Corporate bonds 4.4% 274.2 4.8% 158.9 4.9% 2.3 435.4 Insured liabilities 4.4% 672.1 4.1% 0.5 672.6 Property 6.8% 176.4 5.9% 0.5 176.9 Other 3.4% 217.7 1.0% 2.0 3.1% 15.2 234.9 Total market value 3,145.9 501.2 49.1 3,696.2 Present value of funded scheme liabilities 3,160.6 620.5 61.5 3,842.6 Deficit 14.7 119.3 12.4 146.4 Unfunded pension plans 48.3 6.5 31.3 86.1 Post-retirement healthcare 8.5 11.6 1.0 21.1 Present value of unfunded obligations 56.8 18.1 32.3 107.2 Unrecognised asset due to surplus restriction Net pension liability 71.5 137.4 44.7 253.6 Post-retirement assets 120.6 1.1 121.7 Post-retirement liabilities 192.1 137.4 45.8 375.3 Net pension liability 71.5 137.4 44.7 253.6 124 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2013 9 Post-retirement benefits continued 31 July 2012 UK schemes US schemes Other countries Total Long-term Value Long-term Value Long-term Value rate of return m rate of return m rate of return m m Equities 7.2% 1,294.1 7.3% 245.1 9.2% 12.9 1,552.1 Government bonds 2.5% 168.0 2.3% 43.5 4.8% 7.0 218.5 Corporate bonds 4.1% 81.8 3.8% 169.5 5.0% 0.5 251.8 Insured liabilities 4.1% 665.7 4.1% 3.7 669.4 Property 6.8% 177.1 10.4% 0.8 177.9 Other 2.9% 458.2 3.7% 19.7 477.9 Total market value 2,844.9 458.1 44.6 3,347.6 Present value of funded scheme liabilities 3,116.7 680.6 66.3 3,863.6 Surplus deficit 271.8 222.5 21.7 516.0 Unfunded pension plans 46.1 6.9 28.0 81.0 Post-retirement healthcare 9.2 13.0 0.9 23.1 Present value of unfunded obligations 55.3 19.9 28.9 104.1 Unrecognised asset due to surplus restriction 0.1 0.1 Net pension liability 327.1 242.4 50.7 620.2 Post-retirement assets 7.2 7.2 Post-retirement liabilities 334.3 242.4 50.7 627.4 Net pension liability 327.1 242.4 50.7 620.2 Where any individual scheme shows a recoverable surplus under IAS 19, this is disclosed on the balance sheet as a retirement benefit asset.
The IAS 19 surplus of any one scheme is not available to fund the IAS 19 deficit of another scheme.
The retirement benefit asset disclosed arises from the rights of the employers to recover the surplus at the end of the life of the scheme.
If the pension schemes were wound up while they had members, the schemes would need to buy out the benefits of all members.
The buy outs would cost significantly more than the present value of the scheme liabilities calculated in accordance with IAS 19.
Other assets in the UK and US comprise cash and current assets.
The scheme assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, nor other assets used by, the Group.
The expected rates of return on individual categories of scheme assets are determined by reference to relevant industries.
The overall rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the schemes investment portfolios.

Following completion of the 2012 triennial valuations for the principal UK schemes, agreement has been reached with the trustees that the current contributions will continue as follows: Cash contributions to SIPS of 36m a year until October 2019.
In connect with SIPS, an on-going investment of 24m a year in index-linked gilts held in an escrow account.
The escrow account remains an asset of the Group see note 14 until 2020.
At that time the assets in escrow will be allocated subject to the funding position of SIPS.
In addition, the escrow account may revert to the Group, should there be a surplus at an intervening triennial review.
Cash contributions to TIGPS of 16m a year until April 2016.
In addition to the funding plans referred to above, the Group agreed to make cash contributions to other schemes in respect of any future service cost based on actuarial advice.
In 2014 the following cash contributions to the Groups principal defined benefit schemes are expected: 36m to SIPS: 16m to TIGPS: and approximately 38m to other plans, including the US defined benefit scheme.
Expected cash payments for 2014 total 90m.
In addition, 24m will be invested in UK government bonds held in escrow, in accordance with the funding plan explained above.
Investment In September 2013, the Trustees of the TIGPS invested approximately 160m in annuities which are matched with specific liabilities of the Scheme.

Sensitivity The valuation of post-retirement schemes involves judgements about uncertain future events.
Sensitivities in respect of the key assumptions used to measure the principal pension schemes as at 31 July 2013 are set out below.
These sensitivities show the hypothetical impact of a change in each of the listed assumptions in isolation, with the exception of the sensitivity to inflation which incorporates the impact of certain correlating assumptions.
While each of these sensitivities holds all other assumptions constant, in practice such assumptions rarely change in isolation and the impacts may offset to some extent.

Implementing this standard is expected to have the following impact on the reported position and performance of Smiths Group: Financing credits and charges relating to retirement benefits are excluded from headline profit measures.
In future years, operating profit charges relating to retirement benefit schemes which are closed to future accruals will be excluded from headline profit measures.

Related party transactions The Group has a service contract with a company connected to a member of the Executive Committee.
Costs of 0.2m 2012: 0.3m were incurred in respect of this arrangement.
Value in use calculations are used to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill held allocated to each group of cash generating units CGU.
Value in use is calculated as the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted cash-flows of the CGU.
These forecast cash-flows are based on the 2014 budget and the four year divisional strategic plan, which have both been approved by the Board.
Goodwill is allocated by division as follows: 2013 2012 2013 Number 2012 Number m of CGUs m of CGUs John Crane 142.7 4 139.2 4 Smiths Medical 529.5 1 514.5 1 Smiths Detection 407.8 1 376.9 1 Smiths Interconnect 351.6 3 341.5 3 Flex-Tek 23.1 2 22.3 2 1,454.7 11 1,394.4 11 John Crane and Smiths Medical have strong aftermarket and consumables businesses, with consistent sales trends.
Smiths Detection and Smiths Interconnect have greater sales and margin volatility due to lower levels of recurring revenue and involvement in government funded programmes, particularly defence, and customer led technology innovation.
The key assumptions used in value in use calculations are: Sales: projected sales are built up with reference to markets and product categories.
They incorporate past performance, historical growth rates and projections of developments in key markets.
Margins: projected margins reflect historical performance and the impact of all completed projects to improve operational efficiency and leverage scale.
The projections do not include the impact of future restructuring projects to which the Group is not yet committed.
Discount rate: the discount rates have been calculated based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital and risks specific to the CGU being tested.
Pre-tax rates of 10.9% to 14.9% 2012: 12.3% to 14.1% have been used for the impairment testing.
Long term growth rates: As required by IAS 36, growth rates for the period after the detailed forecasts are based on the long-term GDP projections of the primary market for the CGU.
The average growth rate used in the testing was 2.13% 2012: 2.29%.
These rates do not reflect the long-term assumptions used by the Group for investment planning.
The assumptions used in the impairment testing of significant CGUs are as follows: Year ended 31 July 2013 Smiths Smiths Medical Detection Smiths Interconnect Power Microwave Connectors management Net book value of goodwill m 529.5 407.8 137.3 87.4 126.9 Discount rate 10.9% 14.9% 13.2% 13.8% 13.3% Period covered by management projections 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years Long-term growth rates 2.12% 1.60% 2.76% 2.55% 2.40% Year ended 31 July 2012 Smiths Smiths Medical Detection Smiths Interconnect Power Microwave Connectors management Net book value of goodwill m 514.5 376.9 134.2 84.7 122.6 Discount rate 12.3% 13.5% 14.1% 14.1% 13.1% Period covered by management projections 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years Long-term growth rates 2.20% 2.50% 2.72% 2.32% 2.59% The remaining balance of the goodwill represents smaller individual amounts which have been allocated to smaller CGUs.
130 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2013 11 Intangible assets continued Impairment testing continued Goodwill continued Sensitivity analysis Smiths Interconnect Power managements value in use exceeds its carrying value by 7.8m 2012: 27.4m.
Sensitivity analysis performed around the base case assumptions has indicated that for Smiths Interconnect Power management, the following changes in assumptions in isolation, would cause the value in use to fall below the carrying value: Year ended 31 July 2013 Year ended 31 July 2012 Change required to Change required to trigger impairment trigger impairment Forecast operating cash-flow 4% reduction 12% reduction Discount rate 0.5% higher 1.4% higher Long-term growth rates 0.9% lower 2.8% lower Sales assumptions for Smiths Interconnect Power management are based on: the current order book: proportion of recent tenders which have been successful: and independent projections of the expected growth of the data centre market in North America.
Margin projections for Smiths Interconnect Power management are based on current variable costs and production capacity, and the expected costs of increasing capacity to support higher levels of sales.
For the other CGUs, sensitivity analysis performed around the base case assumptions has indicated that no reasonable changes in key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of any of the CGUs to exceed their respective recoverable amounts.
Other intangible assets The Group has no indefinite life intangible assets other than goodwill.
During the year impairment tests were carried out for development projects which have not yet started to be amortised and acquired intangibles where there were indications of impairment.
In the year ended 31 July 2012 impairment charges of 10.7m were incurred on intangible assets arising from the PDI acquisition.
Value in use calculations were used to determine the recoverable values of these assets.
The impairment charges arose because product sales were lower than expected with a consequential impact on the future value of the technology, customer relationships and brands.
The impairment charge was included in Smiths Interconnect administrative expenses and it was excluded from the calculation of headline operating profit.

Trade receivables are disclosed net of provisions for bad and doubtful debts.
The provisions for bad and doubtful debts are based on specific risk assessment and reference to past default experience.
Credit risk is managed separately for each customer and, where appropriate, a credit limit is set for the customer based on previous experience of the customer and third party credit ratings.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
The largest single customer is the US Federal Government, representing less than 4% 2012: 4% of Group revenue.

19 Financial risk management The Groups international operations and debt financing expose it to financial risks which include the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in debt market prices, interest rates, credit risks and liquidity risks.
Treasury and risk management policies are set by the Board.
The policy sets out specific guidelines to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of financial instruments to manage risk.
The instruments and techniques used to manage exposures include foreign currency derivatives, debt and other interest rate derivatives.
The central treasury function monitors financial risks and compliance with risk management policies.
The management of operational credit risk is discussed in note 16. a Foreign exchange risk Transactional currency exposure The Group is exposed to foreign currency risks arising from sales or purchases by businesses in currencies other than their functional currency.
It is Group policy that, when the net foreign exchange exposure to known future sales and purchases is material, this exposure is hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The net exposure is calculated by adjusting the expected cash-flow for payments or receipts in the same currency linked to the sale or purchase.
This policy minimises the risk that the profits generated from the transaction will be affected by foreign exchange movements which occur after the price has been determined.
Hedge accounting documentation and effectiveness testing are only undertaken if it is cost effective.
The following table shows the currency of financial instruments.
It excludes loans and derivatives designated as net investment hedges.

Based on the assets and liabilities held at the year end, if the specified currencies were to strengthen 10% while all other market rates remained constant, the change in the fair value of financial instruments not designated as net investment hedges would have the following effect: Impact Gain loss Impact Gain loss on profit recognised on profit recognised for the year in reserves for the year in reserves 31 July 2013 31 July 2013 31 July 2012 31 July 2012 m m m m US dollar 2.9 1.7 0.1 4.2 Euro 5.3 2.0 3.6 4.1 Sterling 0.6 0.9 4.1 0.9 These sensitivities were calculated before adjusting for tax and exclude the effect of quasi-equity intra-group loans.
Cash-flow hedging The Group uses foreign currency contracts to hedge future foreign currency sales and purchases.
At 31 July 2013 contracts with a nominal value of 234.0m 2012: 279.4m were designated as hedging instruments.
In addition, the Group had outstanding foreign currency contracts with a nominal value of 87.5m 2012: 249.9m which were being used to manage transactional foreign exchange exposures, but were not accounted for as cash-flow hedges.
The fair value of the contracts is disclosed in note 20.
The majority of hedged transactions will be recognised in the income statement in the same period that the cash-flows are expected to occur, with the only differences arising as a result of normal commercial credit terms on sales and purchases.
Of the foreign exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments 99.9% are for periods of 12 months or less 2012: 98.5%.
The movements in the cash-flow hedge reserve during the period are summarised in the table below: Year ended Year ended 31 July 2013 31 July 2012 m m Brought forward cash-flow hedge reserve at start of year 4.7 0.3 Exchange adjustments 0.2 0.1 Gains losses on effective cash-flow hedges recognised in equity 11.0 10.9 Amounts removed from the hedge reserve and recognised in the following lines on the income statement revenue 3.8 5.5 cost of sales 0.5 0.9 Carried forward cash-flow hedge reserve at end of year 1.8 4.7 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2013 135 Accounts Governance Risks and responsibility Business review Chairman and Chief Executive Group overview Notes to the accounts Continued 19 Financial risk management continued Translational currency exposure The Group has significant investments in overseas operations, particularly in the United States and Europe.
As a result, the sterling value of the Groups balance sheet can be significantly affected by movements in exchange rates.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of these translational currency exposures by matching the net investment in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in their functional currencies, except where significant adverse interest differentials or other factors would render the cost of such hedging activity uneconomic.
This is achieved by borrowing primarily in the relevant currency or in some cases indirectly through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps.
Net investment hedges The table below sets out the currency of loans and swap contracts designated as net investment hedges: At 31 July 2013 Sterling US$ Euro Other Total m m m m m Loans designated as net investment hedges 697.0 267.5 964.5 Currency swap contracts 197.1 56.2 52.4 88.5 197.1 753.2 319.9 88.5 964.5 At 31 July 2012 Sterling US$ Euro Other Total m m m m m Loans designated as net investment hedges 590.9 240.9 831.8 Currency swap contracts 192.4 69.4 39.2 83.8 192.4 660.3 280.1 83.8 831.8 At 31 July 2013 swap contracts in other currencies hedged the Groups exposure to Canadian dollars, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi 31 July 2012: Canadian dollars, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi.
Of the contracts designated as net investment hedges, 55% 2012: 55% are current and the balance matures over the next three years 2012: three years.
The gains and losses that have been deferred in the net investment hedge reserve are shown in the table below: Year ended Year ended 31 July 2013 31 July 2012 m m Brought forward net investment hedge reserve at start of year 120.1 120.3 Amounts deferred in the period on effective net investment hedges 55.7 0.2 Carried forward net investment hedge reserve at end of year 175.8 120.1 The fair values of these net investment hedges are subject to exchange rate movements.
Based on the hedging instruments in place at the year end, if the specified currencies were to strengthen 10% while all other market rates remained constant, it would have the following effect: Loss Loss recognised in recognised in hedge reserve hedge reserve 31 July 2013 31 July 2012 m m US dollar 76.2 65.6 Euro 29.2 25.0 These movements would be fully offset by an opposite movement on the retranslation of the net assets of the overseas subsidiaries.
These sensitivities were calculated before adjusting for tax.
b Interest rate risk The Group operates an interest rate policy designed to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings.
The Groups current policy is to require interest rates to be fixed for greater than 70% of the level of gross debt.
This is achieved primarily through fixed rate borrowings, and also through the use of interest rate swaps.
At 31 July 2013 76% 2012: 75% of the Groups gross borrowings were at fixed interest rates, after adjusting for interest rate swaps and the impact of short maturity derivatives designated as net investment hedges.
The Group monitors its fixed rate risk profile against both gross and net debt.
For medium term planning, it now focuses on gross debt to eliminate the fluctuations of variable cash levels over the cycle.
The weighted average interest rate on borrowings and cross-currency swaps at 31 July 2013, after interest rate swaps, is 5.2% 2012: 5.5%.
136 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2013 19 Financial risk management continued Interest rate profile of financial assets and liabilities and the fair value of borrowings The following table shows the interest rate risk exposure of investments, cash and borrowings, with the borrowings adjusted for the impact of interest rate hedging.
The other financial assets and liabilities do not earn or bear interest and for all financial instruments except for borrowings the carrying value is not materially different from their fair value.
Available Cash Available Cash for sale and cash Fair value of for sale and cash Fair value of investments equivalents Borrowings borrowings investments equivalents Borrowings borrowings 31 July 2013 31 July 2013 31 July 2013 31 July 2013 31 July 2012 31 July 2012 31 July 2012 31 July 2012 m m m m m m m m Fixed interest Less than one year 165.7 170.9 65.0 66.1 Between one and five years 423.3 483.7 451.5 500.8 Greater than five years 83.0 327.3 349.0 58.4 270.2 333.4 Total fixed interest financial assets liabilities 83.0 916.3 1,003.6 58.4 786.7 900.3 Floating rate interest financial assets liabilities 339.8 221.9 221.9 189.0 210.3 210.3 Total interest bearing financial assets liabilities 83.0 339.8 1,138.2 1,225.5 58.4 189.0 997.0 1,110.6 Non-interest bearing assets liabilities in the same category 3.1 54.0 2.5 16.6 Total 86.1 393.8 1,138.2 1,225.5 60.9 205.6 997.0 1,110.6 Interest rate hedging At 31 July 2013 the Group has designated US$150.0m interest rate swaps which mature on 12 October 2022 and 120.0m interest rate swaps which mature on 5 May 2017 as fair value hedges on the US$ 2022 Guaranteed notes and the 2017 Eurobond respectively which mature on the same dates.
At 31 July 2012 the same euro hedge was in place, and US$150m interest rate swaps which matured on 28 January 2013 were designated as fair value hedges on the US Private placement which matured this year.
These positions hedge the risk of variability in the fair value of borrowings arising from fluctuations in base rates.
The fair values of the hedging instruments are disclosed in note 20.
The effect of the swaps is to convert 203.8m 2012: 190.0m debt from fixed rate to floating rate.
Sensitivity of interest charges to interest rate movements The Group has exposure to sterling, US dollar and euro interest rates.
However the Group does not have a significant exposure to interest rate movements for any individual currency.
Based on the composition of net debt and foreign exchange rates at 31 July 2013, and taking into consideration all fixed rate borrowings and interest rate swaps in place, a one percentage point 100 basis points change in average floating interest rates for all three currencies would have a 0.4m 2012: 0.6m impact on the Groups profit before tax.
Based on the investments held at 31 July 2013 a one percentage point 100 basis points increase in sterling interest rates would reduce the carrying value of investments by 11.8m 2012: 8.7m, generating a corresponding charge to reserves.
c Financial credit risk The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not currently expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
Credit risk is mitigated by the Board approved policy of only placing cash deposits with highly rated relationship bank counterparties within counterparty limits established by reference to their Standard & Poors long-term debt rating.

Trading Warranty provision and product liability At 31 July 2013 there are warranty and product liability provisions of 40.0m 2012: 34.5m.
Warranties over the Groups products typically cover periods of between one and three years.
Provision is made for the likely cost of after-sales support based on the recent past experience of individual businesses.
Litigation in respect of current products or ongoing business activities The Group has on occasion been required to take legal action to protect its intellectual property and other rights against infringement.
It has also had to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties, including product liability and insurance subrogation claims.
Provision is made for any expected costs and liabilities in relation to these proceedings where appropriate, though there can be no guarantee that such provisions which may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time will accurately predict the actual costs and liabilities that may be incurred.
Exceptional and legacy John Crane, Inc. John Crane, Inc. JCI is one of many co-defendants in numerous lawsuits pending in the United States in which plaintiffs are claiming damages arising from alleged exposure to, or use of, products previously manufactured which contained asbestos.
Until 2006, the awards, the related interest and all material defence costs were met directly by insurers.
In 2007, JCI secured the commutation of certain insurance policies in respect of product liability.
While JCI has excess liability insurance, the availability of such insurance and scope of the cover are currently the subject of litigation in the United States.
An adverse judgment at first instance from the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois is currently under appeal.
Pending the outcome of that litigation, JCI has begun to meet defence costs directly.
Provision is made in respect of the expected costs of defending known and predicted future claims and of adverse judgments in relation thereto, to the extent that such costs can be reliably estimated.
No account has been taken of recoveries from insurers as their nature and timing are not yet sufficiently certain to permit recognition as an asset for these purposes.
The JCI products generally referred to in these cases consist of industrial sealing product, primarily packing and gaskets.
The asbestos was encapsulated within these products in such a manner that causes JCI to believe, based on tests conducted on its behalf, that the products were safe.
JCI ceased manufacturing products containing asbestos in 1985.
JCI continues to actively monitor the conduct and effect of its current and expected asbestos litigation, including the most efficacious presentation of its safe product defence, and intends to continue to resist these asbestos claims based upon this defence.
Approximately 230,000 claims against JCI have been dismissed before trial over the last 34 years.
JCI is currently a defendant in cases involving approximately 81,000 claims.
Despite the large number of claims brought against JCI, it has had final judgments against it, after appeals, in only 121 cases over the period, and has had to pay awards amounting to approximately US$120m.
JCI has also incurred significant additional defence costs and, whilst the number of claims being filed against JCI and other defendants has been declining, the proportion of mesothelioma claims has increased, and JCIs ability to defend these cases successfully is likely to have a significant impact on its annual aggregate adverse judgment and defence costs.
The provision is based on past history and allows for decreasing levels of new claims based on published tables of asbestos incidence projections and is determined using asbestos valuation experts, Bates White LLC.
Whilst published incidence curves can be used to estimate the likely future pattern of asbestos related disease, John Crane, Inc. s claims experience is significantly impacted by other factors which influence the US litigation environment.
These can include: changing approaches on the part of the plaintiffs bar: changing attitudes amongst the judiciary at both trial and appellate levels: and legislative and procedural changes in both the state and federal court systems.
The projections use a 10 year time horizon on the basis that Bates White LLC consider that there is substantial uncertainty in the asbestos litigation environment so probable expenditures are not reasonably estimable beyond this time horizon, see note 24.
140 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2013 21 Provisions for liabilities and charges continued Exceptional and legacy continued John Crane, Inc. continued The assumptions made in assessing the appropriate level of provision include: The period over which the expenditure can be reliably estimated.
The future trend of legal costs.
The rate of future claims filed.
The rate of successful resolution of claims.
The average amount of judgments awarded.
However, because of the significant uncertainty associated with the future level of asbestos claims and of the costs arising out of related litigation, there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be incurred and, as a result, the provision may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time if new information becomes available as a result of future events.
The provision in respect of JCI is a discounted pre-tax provision using discount rates, being the risk-free rate on US debt instruments for the appropriate period.
The deferred tax asset related to this provision is shown within the deferred tax balance note 6.
Set out below is the gross, discounted and post-tax information relating to this provision: 31 July 2013 31 July 2012 m m Gross provision 232.8 226.3 Discount 22.8 13.2 Discounted pre-tax provision 210.0 213.1 Deferred tax 60.7 51.1 Discounted post-tax provision 149.3 162.0 Titeflex Corporation In recent years Titeflex Corporation, a subsidiary of the Group in the Flex-Tek division, has received a number of claims from insurance companies seeking recompense on a subrogated basis for the effects of damage allegedly caused by lightning strikes in relation to its flexible gas piping product.
It has also received a number of product liability claims regarding this product, some in the form of purported class actions.
Titeflex Corporation believes that its products are a safe and effective means of delivering gas when installed in accordance with the manufacturers instructions and local and national codes, however some subrogation claims have been settled on an individual basis without admission of liability.
Equivalent third-party products in the US marketplace face similar challenges with the profile of legal activity appearing to increase in recent times.
The continuing progress of claims and the pattern of settlement, together with the recent market place activity, provide sufficient evidence to recognise a liability in the accounts.
Therefore provision has been made for the costs which the Group is expected to incur in respect of future claims to the extent that such costs can be reliably estimated.
Titeflex Corporation sells flexible gas piping with extensive installation and safety guidance revised in 2008 designed to assure the safety of the product and minimise the risk of damage associated with lightning strikes.
The assumptions made in assessing the appropriate level of provision, which are based on past experience, include: The period over which expenditure can be reliably estimated The number of future settlements The average amount of settlements The projections use a rolling 10 year time horizon on the basis that there is substantial uncertainty in the US litigation environment so probable expenditures are not reasonably estimable beyond this time horizon, see note 24.
However, because of the significant uncertainty associated with the future level of claims and of the costs arising out of related litigation, there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be incurred and, as a result, the provision may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time if new information becomes available as a result of future events.
The provision of 65.6m 2012: 61.8m is a discounted pre-tax provision using discount rates, being the risk-free rate on US debt instruments for the appropriate period.
Other Reorganisation and property At 31 July 2013 a provision of 10.7m 2012: 9.4m relates to the performance improvement programme in Smiths Detection.
Disposal Other provisions include disposal provisions of 3.6m 2012: 4.0m relating to warranties and other obligations in respect of the disposal of the Marine Systems and Aerospace businesses.
Most of the balance is expected to be utilised within the next five years.

In the year the Company issued nil 2012: nil shares to the Trust, and the Trust purchased 1,027,540 shares 2012: 1,026,514 shares in the market.
At 31 July 2013 the Trust held 855 2012: 855 ordinary shares.
The capital redemption reserve, revaluation reserve and merger reserve arose from: share repurchases: revaluations of property, plant and equipment: and merger accounting for business combinations before the adoption of IFRS, respectively.
Capital management Capital employed comprises total equity adjusted for goodwill recognised directly in reserves, net post-retirement benefit related assets and liabilities, net litigation provisions relating to exceptional items and net debt.
The efficiency of the allocation of the capital to the divisions is monitored through the return on capital employed ROCE.
This ratio is calculated over a rolling 12-month period and is the percentage that headline operating profit comprises of monthly average capital employed.
The capital structure is based on the directors judgement of the balance required to maintain flexibility while achieving an efficient cost of capital.
The Group has a target gearing, calculated on a market value basis, of approximately 20%.
At the balance sheet date the Group had gearing of 13% 2012: 17%.
The Group has surplus cash on the balance sheet and the ratio of net debt to headline EBITDA of 1.2 is well below the medium term target of 1.5 to 2.0.
The Groups robust balance sheet and record of strong cash generation is more than able to fund the immediate investment needs and other legacy obligations.
The Board has therefore recommended a return of cash to shareholders of approximately 118m in the form of a special dividend of 30.0p per share.
As part of its capital management the Group strategy is to maintain a solid investment grade credit rating to ensure access to the widest possible sources of financing and to minimise the resulting cost of capital.
At 31 July 2013 the Group had a credit rating of BBB Baa2 2012: BBB Baa2 with Standard & Poors and Moodys respectively.
The credit rating is managed through the following cash-flow targets: headline operating cash conversion of greater than 80% and a ratio of net debt to headline EBITDA of less than two.
The Board aims for dividend cover of around 2.5 times, to ensure that the Group retains sufficient cash to finance investment in growth.

24 Contingent liabilities and commitments John Crane, Inc. As stated in note 21, John Crane, Inc. JCI is involved in numerous lawsuits pending in the United States in which plaintiffs are claiming damages arising from exposure to, or use of, products containing asbestos.
The JCI products generally referred to in these cases are ones in which the asbestos fibres were encapsulated in such a manner that, according to tests conducted on behalf of JCI, the products were safe.
Provision has been made for future defence costs and the cost of adverse judgments expected to occur.
JCIs claims experience is significantly impacted by other factors which influence the US litigation environment.
As a result, whilst the Group anticipates that asbestos litigation will continue beyond the period covered by the provision, the uncertainty surrounding the US litigation environment beyond this point is such that the costs cannot be reliability estimated.
142 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2013 24 Contingent liabilities and commitments continued Titeflex Corporation As stated in note 21, Titeflex Corporation has made provision for the cost of expected future subrogation and product liability claims.
The Group anticipates that litigation might continue beyond the period covered by the provision.
However, the uncertainty surrounding the US litigation environment beyond this point which reflects factors such as changing approaches on the part of the plaintiffs bar: changing attitudes amongst the judiciary at both trial and appellate levels: and legislative and procedural changes in both the state and federal court systems is such that the costs cannot be reliably estimated.
Other contingent liabilities and commitments In the ordinary course of its business, the Group is subject to commercial disputes and litigation such as product liability claims, employee disputes and other kinds of lawsuits, and faces different types of legal issues in different jurisdictions.
The high level of activity in the US, for example, exposes the Group to the likelihood of various types of litigation commonplace in that country, such as mass tort and class action litigation, legal challenges to the scope and validity of patents, and product liability and insurance subrogation claims.
These types of proceedings or the threat of them are also used to create pressure to encourage negotiated settlement of disputes.
Any claim brought against the Group with or without merit, could be costly to defend.
These matters are inherently difficult to quantify.
In appropriate cases a provision is recognised based on best estimates and management judgement but there can be no guarantee that these provisions which may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs and liabilities that may be incurred.
There are also contingent liabilities in respect of litigation for which no provisions are made.
At 31 July 2013, contingent liabilities, comprising bonds and guarantees arising in the normal course of business, amounted to 166.0m 2012: 167.4m, including pension commitments of 52.1m 2012: 49.5m.
From time to time the Group co-operates with relevant authorities in investigating business conduct issues.
The Group is not aware of any issues which are expected to generate material financial exposures.
