88 HellermannTyton Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 continued 27 Retirement benefit obligations continued The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is as follows: Impact on defined benefit obligation Change in assumption Increase in assumption Decrease in assumption Discount rate 1.0% Decrease by 13.69% Increase by 20.47% Inflation rate 1.0% Increase by 18.07% Decrease by 12.38% The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions, the same method present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the balance sheet.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared with the previous year.
