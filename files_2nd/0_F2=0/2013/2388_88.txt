Finance debt continued The following table shows, by major currency, the groups finance debt at 31 December and the weighted average interest rates achieved at those dates through a combination of borrowings and derivative financial instruments entered into to manage interest rate and currency exposures.
The disposal deposits noted above are excluded from this analysis.

Fair values The estimated fair value of finance debt is shown in the table below together with the carrying amount as reflected in the balance sheet.
Long-term borrowings in the table below include the portion of debt that matures in the 12 months from 31 December 2013, whereas in the balance sheet the amount is reported within current finance debt.
The carrying amount of the groups short-term borrowings, comprising mainly commercial paper, approximates their fair value.
The fair values of the groups long-term borrowings are principally determined using quoted prices in active markets and so fall within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy or, where quoted prices are not available, quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets.
The fair value of the groups finance lease obligations is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the groups current incremental borrowing rates for similar types and maturities of borrowing.

Capital disclosures and analysis of changes in net debt The group defines capital as total equity.
The groups approach to managing capital is set out in its financial framework which BP continues to refine to support the pursuit of value growth for shareholders, whilst maintaining a secure financial base.
We intend to maintain a net debt ratio within the 10-20% gearing range, and continue to hold a significant liquidity buffer while uncertainties remain.
The group monitors capital on the basis of the net debt ratio, that is, the ratio of net debt to net debt plus equity.
Net debt is calculated as gross finance debt, as shown in the balance sheet, plus the fair value of associated derivative financial instruments that are used to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risks relating to finance debt, for which hedge accounting is applied, less cash and cash equivalents.
Net debt and net debt ratio are nonGAAP measures.
BP believes these measures provide useful information to investors.
Net debt enables investors to see the economic effect of gross debt, related hedges and cash and cash equivalents in total.
The net debt ratio enables investors to see how significant net debt is relative to equity from shareholders.
The derivatives are reported on the balance sheet within the headings Derivative financial instruments.
All components of equity are included in the denominator of the calculation.
During 2013, the company repurchased 753 million shares for a total amount of $5.5 billion, including fees and stamp duty, as part of its share buyback programme announced on 22 March 2013.
During 2012, the company did not repurchase any of its own shares, other than as needed to satisfy the requirements of certain employee share-based payment plans.
