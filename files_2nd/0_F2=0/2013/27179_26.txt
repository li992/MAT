Glossary of Terms and Definitions B Ordinary Shares B Ordinary shares carry the same rights as the Ordinary shares.
The difference is that B Ordinary shareholders receive their dividends by means of a capitalisation issue as opposed to a cash dividend.
With effect from the payment of the final dividend in 2007, the capitalisation issue received by B Ordinary shareholders has been made every time a dividend is paid on the Ordinary shares.
B Ordinary shareholders also have the right to convert their shares into Ordinary shares once a year.
More details regarding this are shown on page 77.
There are significantly fewer B Ordinary shares in issue compared to the number of Ordinary shares in issue lower liquidity.
This can result in significantly less trading in the B Ordinary shares on the Stock Exchange resulting in situations where the price of the B Ordinary shares may vary materially from that of the Ordinary shares and therefore the discount or premium can be out of line with that of the Ordinary shares.
