Revenue by destination The following table provides an analysis of the Groups sales by geographical market: 2013 2012 000 000 United Kingdom 243,650 225,671 Continental Europe 61,860 55,769 Canada 17,130 19,038 USA 313,352 349,145 Rest of World 109,162 111,203 745,154 760,826 During the year there was one direct customer 2012: one, that individually accounted for greater than 10% of the Groups total turnover.
Sales to this customer in 2013 were 164.8m 2012: 189.3m across all segments.
These are calculated as follows: 2013 2012 000 000 As restated Operating profit 57,398 88,271 Amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition 29,083 32,079 Impairment of goodwill see note 13 44,239 - Adjustments to contingent consideration net of acquisition costs 9,003 1,494 Underlying operating profit 121,717 121,844 Profit before tax 49,281 79,818 Amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition 29,083 32,079 Impairment of goodwill see note 13 44,239 - Adjustments to contingent consideration net of acquisition costs 9,003 1,494 Unwinding of discount on provisions see note 26 1,268 577 Profit on fair value movements of derivatives 1,470 1,390 Net interest charge on defined benefit pensions 3,408 3,924 Underlying profit before tax 116,806 116,502 Cash generated by operations see note 29 93,476 112,387 Purchase of property, plant and equipment 13,857 20,470 Proceeds on disposal of property, plant and equipment 1,280 67 Expenditure on product development and other intangibles 7,657 4,659 Dividend from equity accounted investment 2,825 765 Acquisition related payments 2,973 1,494 Underlying operating cash flow 79,040 89,584 Underlying operating profit has been shown before adjustments to contingent consideration net of acquisition related costs, the amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions and impairment of goodwill.
To maintain a consistent presentation of financial performance over the longer term, these charges have been excluded from underlying operating profit.
Underlying profit before tax and underlying earnings per share see note 12 are also presented before these adjustments.
IAS 37 requires the Group to discount provisions using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
In the case of the provision relating to the acquisition contingent consideration, to maintain a consistent presentation of financial performance over the longer term, underlying profit before tax and underlying earnings per share see note 12 are stated before the unwinding of discount on the provision.
IAS 39 requires the Group to fair value the derivative instruments used to manage Ultras foreign exchange exposures.
This creates volatility in the valuation of the outstanding instruments as exchange rates move over time.
This will have minimal impact on profit over the full term of the instruments, but can cause significant volatility on particular balance sheet dates.
Underlying profit before tax and underlying earnings per share see note 12 are stated before changes in the valuation of foreign currency derivative instruments.
Following the adoption of IAS 19 revised 2011, the Group has decided to present underlying profit before tax and underlying earnings per share see note 12 before the net interest charge on defined benefit pensions in order that the underlying operating performance of the Group can be seen more clearly.
The comparatives for the year ended 31 December 2012 have been restated as set out in note 36.
The Group is cash-generative and reinvests funds to support the continuing growth of the business.
It seeks to use an accurate and appropriate measure of the funds generated internally while sustaining this growth.
For this, Ultra uses operating cash flow, rather than cash generated by operations, as its preferred indicator of cash generated and available to cover non-operating expenses such as tax and interest payments.
The Group believes that using cash generated by operations, with the exclusion of net expenditure on property, plant and equipment and outflows for capitalised product development and other intangibles, would result in an under-reporting of the true cash cost of sustaining a growing business.

Other changes and reclassifications in 2012 relate to the re-assessment of initial fair values.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the Cash-Generating Units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
These consist of the Groups operating businesses.
Introduction 94 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 13 Goodwill continued The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
In determining the value-in-use for each CGU, the Group prepares cash flows derived from the most recent financial budgets and strategic plans, representing the best estimate of future performance.
These plans, which have been approved by the Board, include detailed financial forecasts and market analysis covering the expected development of each CGU over the next five years.
The cash flows for the following ten years are also included and assume a growth rate of 2.5% per annum.
Cash flows beyond that period are not included in the value-in-use calculation.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, future revenues, growth rates and forecast gross margins.
Management estimates the discount rate using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the Group, being the Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC.
The WACC is then risk-adjusted to reflect risks specific to each business.
The pre-tax discount rate used during 2013 varied between 12.3% and 13.8% 2012: 12.3% to 16.0%.
Future revenues are based on orders already received, opportunities that are known and expected at the time of setting the budget and strategic plans and future growth rates.
Budget and strategic plan growth rates are based on a combination of historical experience, available government spending data and management and industry expectations of the growth rates that are expected to apply in the major markets in which each CGU operates.
Longer-term growth rates, applied for the ten year period after the end of the strategic planning period, are set at 2.5%.
Ultra considers the long-term growth rate to be appropriate for the sectors in which it operates.
Forecast gross margins reflect past experience, factor in expected efficiencies to counter inflationary pressures, and also reflect likely margins achievable in the shorter-term period of greater defence spending uncertainty.
Within each of the strategic plans a number of assumptions are made about business growth opportunities, contract wins, product development and available markets.
A key assumption is that there will be continued demand for Ultras products and expertise from a number of US government agencies and prime contractors during the strategic plan period.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the value-in-use calculations to: i reduce the post-2018 growth assumption from 2.5% to nil.
ii apply a 10% reduction to forecast operating profits in each year of the modelled cash inflows.
iii consider specific market factors as noted above.
Certain of these sensitivity scenarios give rise to potential impairments at GigaSat, Adaptive Materials Inc and Tactical Communications Systems.
Headroom for these businesses, which represents the value derived from the key growth assumptions in the value-in-use calculations, is as follows: GigaSat 1.6m, Adaptive Materials Inc 5.1m and Tactical Communication Systems 23.2m.
Sensitivity assumptions i and ii would result in a headroom shortfall at GigaSat of 0.3m and 1.3m respectively.
Sensitivity iii is particularly relevant for Adaptive Materials Inc and accordingly if assumption ii was extended further, a 28% reduction to forecast operating profits, representing a key programme, would indicate impairment.
Similarly, the Tactical Communication Systems CGU is also sensitive to specific market factors: a material delay in bringing a key programme to market, combined with failure to secure sufficient business with new and existing customers would result in impairment.
The reduction in placement of US service contracts has particularly impacted the ProLogic business during 2013.
The value-in-use of the ProLogic CGU was lower than the carrying value of the CGUs net operating assets and consequently an impairment charge of 44.2m has been recorded in the year.
The pre-tax discount rate used during this assessment was 13.8%.
Following the impairment charge, the carrying value of goodwill for the ProLogic CGU as at 31 December 2013 is nil.
As set out in note 2, the 44.2m impairment charge has been included as part of the non-underlying operating results of the Group.
ProLogic is within the Information & Power Systems operating segment.
For all other CGUs, the value-in-use calculations comfortably exceed the CGU carrying values in the sensitivity scenarios.
The amortisation of intangible assets charge is included within administrative expenses.
Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortised over their estimated useful lives, typically as follows: Customer relationships 5 to 16 years Intellectual property 5 to 10 years Profit in acquired order book 1 to 3 years Other acquired 1 to 5 years Development costs 2 to 10 years Other intangibles: 3 to 5 years Software 3 to 5 years Patents and trademarks 10 to 20 years 6.
The net book value of plant and machinery held under finance leases was 48,000 2012: 107,000.
Depreciation charged in the year on assets held under finance leases was 65,000 2012: 52,000.
Included within Land and Buildings is nil 2012: 5,137,000 of assets in the course of construction.
16 Interest in associate 2013 2012 000 000 The value of the Groups investment is made up as follows: Total assets 13,894 14,069 Total liabilities 6,577 5,080 Interest in associate 7,317 8,989 2013 2012 000 000 Total revenue of associate 29,370 38,859 Groups share of profit recognised 1,424 3,487 The Groups interest in associate is represented by its 49% shareholding in Al Shaheen Adventure LLC, a Company incorporated in the UAE.

The average credit period on sale of goods is 34 days 2012: 34 days.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
The ageing profile of unprovided overdue trade receivables was as follows: Related Related 2013 provision Total 2012 provision Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 1 to 3 months 12,698 364 12,334 18,510 451 18,059 4 to 6 months 2,123 358 1,765 2,886 306 2,580 7 to 9 months 791 143 648 670 405 265 Over 9 months 740 740 - 907 283 624 Total overdue 16,352 1,605 14,747 22,973 1,445 21,528 The Group provides against its trade receivables where there are serious doubts as to future recoverability based on prior experience, on assessment of the current economic climate and on the length of time that the receivable has been overdue.
All trade receivables that have been overdue for more than a year are provided for in full.
Movement in the provision for trade receivables was as follows: 2013 2012 000 000 Balance at beginning of year 1,445 1,743 Foreign exchange differences 8 12 Increase in provision for trade receivables regarded as potentially uncollectable 731 412 Decrease in provision for trade receivables recovered during the year 563 698 Balance at end of year 1,605 1,445 Credit risk Credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group mitigates this risk of financial loss by only dealing with creditworthy counterparties.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Whilst the Group has elements of concentration of credit risk, with exposure to a number of large counter parties and customers, the customers are mainly government agencies or multi-national organisations with whom the Group has long term business relationships.
The Group has a small number of customers with individually significant amounts outstanding.
These customers are considered to have low credit risk.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and when appropriate action is taken to minimise the Groups credit risk.

Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to all significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted unadjusted active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that includes inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All of Ultras financial instruments have been assessed as Level 2.

Liquidity risk The Group maintains committed banking facilities with core banks to provide prudent levels of borrowing headroom.
The Groups banking facilities are provided by a small group of banks, led by The Royal Bank of Scotland.
During the year there were two facilities in place: one provides 90 million of revolving credit and expires in January 2016 and a second, which was put in place in January 2013 to replace the previous 120 million facility, provides 100 million of revolving credit which expires in December 2017.
Both facilities are denominated in Sterling, US dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars and Euros and are used for balance sheet and operational needs.
A further 15 million overdraft is available for short-term working capital funding.
All bank loans are unsecured.
Interest was predominantly charged at 1.45% 2012: 1.50% over base or contracted rate.
At 31 December 2013, the Group had available 163,000,000 2012: 180,815,000 of undrawn, committed borrowing facilities.
The Group is strongly cash-generative and the funds generated by operating companies are managed regionally to fund short-term local working capital requirements.
Where additional funding is required, this is provided centrally through the Groups committed banking facilities.
The Group, through its Canadian subsidiary Ultra Electronics Tactical Communication Systems UETCS, participates in two Canadian programmes that provide government support in relation to the development of certain of its products.
Further disclosure is provided in note 24.
Introduction 100 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 23 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Liquidity risk continued In July 2011 the Group negotiated a private shelf agreement with Prudential Investment Management, Inc. which allowed the Group to issue loan notes up to a value of USD150 million and with a maturity date of up to 10 years.
USD10 million of loan notes were issued in 2011 with a maturity date of July 2018 and a further USD60 million of loan notes were issued in January 2012 with a maturity date of January 2019.
Consequently as at 31 December 2013 USD80 million remained available under the shelf agreement.
On 2 January 2014 the Group agreed an amendment to extend the private shelf agreement for a three year period.
Consequently loan notes can now be issued up until 2 January 2017.
The amendment also increased the size of the shelf agreement so USD125 million of notes remain available for issue.

The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 22 to the Accounts, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Currency risk The Group uses currency derivatives in the form of forward currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency transaction risk.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollars and Canadian dollars.
At 31 December 2013, the net fair value of the Groups currency derivatives is estimated to be an asset of approximately 6,487,000 2012: 5,017,000, comprising 7,533,000 assets 2012: 5,606,000 and 1,046,000 liabilities 2012: 589,000.
The gain on derivative financial instruments included in the Groups consolidated income statement for the period was 1,470,000 2012: 1,390,000.
The net notional, or net contracted amounts of foreign currency related forward sales contracts, classified by year of maturity are shown below.

The value of the borrowings does not exceed the net investments, meeting the conditions required to qualify as effective hedges.
Interest rate risk The Group has USD70 million of long term fixed rate debt with an interest rate of 3.60%.
This was entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposure reflecting the Groups policy.
The effective interest rates and repricing dates of the Groups financial assets and liabilities were as follows: Effective Within interest Total 1 year 1 to 2 years 2 to 5 years 5 years rate 000 000 000 000 000 2013 Cash and cash equivalents 0.39% 30,570 30,570 --- Loan notes 3.60% 42,352 -- 6,050 36,302 Unsecured bank loans 1.84% 25,975 -- 25,975 - Government loans 4.43% 4,337 --- 4,337 Finance lease liabilities 4.89% 63 44 19 -- 2012 Cash and cash equivalents 0.36% 30,840 30,840 --- Loan notes 3.60% 43,295 --- 43,295 Unsecured bank loans 1.94% 27,544 27,544 --- Government loans 4.43% 2,914 --- 2,914 Finance lease liabilities 4.89% 87 37 30 20 - Market risk sensitivity analysis Interest rate risk During 2013 the Groups net borrowings were predominantly at fixed interest rates, consequently the income statement is not particularly sensitive to a small change in interest rates.
The Group has estimated the impact on the income statement of a 1% increase in market interest rates, from the average rates applicable during 2013.
There is no significant difference between the amount recharged to the income statement and equity in the year.
1% change Profit before tax 000 2013 Interest rate sensitivity 229 2012 Interest rate sensitivity 389 Currency risks The Group has estimated the impact on the income statement and equity of a 10% and 25% strengthening or weakening of average actual and transactional currency rates applicable during the year and a 10% and 25% change in the foreign exchange rates applicable for valuing foreign exchange derivative instruments.
