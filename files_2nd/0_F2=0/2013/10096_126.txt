Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and accounts 2013 SECTION 5 CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING continued 52 weeks ended 28 December 2013 5.7 Equity and capital management Capital management The capital structure of the Group consists of debt which includes borrowings see note 5.2, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent company, as disclosed below.
The Groups objective when managing capital is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor and creditor confidence and to sustain future development of the business: to provide returns for shareholders: and to optimise the capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
There are no externally imposed capital requirements on the Group.
To enable the Group to meet its objective, the Directors monitor returns on capital through constant review of earnings generated from the Groups capital investment programme and through regular budgeting and planning processes, manage capital in a manner so as to ensure that sufficient funds for capital investment and working capital are available, and the requirements of the Groups debt covenants are met.
The Group does not routinely make additional issues of capital, other than for the purpose of raising finance to fund significant acquisitions or developments intended to increase the overall value of the Group.
Share schemes have been created to allow employees of the Group to participate in the ownership of the Groups equity instruments, in order to ensure employees are focused on growing the value of the Group to achieve the aims of all the shareholders.
