A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
Level 2 financial instruments The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, commodity pricing contracts and forward foreign exchange contracts are determined by using valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates.
The fair value of interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts is calculated as the present value of the future cash flows based on observable inputs drawn from interest yield curves sourced from a reputable third-party source.
Level 3 financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments is based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity at the statement of financial position date.
These inputs generally reflect the entitys own assumptions about how a market participant would reasonably be expected to determine the price of a financial instrument.
For commodity pricing contracts, in evaluating the significance of fair value inputs, the Group generally classifies assets or liabilities as level 3 when their fair value is determined using unobservable inputs that individually, or when aggregated with other unobservable inputs represent more than 10% of the fair value of the observable inputs of the assets or liabilities.
Available-for-sale financial assets which are analysed at level 3 primarily represent investments in unlisted securities.
The fair values of the unlisted securities are principally approximated at cost.
Values are adjusted for permanent impairments and fair value movements as disclosed in Note 18.
For financial instruments in level 3, the Group does not consider that changes to inputs to reasonable alternatives would have a material impact on the income statement or equity.
