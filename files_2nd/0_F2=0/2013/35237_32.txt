NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2013 1 Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union IFRS, IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of investment properties, property, plant and equipment, available for sale investments, and financial assets and liabilities held for trading.
2 Changes in accounting policies The principal accounting policies are described in note 42 and are consistent with the 2012 annual financial statements, as amended to reflect the adoption of new standards, amendments and interpretations which became effective in the year.
The new standards adopted during 2013 are outlined below.
IFRS 7 amended Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities: IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement: IAS 1 amended Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income: IAS 12 amended Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets: and IAS 19 revised Employee Benefits.
These had no material impact on the financial statements, but the adoption of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement has resulted in additional disclosure.
Standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations applicable to the Groups financial statements which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective at the year end.
The following standards are deemed not relevant to the Group or to have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group when the relevant standards come into effect: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities: IAS 19 amended Defined Benefit Plans Employee Contributions: IAS 27 revised Separate Financial Statements: IAS 28 revised Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: IAS 32 amended Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities: IAS 36 amended Recoverable Amounts Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets: IAS 39 amended Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting: Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010 2012 Cycle : and Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011 2013 Cycle.
The following standards will affect the accounting for any future joint arrangements entered into by the Group: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements.
3 Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and judgements.
It also requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may differ from those estimates.
The Groups significant accounting policies are stated in note 42.
Not all of these accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgements or estimates.
The following is intended to provide an understanding of the policies that management consider critical because of the level of complexity, judgement or estimation involved in their application and their impact on the consolidated financial statements.
These judgements involve assumptions or estimates in respect of future events.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Trade receivables The Group is required to judge when there is sufficient objective evidence to require the impairment of individual trade receivables.
It does this on the basis of the age of the relevant receivables, external evidence of the credit status of the debtor entity and the nature of any disputed amounts.
Property portfolio valuation The Group uses the valuation carried out by its independent valuers as the fair value of its property portfolio.
The valuation is based upon assumptions including future rental income, anticipated maintenance costs, future development costs and the appropriate discount rate.
The valuers also make reference to market evidence of transaction prices for similar properties.
More information is provided in note 18.
Outstanding rent reviews Where the outcome of an outstanding rent review is reasonably certain, rent is accrued from the rent review date based upon an estimated annual rent.
This estimate is derived from knowledge of market rents for comparable properties and is only accrued where the outcome is considered to be reasonably certain.
126 Financial statements Compliance with the real estate investment trust REIT taxation regime The Group is a REIT and is thereby exempt from tax on both rental profits and chargeable gains.
In order to retain REIT status, certain ongoing criteria must be maintained.
The main criteria are as follows: at the start of each accounting period, the assets of the tax exempt business must be at least 75% of the total value of the Groups assets: at least 75% of the Groups total profits must arise from the tax exempt business: and at least 90% of the tax exempt business must be distributed.
The Directors intend that the Group should continue as a REIT for the foreseeable future, with the result that deferred tax is no longer recognised on temporary differences relating to the property rental business which is within the REIT structure.
Contingent consideration Any contingent consideration is recognised at fair value at the balance sheet date.
The fair value is calculated using future discounted cash flows based on expected outcomes with estimated probabilities taking account of the risk and uncertainty of each input.
4 Segmental information IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal financial reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker which in the Groups case is its Executive Committee comprising the six executive Directors and four senior managers in order to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
The internal financial reports received by the Groups Executive Committee contain financial information at a Group level as a whole and there are no reconciling items between the results contained in these reports and the amounts reported in the financial statements.
These internal financial reports include the IFRS figures but also report the non-IFRS figures for the EPRA earnings per share, net asset value and profit figures.
Reconciliations of each of these figures to their statutory equivalents are detailed in note 17.
Additionally, information is provided to the Executive Committee showing gross property income and investment property valuation by individual property.
Therefore, for the purposes of IFRS 8, each individual property is considered to be a separate operating segment in that its performance is monitored individually.
The Groups property portfolio includes investment property, owner-occupied property, assets held for sale and trading property and comprised 93% 1 office buildings by value 2012: 93%.
The Directors consider that these properties have similar economic characteristics.
Therefore, these individual properties have been aggregated into a single operating segment.
The remaining 7% 2012: 7% represents a mixture of retail, hotel, residential and light industrial properties, as well as land, each of which is fide minimis in its own right.
Accordingly, the Directors are of the view that it is appropriate to disclose two reportable segments, office buildings and other, by reference to gross property income and property value.
No tenant accounts for more than 10% of gross property income in either 2013 or 2012, and no individual property accounts for more than 10% of the value of the property portfolio in either year.
All of the Groups properties are based in the UK.
The Group also has a joint venture investment in Prague which represents 0.1% of the Groups assets see notes 20 and 23, is in the process of being sold and is excluded from this analysis.
No geographical grouping is contained in any of the internal financial reports provided to the Groups Executive Committee and, therefore, no geographical segmental analysis is required by IFRS 8.
However, geographical analysis is included in the tables below to provide users with additional information regarding the areas contained in the strategic report.

The Group has included the income from this building within gross property income as, although similar to a lease surrender arrangement, the Groups entitlement to this rental income is linked to its continued ownership of the property rather than being an unconditional amount receivable whether as an upfront payment or through a series of instalments.
Additionally, rental income includes 5.6m 2012: 8.2m relating to rents recognised in advance of the cash receipts.
Other income relates to fees and commissions earned in relation to the management of the Groups properties and is recognised in the Group income statement in accordance with the delivery of services.
Net property and other income includes costs of 0.4m 2012: 0.5m relating to properties which produced no income during the year.

The property had a carrying value of 78.4m and was sold for 132.5m before costs of 1.1m.
The price achieved reflected the special nature of the purchaser combined with the unique location of this development site.
7 Profit on disposal of investment In March 2012 the Group liquidated a non-trading US subsidiary.
In previous years, the retranslation of the US-dollar denominated loan from this subsidiary resulted in foreign exchange movements being reflected in the income statement.
The net asset impact in each year was effectively nil as there was an equal and opposite movement taken to other comprehensive income on translation of the subsidiarys net asset balance.
In accordance with IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, on disposal of this foreign subsidiary, the cumulative amount of 3.9m of the exchange differences previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign exchange translation reserve was reclassified to the income statement.
In 2012, as in previous years, the effect of this reclassification on net assets was effectively nil.

In accordance with EPRA guidance, these costs have been excluded from EPRA profit and earnings.
Finance costs of 4.8m 2012: 4.9m have been capitalised on development projects, in accordance with IAS 23 Borrowing Costs, using the Groups average cost of borrowings during each quarter.
Total finance costs paid during 2013 were 37.1m 2012: 38.2m of which 4.8m 2012: 4.9m was included in capital expenditure on the property portfolio in the Group cash flow statement under investing activities.
The foreign exchange gain in 2012 of 0.3m resulted from the translation of an intercompany loan from a non-trading US subsidiary.
The impact on net asset value from this exchange movement was effectively nil as there was an offsetting entry in equity see Group statement of comprehensive income.
The US subsidiary was liquidated in March 2012 see note 7.
9 Financial derivative termination costs In July 2013, the Group terminated, deferred and re-couponed interest rate swaps with a principal amount of 190m at a cost of 12.9m.
During the year, the Group also incurred costs of 0.8m deferring the start date of an interest rate swap with a principal amount of 65m.
In 2012, the Group incurred costs of 6.3m terminating two interest rate swaps with a principal amount of 130m and incurred costs of 0.6m breaking an interest rate swap with a principal amount of 65m.

The following information is relevant in the determination of the fair value of the options granted during 2012 and 2013 under the equity-settled employee share plan operated by the Group.
2013 2012 Option pricing model used Binomial lattice Binomial lattice Risk-free interest rate 0.8% 0.7% Volatility 25.0% 41.0% Dividend yield 1.5% 1.8% For both the 2013 and 2012 grants, additional assumptions have been made that there is no employee turnover and 50% of employees exercise early when the share options are 20% in the money and 50% of employees exercise early when the share options are 100% in the money.
The volatility assumption, measured as the standard deviation of expected share price returns, is based on a statistical analysis of daily prices over the last four years.
Group cash-settled option scheme All options relating to the cash-settled option scheme arose as a result of the acquisition of London Merchant Securities plc.
A binomial lattice pricing model was used to value the cash-settled options.
The closing share price at 31 December 2013 of 24.95 2012: 21.06 and a dividend yield of 1.4% 2012: 1.5% were used together with a risk-free interest rate of 0.3% 2012: 0.3%.
An assumption of zero employee turnover has been made and a volatility assumption of 17% pa has been used for options with expected terms of one year, which now covers all outstanding awards 2012: 18% pa.
In general, the value of an option is affected by how quickly employees are assumed to exercise their awards after vesting.
In this case, however, given the other assumptions, the share price at 31 December 2013, and the fact that the expected lives of the options are relatively short, the fair values are not sensitive to this assumption.
It has been assumed that employees try to maximise their returns and therefore do not exercise their options immediately.
Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2013 131 15 Pension costs The Group and Company operate both a defined contribution scheme and a defined benefit scheme.
The latter was acquired as part of the acquisition of London Merchant Securities plc in 2007 and is closed to new members.
All new employees are entitled to join the defined contribution scheme.
The assets of the pension schemes are held separately from those of the Group companies.
Defined contribution plan The total expense relating to this plan in the current year was 1.3m 2012: 1.2m.
Defined benefit plan The defined benefit scheme, which is contributory for members, provides benefits based on final pensionable salary and contributions are invested in a Managed Fund Policy with F&C Fund Management Limited, Legal and General Investment Management Limited and Ruffer LLP plus annuity policies held in the name of the scheme.
The pension charge for the defined benefit scheme is assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary.
The most important assumptions made in connection with the establishment of this charge were that the return on the fund will be 5.2% pa 2012: 5.4% pa and that salaries will be increased at 5.0% pa 2012: 4.4% pa.
The market value of assets of the scheme at 31 December 2013 was 12.2m 2012: 12.0m and the actuarial value of those assets on an ongoing basis represented 110% 2012: 102% of the benefit of 11.1m 2012: 11.8m that had accrued to members allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The Group paid a deficit reduction contribution of 0.5m during the year 2012: 0.5m and 0.1m 2012: 0.1m of normal pension contributions.

The value calculated in this way is reflected in the net asset liability in the balance sheet as shown above.
The projected unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which allowance is made for projected earnings increases.
The accumulated benefit obligation is an alternative actuarial measure of the plan liabilities, whose calculation differs from that under the projected unit credit method in that it includes no assumption for future earnings increases.
In assessing this figure for the purpose of the disclosures, allowance has been made for future statutory revaluation of benefits up to retirement for deferred pensioners but not for active members.
At the balance sheet date the accumulated benefit obligation was 11.1m 2012: 11.8m.
All actuarial gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income in the year in which they occur.
Reconciliation of the impact of the asset ceiling 2013 2012 m m Actuarial losses on asset ceiling 0.3 Impact of asset ceiling at end of the year 0.3 The Group has reviewed the implications of the guidance provided by IFRIC14 IAS 19 Limit on Defined Benefit Asset and concluded that it is not necessary to make any adjustments to the IAS19 figures in respect of an asset ceiling or minimum funding requirement at 31 December 2013.
The maximum economic benefit available is entirely in the form of a reduction in future contributions.

The expected return on the assets at 31 December 2012 was 5.2%.
This compares to the discount rate of 4.7% used in the calculation of the interest income for the year ended 31 December 2013.

All of the scheme assets have a quoted market price in an active market with the exception of the trustees bank account balance representing Level 1 fair value measurement as defined by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
It is the policy of the trustees and the Group to review the investment strategy at the time of each funding valuation.
The trustees investment objectives and the processes undertaken to measure and manage the risks inherent in the plan investment strategy are illustrated by the asset allocation at 31 December 2013.
There are no asset-liability matching strategies currently being used by the plan.

The inflation sensitivity includes the impact of changes to the assumptions for revaluation, pension increases and salary growth.
The average duration of the defined benefit obligation at the year ended 31December 2013 is 25 years.
The plan typically exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, salary growth risk, mortality risk and longevity risk.
A decrease in corporate bond yields, a rise in inflation or an increase in life expectancy would detrimentally impact the balance sheet position and may give rise to increased charges in the future.
This effect would be partially offset by an increase in the plans bond holdings, and in qualifying death in service insurance policies that cover the mortality risk.
The best estimate of contributions to be paid by the Group to the plan for the year commencing 1 January 2014 is 0.6m.

The dilutive effect of these shares is required to be recognised in accordance with IAS 33 Earnings per Share.
The shares are not recognised in the calculations if they are anti-dilutive.
For 2013 and 2012, the shares created by the conversion of the 2016 bonds are dilutive for unadjusted earnings per share but anti-dilutive for EPRA and underlying earnings per share.
They are dilutive for NAV and EPRA NAV per share in 2013 but anti-dilutive for all NAV measures in 2012.
For consistency purposes, the Group has adopted the same approach for dilution due to convertible bonds for the calculation of EPRA triple NAV per share as EPRA NAV per share.
For 2013, the shares created by the conversion of the 2019 bonds, issued in 2013, are dilutive for unadjusted earnings per share but anti-dilutive for EPRA and underlying earnings per share and all NAV per share measures.

CBRE Limited valued properties at 3,322.8m 2012: 2,829.1m and other valuers at 30.3m 2012: 30.5m.
Of the properties revalued by CBRE, 19.7m 2012: 17.9m relating to owner-occupied property was included within property, plant and equipment, nil 2012: 16.5m was included within non-current assets held for sale and 24.7m 2012: nil was in relation to trading property.
The total fees, including the fee for this assignment, earned by CBRE or other companies forming part of the same group of companies within the UK from the Group is less than 5.0% of their total UK revenues.
During the year ended 31 December 2013, the Group transferred, at market value, properties previously held for investment to trading property as it became the Groups intention to redevelop and sell these properties.
Any future revaluation surplus relating to the trading property will be recognised as an adjustment to EPRA net asset value, but, in accordance with IAS 2 Inventories, will not be recognised in the carrying value of the property.

This information is derived from the Groups financial and property management systems and is subject to the Groups overall control environment.
In addition, the valuation reports are based on assumptions and valuation models used by the valuers.
The assumptions are typically market related, such as yields and discount rates, and are based on their professional judgment and market observation.
Each property is considered a separate asset class based on the unique nature, characteristics and risks of the property.
Members of the Groups investments team, who report to the executive Director responsible for the valuation process, verify all major inputs to the external valuation reports, assess the individual property valuation changes from the prior year valuation report and hold discussions with the external valuers.
When this process is complete, the valuation report is recommended to the Audit Committee, which considers it as part of its overall responsibilities.
The external valuers hold meetings with the Auditor and then with the Audit Committee to discuss the valuation processes and outcome at each year end and half year end.
Valuation techniques The fair value of the property portfolio has been determined using an income capitalisation technique, whereby contracted and market rental values are capitalised with a market capitalisation rate.
The resulting valuations are cross-checked against the equivalent yields and the fair market values per square foot derived from comparable recent market transactions on arms length terms.
For properties under construction, the fair value is calculated by estimating the fair value of the completed property using the income capitalisation technique less estimated costs to completion and a risk premium.
These techniques are consistent with the principles in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement and use significant unobservable inputs such that the fair value measurement of each property within the portfolio has been classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
There were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 or between Levels 2 and 3 in the fair value hierarchy during the year.
Gains and losses recorded in profit or loss for recurring fair value measurements categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy amount to 335.6m 2012: 174.4m and are presented in the Group income statement in the line item revaluation surplus.
The revaluation surplus for the owner-occupied property of 1.9m 2012: 0.9m was included within the revaluation reserve.
All gains and losses recorded in profit or loss in 2013 and 2012 for recurring fair value measurements categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are attributable to changes in unrealised gains or losses relating to investment property held at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012, respectively.

Sensitivity of measurement to variations in the significant unobservable inputs The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy of the Groups property portfolio, together with the impact of significant movements in these inputs on the fair value measurement, are shown below: Impact on fair value measurement of significant Impact on fair value measurement of significant Unobservable input increase in input decrease in input Gross ERV Increase Decrease Net initial yield Decrease Increase Reversionary yield Decrease Increase True equivalent yield Decrease Increase There are inter-relationships between these inputs as they are partially determined by market rate conditions.
An increase in the reversionary yield may accompany an increase in gross ERV and would mitigate its impact on the fair value measurement.

The Companys accounting policy is to carry investments in subsidiary undertakings at the lower of cost and recoverable amount and recognise any impairment, or reversal thereof, in the income statement.
In the opinion of the Directors, the most appropriate estimate of the recoverable amount is the net asset value of the subsidiaries.
Principally due to the dividends paid by the subsidiaries in the year, there has been a decrease in the net asset value of the subsidiaries which has been reflected as an impairment in the Company income statement of 43.3m.
In 2012, there was an increase in the net asset value of the subsidiaries mainly as a result of the valuation movement in investment properties, which was reflected as an impairment reversal in the Company income statement of 71.6m.

Completion of the transaction is expected during the first half of 2014.
In February 2013, the Group exchanged contracts to sell two freehold properties for a total of 16.5m after costs, with completion occurring in March 2013.

National insurance is payable on gains made by employees on the exercise of share-based payments granted to them.
The eventual liability to national insurance is dependent on: the market price of the Companys shares at the date of exercise: the number of equity instruments that are exercised: and the prevailing rate of national insurance at the date of exercise.

The unsecured instrument pays a coupon of 2.75% until July 2016 or its conversion date, if earlier.
In accordance with IAS 32, the equity and debt components of the bond are accounted for separately and the fair value of the debt component was determined using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond, deemed to be 3.99%.
As a result, 165.4m was recognised as a liability in the balance sheet on issue and the remainder of the proceeds, 9.6m, which represent the equity component, was credited to reserves.
The difference between the fair value of the liability and the principal value has been amortised through the income statement from the date of issue.
Issue costs of 4.8m were allocated between equity and debt and the element relating to the debt component has been amortised over the life of the bond.
The issue costs apportioned to equity of 0.2m have not been amortised.
The fair value was determined by the ask-price of 122.34 per 100 as at 31 December 2013 2012: 113.03 per 100.

The unsecured instrument pays a coupon of 1.125% until July 2019 or its conversion date, if earlier.
The initial conversion price was set at 33.35 per share.
In accordance with IAS 32, the equity and debt components of the bond are accounted for separately and the fair value of the debt component has been determined using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond, deemed to be 2.67%.

This difference between fair value and principal value is being amortised through the income statement.
The fair value was determined by the ask-price of 113.72 per 100 as at 31 December 2013 2012: 122.28 per 100.
3.99% secured loan 2024 In July 2012, the Group arranged a 12-year secured fixed rate loan.
The loan was drawn on 1 August 2012.
The fair value was determined by comparing the discounted future cash flows using the contracted yield with those of a prevailing market gilt.
The reference was a 5% 2025 gilt with an implied margin which is unchanged since the date of fixing.
Bank borrowings The Group refinanced the majority of its bank loans in the open market in September 2013.
The margin charged on the new 550m facility is similar to the margin charged on the bank facilities not refinanced.
The fair values of the Groups bank loans are therefore deemed to be approximately the same as their carrying amount, after adjusting for the unamortised arrangement fees.

As with the bonds, debt and equity components of the intercompany loan have been accounted for separately, and the fair values of the debt components are identical to that of the bonds.
Derivative financial instruments The derivative financial instruments consist of interest rate swaps, the fair values of which represent the net present value of the difference between the contracted fixed rates and the fixed rates payable if the swaps were to be replaced on 31 December 2013 for the period to the contracted expiry dates.
During the year, the Group entered into a 70m forward starting interest rate swap effective 30 June 2014.
The Group also has an additional 65m forward starting interest rate swap effective from 25 April 2014.
These swaps are not included in the 31 December 2013 figures in the table below, but the financial impact from the effective date onwards is included in the relevant tables in this note.
The fair values of the Groups outstanding interest rate swaps have been estimated using the mid-point of the yield curves prevailing on the reporting date and represent the net present value of the differences between the contracted rate and the valuation rate when applied to the projected balances for the period from the reporting date to the contracted expiry dates.

In addition, the 2026 bonds were secured by a floating charge over a number of the Groups subsidiary companies which contain 634.1m 2012: 521.0m of the Groups properties.
At 31 December 2013, the Companys secured bank loan and the 3.99% secured loan 2024 were secured by a fixed charge over 268.2m 2012: 1,409.0m and 194.8m 2012: 174.5m, respectively, of the Groups properties.
Fixed interest rate and hedged debt At 31 December 2013 and 2012, the Groups fixed rate and hedged debt included the secured bonds 2026, the unsecured convertible bonds 2016, a secured loan 2024 and the hedged bank debt.
Additionally, at 31 December 2013, it also comprised additional unsecured convertible bonds maturing in 2019 which were issued during the year.
At 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012, the Companys fixed rate debt comprised the instruments used to hedge its floating rate debt and the long-term intercompany loans.

Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2013 147 26 Borrowings and derivative financial instruments continued Anticipated undiscounted cash outflows IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure, requires disclosure of the maturity of the Groups and Companys remaining contractual financial liabilities.
The tables below show the anticipated undiscounted cash outflows arising from the Groups gross debt.
These amounts represent the gross cash flows of the derivative financial instruments and are settled as either a net payment or receipt.
In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments.
The following describes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them.
Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is presented throughout these financial statements.
Further information on risk as required by IFRS 7 is given on pages 28 to 32 and page 83.
Other than the refinancing of certain secured bank loans with new unsecured bank loans, and the convertible bonds 2019, there have been no substantive changes in the Groups exposure to financial instrument risks, its objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks or the methods used to measure them from previous periods.
The Company has the same risk profile as the Group except tenant credit risk, which does not exist in the Company and therefore no separate analysis has been provided in relation to the Company.
Principal financial instruments The principal financial instruments used by the Group, from which financial instrument risk arises, are trade receivables, cash at bank, trade and other payables, floating rate bank loans, a fixed rate loan, secured and unsecured bonds and interest rate swaps.
General objectives, policies and processes The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Groups risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies to executive management.
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Groups flexibility and its ability to maximise returns.
Further details regarding these policies are set out below: 150 Financial statements Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Group is mainly exposed to credit risk from lease contracts in relation to its property portfolio.
It is Group policy to assess the credit risk of new tenants before entering into such contracts.
The Board has established a Credit Committee which assesses each new tenant before a new lease is signed.
The review includes the latest sets of financial statements, external ratings, when available, and, in some cases, forecast information and bank and trade references.
The covenant strength of each tenant is determined based on this review and, if appropriate, a deposit or a guarantee is obtained.
As the Group operates predominantly in central London, it is subject to some geographical risk.
However, this is mitigated by the wide range of tenants from a broad spectrum of business sectors.
Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with minimum rating of investment grade are accepted.
This risk is also reduced by the short periods that money is on deposit at any one time.
The quantitative disclosures of the credit risk exposure in relation to trade and other receivables which are neither past due nor impaired are disclosed in note 22.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained.
Market risk Market risk arises from the Groups use of interest bearing instruments.
It is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates interest rate risk.
Fair value and cash flow interest rate risk The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk from borrowings at variable rates.
It is currently Group policy that generally between 60% and 85% of external Group borrowings excluding finance lease payables are at fixed rates.
Where the Group wishes to vary the amount of external fixed rate debt it holds subject to it being generally between 60% and 85% of expected Group borrowings, as noted above, the Group makes use of interest rate derivatives to achieve the desired interest rate profile.
Although the Board accepts that this policy neither protects the Group entirely from the risk of paying rates in excess of current market rates nor eliminates fully cash flow risk associated with variability in interest payments, it considers that it achieves an appropriate balance of exposure to these risks.
At 31 December 2013, the proportion of fixed debt held by the Group was 83%.
During both 2013 and 2012, the Groups borrowings at variable rate were denominated in sterling.
The Group monitors the interest rate exposure on a regular basis.
A sensitivity analysis was performed to ascertain the impact on profit or loss and net assets of a 50 basis point shift in interest rates and this would result in an increase of 0.8m 2012: 0.3m or a decrease of 0.8m 2012: 0.3m.
The Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps quantitative disclosures are given in this note.
The Group generally raises long-term borrowings at fixed rates.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the Groups management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt instruments.
It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient headroom in its loan facilities to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due.
To achieve this aim, it seeks to maintain committed facilities to meet the expected requirements.
The Group also seeks to reduce liquidity risk by fixing interest rates and hence cash flows on a portion of its long-term borrowings.
This is further explained in the fair value and cash flow interest rate risk section above.
The executive management receives rolling three-year projections of cash flow and loan balances on a regular basis as part of the Groups forecasting processes.
At the balance sheet date, these projections indicated that the Group expected to have sufficient liquid resources to meet its obligations under all reasonably expected circumstances.
The Groups loan facilities are spread across a range of banks so as to minimise any potential concentration of risk.
The liquidity risk of the Group is managed centrally by the finance department.
Capital disclosures The Groups capital comprises all components of equity share capital, share premium, other reserves, retained earnings and minority interest.
The Groups objectives when maintaining capital are: to safeguard the entity s ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide above average long-term returns for shareholders: and to provide an above average annualised total return to shareholders.
The Group sets the amount of capital it requires in proportion to risk.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in its industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of NAV gearing and the loan-to-value ratio.
During 2013, the Groups strategy, which was unchanged from 2012, was to maintain the NAV gearing below 80% in normal circumstances.
The four gearing ratios are defined on page 166 and are derived in note 28.

The calculation takes account of indexation on the historic cost of the properties and any available capital losses.
Due to the Groups REIT status, deferred tax is only provided at each balance sheet date on properties outside of the REIT regime.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of all tax losses and other temporary differences where the Directors believe it is probable that these assets will be recovered.

These contracts relate wholly to the construction, development or enhancement of the Groups investment properties.
At 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012, there were no obligations for the purchase, repair or maintenance of investment properties.
37 Contingent liabilities The Company and its subsidiaries are party to cross guarantees securing certain bank loans.
At 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012, there was no liability that could arise for the Company from the cross guarantees.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts and guarantees the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time that it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.

These vary dependent on the individual tenant and the respective property and demise but typically are let for a term of five to 15 years, at a market rent with provisions to review to market rent every five years.
Standard lease provisions include service charge payments and recovery of other direct costs.
The weighted average lease length of the leases granted during 2013 was 13.8 years 2012: 13.5 years.
Of these leases, on a weighted average basis, 90% 2012: 94% included a rent free or half rent period.
Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2013 157 39 Post balance sheet events In January 2014, the Group initiated a programme to locate a buyer for one of its properties which had a fair value at 31 December 2013 of 23.0m.

Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2013 159 42 Significant accounting policies Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Derwent London plc and all of its subsidiaries, together with the Groups share of the results of its joint ventures.
Subsidiary undertakings are those entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences and until the date control ceases.
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting as permitted by IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures, and following the procedures for this method set out in IAS 28 Investments in Associates.
The equity method requires the Groups share of the joint ventures post-tax profit or loss for the period to be presented separately in the income statement and the Groups share of the joint ventures net assets to be presented separately in the balance sheet.
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the joint venture concerned.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Gross property income Gross property income arises from two main sources: i Rental income This arises from operating leases granted to tenants.
An operating lease is a lease other than a finance lease.
A finance lease is one whereby substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are passed to the lessee.
Rental income is recognised in the Group income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease in accordance with SIC 15 Operating Leases Incentives and IAS 17 Leases.
This includes the effect of lease incentives given to tenants, which are normally in the form of rent free or half rent periods or capital contributions in lieu of rent free periods, and the effect of contracted rent uplifts and payments received from tenants on the grant of leases.
For income from property leased out under a finance lease, a lease receivable asset is recognised in the balance sheet at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease, as defined in IAS 17 Leases.
Minimum lease payments receivable, again defined in IAS 17, are apportioned between finance income and the reduction of the outstanding lease receivable so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on the remaining net investment in the lease.
Contingent rents, being the difference between the rent currently receivable and the minimum lease payments when the net investment in the lease was originally calculated, are recognised in property income in the years in which they are receivable.
ii Surrender premiums Payments received from tenants to surrender their lease obligations are recognised immediately in the Group income statement.
Other income Other income consists of commissions and fees arising from the management of the Groups properties and is recognised in the Group income statement in accordance with the delivery of service.
Expenses i Lease payments Where investment properties are held under operating leases, the leasehold interest is classified as if it were held under a finance lease, which is recognised at its fair value on the balance sheet, within the investment property carrying value.
Upon initial recognition, a corresponding liability is included as a finance lease liability.
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining finance lease liability.
Contingent rents payable, being the difference between the rent currently payable and the minimum lease payments when the lease liability was originally calculated, are charged as expenses within property expenditure in the years in which they are payable.
ii Dilapidations Dilapidations monies received from tenants in respect of their lease obligations are recognised immediately in the Group income statement, unless they relate to future capital expenditure.
In the latter case, where the costs are considered to be recoverable they are capitalised as part of the carrying value of the property.
iii Reverse surrender premiums Payments made to tenants to surrender their lease obligations are charged directly to the Group income statement unless the payment is to enable the probable redevelopment of a property.
In the latter case, where the costs are considered to be recoverable, they are capitalised as part of the carrying value of the property.
iv Other property expenditure Vacant property costs and other property costs are expensed in the year to which they relate, with the exception of the initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging leases which are, in accordance with IAS 17 Leases, added to the carrying value of the relevant property and recognised as an expense over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income.
Employee benefits i Share-based remuneration a Equity-settled The Company operates a long-term incentive plan and share option scheme.
The fair value of the conditional awards of shares granted under the long-term incentive plan and the options granted under the share option scheme are determined at the date of grant.
This fair value is then expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
At each reporting date, the non-market based performance criteria of the long-term incentive plan are reconsidered and the expense is revised as necessary.
In respect of the share option scheme, the fair value of options granted is calculated using a binomial lattice pricing model.
Under the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, no expense is recognised for options or conditional shares granted on or before 7 November 2002. b Cash-settled For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised based on the current fair value determined at each balance sheet date.
The movement in the current fair value is taken to the Group income statement.
160 Financial statements Employee benefits continued ii Pensions a Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Group income statement in the period to which they relate.
b Defined benefit plans The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit post-employment plans, including pension plans, is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Any actuarial gain or loss in the period is recognised in full in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method.
Any excess of the purchase price of business combinations over the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired and resulting deferred tax thereon is recognised as goodwill.
Any discount is credited to the Group income statement in the period of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Group income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Any residual goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment.
Investment property i Valuation Investment properties are those that are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both, including those that are undergoing redevelopment.
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including related transaction costs.
After initial recognition, they are carried in the Group balance sheet at fair value adjusted for the carrying value of leasehold interests and lease incentive and letting cost receivables.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an investment property in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The valuation is undertaken by external valuers who hold recognised and relevant professional qualifications and have recent experience in the locations and categories of properties being valued.
Surpluses or deficits resulting from changes in the fair value of investment property are reported in the Group income statement in the year in which they arise.
ii Capital expenditure Capital expenditure, being costs directly attributable to the redevelopment or refurbishment of an investment property, up to the point of it being completed for its intended use, are capitalised in the carrying value of that property.
In addition, in accordance with IAS 23 Borrowing Costs, finance costs that are directly attributable to such expenditure are capitalised using the Groups average cost of borrowings during each quarter.
iii Disposal Properties are treated as disposed when the Group transfers the significant risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer.
Generally this would occur on completion of contract.
On disposal, any gain or loss is calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying value at the last year end plus subsequent capitalised expenditure during the year.
Where the net disposal proceeds have yet to be finalised at the balance sheet date, the proceeds recognised reflect the Directors best estimate of the amounts expected to be received.
Any contingent consideration is recognised at fair value at the balance sheet date.
iv Development When the Group begins to redevelop an existing investment property for continued use as an investment property or acquires a property with the subsequent intention of developing it as an investment property, the property is classified as an investment property and is accounted for as such.
When the Group begins to redevelop an existing investment property with a view to sale, the property is transferred to trading properties and held as a current asset.
The property is remeasured to fair value as at the date of transfer with any gain or loss being taken to the income statement.
The remeasured amount becomes the deemed cost at which the property is then carried in trading properties.
Property, plant and equipment i Owner-occupied property Owner-occupied property is stated at its revalued amount, which is determined in the same manner as investment property.
It is depreciated over its remaining useful life 40 years with the depreciation included in administrative expenses.
On revaluation, any accumulated depreciation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the property concerned, and the net amount restated to the revalued amount.
Subsequent depreciation charges are adjusted based on the revalued amount for each property.
Any difference between the depreciation charge on the revalued amount and that which would have been charged under historic cost is transferred, net of any related deferred tax, between the revaluation reserve and retained earnings as the property is utilised.
Surpluses or deficits resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
The land element of the property is not depreciated.
ii Artwork Artwork is stated at revalued amounts on the basis of open market value.
iii Other Plant and equipment is depreciated at a rate of between 10% and 25% per annum which is calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value of the individual assets, over their expected useful lives.
Investments Investments in joint ventures, being those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, as established by contractual agreement, are included in the Groups balance sheet at cost together with the Groups share of post-acquisition reserves, on a net equity basis.
Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are included in the Companys balance sheet at the lower of cost and recoverable amount.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2013 161 42 Significant accounting policies continued Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying value will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met if the sale is highly probable, the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition, being actively marketed and management is committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Non-current assets, including related liabilities, classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs of disposal.
Financial assets i Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and on-demand deposits less overdrafts.
Cash equivalents comprise short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
ii Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the original transaction value.
A provision for impairment is established where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables concerned.
Financial liabilities i Bank loans and fixed rate loans Bank loans and fixed rate loans are included as financial liabilities on the balance sheets at the amounts drawn on the particular facilities.
Interest payable is expensed as a finance cost in the year to which it relates.
ii Non-convertible bonds These are included as a financial liability on the balance sheet net of the unamortised discount and costs on issue.
The difference between this carrying value and the redemption value is recognised in the Group income statement over the life of the bond on an effective interest basis.
Interest payable to bond holders is expensed in the year to which it relates.
iii Convertible bonds The fair value of the liability component of a convertible bond is determined using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond.
This amount is recorded as a liability on an amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bonds.
The remainder of the proceeds is allocated to the conversion option.
This is recognised and included in shareholders equity, net of income tax effects and is not subsequently re-measured.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and the equity components of the convertible bonds based on their carrying amounts at the date of issue.
The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity.
The issue costs apportioned to the liability are amortised over the life of the bond.
The issue costs apportioned to equity are not amortised.
iv Finance lease liabilities Finance lease liabilities arise for those investment properties held under a leasehold interest and accounted for as investment property.
The liability is initially calculated as the present value of the minimum lease payments, reducing in subsequent years by the apportionment of payments to the lessor, as described above under the heading for lease payments.
v Interest rate derivatives The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with the financing of the Groups business.
No trading in financial instruments is undertaken.
At each reporting date, these interest rate derivatives are measured at fair value, being the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the agreement at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current credit rating of the counterparties.
The gain or loss at each fair value remeasurement is recognised in the Group income statement.
vi Trade payables Trade payables are recognised and carried at the original transaction value.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the tax computations, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
In respect of the deferred tax on the revaluation surplus, this is calculated on the basis of the chargeable gains that would crystallise on the sale of the investment portfolio as at the reporting date.
The calculation takes account of available indexation on the historic cost of the properties and any available capital losses.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period, based on Acts substantially enacted at the year end, when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is included in profit or loss for the period, except when it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Dividends Dividends payable on the ordinary share capital are recognised in the year in which they are declared.
Foreign currency translation On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign entities are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and their income statement and cash flows are translated at the average rate for the period.
