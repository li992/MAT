Share-based payments The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of the shares that will eventually vest allowing for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes or the Monte Carlo pricing models.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The Company also provides certain employees with the ability to purchase the Companys ordinary shares at a discount to the current market value at the date of the grant.
The Company records an expense, based on its estimate of the discount related to shares expected to vest, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
At the end of each reporting period, the entity revises its estimates for the number of options expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the profit and loss account, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
Financial instruments and hedge accounting The accounting policy of the Company for financial instruments and hedge accounting is the same as that shown in the Group accounting policies.
This policy is in accordance with FRS 26, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
