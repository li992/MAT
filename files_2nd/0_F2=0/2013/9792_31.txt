The Other reserve was originally created as part of the capital restructuring that took place in 2002.
It represents the difference between the nominal value of the shares issued prior to the capital reduction by the Company being the carrying value of the investment in Marks and Spencer plc and the share capital, share premium and capital redemption reserve of Marks and Spencer plc at the date of the transaction.
Last year the reserve also included discretionary distributions to the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme, which following the Groups payment of an interim dividend in relation to 2011 12 and the resultant recognition of the annual distribution of 71.9m as a financial liability was 427.9m.
On 21 May 2012 the Group changed the terms of the Marks and Spencer Scottish Limited Partnership and the total equity instrument of 427.9m was derecognised and the fair value of the remaining distributions of 606.0m was recognised as a financial liability see note 12.
The Retained earnings reserve includes a cumulative 14.5m gain last year 5.1m gain in the currency reserve.
Amounts reclassified and reported in net profit have all been recorded in cost of sales.
