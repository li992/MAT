On 21 September 2007 1,504,120 options with an exercise price of 166.2p, were granted.
These are potentially dilutive instruments but were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive for the year and prior period as the average market price of the shares was lower than the exercise price.
On 10 March 2008, 3 July 2008 and 20 August 2009 respectively, 2.79m, 2.25m and 2.4m share options were granted to Directors and management under the Stobart Executive Incentive Plan with an exercise price of nil.
974,020 of these share options vested on 20 August 2012 and are included as dilutive instruments for the year to 28 February 2013.
979,848 and 769,577 of these share options vested on 10 March 2011 and 3 July respectively and are included as dilutive instruments for the year to 29 February 2012.
On 5 December 2008, 1.0m share options were granted to a senior manager under a share option agreement.
On 28 December 2012 750,000 of these options vested and on 10 August 2011, 250,000 of these options vested.
These were dilutive in the respective years.
On 7 December 2011, 35m share options were granted to Directors and senior others under a Long Term Incentive Plan.
These are potentially dilutive instruments but were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the vesting conditions have not been met unconditionally at the year end date.
There are 259,368 share options allocated to Non-Executive Directors.
There are no performance conditions attached to these and so they are dilutive in the year.
During the year the company purchased 7,443,291 of its own shares.
750,000 of these were used to satisfy options and at the year end 6,693,291 shares remain in treasury.
These shares are not included in the weighted average number of shares used to calculate earnings per share.
Own shares held in an Employee Benefit Trust are excluded from the weighted average number of shares.
