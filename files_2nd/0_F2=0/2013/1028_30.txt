The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are market risk primarily exposure to changes in the interest rate and foreign currency risks, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
Anite plc 115 Annual report and accounts 2013 Business overview Governance Financial statements 17 Financial risk management continued e Market risk interest rate The Group finances its operations and acquisitions through a mixture of reserves, bank borrowings and new equity and this policy is reviewed from time to time.
The Group borrows in the desired currencies at floating rates of interest and manages the interest rate risk by selectively using interest rate swaps.
Any surplus cash is converted into Sterling and is invested in short-term money market and bank deposits at the prevailing rates of interest in order to achieve the market rate of return.
The financial assets and liabilities that are interest-bearing and expose the Company to interest rate risk are as follows: i Cash and cash equivalents note 8.
The weighted average floating interest rate for these financial assets which were based on Sterling market rates, fixed for periods up to three months was 0.46% 2012: 1.05%.
During the period that the Company had outstanding bank borrowings, the weighted average floating interest rate for bank borrowings was 2.28% 2012: not applicable.
Sterling denominated borrowings are linked to Sterling LIBOR and Euro denominated borrowings are linked to EURIBOR, in each case plus a margin.
The margin varies between 1.35% and 1.85% dependent on the level of borrowing, but during the period that the Group had outstanding bank borrowings, the margin remained constant at 1.85% 2012: not applicable.
iii Interest bearing intercompany debtors and creditors note 7.
The weighted average of these interest rates net is 2.28% 2012: 2.04%.
These rates are linked to LIBOR or EURIBOR, in each case plus a margin.
The weighted average margin in the period was 1.13%.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis below has been determined, based on the exposure to interest rates for both financial assets and liabilities as listed above at the balance sheet date.
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to a 0.5% change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, applied to the major currencies of net variable rate assets liabilities.
0.5% is the sensitivity rate that represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates in the next 12 months.

The sensitivity analysis includes amounts owed by the Group undertakings.

h Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Company.
The Companys maximum exposure to credit risk is as follows: 2013 2012 Note 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents 8 3,517 734 Trade receivables 6 8 41 Amounts owed by Group undertakings 35,079 35,289 38,604 36,064 The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited because the counterparties to these assets are highly rated financial institutions.
In addition, the Company has further mitigated this risk by spreading cash deposits over a range of financial institutions with no more than 10m being deposited with any one counterparty.
The amounts presented in the table above are net of allowances for doubtful recoverability and foreseeable losses.
The table below shows the movements in the provision for impairment of amounts owed by Group undertakings: Amounts owed by Group undertakings 2013 2012 000 000 At 1 May 16,926 16,939 Charge for the year 122 118 Release in the year 152 131 At 30 April 16,896 16,926 Anite plc 117 Annual report and accounts 2013 Business overview Governance Financial statements 17 Financial risk management continued The ageing of the individually impaired amounts owed by Group undertakings is as follows: Amounts owed by Group undertakings 2013 2012 000 000 More than 12 months overdue 16,896 16,926 The ageing of the trade receivables and amounts owed by Group undertakings excluding those that have been impaired is as follows: Amounts owed by Trade receivables Group undertakings 2013 2012 2013 2012 000 000 000 000 Not past due 5 30 8 3 Past due Less than one month overdue 3 342 361 One to two months overdue 11 20 11 Two to three months overdue 180 11 More than three months overdue 34,529 34,903 3 11 35,071 35,286 Balance at 30 April 8 41 35,079 35,289 The credit quality of those debts owed by Group undertakings that are past due but not impaired has been assessed at the reporting date and has not significantly changed.
There is no reason why these amounts will not be recovered in due course.

The Groups UK overdraft facility was renewed during the year at 5m net, 2012: 5m net.
