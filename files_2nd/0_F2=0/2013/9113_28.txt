FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The principal objective of the Groups treasury policy is to ensure that there are sufficient resources to finance the business.
The cash resources of the Group are retained in a combination of central and local bank accounts.
These accounts comprise current, call and short-term deposits with banks approved by the Board.
Financial instruments held by the Group principally comprise financing facilities, cash and other items including receivables and payables, all of which arise directly from its operations.
The risks arising from these financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange rate risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews, agrees and monitors policies for managing each of these risks: these are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged during the period under review.
A LIQUIDITY RISK Group cash resources held at banks are monitored regularly by senior management locally and at Group level.
It is the Groups policy to retain sufficient funds in current and call accounts to meet short-term needs.
Surplus funds are retained on short-term interest-bearing deposits.
The Group also maintains overdraft facilities in certain entities.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period from the reporting date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

The trade and other receivables are non-interest-bearing.
The cash and cash equivalents earn interest at floating rates based on individual bank market rates for the relevant currencies and durations.
The Groups exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to bank loans and amounts payable under asset financeleases.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The impact on the Groups pre-tax profit due to a possible change in interest rates on loans and asset finance leases at the reporting date is demonstrated below: 2013 2012 US$000 US$000 1% movement in rates loans and asset finance leases 174 130 1% movement in rates Cash & Cash Equivalents 2,463 2,298 C FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Financial Statements are prepared in US Dollars, rounded to the nearest thousand which represents the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency of the Group.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases, borrowings and net investments in subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency other than US Dollars.
The principal currencies giving rise to this risk are Australian Dollar, South African Rand, United Arab Emirates Dirham, Saudi Riyal, Qatari Riyal, Kuwaiti Dinar, Euro, Russian Rouble, Canadian Dollar, Trinidad Tobago Dollar, Botswana Pula, Mozambique Metical, Madagascar Ariary, Dominican Republic Peso and Colombian Peso.
Exchange rate risk is managed at the subsidiary levels by ensuring that, as far as possible, income and expenses are denominated in the appropriate functional currency.
Certain subsidiaries enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge the exchange risk of trading and intercompany balances in line with Board-approved policy.
Those contracts outstanding at the relevant period ends are not designated as cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges and are entered into for periods consistent with currency transaction exposures, which are short-term in nature with average duration of three months as at 31 December 2013.
The Group does not trade in any derivative financial instruments.
EXCHANGE RATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of profit before tax to selected movements in subsidiary foreign exchange rates with all other variables held constant.
The impact on profit before tax is based on a reasonably possible change in US Dollar exchange rates with respect to different floating exchange rate reporting currencies.
The impact on total equity is calculated by changing the exchange rates used in measuring the closing balance sheet values.
2013 2012 US$000 US$000 A 10% rate depreciation in these currencies versus US dollar Impact on profit before tax 4,523 3,239 Impact on total equity 1,803 1,239 D CREDIT RISK Credit risk is managed on a subsidiary basis in line with procedures established and approved by the Group Board.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions as well as credit exposure to customers including outstanding receivables and work in progress.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with investment grade credit ratings are accepted.
Exceptions to this policy are permitted subject to specific Board approval for relationship banks that do not have an independent credit rating or require collateral support to achieve an acceptable credit rating.
The Groups credit risk management policy in relation to trade receivables and work in progress involves periodically assessing the financial reliability of customers taking into account their financial position past experience and other factors.
Credit risk is considered as part of the tender review process and the Group seeks to negotiate reasonable payment terms to mitigate such exposures.
At the reporting date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum Group credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
E FAIR VALUES Forward exchange contracts open at the reporting period ends are marked to market to fair value the contracts.
At 31 December 2013, the Group had foreign exchange contracts outstanding with notional contract values of US$144.1 million 2012: US$76.9 million and net unrealised gains of US$2.1 million US$0.5 million.
