William Hill PLC 74 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 DIReCTORS ReMUNeRATION RepORT 2013 Annual Bonus The 2013 Annual Bonus Plan for the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director was primarily based upon the annual profit before interest and taxes and exceptional items PBIT performance of the Group measured against annual PBIT targets as approved by the Board of Directors of William Hill PLC.
75% of the potential bonus award was based on this Group measure, being 123.75% of salary for the Chief Executive and 90% of salary for the Group Finance Director.
The 2013 Group PBIT performance targets were set, as they are annually, taking into account business expectations for the year and relevant external factors.
The 2013 PBIT threshold and target were set at a level, which represented stretching performance.
The actual Group PBIT for 2013 of 324.1m was below the threshold PBIT and therefore no bonus was payable in respect of the Group financial PBIT element.
2013 Group PBIT Target 2013 Group PBIT Performance Pre-bonus spend Actual Threshold 334.4m Target 352.0m 324.1m Maximum 369.6m The remaining 25% of the potential bonus award was based on individual performance against key business objectives, being 41.25% of salary for the Chief Executive and 30% of salary for the Group Finance Director.
Ralph Toppings individual objectives related to ongoing international expansion in key markets such as the US, Australia, Spain and Italy: leading the buyout of the Playtech joint venture: continuing significant progress in developing a multi-channel proposition and in particular accelerating the development of mobile: ensuring that our approach to responsible gambling is fully embedded within the business, whilst playing an active part in the work of the betting sector in these areas: and continuing to strengthen the Senior Management team.
Neil Coopers individual objectives related to mergers & acquisition activity including completion of the Australia and Playtech deals: managing the 2013 Rights Issue: and a range of corporate finance, planning, financial systems and tax projects.
Despite achieving a number of the above individual objectives, no bonus was payable to either executive director in respect of the individual performance element since as the rules of the annual bonus plan provide that the individual element of bonus is only payable if the threshold level of Group PBIT is achieved.
Therefore, both executive directors have been awarded no bonus in respect of 2013.
2013 Long-term incentives vesting in relation to performance ending in 2013 The 2010 and 2011 PSP awards will vest in full based on performance up to the end of 2013.
For the purposes of the single figure table, the values are based on the average share price for the last quarter of 2013 390.1p.
The original awards were adjusted for the 2013 rights issue by the theoretical ex-rights price adjustment factor and include the value of dividends that have accrued on vested share awards.
The EPS targets attached to half of the awards were also adjusted by the same factor.
2010 PSP awards In 2010, the Committee awarded Ralph Topping PSP shares to the value of 225% of salary and Neil Cooper shares to the value of 200% of salary 2010 PSP awards.
The vesting of one half of the 2010 PSP awards the EPS tranche depended on the aggregate adjusted EPS growth over the four year period: 2010 to 2013.
The aggregate EPS range for 2010 to 2013 was 78.8p to 97.4p.
No shares vest if aggregate EPS growth is below 78.8p: for EPS growth at the threshold of 78.8p, 25% of the EPS tranche vests: for EPS growth of 97.4p or above, the full EPS tranche vests: a sliding scale applies for performance between threshold and maximum.
The vesting of the remaining half of the 2010 PSP awards the TSR tranche depended on the Companys relative TSR performance over the four year performance period: 2010 to 2013 against a comparator group of 16 gambling and leisure companies.
For a ranking below median, none of the TSR tranche vests: for a median ranking 25% of the TSR tranche vests, rising on a straight-line basis to full vesting for a ranking at or above upper quartile.
The Companys aggregate EPS growth over the four year performance period was 98.7p which is above the maximum of the range the EPS tranche therefore vests in full.
The Companys TSR performance ranking was 3.23 relative to the comparator group of 15 companies, representing upper quartile performance, over the four year performance period the TSR tranche therefore vests in full.
The 2010 PSP awards therefore vest in full.
Ralph Topping receives 587,889 shares comprised of the original PSP award plus an additional 72,618 shares in lieu of dividends paid over the performance period.
Neil Cooper receives 385,049 shares comprised of the original PSP award plus an additional 47,562 shares in lieu of dividends paid over the performance period.
