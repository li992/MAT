Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profit will be available to utilise losses.
Factors affecting the tax charge in future years As a global organisation there are many factors which could affect the future effective tax rate of the Group.
The mix of profits across different territories, transfer pricing and other disputes with tax authorities and the location of research and development activity can all have a significant impact on the Groups effective tax rate.
Changes to tax legislation in territories where the Group has business operations could also impact the Groups effective tax rate.
In December 2012, the UK Government announced that as part of the ongoing phased reduction in the main rate of corporation tax, the main rate will reduce to 21% with effect from April 2014.
In March 2013, a further reduction in the main rate of corporation tax to 20% was announced which will take effect from 1 April 2015.
The deferred tax movements reflect the reduction in the UK tax rate from 23% to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014, and to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015, as these have been substantively enacted.
