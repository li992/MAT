Provisions in respect of discontinued and disposed of businesses relate to estimated amounts payable in connection with onerous contracts and claims arising from disposals.
The final amount payable remains uncertain as, at the date of approval of these financial statements, there remains a further period during which claims may be received.
The timing of any settlement will depend upon the nature and extent of claims received.
Provisions for onerous contracts represent the liabilities in respect of short term and long term leases on unoccupied properties and other contracts lasting under five years.
Provisions for legal and other claims relate principally to provisions for the estimated cost of litigation and other sundry claims.
The timing of the settlement of these claims is uncertain.
Provisions for re-organisation include provision for redundancy costs.
Other provisions include environmental provisions.
These are in respect of potential liabilities relating to the Groups responsibility for maintaining its operating sites in accordance with statutory requirements and the Groups aim to have a low impact on the environment.
These provisions are expected to be utilised as operating sites are disposed of or as environmental matters are resolved.
Provisions are discounted to present value where the effect is material using the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
23 Post-employment benefit obligations Pension schemes operated The Group operates a number of pension arrangements throughout the world which have been developed in accordance with statutory requirements and local customs and practices.
The majority of schemes are self-administered and the schemes assets are held independently of the Groups assets.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
The Group makes employer contributions to the various schemes in existence within the range of 3% to 35% of pensionable salaries.
The contributions payable for defined contribution schemes of 80 million 2012: 77 million have been fully expensed against profits in the current year.
UK schemes Within the UK there are now three main arrangements.
The Compass Retirement Income Savings Plan CRISP, the Compass Group Pension Plan the Plan and the Companys stakeholder pension arrangement.
CRISP was launched on 1 February 2003.
This has been the main vehicle for pension provision for new joiners in the UK since that date, but existing members of the Plan continued to accrue benefits under those arrangements up until 5 April 2010.
CRISP is a contracted-in money purchase arrangement whereby the Group will match employee contributions up to 6% of pay minimum 3%.
Within CRISP a new defined contribution section was established from April 2006 known as the Compass higher Income Plan ChIP.
Senior employees who contribute to CRISP will receive an additional employer-only contribution into ChIP.
The amount of contribution and eligibility for ChIP are decided annually at the Companys discretion.
The payment towards ChIP may be taken in part, or in whole, as a cash supplement instead of a pension contribution.
The Plan is a defined benefit arrangement.
Those UK employees who transfer from the public sector under the Transfer of Undertakings Protection of Employment Regulations 2006 are eligible to join the Plan, which has otherwise been closed to new entrants since 2003.
Such transferees enter into the Government Actuarys Department GAD sections of the Plan and are known as GAD members.
The Plan closed to future accrual for all existing members, other than GAD members, on 5 April 2010.
The affected members were offered membership of CRISP from 6 April 2010.
The Plan is operated on a pre-funded basis.
The funding policy is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as achieves a 100% funding level on a projected salary basis.
The actuarial assessments covering expense and contributions are carried out by independent qualified actuaries.
A formal actuarial valuation of the Plan is carried out every three years.
The most recent valuation of the Plan took place as at 5 April 2013.
At the valuation date, the total market value of the assets of the Plan was 1,808 million which represented 92% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
Consolidated financial statements Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2013 Financial statements 115 23 Post-employment benefit obligations continued By agreement with the Trustees, the Company has agreed to eliminate the 5 April 2013 deficit over a period of six years and three months to 31 December 2019 through monthly payments totalling 26 million per annum.
The next triennial valuation is due to be completed as at 5 April 2016.
The Plan is reappraised annually by independent actuaries in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits requirements.
The Chairman, Tony Allen, is independent but will retire on 30 November 2013. his successor will be Nigel Palmer, who is a current employee of the Group and was appointed a Trustee Director on 30 May 2013.
The other four Trustee Directors are UK-based employees of the Group, one of whom has been nominated by CRISP members.
At the date of this Report, there are vacancies for a further two member-nominated Trustee Directors.
The Plan has a corporate trustee.
The Chairman, Peter Morriss to 11 October 2013 and Phillip Whittome from 11 October 2013, is independent.
There are a further five Trustee Directors who are either UK-based employees or former employees of the Group, three of whom have been nominated by Plan members.
The Company became subject to the Pensions Automatic Enrolment Regulations for its workforce in the UK on 1 November 2012 but in accordance with the Regulations deferred its staging date for automatic enrolment of eligible employees until 2 January 2013 in order to ensure that adequate systems were in place and employees were not impacted over the Christmas period.
Both the Plan and CRISP are compliant arrangements under these Regulations and have been registered as such.
Employees who are not already in one of these registered compliant arrangements have been automatically enrolled into the National Employment Savings Trust NEST.
The decision to appoint NEST as the Companys partner for automatic enrolment was made following a comprehensive selection process and the Company considers that NEST provides the right type of service, communication material and investment choice for our employees and that it has the capabilities to support a company as large and diverse as Compass.
Overseas schemes In the USA, the main plan is a defined benefit plan.
The funding policy, in accordance with government guidelines, is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as achieves a 100% funding level on a projected salary basis.
In Canada, Norway and Switzerland, the Group also participates in funded defined benefit arrangements.
In other countries, Group employees participate primarily in state arrangements to which the Group makes the appropriate contributions.
Other than where required by local regulation or statute, the defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants.
For these schemes, the current service cost will increase under the projected unit credit method as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
In addition, the Group contributes to a number of multi employer, union sponsored pension plans, primarily in the USA.
These plans are accounted for as defined contribution plans, as the information provided by the plan administrators is insufficient for them to be accounted for as defined benefit plans.
The Group made total contributions of 10 million in the year 2012: 9 million to these arrangements.
All schemes Disclosures showing the assets and liabilities of the schemes are set out below.
These have been calculated on the following assumptions: UK schemes USA schemes Other schemes 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 Discount rate 4.4% 4.5% 5.1% 4.3% 3.5% 4.4% 3.6% 3.1% 3.7% Inflation assumption 3.4% 2.7% 3.0% 2.2% 2.3% 2.3% 2.0% 2.0% 2.1% CPI inflation assumption 2.65% n a n a n a n a n a n a n a n a Rate of increase in salaries 3.4% 3.7% 4.0% 3.0% 3.0% 3.0% 2.1% 2.4% 2.5% Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.3% 2.7% 3.0% 2.2% 2.3% 2.3% 0.5% 0.5% 0.7% Rate of increase for deferred pensions 3.4% 2.7% 3.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.3% 0.5% 116 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2013 23 Post-employment benefit obligations continued The mortality assumptions used to value the UK pension schemes are derived from the S1NA generational mortality tables with improvements in line with the projection model prepared by the Continuous Mortality Investigation of the UK actuarial profession, with no rating for males and 0.6 year age adjustment for females, with a long term underpin of 1.25%.
These mortality assumptions take account of experience to date and assumptions for further improvements in the life expectancy of scheme members.
Examples of the resulting life expectancies are as follows: 2013 2012 Life expectancy at 65 years Male Female Male Female Member aged 65 in 2013 2012 22.4 24.4 22.4 24.8 Member aged 65 in 2033 2032 24.2 26.3 24.1 26.8 The other demographic assumptions have been set having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data.
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of pension schemes.
For the overseas schemes, regionally appropriate assumptions have been used where recommended by local actuaries.
For US schemes, examples of the resulting life expectancies are as follows: 2013 2012 Life expectancy at 65 years Male Female Male Female Member aged 65 in 2013 2012 19.2 21.0 19.1 21.0 Analysis of the fair value of plan assets and the expected rates of return The expected rates of return on individual categories of plan assets are determined after taking advice from external experts and using available market data, for example by reference to relevant equity and bond indices published by stock exchanges.
The overall rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the respective investment portfolio of each plan.

The expected return on plan assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the period.
The actual return on assets was a gain of 205 million 2012: gain of 172 million.
The cumulative actuarial loss recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income was 463 million 2012: 502 million.
An actuarial gain of 39 million 2012: actuarial loss of 115 million was recognised during the year.
Measurement of the Groups defined benefit retirement obligations is particularly sensitive to changes in certain key assumptions, including the discount rate and life expectancy.
An increase or decrease of 0.5 percentage points in the UK discount rate would result in a 159 million decrease or 169 million increase in the UK defined benefit obligations respectively.
An increase of one year in the life expectancy of all UK members from age 65 would result in a 49 million increase in the UK defined benefit obligations.
