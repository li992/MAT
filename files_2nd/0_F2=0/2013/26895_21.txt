Taxation 2013 2013 2013 2012 2012 2012 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total i Analysis of tax charge for the year Overseas taxation - - - - - - Current tax charge - - - - - - ii Factors affecting current tax charge for the year The tax assessed for the year is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 24.33% 2012 - 26.33%.
Accordingly the companys profits for this accounting period are taxed at the effective rate of 24.33% and will be taxed at 24% in the future.
The companys taxable income is exceeded by its tax allowable expenses, which include both the revenue and capital elements of the management fee and finance costs.
As at 31 January 2013, the company had accumulated surplus expenses of 162.2 million 2012 - 152.4 million.
As at 31 January 2013 the company has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 37.3 million 2012 - 36.6 million in respect of the accumulated expenses, based on a prospective corporation tax rate of 23% 2012 24%.
The reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax was substantively enacted on 3 July 2012 and is effective from 1 April 2013.
A further reduction to the main rate is proposed to reduce the rate by 1% to 22% in April 2014.
Provided the company continues to maintain its current investment profile, it is unlikely that these expenses will be utilised and that the company will obtain any benefit from this asset.
The company will continue to seek approval under section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 for the current year and the foreseeable future.
The company has not therefore provided for deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the disposals of investments.

Details of these dividends are set out below.
However, the dividend payable will be based on the numbers of shares in issue on the record date and will reflect any purchases and cancellations of shares by the company settled subsequent to the year end.
Ordinary dividends paid by the company carry a tax credit at a rate of 10%.
The credit discharges the tax liability of shareholders subject to income tax at less than the higher rate.
Shareholders liable to pay tax at the higher or additional rate will have further tax to pay.

The Loan Notes and Bonds were issued in 1987 at 97.4% and are repayable on 2 January 2018, together with a premium of 8,366,510.
The initial interest rate on the Loan Notes and Bonds was 7.16% per annum.
This increased annually by 7.5% compound until January 1998 when it reached its current rate of 14.75%.
This stepped interest rate, when combined with the accrual of the premium, results in an effective interest rate of 11.28% per annum.
Interest on the Loan Notes and Bonds is payable in January and July each year.
Interest on the Loan Notes is variable in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the lender, First Debenture Finance PLC FDF.

The company has guaranteed the repayment of principal and interest on 34.0 million of FDFs debenture stock.
This is in proportion to the principal amounts raised by the company in 1987 in respect of the Loan Notes and Bonds.
There is a floating charge on all the companys present and future assets to secure this obligation.
The company has also agreed to meet its proportionate share of any expenses incurred by FDF, including any tax liability.

This loan is repayable on 20 May 2023 and carries interest at 9.25125% per annum on the principal amount.
Interest is payable in May and November each year.
As security for this loan, the company has granted a floating charge over its assets in favour of the lender.
This charge ranks pari passu with the floating charge noted in 10 i above.
The effective interest rate of this portion of the loan is 9.51%.
On assuming the additional loan of 12,000,000 in 1998, the company also received a premium of 5,286,564 to ensure that the finance costs on this additional loan were comparable to existing market interest rates.
This premium is being amortised over the remaining life of the loan.
The effective interest rate of this portion of the loan is 6.00%.

A proposal to remove this prohibition from the Articles is being proposed for shareholder approval at the AGM.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales ICAEW, in its technical guidance TECH 02 10, states that investment holding gains arising out of a change in fair value of assets may be recognised as realised provided they can be readily converted into cash.
Securities listed on a stock exchange are generally regarded as being readily convertible into cash and hence profits in respect of such securities, currently included within the investment holding losses of the capital reserve above, may be regarded as realised under company law.

Financial Risk Management Policies and Procedures The company invests in equities and other investments in accordance with its investment policy as stated on page 1.
In pursuing its investment policy, the company is exposed to certain inherent risks that could result in either a reduction in the companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for distribution by way of dividends.
The main risks arising from the companys financial instruments are: market price risk, market yield risk, foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The directors determine the objectives and agree policies for managing each of these risks, as set out below.
The investment manager, in close co-operation with the directors, implements the companys risk management policies.
The companys policy allows the use of derivative financial instruments to moderate risk exposure and to generate additional revenue.
These policies have remained substantially unchanged during the current and preceding period.
a Market Risk The investment manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision, and monitors the risk on the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
Market risk comprises market price risk, market yield risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
i Market Price Risk Market price risk arises mainly from the uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments held.
It represents the potential loss the company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
Where call options are sold written, in all cases a sufficient position is maintained in the underlying equity to cover any potential option exercise.
Whilst the option value can be volatile, price movements should to some extent be offset by opposing movements in the value of the underlying equity.
If options are retained until expiry they will either expire worthless or be exercised.
The effect of any option exercise is to sell the underlying shares at the strike price of the option.
A schedule of the companys listed holdings is shown on pages 18 and 19.
Where put options are purchased, the market value of such options can be volatile but the maximum loss on any contract is limited to the original investment cost.
No put options were purchased in the year.
Further explanation of this derivative strategy is included in the Investment Managers Review page 15.
Falls in stock market valuations lead to changes in gearing ratios.
The boards procedure for monitoring the gearing of the company is set out in note 18 on page 63.
This takes into account the investment managers view on the market, covenant requirements and the future prospects of the companys performance.
Market price risk sensitivity The value of the companys listed investments i. e. fixed asset investments, excluding unlisted equities which were exposed to market price risk as at 31 January 2013 was as follows: 2013 2012 Listed investments held at fair value through profit or loss 587,885,448 512,041,586 Derivative financial instruments - written call options 956,913 291,625 Total listed investments 586,928,535 511,749,961 The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and the net assets to an increase or decrease of 20% 2012 - 20% in the fair values of the companys listed investments.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of market conditions in recent years.
The sensitivity analysis on the net return after tax is based on the impact of a 20% increase or decrease in the value of the companys listed equity investments at each closing balance sheet date and the consequent impact on the investment management fees for the year, with all other variables held constant.

A dedicated investment manager has the responsibility for monitoring the existing portfolio selection in accordance with the companys investment objectives and to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Call options are only written on stock owned within the portfolio with a maximum exposure of 15% of gross assets at the time of writing the call.
ii Market Yield Risk Market yield risk arises from the uncertainty about the companys ability to maintain its income objectives due to systematic decline in corporate dividend levels.
Management of market yield risk The directors regularly review the current and projected yield of the investment portfolio, and discuss with the investment manager the extent to which it will enable the company to meet its investment income objective.

59 The Merchants Trust PLC Annual Financial Report for the year ended 31 January 2013 Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 January Interest Rate Exposure The table below summarises in sterling terms the financial assets and financial liabilities whose values are directly affected by changes in interest rates.
The fixed rate interest bearing liabilities bear the following coupon and effective rates as at 31 January 2013 and 31 January 2012.
Amount Effective Maturity borrowed Coupon rate since date rate inception First Debenture Finance PLC FDF - Bonds 02 01 2018 5,133,520 14.75% 11.28% First Debenture Finance PLC FDF - Notes 02 01 2018 20,534,079 14.75% 11.28% Fintrust Debenture PLC Fintrust - Original Loan 20 05 2023 30,000,000 9.25125% 9.51% Fintrust Debenture PLC Fintrust - Additional Loan 20 05 2023 12,000,000 9.25125% 6.00% 5.875% Secured Bonds 2029 20 12 2029 30,000,000 5.875% 6.23% 4% Perpetual Debenture Stock n a 1,375,000 4.00% 4.00% 3.65% Cumulative Preference Stock n a 1,178,000 3.65% 3.65% 100,220,599 The effective rates are calculated in accordance with FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement as detailed in the Statement of Accounting Policies on page 47.
The details in respect of the above loans have remained unchanged since the previous accounting period.
The weighted average effective rate of the companys fixed interest bearing liabilities excluding the 3.65% Cumulative Preference Stock and the 4% Perpetual Debenture Stock is 8.54% 2012 - 8.54% and the weighted average period to maturity of these liabilities is 11.2 years 2012 - 12.2 years.
The above year end amounts are reasonably representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year, as the level of exposure does not change materially.
Therefore the companys net return and net assets, are not significantly affected by changes in interest rates.
60 Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 January Management of interest rate risk The company invests predominantly in equities, the values of which are not directly affected by changes in prevailing market interest rates.
In the year to 31 January 2013, the company held no fixed interest securities.
The companys policy is to remain substantially fully invested and thus does not expect to hold significant cash balances.
The financial assets have minimal exposure to interest rate risk.
The company finances its operations through a mixture of share capital, retained revenue and long term borrowings.
Movement in interest rates will not have a material effect on the finance costs and financial liabilities of the company, as presented in the accounts, as all the borrowings of the company are subject to fixed rates of interest.
b Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk relates to the capacity to meet liabilities as they fall due and is dependent on the liquidity of the underlying assets.
Maturity of financial liabilities The table below presents the future cash flows payable by the company in respect of its financial liabilities.
Cash flows in respect of the principal and interest on the Stepped Rate Interest Loan, Fixed Rate Interest Loan and 5.875% Secured Bonds 2029 reflect the maturity dates as set out in note 10 on pages 53 to 55.
The loans are each governed by a trust deed and only if the covenants are breached would early repayment be enforced.
Therefore their repayment is not considered to be a likely short term liquidity issue.
Cash flows in respect of the 4% Perpetual Debenture Stock and 3.65% Cumulative Preference Stock, which have no fixed repayment date, assumes maturity of 20 years from the balance sheet date.
Cash flows have not been discounted.
