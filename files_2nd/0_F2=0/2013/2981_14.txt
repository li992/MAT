The reduction from 24% to 23% was substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and has therefore been reflected in these Group financial statements.
In addition to the changes in the corporation tax disclosed above, it was announced in the December 2012 Budget Statement that the rate would be reduced from 23% to 21% from 1 April 2014 and in the March 2013 Budget Statement it was announced that the rate would be further reduced to 20% from 1 April 2015.
These further rate reductions had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are therefore not reflected in these Group financial statements.
The proposed reductions of the main rate of corporation tax to 21% and 20% by 1 April 2014 and 1 April 2015, respectively, are expected to be enacted separately each year.
The combined effect would be to reduce the net deferred tax liability provided at 27 April 2013 by 2.4m.

Dividends The Directors decided that no final dividend will be paid 2012: No final dividend paid.
This results in no dividend in the year to 27 April 2013 2012: No dividend paid.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding those held by Equity Trust Jersey Limited see note 25 which are treated as cancelled.
In order to compute diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
Those share options granted to employees and Executive Directors where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the period represent potentially dilutive ordinary shares.

Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2013 Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2013 Business review Governance Financial statements Business review Governance Financial statements 55 55 Goodwill is impaired if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use.
In the absence of a recent market transaction the recoverable amount of the goodwill held by the Group is determined from value in use calculations.
These calculations are based on 10 year profit projections, the same period used by the Group for appraising the potential of business acquisitions, adjusted for non-cash items, planned working capital movements and capital expenditure.
The cash flow projections for the initial five year period are based on financial budgets and plans approved by the Board.
The key drivers are like-for-like sales growth, gross margin percentage and anticipated cost inflation.
Cash flows beyond the five year plan period are extrapolated at a constant growth rate of 2.5% 2012: 2.5% and a terminal value is included at five times year 10 EBITDA.
The growth rate is in line with long term growth rates of the countries in which the Group operates.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 7.7% 2012: 8.0% and is based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reflect the risks of the businesses acquired.
Based on these calculations goodwill is not impaired.
An increase of 1% in the discount rate would not lead to an impairment of goodwill.

Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a variety of pension schemes, principally in the UK, the Netherlands and Belgium.
They comprise defined benefit schemes where benefits are based on employees length of service and average final salary, and defined contribution schemes where the employer company pays a set contribution to the scheme.
The UK defined benefit schemes referred to in 22 i a and the first two defined contribution schemes referred to in 22 ii are accounted for by the Company.
i Defined benefit schemes a UK defined benefit schemes The Company operated a funded defined benefit pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay for its employees and has assumed the liability for the scheme previously operated by Storey Carpets Ltd Storeys.
The Company scheme was closed to defined benefit service accrual on 30 April 2010 and has been closed to new members since 31 March 2006.
The scheme previously operated by Storeys is also closed to new members and has no active members.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Company.
The assets of the Company scheme are invested in a Managed Fund operated by a fund management company.
Contributions are determined by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The most recent actuarial review was at 6 April 2011 when the actuarial value of the assets represented 77% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
A deficit reduction plan has been agreed with the Trustees under which 0.6m was paid in the year 2012: 0.6m.
The assets of the Storeys scheme are held in independently managed funds.
The most recent actuarial review of the Storeys scheme was at 1 March 2011 when the actuarial value of the assets represented 90% of the benefits accrued to members.
A deficit reduction plan has been agreed with the Trustees under which 0.2m was paid in the year 2012: 0.1m.
The assets and liabilities of the schemes were valued on an IAS 19 basis at 27 April 2013 by a qualified actuary.
The numbers set out below are the aggregate of the two schemes.
1 Key assumptions used: 2013 2012 % % RPI inflation 3.4 2.8 Discount rate 4.2 4.6 Deferred pension revaluation 2.8 2.2 Expected return on scheme assets 4.4 5.2 The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The assumptions used for future life expectancy of members of the scheme are derived from industry dates and standard tables.
Specifically the S1NMA table 2012: S1NMA table with medium cohort improvement has been used for male pensioners and the S1NFA table 2012: S1NFA table with medium cohort improvement for female pensioners projected by year of birth.
The most significant assumptions are the expected return on scheme assets and the discount rate, of which the most sensitive assumption is the discount rate.
If this assumption increased or decreased by 0.1% the defined benefit obligation would change by 0.4m 2012: 0.2m.

It is not possible to identify the Groups share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme, and therefore in accordance with IAS 19, the Group has taken the exemption for multi-employer pension schemes not to disclose pension scheme assets and liabilities.
Accordingly, although this scheme is a defined benefit scheme it is treated as a defined contribution scheme recognising the contributions payable in each period in the income statement.
Under the terms of the scheme the scheme deficit is recovered through increased contributions from participating members.
At the period end the Group was unable to obtain a valuation of the industry schemes full surplus or deficit.
Contributions charged to the income statement amounted to 1.1m 2012: 1.3m.
ii Defined contribution schemes The Company launched a Group Personal Pension Plan in April 2006.
Contributions made by employees are matched by the Company to an upper limit.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company and are invested by Scottish Life.
Contributions for the period amounted to 0.9m 2012: 1.0m.
In addition, the Group operates defined contribution pension schemes for subsidiary companies in Belgium and the Netherlands.
The Group makes contributions into the schemes, the assets of which are held separately from those of the Group and are invested by local insurance companies.
The contributions by the Group into individual company schemes for the period were a net charge of nil 2012: nil and contributions to industry collective schemes were 0.1m 2012: 0.1m.

Financial instruments i Financial risk management objectives and policies Risk management The Groups principal financial instruments comprise borrowings and overdrafts, cash and cash equivalents.
These financial instruments are used to manage funding and liquidity requirements.
Other financial instruments which arise directly from the Groups operations include trade receivables and payables.
Exposure to credit, liquidity, foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks arise in the normal course of the Groups business operations and each of these risks is managed in accordance with the Groups treasury risk management strategy, which is also discussed in the Business Review in the section Current liquidity.
a Credit risk The Group does not have significant concentrations of credit risk as exposure is spread over a number of counterparties and customers.
The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables, the majority of which relates to retail customer products held ready for collection see note 15.
Retail customers are required to settle outstanding balances in cash or using a major credit card prior to goods being collected from delivered by the store.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with a minimum Acredit rating.
The maximum amount of credit risk is represented by the carrying amounts of financial assets.
b Liquidity risk The Group finances its operations from a mix of retained profits and bank borrowings achieved through term loans, revolving credit agreements and overdraft facilities.
Daily cash balances are forecast and surplus cash is placed on treasury deposit with the Groups bankers at commercial rates.
All counterparties have minimum Acredit ratings.

The Company has committed facilities to July 2015.
These facilities comprise a 14.0m amortising term loan and a 45.0m revolving credit facility.
Repayments on the term loans cannot be redrawn.
There are a number of covenants which commit the Group to maintaining certain rates of leverage and fixed charge cover.
The Group has and is expected to remain in compliance with these covenants.
At 27 April 2013 the Euro amortising term loan was 1.8m and the revolving credit facility had an undrawn amount of 42.5m 2012: 32.5m.
c Foreign exchange risk Outside the UK the Group operates in the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium and has an investment property in Poland.
Revenues and expenses of these operations are denominated in Euros or Zlotys.
The Groups investment in Poland is not sufficiently material to require the risk to be hedged.
The Group mitigates currency risk in respect of the net investment in European operations by designating Euro denominated borrowings as hedging instruments of Euro denominated investments in foreign operations.
If the closing Sterling-Euro rate had been 0.01 points lower in the period the exchange difference reported in the statement of comprehensive income would have been 0.6m lower 2012: 0.7m lower.
At 27 April 2013 if Sterling had weakened strengthened by 10% against the Euro, profit after tax for the year would have been 0.1m higher lower as a result of the translation of the Euro denominated businesses.
Financial assets and liabilities and foreign operations are translated at the following rates of exchange: Euro Euro Zloty Zloty 2013 2012 2013 2012 Average rate 1.23 1.16 5.12 4.90 Closing rate 1.19 1.23 4.93 5.12 www.

Financial instruments continued d Interest rate risk The Group has various borrowings bearing interest at a margin over LIBOR or EURIBOR rates.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the Group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by changes in interest rates.
This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt and a constant ratio of fixed to floating interest rates as at 27 April 2013 and 28 April 2012 respectively.
Consequently analysis relates to the situation at those dates and is not representative of the years then ended.
Based on the Groups net debt position at the year end a 1% change in interest rates would affect the Groups profit before tax by approximately 0.1m 2012: 0.3m.
The interest rate profile of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group is as follows: 2013 2012 Weighted Weighted average average effective Floating Fixed Interest effective Floating Fixed Interest interest rate rate rate free Total interest rate rate rate free Total % m m m m % m m m m Sterling 3.9 3.1 7.0 0.2 6.1 4.8 10.9 Euro 0.4 3.7 4.5 8.2 1.2 3.2 4.6 7.8 Zloty 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 Total financial assets 7.9 7.6 15.5 9.6 9.4 19.0 Sterling 1.0 9.8 2.4 70.8 83.0 1.0 15.4 2.7 72.2 90.3 Euro 0.8 5.7 0.2 9.9 15.8 2.2 10.6 12.8 23.4 Total financial liabilities 15.5 2.6 80.7 98.8 26.0 2.7 85.0 113.7 Capital management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and retain financial flexibility in order to continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
The Group considers capital to be equity and net debt.
Net debt is disclosed in note 29.
The Group manages its capital by: continued focus on free cash flow generation: setting the level of capital expenditure and dividend in the context of the current year and forecast free cash flow: and monitoring the level of the Groups financial and leasehold debt in the context of Group performance.

iv Hedge accounting Net investment hedges Euro-denominated borrowings are designated as hedging instruments of Euro-denominated net assets of the Groups foreign operations in order to protect the Group from currency risk in respect of the Groups Euro-denominated foreign operations.
Borrowing balances are carried at amortised cost which approximates fair value since borrowings bear interest at the prevailing floating rate.
The carrying value of borrowings amounted to 1.8m 2012: 6.7m.
