Financial statements Notes to the UK GAAP Company balance sheet for the year ended 31 December 2013 1.
Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
They have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption of FRS 8 Related party disclosures not to show transactions with other companies in the Group headed by Xaar plc.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in paragraph 2D of FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and not disclosed information required by that standard as the Groups consolidated financial statements, in which the Company is included, provide equivalent disclosures for the Group under IFRS 7 Financial Disclosures.
Own shares Own shares are deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Companys own shares.
Share-based payments The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1 January 2005.
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
These payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
The fair value of options issued under the Companys Long Term Incentive Plan is measured using a stochastic Monte Carlo binominal model for grants made between 2007 and 2009 inclusive.
The fair value of all other equity-settled share-based payments is measured using the Black-Scholes pricing model.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when the timing differences crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in financial statements.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Investments Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
For investments in subsidiaries acquired for consideration, including the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief, cost is measured by reference to the nominal value only of the shares issued.
Bonds with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity dates that the Group has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity investments and are measured at amortised cost using effective interest method less any impairment.
Profit for the year As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the year.
