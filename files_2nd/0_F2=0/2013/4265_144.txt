Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued During 2013 management reviewed the long term growth rates in the markets in which the Group operates: as much of our business operates in Asian markets where growth rates are typically higher it was concluded that 3.5% was an appropriate terminal growth rate to use across the business 2012: 3.5%.
While growth rates have fallen globally due to the macro economic situation, this rate is below the long term growth rate projected for our major markets.
The Group has conducted sensitivity analysis on a variety of scenarios when completing the annual impairment review.
The directors have concluded that there are no cash generating units where reasonably possible changes in assumptions would cause the carrying amount of a CGu to exceed its value in use.
