29 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Risk Management Policies and Procedures The Group comprises of an investment trust and a wholly owned subsidiary.
The Group invests in equities and other financial instruments for the long term to further the investment objective set out on page 46.
This exposes the Group to a range of financial risks that could impact on the assets or performance of the Group.
The main risks arising from the Groups pursuit of its investment objective are market risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and gearing risk and the Directors approach to the management of them is set out below.
The risks have remained unchanged since the beginning of the year to which the financial statements relate.
The Groups exposure to financial instruments comprise: E quity and non-equity shares which are held in the investment portfolio in accordance with the Groups investment objective.
Term loans and bank overdrafts, the main purpose of which is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
C ash, liquid resources and short-term receivables and payables that arise directly from the Groups operations.
D erivative transactions which the Group enters into may include equity or index options, forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps.
The purpose of these is to manage the market price risks, foreign exchange risks and interest rate risks arising from the Groups investment activities.
The overall management of the risks is determined by the Board and its approach to each risk identified is set out below.
The Board and the investment manager co-ordinate the risk management and the investment manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision.
a Market Risk Market risk comprises three types of risk: market price risk see note 29 a i, currency risk see note 29 a ii, and interest rate risk see note 29 a iii.
i Market Price Risk The Company is an investment company and as such its performance is dependent on the valuation of its investments.
Consequently market price risk is the most significant risk that the Group faces.
Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Groups operations.
It represents the potential loss the Group might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
A detailed breakdown of the investment portfolio is given on pages 36 to 41.
Investments are valued in accordance with the Groups accounting policies as stated in Note 2 g. At the year end, the Companys portfolio included two derivative instruments 30 April 2012: two both of which are interest rate swaps.
Management of the risk In order to manage this risk it is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce both the statistical risk and the risk arising from factors specific to a particular technology sector.
The allocation of assets to international markets, together with stock selection covering small, medium and large companies, and the use of index options, are other factors which act to reduce price risk.
The investment manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board which meets regularly in order to consider investment strategy.

Market price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and the value of shareholders funds to an increase or decrease of 15% 30 April 2012: 15% in the fair values of the Groups investments.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions and historic trends.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Groups investments at each balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.

Polar Capital Technology Trust plc 94 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2013 Management of the risk The investment manager mitigates the individual currency risks through the international spread of investments and the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Borrowings in foreign currencies are entered into to manage the asset exposure to those currencies, which vary according to the asset allocation.
Foreign currency exposure The table below shows, by currency, the split of the Groups non-Sterling monetary assets, liabilities and investments that are priced in currencies other than Sterling.

Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the loss after tax for the year and the value of shareholders funds in regard to the financial assets and financial liabilities and the exchange rates for the US Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen, Hong Kong Dollar, Korean Won and Taiwan Dollar.
It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: US Dollar - 10% 2012: 10% Euro - 10% 2012: 10% Japanese Yen - 10% 2012: 10% Hong Kong Dollar - 10% 2012: 10% Korean Won - 10% 2012: 10% Taiwan Dollar - 10% 2012: 10% If Sterling had depreciated against the currencies shown, this would have the following effect: Group 30 April 2013 000 Hong US Kong Korean Taiwan Dollar Euro Yen Dollar Won Dollar Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 279 50 11 1 9 52 Capital return 43,670 2,404 2,042 1,697 2,578 3,020 Change to the profit loss after tax for the year 43,949 2,454 2,053 1,698 2,587 3,072 Change to shareholders funds 43,949 2,454 2,053 1,698 2,587 3,072 Group 30 April 2012 000 Hong US Kong Korean Taiwan Dollar Euro Yen Dollar Won Dollar Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 139 18 21 8 7 60 Capital return 43,105 2,231 1,652 1,673 2,187 2,621 Change to the profit loss after tax for the year 43,244 2,249 1,673 1,681 2,194 2,681 Change to shareholders funds 43,244 2,249 1,673 1,681 2,194 2,681 Polar Capital Technology Trust plc 96 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2013 If Sterling had appreciated against the currencies shown, this would have the following effect: Group 30 April 2013 000 Hong US Kong Korean Taiwan Dollar Euro Yen Dollar Won Dollar Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 228 41 9 1 7 42 Capital return 35,730 1,967 1,670 1,389 2,109 2,471 Change to the profit loss after tax for the year 35,958 2,008 1,679 1,390 2,116 2,513 Change to shareholders funds 35,958 2,008 1,679 1,390 2,116 2,513 Group 30 April 2012 000 Hong US Kong Korean Taiwan Dollar Euro Yen Dollar Won Dollar Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 114 14 17 7 6 49 Capital return 35,268 1,825 1,352 1,369 1,789 2,144 Change to the profit loss after tax for the year 35,382 1,839 1,369 1,376 1,795 2,193 Change to shareholders funds 35,382 1,839 1,369 1,376 1,795 2,193 The impact of the Company figures have not been given as they would not materially differ from the Group figures.
In the opinion of the Directors, neither of the above sensitivity analyses are representative of the year as a whole since the level of exposure changes frequently as part of the currency risk management process used to meet the Companys objectives.
iii Interest Rate Risk Interest rate changes may affect the income received from cash at bank and interest payable on borrowings.
All cash balances earn interest at a variable rate.
The Group finances its operations through its term loans as well as bank overdrafts and any retained gains arising from operations.
The Group uses borrowings in the desired currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest to both generate the desired interest rate profile and manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Polar Capital Technology Trust plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2013 97 Financial Statements 5 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued for the year ended 30 April 2013 29 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Management of the risk The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these on a regular basis.
The Group has entered into two fixed floating interest rate swap transactions on Japanese Yen and US Dollars.
The swap allows the variable LIBOR part of the US Dollar and Japanese Yen loans to be swapped for a fixed amount.
The Group uses its interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its Japanese Yen and US Dollar bank borrowings.
A Japanese Yen contract with a nominal value of Y750 million has fixed interest payments at a rate of 0.46% and floating interest receipts at Yen LIBOR 2012: fixed interest payments at a rate of 0.46% floating interest receipts at Yen LIBOR.
A US Dollar contract with a nominal value of $23 million has fixed interest payments at a rate of 0.81% and floating interest receipts at USD LIBOR 2012: fixed interest payments at a rate of 0.81% and floating interest receipts at USD LIBOR.
Interest rate exposure The exposure, at 30 April, of financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates i. e. giving cash flow interest rate risk - when the rate is due to be re-set: f ixed interest rates i. e. giving fair value interest rate risk - when the financial instrument is due for repayment.

Polar Capital Technology Trust plc 98 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2013 The table below illustrates the Groups sensitivity to interest rate movements, with a change of 0.25% p. a. in the rates of interest available to the Groups financial assets and a change of 0.25% p. a in the rates of interest available to the Groups financial liabilities.
The effect on the revenue and capital return after tax and the value of shareholders funds are as follows if rates increased: 30 April 2013 30 April 2012 Group Company Group Company 000 000 000 000 Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 37 34 48 34 Capital return Change to the profit loss after tax for the year 37 34 48 34 Change to shareholders funds 37 34 48 34 A corresponding decrease in the rate would have equal and opposite effect to that shown in the table above.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions.
This is not representative of the year as a whole, since the exposure changes as level of cash loans held during the year will be affected by the strategy being followed in response to the Investment Managers perception of market prospects and the investment opportunities available at any particular time.
b Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the possibility of failure of the Group to realise sufficient assets to meet its financial liabilities.
Management of the risk The Groups assets mainly comprise readily realisable securities which may be sold to meet funding requirements as necessary.
Liquidity risk exposure The maturity of the Groups existing borrowings are set out in note 18 to the financial statements.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
At 30 April the financial liabilities comprised of: Group Company Group Company 30 April 2013 30 April 2013 30 April 2012 30 April 2012 000 000 000 000 Due within 1 month: Bank overdraft 148 148 Balances due to brokers 5,262 5,262 4,309 4,309 Accruals 297 297 1,600 1,600 Due after 1 month and within 3 months: Bank loan 10,076 10,076 Interest rate swap Due after 3 months and within 1 year: Bank loan 19,922 19,922 Interest rate swap 46 46 Due after 1 year: Bank loan 20,621 20,621 Interest rate swap 40 40 Polar Capital Technology Trust plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2013 99 Financial Statements 5 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued for the year ended 30 April 2013 29 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued c Credit Risk Credit risk is the exposure to loss from failure of a counterparty to deliver securities or cash for acquisitions or disposals of investments or to repay deposits.
Management of the risk This risk is not considered significant.
The Group manages credit risk by using brokers from a database of approved brokers and by dealing through Polar Capital.
All cash balances are held with approved counterparties.
These arrangements were in place throughout the current year and the prior year.
Credit risk exposure The maximum exposure to credit risk at 30 April 2013 was 44,385,000 30 April 2012: 50,401,000 comprising: Group Company Group Company 30 April 2013 30 April 2013 30 April 2012 30 April 2012 000 000 000 000 Balances due from brokers 9,560 9,560 1,091 1,091 Accrued income 282 281 233 231 Cash at bank 34,511 33,279 49,077 43,465 44,353 43,120 50,401 44,787 All of the above financial assets are current, their fair values are considered to be the same as the values shown and the likelihood of a material credit default is considered low.
None of the Groups financial assets are past due or impaired.
All deposits were placed with banks that had ratings of A or higher.
The fixed floating interest rate swaps are held with a counterparty with a rating of A or higher.
d Gearing risk The Companys policy is to increase its exposure to equity markets through the judicious use of borrowings.
When borrowings are invested in such markets, the effect is to magnify the impact on Shareholders funds of changes, both positive and negative, in the value of the portfolio.
Management of the risk The Company uses short-term loans to manage gearing risk, details of which can be found in note 18.
Gearing risk exposure The loans are valued at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method in the financial statements.
The Board regulates the overall level of gearing by raising or lowering cash balances.
Polar Capital Technology Trust plc 100 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2013 e Capital Management Policies and Procedures The Companys capital, or equity, is represented by its net assets which are managed to achieve the Companys investment objective set out on page 46.
The Board monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: i the planned level of gearing through the Companys fixed rate loan facility: and ii the need to issue or buy back equity shares for cancellation, which takes account of the difference between the net asset value per share and the share price ie the level of share price discount or premium.
The Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding accounting period.
The Company is subject to externally imposed capital requirements through the Companies Act with respect to its status as a public company.
In addition in order to pay dividends out of profits available for distribution by way of dividend, the Company has to be able to meet one of the two capital restriction tests imposed on investment companies by company law.
The Company is also subject to externally imposed capital requirements through the loan covenants set out in the loan facility.
These requirements are unchanged since the previous year end and the Company has complied with them.
