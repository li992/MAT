Financial instruments Derivative financial instruments The carrying values of derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date were as follows: Assets Assets Liabilities Liabilities 2013 2012 2013 2012 m m m m Cross currency interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges 0.8 0.4 0.7 Cross currency interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges 3.2 0.7 Derivative financial instruments hedging private placement notes 4.0 0.7 0.4 0.7 Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.
Fair values of derivative financial instruments are calculated based on a discounted cash flow analysis using appropriate market information for the duration of the instruments.
Fair value measurements are classified into three levels, depending on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from other observable inputs for the asset or liability: and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
We consider that the derivative financial instruments fall into Level 2.
All contracts are gross settled.
