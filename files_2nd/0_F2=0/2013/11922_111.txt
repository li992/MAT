Prior to 1 January 1998 all goodwill was written off to reserves on the date of acquisition.
For acquisitions completed between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2002 no value was ascribed to intangibles other than goodwill and the goodwill on each acquisition was amortised over a period of up to 20 years.
On adoption of IFRS on 1 January 2003, the Group chose not to restate the goodwill balance and at that date the balance was frozen i. e. amortisation ceased.
If goodwill had been restated then a significant value would have been ascribed to other intangible assets, which would be subject to amortisation, and the carrying value of goodwill would be significantly lower.
For acquisitions completed after 1 January 2003 value has been ascribed to other intangible assets which are amortised.
Other intangible assets Other intangibles acquired include content, technology and software rights.
Intangible assets are valued separately for each acquisition and the primary method of valuation used is the discounted cash flow method.
The majority of acquired intangibles are amortised using the unit of production method which is based on the pattern of benefits embodied in the asset.
Amortisation of 15m 2012: 10m is included in the income statement in cost of goods sold and 210m 2012: 218m including an impairment of 21m relating to Pearson in Practice in operating expenses.
In 2013 2m 2012: 9m of amortisation relates to discontinued operations.
