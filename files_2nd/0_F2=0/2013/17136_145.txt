William Hill PLC 118 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups shares over a period matching the option life.
The expected life of the option used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
For PSP, LTIP, EBMS, and William Hill Online LTIP schemes, the value of the option has also been adjusted to take into account the market conditions applicable to the option i. e. TSR requirements by applying a discount to the option value.
This discount is calculated based on an estimate of the probability of achieving the relevant condition and was 25% for the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2013 53 weeks ended 1 January 2013: 25% The weighted average fair value of the awards granted under the PSP, LTIP, EBMS, and William Hill Online LTIP schemes at the date of grant was 3.03 per option 1 January 2013: 1.55.
The weighted average fair value of the options granted under SAYE grants at the date of grant was 0.34 per option 53 weeks ended 1 January 2013: 0.34.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES The Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
The UK schemes are operated under a single trust and the assets of all the schemes held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
The respective costs of these schemes are as follows: 52 weeks 53 weeks ended ended 31 December 1 January 2013 2013 m m Defined contribution scheme charged to profit before interest and tax 9.8 5.2 Defined benefit scheme charged to profit before interest and tax 2.2 1.5 Defined benefit scheme charged to finance costs 0.7 1.4 Defined benefit scheme charged credited to other comprehensive income 3.8 5.6 16.5 2.5 Defined contribution schemes The defined contribution schemes, to which both the Group and employees contribute to fund the benefits, are available for all eligible employees.
The only obligation of the Group with respect to these schemes is to make the specified contributions.
The total cost charged to income in respect of these schemes represents contributions payable to the schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the respective schemes.
At 31 December 2013, contributions of 1.4m 1 January 2013: nil due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit scheme The Group also operates a defined benefit scheme in the UK for eligible employees which closed to new members in 2002.
Under the scheme, employees are entitled to retirement benefits varying between 1.67% and 3.33% of final pensionable pay for each year of service on attainment of a retirement age of 63.
With effect from 1 April 2011, the defined benefit scheme was closed to future accrual but maintains the link for benefits accrued up to 31 March 2011 with future salary increases up to a maximum of 5% per annum.
Employed members of this scheme were automatically transferred into one of the defined contribution schemes.
The costs of administering the scheme are borne by the Group.
The general principles adopted by the Trustees for the purposes of this funding valuation are that the assumptions used, taken as a whole, will be sufficiently prudent for pensions already in payment to continue to be paid, and to reflect the commitments which will arise from members accrued pensions right.
The Group expects to make deficit repair contributions of ca.
9.4m to the scheme during 2014 plus a 1.5m contribution towards the cost of life assurance and costs of running the scheme.
For the purposes of preparing the information disclosed in these accounts, a full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 30 September 2010 and updated to 31 December 2013 by a qualified independent actuary.
The present values of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
Disclosure of principal assumptions The financial assumptions used by the actuary in determining the present value of the defined benefit schemes liabilities were: 31 December 1 January 2013 2013 Rate of increase of salaries 4.40% 4.00% Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.30% 3.00% Discount rate 4.70% 4.50% Rate of RPI inflation 3.40% 3.00% Rate of CPI inflation 2.60% 2.30% William Hill PLC 119 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 32.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES In accordance with the relevant accounting standard, the discount rate has been determined by reference to market yields at the period end date on high quality fixed income investments at a term consistent with the expected duration of the liabilities.
Price inflation is determined by the difference between the yields on fixed and index-linked government bonds with an adjustment to allow for differences in the demand for these bonds, which can distort this figure.
The Bank of England target inflation rate has also been considered in setting this assumption.
The expected rate of salary growth and pension increases are set with reference to the expected rate of inflation.
No change has been made to the basis of inflation applied to pension increases in the scheme.
The mortality assumption is kept under review and has been updated.
The current life expectancies for a member underlying the value of the accrued liabilities are: 31 December 1 January Life expectancy at age 65 2013 2013 Member currently aged 65 22 years 22 years Member currently aged 40 25 years 25 years The assets in the scheme are set out in the table below.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES Movements in the present value of defined benefit obligations in the current period were as follows: 52 weeks 53 weeks ended ended 31 December 1 January 2013 2013 m m At beginning of period 317.0 308.9 Movement in period: Service cost 0.9 1.5 Interest cost 14.0 14.3 Actuarial loss due to changes in demographic assumptions Actuarial loss due to changes in financial assumptions 6.8 4.5 Benefits paid 10.0 12.2 Insurance premium for risk benefits 0.9 At end of period 327.8 317.0 Movements in the present value of fair value of scheme assets in the current period were as follows: 52 weeks 53 weeks ended ended 31 December 1 January 2013 2013 m m At beginning of period 295.9 274.8 Movement in period: Interest Income on assets 13.3 12.9 Return on assets in excess of interest income 3.0 10.1 Contributions from the sponsoring companies 10.3 10.3 Administration expenses recognised charged to profit before interest and tax 1.3 Benefits paid 10.0 12.2 Insurance premium for risk benefits 0.9 At end of period 310.3 295.9 Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure scheme liabilities The sensitivity of the present value of the schemes liabilities to changes in the principal assumptions used to measure these liabilities is illustrated in the table that follows.
The illustrations consider the single change shown, with the other assumptions assumed to be unchanged.
In practice, changes in one assumption may be accompanied by offsetting changes in another assumption although this is not always the case.
In addition, changes in the assumptions may occur at the same time as changes in the market value of the scheme assets, which may or may not offset the change in assumptions.
Assumption Changes in assumption Impact on defined benefit liabilities Discount rate Decrease by 0.25% p. a.
Increase of 17.4m Rate of increase in inflation Increase by 0.25% p. a.
Increase of 16.5m Members assumed to live Life expectancy Increase of 8.0m one year longer If the change in assumptions were in the opposite direction to that shown above, the impact on the defined benefits liabilities would be of a similar magnitude, but in the opposite direction.
