GSK normally pays a dividend two quarters after the quarter to which it relates and one quarter after it is declared.
The 2013 financial statements recognise those dividends paid in 2013, namely the third and fourth interim dividends for 2012, and the first and second interim dividends for 2013.
The amounts recognised in each year are as follows: 2013 2012 2011 m m m Dividends to shareholders 3,680 3,814 3,406 17 Property, plant and equipment Plant, Land and equipment Assets in buildings and vehicles construction Total m m m m Cost at 1 January 2012 6,351 10,389 2,092 18,832 Exchange adjustments 186 239 57 482 Additions 85 209 871 1,165 Additions through business combinations 18 15 33 Capitalised borrowing costs 9 9 Disposals and write-offs 250 630 3 883 Reclassifications 533 376 977 68 Transfer from assets held for sale 81 49 6 136 Cost at 31 December 2012 6,632 10,169 1,941 18,742 Exchange adjustments 68 105 29 202 Additions 57 230 948 1,235 Additions through business combinations 12 11 23 Capitalised borrowing costs 16 16 Disposals and write-offs 77 516 2 595 Reclassifications 107 233 340 Transfer to assets held for sale 53 296 17 366 Cost at 31 December 2013 6,610 9,726 2,517 18,853 GSK Annual Report 2013 155 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 17 Property, plant and equipment continued Plant, Land and equipment Assets in buildings and vehicles construction Total m m m m Depreciation at 1 January 2012 2,396 7,041 9,437 Exchange adjustments 73 164 237 Charge for the year 228 643 871 Disposals and write-offs 150 491 641 Transfer from assets held for sale 36 20 56 Depreciation at 31 December 2012 2,437 7,049 9,486 Exchange adjustments 38 80 118 Charge for the year 214 518 732 Disposals and write-offs 51 422 473 Transfer to assets held for sale 20 139 159 Depreciation at 31 December 2013 2,542 6,926 9,468 Impairment at 1 January 2012 138 443 66 647 Exchange adjustments 3 9 2 14 Disposals and write-offs 21 103 1 125 Impairment losses 18 38 2 58 Reversal of impairments 19 104 3 126 Transfer from assets held for sale 39 1 40 Impairment at 31 December 2012 152 266 62 480 Exchange adjustments 1 8 9 Disposals and write-offs 14 44 58 Impairment losses 23 100 1 124 Reversal of impairments 2 22 24 Transfer from to assets held for sale 1 1 Impairment at 31 December 2013 159 291 63 513 Total depreciation and impairment at 31 December 2012 2,589 7,315 62 9,966 Total depreciation and impairment at 31 December 2013 2,701 7,217 63 9,981 Net book value at 1 January 2012 3,817 2,905 2,026 8,748 Net book value at 31 December 2012 4,043 2,854 1,879 8,776 Net book value at 31 December 2013 3,909 2,509 2,454 8,872 The net book value at 31 December 2013 of the Groups land and buildings comprises freehold properties 3,478 million 2012 3,611 million, properties with leases of 50 years or more 366 million 2012 376 million and properties with leases of less than 50 years 65 million 2012 56 million.
Included in land and buildings at 31 December 2013 are leased assets with a cost of 784 million 2012 766 million, accumulated depreciation of 313 million 2012 315 million, impairment of 40 million 2012 19 million and a net book value of 431 million 2012 432 million.
Included in plant, equipment and vehicles at 31 December 2013 are leased assets with a cost of 99 million 2012 110 million, accumulated depreciation of 47 million 2012 55 million, impairment of 10 million 2012 nil and a net book value of 42 million 2012 55 million.
Some lease agreements include renewal or purchase options or escalation clauses.
The impairment losses principally arise from decisions to rationalise facilities and are calculated based on either fair value less costs of disposal or value in use.
The fair value less costs of disposal valuation methodology uses significant inputs which are not based on observable market data, and therefore this valuation technique is classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
These calculations determine the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted, post-tax cash flows of the relevant asset or cash generating unit, applying a discount rate of the Group post-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC of 7%, adjusted where appropriate for relevant specific risks.
For value in use calculations, where an impairment is indicated and a pre-tax cash flow calculation is expected to give a materially different result, the test would be reperformed using pre-tax cash flows and a pre-tax discount rate.
The Group WACC is equivalent to a pre-tax discount rate of approximately 10%.
The impairment losses have been charged to cost of sales 32 million 2012 25 million, R&D 14 million 2012 9 million and SG&A 78 million 2012 24 million, and include 62 million 2012 7 million arising from the major restructuring programmes.
Reversals of impairment arise from subsequent reviews of the impaired assets where the conditions which gave rise to the original impairments are deemed no longer to apply.
All of the reversals have been credited to cost of sales.
The carrying value at 31 December 2013 of assets for which impairments have been charged or reversed in the year was 6 million 2012 44 million.
