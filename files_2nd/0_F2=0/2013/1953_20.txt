66 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Accounts NO TES TO THE ACCOUNTS 1 Segmental analysis The Board regularly reviews the Groups performance and balance sheet position for its entire operations, which are entirely based in its country of domicile, the UK, and receives financial information for the UK as a whole.
As a consequence the Group has one reportable segment which is UK housebuilding.
As there continues to be only one reportable segment whose revenue, profits, expenses, assets, liabilities and cash ows aremeasured and reported on a basis consistent with the Group financial statements, no additional numerical disclosures arenecessary.
Additional information on average selling prices and the unit sales split between north, south, private and social has been included in the Group Finance Directors Review on pages 22 to 25.
The Board does not, however, consider these categories to be separate reportable segments as they review the entire operations as a whole, which are based in the UK, when assessing performance and making decisions about the allocation of resources.

Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less all estimated costs of completion and attributable overheads.
Estimated selling prices were reviewed on a site-by-site basis and selling prices were amended based on local management and the Boards assessment of current market conditions.
No exceptional land writedowns or land write backs were required as a result of this review.
There were no exceptional items in the year ended 31 July 2012.

At the year end a tax rate reduction to 21%, effective from 1 April 2014, and 20%, effective from 1 April 2015, were substantively enacted.
The corporation tax rate reduced from 26% to 24% with effect from 1 April 2012, and to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013.
Furtherreductions to 21% and 20% will reduce the Groups current tax charge accordingly.
The effective income tax charge is 23.0% of profit before taxation 2012 24.7% and compares favourably to the Groups standard tax rate for the year of 23.7% 2012 25.3%.
The lower effective tax rate in the current year is principally due to nalisation of prior year corporation tax returns.

Annual Report and Accounts 2013 8 Earnings per ordinary share Basic earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing earnings by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding the weighted average number of ordinary shares held by the employee share ownership plans which are treated as cancelled.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share uses the same earnings gure as the basic calculation except that the weighted average number of shares has been adjusted to reect the dilutive effect of outstanding share options allocated under employee share schemes where the market value exceeds the option price.
It is assumed that all dilutive potential ordinary shares are converted at the beginning of the accounting period.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing earnings by the diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares.
