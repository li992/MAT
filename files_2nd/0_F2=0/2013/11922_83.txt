Awards are designated as: ABSMP annual bonus share matching plan, subject to performance conditions: LTIP long-term incentive plan, subject to performance conditions: Dividends where dividend-equivalent shares are added without performance conditions to vested shares under the ABSMP and LTIP and released immediately on award.
Released means where shares have been transferred to participants.
Held means where awards have vested but are held pending release on the relevant anniversary of the award date.
Outstanding means awards that have been granted but are still subject to the achievement of performance conditions.
Note 2 No variations to terms and conditions of plan interests were made during the year.
Note 3 Performance conditions and vesting for awards under the bonus share matching and long-term incentive plans are described on pages 102 and 103.
Note 4 The single figure of remuneration for 2013 includes all awards that were subject to a performance condition where the performance period ended, or was substantially but not fully completed, at 31 December 2013 and awards where the performance condition has been satisfied but where the release of shares is subject to a further holding period.
The same methodology has been applied for earlier periods and the single figure for earlier reporting periods has been restated where necessary.
Note 5 The value of shares included in the single figure of remuneration is the number of shares multiplied by the share price on release or, if the shares have not yet been released, the average share price over the final quarter of the year which for 2013 was 1,310.45p.
