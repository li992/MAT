Accounting policies A summary of the principal accounting policies, all of which have been applied consistently throughout the year, is set out below.
a Basis of accounting The consolidated accounts have been prepared and approved in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU, interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Standards Committee, applicable legal and regulatory requirements of the Companies Guernsey Law, 2008 and the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.
The consolidated accounts give a true and fair view and are also in compliance with the Companies Guernsey Law, 2008.
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for investment trust companies issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC in January 2009 is consistent with the requirements of IFRS, the Directors have sought to prepare the financial statements on a basis compliant with the recommendations of the SORP.
The consolidated accounts have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for investment property and derivative financial instruments that have been measured at fair value.
The notes and financial statements are presented in pounds sterling being the functional currency of the Company and presentational currency for the Company and the Group and are rounded to the nearest thousand except where otherwise indicated.
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenue and expenses during the period.
The nature of the estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
significant estimates and assumptions are made in the valuation of the investment properties held.
Further information on the valuation, market risk and sensitivity to market changes are provided in notes 1 f, 9 and 18.
After making enquiries, and bearing in mind the nature of the Companys business and assets, the Directors consider that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
In assessing the going concern basis of accounting the Directors have had regard to the guidance issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
They have considered the current cash position of the Group, forecast rental income and other forecast cash ows.
The Group has agreements relating to its borrowing facilities with which it has complied during the year.
Based on this information the Directors believe that the Group has the ability to meet its financial obligations as they fall due for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the accounts.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except that the following new standards have been adopted in the current year: In June 2011, the International Accounting Standards Board the IASB issued Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.
The amendments to IAS 1 change the grouping of items presented in Other Comprehensive Income in its Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Items that could be reclassied to profit or loss at a future point in time are now required to be presented separately from items that will never be reclassied.
The amendment affects presentation only and has no impact on the Groups financial position or performance.
In May 2011, the IASB issued IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements 2011.
IFRS 10 2011 introduces a new control model that is applicable to all investees, by focussing on whether the Group has power over an investee, exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and ability to use its power to affect those returns.
As a result of IFRS 10 2011, the Group has changed its accounting policy for determining whether it has control over and consequently whether it consolidates its investees.
The Group reassessed the control conclusion for its investees at 1 January 2013 and concluded that it does not change the companies consolidated within the Group and therefore has no impact on the financial statements as presented.
In May 2011, the IASB issued IFRS 12 Disclosure of Involvement with Other Entities.
IFRS 12 includes all the disclosures which were previously required by IAS 27 related to consolidated financial statements, as well as all of the disclosures that were previously included in IAS 31 and IAS 28.
These disclosures relate to an entitys interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and structured entities.
The adoption of IFRS 10 and 12, from 1 January 2013, has no significant impact on the Group accounts, method of consolidation or disclosures presented.
In May 2011, the IASB issued IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements.
IFRS 13 does not change when an entity is required to use fair value, but 36 F&C Commercial Property Trust Limited 105710 CPropTxt PRINT 105710 CPropTxt V17 11 04 2014 15:07 Page 37 1.
Accounting policies continued a Basis of accounting continued rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under IFRS when fair value is required or permitted.
A number of additional disclosures are required and are included in notes 9, 13 and 14.
The following new standards have been issued but are not effective for this accounting period and have not been adopted early: In November 2009 and October 2010, the IASB issued IFRS 9 Financial Instruments which represents part of a project to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
It replaces the parts of IAS 39 that relate to the classication and measurement of financial instruments.
IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classied into two measurement categories: those measured as at fair value and those measured at amortised cost.
The determination is made at initial recognition.
The classication depends on the entity's business model for managing its financial instruments and the contractual cash ow characteristics of the instrument.
For financial liabilities, the standard retains most of the IAS 39 requirements.
The main change is that, in cases where the fair value option is taken for financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entitys own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch.
The IASB currently has an active project to make limited amendments to the classication and measurement requirements of IFRS 9 and to add new requirements to address the impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting.
A final standard in relation to hedge accounting is now in issue.
IFRS 9 will not be effective before 1 January 2017, with the final effective date being determined by the IASB when other parts of IFRS are nalised, but may be applied earlier subject to EU endorsement.
The Group is yet to assess IFRS 9s full impact and will also consider the impact of the remaining phases of IFRS 9 when completed by the IASB.
In October 2012, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements, IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in other entities and IAS 27 Separate financial statements Investment entities: The amendments define an investment entity and introduce an exception to consolidating particular subsidiaries for investment entities.
These amendments require an investment entity to measure those subsidiaries at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments in its consolidated and separate financial statements.
The amendments also introduce new disclosure requirements for investment entities in IFRS 12 and IAS 27.
These amendments become effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2014.
The Group does not consider that the future adoption of these amendments, in the form currently available, will have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements as presented.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December each year.
Subsidiaries are those entities, including special purpose entities, controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benets from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The Company owns 100 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of FCPT Holdings Limited, a company registered in Guernsey which was, until the group reconstruction in 2009, the top company in the group structure.
The principal activity of FCPT Holdings Limited is now to act as a holding company and it owns 100 per cent of the ordinary share capital of F&C Commercial Property Holdings Limited, a company registered in Guernsey whose principal business is that of an investment and property company.
The Company owns 100 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of SCP Estate Holdings Limited, a company registered in Guernsey.
The principal activity of SCP Estate Holdings Limited is to act as a holding company and it owns 100 per cent of the ordinary share capital of SCP Estate Limited, a company registered in Guernsey whose principal business is that of an investment and property company, and 100 per cent of the ordinary share capital of Prime Four Limited, a company registered in Guernsey whose principal business is that of an investment and property company.
The Company owns 100 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of Winchester Burma Limited, a company registered in Guernsey whose principal business is that of an investment and property company.
The Company owns 100 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of Accede Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales.
At 31 December 2013 this Company was dormant, having previously acted as an investment and property company.

Accounting policies continued b Basis of consolidation continued The Group also consolidates the results of F&C Commercial Property Finance Limited, a special purpose vehicle incorporated in Guernsey to issue the interest-bearing bonds.
F&C Commercial Property Finance Limited has the same board of directors as the Company and the Company has the majority of the risks and rewards associated with the vehicle.
F&C Commercial Property Finance Limited is therefore consolidated as a subsidiary.
c Revenue recognition Rental income, excluding VAT, arising on investment properties is accounted for in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term of ongoing leases.
Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income.
The Group from time to time receives surrender premiums from tenants who break their leases early.
To the extent they are deemed capital receipts to compensate the Group for loss in value of property to which they relate, they are credited to capital reserve investments held.
All other surrender premiums are recognised within rental income in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Distribution income received from any indirect property funds is recognised on the date the Group becomes entitled to the distribution and recorded separately from any unrealised or realised gains or losses on revaluation of indirect property funds.
Interest income is accounted for on an accruals basis.
d Expenses Expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
The Groups investment management and administration fees, finance costs and all other expenses are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
e Taxation The tax credit expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit loss before taxation reported in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
As the Directors consider the value of the property portfolio is likely to be realised by sale rather than use over time, and that no charge to Guernsey or United Kingdom taxation will arise on capital gains, no provision has been made for deferred tax on valuation uplifts.
f Investment properties Investment properties consist of land and buildings held to earn rental income together with the potential for capital and income growth.
Investment properties are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of consideration given, including associated transaction costs.
Any subsequent capital expenditure incurred in improving investment properties is capitalised in the period during which the expenditure is incurred and included within the book cost of the properties.
After initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and transferred to the Capital Reserve Investments Held.
Fair value is based on valuations provided by CBRE Limited, Registered Valuers, at the balance sheet date using recognised valuation techniques.
For the purposes of these financial statements, in order to prevent double accounting, the assessed fair value provided by CBRE is reduced by the carrying amount of any accrued income resulting from the spreading of lease incentives and or minimum lease payments.
This accrued income is separately recorded in the accounts within current assets.
Techniques used for valuing investment properties The Traditional Method converts anticipated future cash ow benets in the form of rental income into present value.
This approach requires careful estimation of future benets and application of investor yield or return requirements.
One approach to value the property on this basis is to capitalise net rental income on the basis of an Initial Yield, generally referred to as the All Risks Yield approach or Net Initial Yield approach.

Accounting policies continued f Investment properties continued The Discounted Cash Flow Method involves the projection of a series of periodic cash ows either to an operating property or a development property.
To this projected cash ow series an appropriate market-derived discount rate is applied to establish an indication of the present value of the income stream associated with the property.
The calculated periodic cash ow is typically estimated as gross income less vacancy and collection losses and operating expenses outgoings.
A series of periodic net operating incomes, along with an estimate of the reversion terminal exit value which uses the traditional valuation approach anticipated at the end of the projection period, are discounted to present value.
The aggregate of the net present values equals the market value of the property.
The fair value of investment properties is measured based on each propertys highest and best use from a market participants perspective and considers the potential uses of the property that are physically possible, legally permissible and nancially feasible.
Investment properties held under finance leases and leased out under operating leases are classied as investment properties and stated at fair value.
On derecognition, realised gains and losses on disposals of investment properties are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and transferred to the Capital Reserve Investments Sold.
Recognition and derecognition occurs on the completion of a sale between a willing buyer and a willing seller.
Any investment properties on which contracts for sale have been exchanged but which had not completed at the period end are disclosed as properties held for sale and stated at fair value.
g Investments Investments in any unquoted indirect property funds are recognised and derecognised on the trade date, and are initially measured at fair value.
Investments in any unquoted indirect property funds are financial instruments and are classied on initial recognition as fair value through profit or loss given that their fair value can be reliably determined based on the criteria set out in IAS 39.
Financial assets designated as fair value through profit or loss are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Accounting standards recognise a hierarchy of fair value measurements for financial instruments which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3.
The classication of financial instruments depends on the lowest significant applicable input, as follows: Level 1 Unadjusted, fully accessible and current quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Examples of such instruments would be investments listed or quoted on any recognised stock exchange.
The fair value of the interest-bearing bonds issued by the Company, as disclosed in note 13, is included in Level 1.
Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, or other directly or indirectly observable inputs which exist for the duration of the period of investment.
Examples of such instruments would be those for which the quoted price has been suspended, forward exchange contracts and certain other derivative instruments.
The interest rate swap entered into to hedge the interest rate on the 50 million bank loan and the forward interest rate swap are included in Level 2.
Level 3 External inputs are unobservable.
Value is the Directors best estimate, based on advice from relevant knowledgeable experts, use of recognised valuation techniques and on assumptions as to what inputs other market participants would apply in pricing the same or similar instrument.
All investments in direct property, and any investments in indirect property funds, would be included in Level 3.
The Company measures financial instruments and non-financial assets, such as investment properties, at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost, if any, are disclosed in note 18.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
h Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its risk associated with interest rate uctuations.
The Groups policy is not to trade in derivative instruments.
Derivative instruments are initially recognised in the Balance Sheet at their fair value.
Fair value is determined by a model using market values for similar instruments.
Transaction costs are expensed immediately.
Gains or losses arising on the fair value of cash ow hedges in the form of derivative instruments are taken directly to Other Comprehensive Income.
Such gains and losses are taken to the Hedging Reserve.
On maturity or early redemption the unrealised gains or losses arising from cash ow hedges in the form of derivative instruments, initially recognised in Other Comprehensive Income, are reclassied to profit or loss.

Accounting policies continued h Derivative financial instruments continued The Group considers that its interest rate swaps qualify for hedge accounting when the following criteria are satisfied: The instruments must be related to an asset or liability: They must change the character of the interest rate by converting a variable rate to a xed rate or vice versa: They must match the principal amounts and maturity dates of the hedged items: and As cash-ow hedges the forecast transactions incurring interest payable on the bank loans that are subject to the hedges must be highly probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash ows that could ultimately affect the profit or loss.
The effectiveness of the hedges must be capable of reliable measurement and must be assessed as highly effective on an ongoing basis throughout the financial reporting periods for which the hedges were designated.
i Cash and cash equivalents Cash in banks and short-term deposits are carried at cost.
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in hand and short-term deposits in banks with an original maturity of three months or less.
j Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which are generally due for settlement at the relevant quarter end, are recognised and carried at the original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identied.
Reverse lease premia and other capital incentives paid to tenants are recognised as a current asset and amortised over the period from the date of lease commencement to the earliest termination date.
k Interest-bearing borrowings All non-current borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being fair value of the consideration received, net of arrangement costs associated with the borrowings.
After initial recognition, all interest-bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any loan arrangement costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Fees 2013 2012 000 000 a Investment management fee base management fee 3,731 3,494 performance fee 2,571 2,500 6,302 5,994 Throughout the year the Groups investment manager was F&C Investment Business Limited FCIB, a wholly-owned subsidiary of F&C Asset Management plc.
The property management arrangements of the Group have been delegated by FCIB, with the approval of the Company, to F&C REIT Property Asset Management plc, which is also part of the F&C Asset Management plc group.
FCIB is entitled to a base management fee of 0.50 per cent per annum of the Groups net assets and reduced to 0.25 per cent per annum on cash net of gearing in excess of 5 per cent of net assets, payable quarterly in arrears.
The fees of any managing agents appointed by the investment managers are payable out of the management fee.
FCIB is also entitled to a performance fee equal to 20 per cent of the amount by which the total return whether positive or negative on the directly held properties exceeds 110 per cent of the total return 90 per cent if the total return is negative on the benchmark and multiplied by the Groups average total assets excluding any indirect property holdings.
The benchmark for measuring the comparative performance of directly held properties is the total return from the IPD Quarterly Universe.
The performance fee payable in each financial year is capped at an amount which, when taken with the aggregate base management fee payable in each financial year, equals 0.60 per cent of the gross assets of the Group.
Performance fees in excess of this capped return can be carried forward for up to two subsequent financial years subject to the annual 0.60 per cent cap.
The performance fee is measured over a rolling three year period and the performance fee payable in respect of any one financial year is equal to the total performance fee earned over that three year period less any performance fees already paid in the previous two years.
In the event that the amount already paid in the previous two years is in excess of the amount earned over the rolling three year period, such excess shall be repaid to the Group by FCIB.

Fees continued The performance fee is accrued based on the relative performance of the directly held properties at the balance sheet date up to a maximum of the capped amount in any financial year.
No recognition is made of any excess paid by the Group in the previous two years until the Groups entitlement to any repayment is certain.
FCIB is also entitled to an administration fee which is payable quarterly in arrears.
It received 140,000 for administration services provided in respect of the year ended 31 December 2013 2012: 138,000.
The investment management agreement may be terminated by either party by giving not less than six months notice.
The agreement may be terminated earlier provided that a payment in lieu of notice, equivalent to the amount FCIB would otherwise have received during the notice period, is made.
b Valuers fees The valuers of the investment properties, CBRE Limited, have agreed to provide valuation services in respect of the property portfolio.
The valuation agreement is for a xed term to 30 September 2014 and an annual fee is payable equal to 0.01 per cent of the aggregate value of the direct property portfolio.
Other expenses 2013 2012 000 000 Direct operating expenses of let rental property 5,209 4,252 Valuation and other professional fees 528 474 Directors fees 240 225 Administration fee 140 138 Auditors remuneration for: statutory audit 65 63 audit-related services 13 19 Other 607 478 6,802 5,649 An analysis of the Directors fees is provided in the Directors Emoluments for the Year table within the Remuneration Report on page 27.

Taxation 2013 2012 000 000 Current income tax Current income tax charge 239 233 Adjustment to provision for prior years 39 Total tax charge 278 233 A reconciliation of the income tax charge applicable to the results at the statutory income tax rate to the charge for the year is as follows: 2013 2012 000 000 profit before taxation 92,263 30,367 UK income tax at a rate of 20 per cent 18,453 6,073 Effects of: Capital gains losses on investment properties not taxable 13,313 203 Income not taxable, including interest receivable 192 106 Expenditure not allowed for income tax purposes 3,220 3,187 Allowable intercompany loan interest paid 8,685 8,999 Losses carried forward to future years 858 45 Capital allowances claimed 102 170 Adjustment to provision for prior years 39 Total tax charge 278 233 The Company and its subsidiaries are exempt from Guernsey taxation under the Income Tax Exempt Bodies Guernsey Ordinance, 1989.
A xed annual fee of 600 per company is payable to the States of Guernsey in respect of this exemption.
No charge to Guernsey taxation will arise on capital gains.
The Directors intend to conduct the Groups affairs such that management and control is not exercised in the United Kingdom and so that neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries carries on any trade in the United Kingdom.
Accordingly, the Company and its subsidiaries will not be liable for United Kingdom taxation on their income or gains other than certain income deriving from a United Kingdom source.
The Group had unutilised tax losses carried forward of 9,731,000 2012: 4,609,000 at 31 December 2013.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised on this amount as it is uncertain that there will be taxable profits arising within the relevant subsidiary from which the future reversal of the deferred tax asset could be deducted.
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to United Kingdom income tax on income arising on the property portfolio after deduction of its allowable debt nancing costs and other allowable expenses.

The twelfth, and last, interim dividend in respect of the year, of 0.5p per share, will be paid on 30 April 2014 to shareholders on the register on 11 April 2014.
Although these payments relate to the year ended 31 December 2013, under IFRS they will be accounted for in the year ending 31 December 2014, being the period during which they are paid.
It is the Directors intention that the Company will continue to pay dividends monthly.
Earnings per share The Groups basic and diluted earnings per Ordinary Share are based on the profit for the year of 91,985,000 2012: 30,134,000 and on 756,792,414 2012: 714,924,384 Ordinary Shares, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.

All the Groups investment properties were valued as at 31 December 2013 by RICS Registered Valuers working for the company of CBRE Limited CBRE, commercial real estate advisors, acting in the capacity of external valuers.
All such valuers are Chartered Surveyors, being members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS.
CBRE completed the valuation of the Groups investment properties at 31 December 2013 on a fair value basis and in accordance with The RICS Valuation Professional Standards 2012.
The CBRE valuation report is dated 20 January 2014 the Valuation Report.
Fair value is the amount for which the assets could be exchanged at the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms length transaction after proper marketing and where the parties had acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.
The fair value of these investment properties per the Valuation Report amounted to 927,940,000 2012: 879,690,000.
The difference between the Valuation Report and the closing fair value of investment properties disclosed above of 914,183,000 2012: 869,147,000 consists of capital incentives paid to tenants totalling 4,284,000 and accrued income relating to the pre-payment for rent free periods recognised over the life of the lease totalling 9,473,000, which are both separately recorded in the accounts as current assets within trade and other receivables.
The Valuation Report is signed by David M. Tudor, MRICS who has been the signatory of valuation reports provided to the Group for the same purpose as the Valuation Report for a continuous period since December 2011.
CBRE has been carrying out valuations for the Group for the same purpose as the Valuation Report for the same period.
CBRE also values properties held by other companies for which the F&C Asset Management plc group is also the investment manager.
CBRE provides, and has provided in the past, ad hoc investment and occupational agency advice, landlord and tenant and building consultancy advice to members of the F&C Asset Management plc group.
The proportion of total fees payable by the F&C Asset Management plc group to the total fee income of CBRE was less than 5 per cent of total UK revenues.
The property valuer is independent and external to the Group.
The property valuer takes account of deleterious materials included in the construction of the investment properties in arriving at its estimate of fair value, when the Managers advise the presence of such materials.
All leasehold properties are carried at fair value rather than amortised over the term of the lease.
The same valuation criteria are therefore applied to leasehold as freehold properties.
All leasehold properties have more than 60 years remaining on the lease term.
The Group has entered into leases on its property portfolio as lessor see note 20 for further information.
No one property accounts for more than 15 per cent of the gross assets of the Group.
All of the properties per fair value band are shown on page 17.
There are no restrictions on the realisability of the Groups investment properties or on the remittance of income or proceeds of disposal.
However, the Groups investments comprise UK commercial property, which may be difficult to realise as described in Liquidity Risk in note 18.

Investment properties continued Other than the capital commitments and forward commitment to purchase disclosed in note 19, the Group is under no contractual obligations to purchase, construct or develop any investment property.
The majority of leases are on a full repairing basis and, as such, the Group is not liable for costs in respect of repairs, maintenance or enhancements to those investment properties.
All investment properties are categorised as Level 3 fair values as they use significant unobservable inputs.
There have not been any transfers between Levels during the year.
Investment properties have been classed according to their real estate sector.
Information on these significant unobservable inputs per class of investment property is disclosed below: Valuation Valuation significant Weighted Sector 000 Technique Assumption Range Average Retail 274,975 All Risks Yield Current Rental Value per square foot psf per annum 11 - 44 36 Estimated Rental Value psf per annum 19 - 98 43 Initial Yield 0.4% - 6.0% 4.4% Equivalent Yield 3.0% - 6.4% 4.9% Estimated capital value per square foot 267 - 3,030 1,020 Retail Warehouse 192,000 All Risks Yield Current Rental Value psf per annum 14 - 24 20 Estimated Rental Value psf per annum 14 - 28 24 Initial Yield 3.1% - 6.9% 4.8% Equivalent Yield 5.1% - 6.9% 5.5% Estimated capital value per square foot 189 - 449 407 Ofce 296,360 All Risks Yield Current Rental Value psf per annum 4 - 62 38 Estimated Rental Value psf per annum 15 - 75 43 Initial Yield 1.5% - 12.6% 5.0% Equivalent Yield 4.1% - 9.2% 5.8% Estimated capital value per square foot 122 - 1,652 840 Industrial, logistics and other 164,605 All Risks Yield Current Rental Value psf per annum 0 - 13 6 Estimated Rental Value psf per annum 4 - 13 7 Initial Yield 2.7% - 12.6% 5.9% Equivalent Yield 6.6% - 13.5% 7.5% Estimated capital value per square foot 47 - 220 93 The ranges are based on averages per property.

Investment properties continued For the majority of properties the fair value was determined by using the market comparable method.
This means that valuations performed by CBRE are based on inputs determined from active markets, adjusted for differences in the nature, location or condition of the specic property.
Most valuations are based on initial yield, although equivalent yield may also be taken into consideration.
Where properties are vacant at the date of valuation a comparable capital value per square foot is used.
In determining the net initial yield, or capital value per square foot, the valuers may have regard to the terms of any existing lease including current rental values, lease length and covenant strength, along with assumptions regarding estimated rental values, rental growth rates, vacancy rates and void or rent free periods expected after the end of each lease.
The highest and best use of the properties do not differ from their current use.
Sensitivity analysis The valuations of investment properties are sensitive to changes in the assumed significant unobservable inputs.
A significant increase decrease in estimated rental values in isolation would result in a signicantly higher lower fair value of the properties.
A significant increase decrease in the all risks yield in isolation would result in a signicantly lower higher fair value.
There are interrelationships between the yields and rental values as they are partially determined by market rate conditions.
The sensitivity of the valuation to changes in the most significant inputs per class of investment property are shown below: Industrial, Estimated movement in fair value Retail Logistics of investment properties at Retail Warehouses Ofces and other Total 31 December 2013 arising from: 000 000 000 000 000 Increase in rental value by 5% 13,749 9,600 14,818 8,230 46,397 Decrease in rental value by 5% 13,749 9,600 14,818 8,230 46,397 Increase in initial yield by 0.25% 14,782 9,527 14,101 6,644 45,054 Decrease in initial yield by 0.25% 16,562 10,577 15,584 7,227 49,950 10.

The bonds carry interest at a xed rate of 5.23 per cent per annum and have an expected maturity date of 30 June 2015.
If the bonds are not redeemed at this date they will carry interest at 0.60 per cent over six-month LIBOR until the final maturity date of 30 June 2017.
These bonds are secured by means of a xed and oating charge over the whole of the assets of the Secured Group which comprises FCPT Holdings Limited, F&C Commercial Property Holdings Limited and F&C Commercial Property Finance Limited.
Under the covenants relating to the bonds the Company is to ensure that for the Secured Group: the loan to value percentage remains less than, or equal to, 50 per cent dened as financial indebtedness expressed as a percentage of gross secured asset value : the secured loan to value percentage remains less than, or equal to, 40 per cent dened as the principal amount outstanding on the bonds expressed as a percentage of gross secured asset value : the interest cover ratio is greater than 1.5 times on any calculation date: payments are not made in respect of shares unless the ratio of free cash ow to interest is greater than 2.0 times and, after deduction of an amount equal to the proposed payment, greater than 1.75 times: no single property measured by market value accounts for more than 15 per cent of the gross asset value: the sector weightings measured by market value do not exceed the following percentages of the gross asset value: All industrial: 40 per cent: All ofce: 50 per cent: All retail: 65 per cent: the five largest properties measured by market value do not exceed 40 per cent of the gross asset value: no single tenant exceeds 15 per cent of the total annual net rental income from the properties: the five largest tenants do not exceed 40 per cent of the total annual net rental income from the properties: and short leasehold properties measured by market value do not exceed 10 per cent of the gross asset value.
The Secured Group has complied with all the bond covenants during the year.
The fair value of the interest-bearing bonds based on mid-market price at 31 December 2013 was 241,247,000 2012: 242,008,000.
The fair value of the interest-bearing bonds is classied as Level 1 under the hierarchy of fair value measurements.

The loan facility is repayable on 28 June 2017.
Interest accrues on the bank loan at a variable rate, based on 3 month LIBOR plus margin and mandatory lending costs, and is payable quarterly.
The margin is 1.95 per cent per annum for the duration of the loan.
This bank loan is secured by way of a xed and oating charge over the whole of the assets of SCP Estate Holdings Limited and SCP Estate Limited the SCP Group, whose assets consist mainly of the properties held at St. Christophers Place Estate, London W1.
In addition, the SCP Group has granted security to Barclays pursuant to Guernsey security interest agreements over bank accounts and shares.
Under the bank covenants related to this loan, the Company is to ensure that for the SCP Group: the loan to value percentage does not exceed 60 per cent: and the interest cover is greater than 1.4 times on any calculation date.
The SCP Group has complied with all the bank loan covenants during the year.
Interest rate exposure has been hedged by the purchase of an interest rate swap contract.
The hedge has been achieved by matching the notional amount of the swap with the loan principal and matching the swap term to the loan term.
Interest on the swap is receivable at a variable rate calculated on the same LIBOR basis as for the bank loan as detailed above but excluding the margin and payable quarterly at a xed rate of 2.9265 per cent per annum.
The interest rate swap is due to expire on 28 June 2017.
The fair value of the liability in respect of the interest rate swap contract at 31 December 2013 was 2,378,000 2012: 4,654,000, which is based on the marked to market value.
The interest rate swap is classied as Level 2 under the hierarchy of fair value measurements.
30 million bank loan 2015 On 31 July 2012 the Group entered into a 30 million committed facility with Barclays which remained undrawn throughout the year.
The loan facility is repayable on 30 June 2015.
For the period it remains undrawn, a commitment fee of 1.35 per cent per annum is payable on this facility.
Once drawn interest will accrue on the bank loan at a variable rate, based on 3 month LIBOR plus margin and mandatory lending costs and is payable quarterly.
The margin is 2.70 per cent per annum for the duration of the drawn loan.
The facility is expected to be drawn on purchase of the later of blocks 1 and 2, Prime Four Business Park, Kingswells, Aberdeen see note 19 for further details on this forward commitment.
The bank loan is secured by way of a xed and oating charge over the properties held at St. Christophers Place Estate, London W1 and the whole of the assets of Prime Four Limited, whose assets are expected to include certain of the properties to be purchased at Prime Four Business Park.
Under the bank covenants related to this loan, the Company is to ensure that for Prime Four Limited: the loan to value percentage does not exceed 60 per cent: and the interest cover is greater than 2.75 times on any calculation date.
Interest rate exposure has been hedged by the purchase of a forward interest rate swap contract.
The forward starting swap can commence at any point between 22 October 2013 and 31 July 2014.
The hedge has been achieved by matching the notional amount of the swap with the loan principal and the swap term is expected to match the drawn loan term.

Share premium The surplus of net proceeds received from the issue of new shares over the par value of such shares is credited to this account.
Reverse acquisition reserve Created as a result of the Group reconstruction in July 2009 to reect the difference arising between the total of the issued share capital including the Capital Redemption Reserve immediately before and after the reconstruction.
Special reserve The Special Reserve was created by the cancellation of FCPT Holdings Limiteds Share Premium Account by the Royal Court of Guernsey in July 2005 and a subsequent smaller cancellation in March 2008.
In addition, approval of the Royal Court of Guernsey was received in March 2008 to reduce the nominal value of the Ordinary Shares from 90p to 1p, resulting in an amount of 679.6 million being transferred from Share Capital to the Special Reserve.
It is a distributable reserve to be used for all purposes permitted under Guernsey law, including the buy back of shares and the payment of dividends.
The costs of the Group reconstruction during 2009 which related directly to the issue of new Ordinary Shares were charged to the Special Reserve.
Capital reserve investments sold The following are accounted for in this reserve: gains and losses on the disposal of investments and investment properties, including the transfer of any unrealised gains or losses now realised which were previously recognised through Capital Reserve Investments Held: and the buy back of shares up to the balance on this reserve, thereafter any buy back of shares is charged to the Special Reserve.

Related party transactions The Directors are considered to be the Groups key management personnel.
No Director has an interest in any transactions which are, or were, unusual in their nature or significant to the nature of the Group.
At 31 December 2013 Resolution Limited, through a number of subsidiaries, owned 26.8 per cent of the Companys ordinary share capital 2012: 31.2 per cent.

Mr Niven ceased his role on 1 January 2014 and no longer has any relationships with Resolution Limited.
The Directors consider Resolution Limited to be a related party of the Company.
The Directors of the Company received fees for their services.
Further details are provided in the Directors Emoluments for the Year table in the Remuneration Report on page 27.
No fees remained payable at the year end.
Financial instruments The Companys investment objective is to provide ordinary shareholders with an attractive level of income together with the potential for capital and income growth from investing in a diversied UK commercial property portfolio.
Consistent with that objective, the Group holds UK commercial property investments.
In addition, the Groups financial instruments comprise interest-bearing bonds, an interest-bearing bank loan, cash and receivables and payables that arise directly from its operations.
The Group does not have exposure to any derivative instruments other than the interest rate swaps entered into to hedge the interest paid on the interest-bearing bank loan and facility.
The Group is exposed to various types of risk that are associated with financial instruments.
The most important types are credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and market price risk.
There is no foreign currency risk as all assets and liabilities of the Group are maintained in pounds sterling.

Financial instruments continued The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing the Groups risk exposure.
These policies are summarised below and have remained unchanged for the year under review.
These disclosures include, where appropriate, consideration of the Groups investment properties which, whilst not constituting financial instruments as dened by IFRS, are considered by the Board to be integral to the Groups overall risk exposure.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or counterparty will be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the Group.
In the event of default by an occupational tenant, the Group will suffer a rental shortfall and incur additional costs, including legal expenses, in maintaining, insuring and re-letting the property.
The Board receives regular reports on concentrations of risk and any tenants in arrears.
The Managers monitor such reports in order to anticipate, and minimise the impact of, defaults by occupational tenants.
The Group has a diversied tenant portfolio.
The maximum credit risk from the rent receivables of the Group at 31 December 2013 was 926,000 2012: 1,536,000.
The maximum credit risk is stated after deducting the bad debt provision of 577,000 2012: 440,000.
As at 31 December 2013, rent receivable of 577,000 that was greater than three months overdue was fully provided for.
As at 31 December 2012 the provision was 440,000.
Of this amount 210,000 was subsequently written off, 147,000 is still outstanding and 83,000 was recovered.
Apart from the rent receivable disclosed above there were no financial assets which were either past due or considered impaired at 31 December 2013 2012: nil.
All of the Groups cash is placed with financial institutions with a long-term credit rating of A or better.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of such financial institutions may cause the Groups ability to access cash placed on deposit to be delayed or limited.
Should the credit quality or the financial position of the banks currently employed signicantly deteriorate, cash holdings would be moved to another bank.
During the year and the prior year, due to the quantum of cash balances held, counterparty risk was spread by placing cash across a number of different financial institutions.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter in realising assets or otherwise raising funds to meet financial commitments.
The Groups investments comprise UK commercial property.
Property and property-related assets in which the Group invests are not traded in an organised public market and may be illiquid.
As a result, the Group may not be able to liquidate quickly its investments in these properties at an amount close to their fair value in order to meet its liquidity requirements.
The Groups liquidity risk is managed on an ongoing basis by the Managers and monitored on a quarterly basis by the Board.
In order to mitigate liquidity risk the Group aims to have sufficient cash balances including the expected proceeds of any property sales to meet its obligations for a period of at least twelve months.

The exact amount attributable to each of the interest-bearing 50 million bank loan and the related interest rate swap will vary depending on the rate of 3 month LIBOR over the instruments duration.
The terms of both the interest-bearing bank loan and the interest rate swap are detailed in note 14.
The total amount due to Barclays under the interest-bearing 30 million bank facility, which was undrawn at the year end, and the related forward interest rate swap, includes both the commitment fee payable under the facility and the expected payments due under the swap, commencing on the forward starting date, based on the rate of 3 month LIBOR as at 31 December 2013.
This assumes the facility remains undrawn for the full period until expiry on 30 June 2015.
In certain circumstances, the terms of the Groups listed bonds interest-bearing bank loan entitle the bondholders bank to require early repayment and, in such circumstances, the Groups ability to maintain dividend levels and the net asset value attributable to the Ordinary Shares could be adversely affected.
The Groups investments may, from time to time, include investments in indirect property funds which are not traded in an organised public market and which generally may be illiquid.
As a result, similar to the directly-held properties, the Group may not be able to liquidate quickly some of its investments in those instruments in order to meet its liquidity requirements.
As at 31 December 2013 the Group did not hold any investments in indirect property funds 2012: nil.
Interest rate risk Some of the Groups financial instruments are interest-bearing.
They are a mix of both xed and variable rate instruments with differing maturities.
As a consequence, the Group is exposed to interest rate risk due to uctuations in the prevailing market rate.

Financial instruments continued The Groups exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to its long-term debt obligations.
Interest rate risk on long-term debt obligations is managed by xing the interest rate on such borrowings, either directly or through interest rate swaps for the same notional value and duration.
Long-term debt obligations and the interest rate risk they confer to the Group is considered by the Board on a quarterly basis.
Long-term debt obligations consist of 230 million Secured Bonds due 2017 on which the rate has been xed at 5.23 per cent until the expected maturity date of 30 June 2015.
If the bonds are not redeemed at this date they will carry interest at 0.6 per cent over LIBOR until the final maturity date of 30 June 2017.
The Group has a 50 million interest-bearing bank loan on which the rate has been xed through an interest rate swap at 4.88 per cent per annum until the maturity date of 28 June 2017.
The Group has entered into a forward interest rate window swap, commencing between 31 December 2013 and 31 July 2014, at the option of the Group, with a nominal value of 30 million and a maturity date of 30 June 2015.
This swap will be used to x the interest rate on the 30 million interest-bearing bank loan facility which is expected to be used to partially fund a property purchase at Prime Four Business Park, Kingswells, Aberdeen see note 19.
The forward interest rate swap would x the interest rate on the loan at 3.71 per cent per annum until the maturity date of 30 June 2015.
The following table sets out the carrying amount of the Groups financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk: Assets Weighted liabilities Weighted average where no average period for Fixed Variable interest is interest which rate Total rate rate received rate is xed Type 000 000 000 000 % years As at 31 December 2013 Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 160,937 5,616 155,321 0.38 0.8 Cash deposits held for tenants 2,364 2,364 Rents receivable 926 926 Financial liabilities 5.23 per cent Secured Bonds due 2017 229,811 229,811 5.29 1.5 Bank loan and interest rate swaps 51,610 51,585 25 4.88 3.5 As at 31 December 2012 Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 153,143 30,575 122,568 0.60 0.3 Cash deposits held for tenants 2,761 2,761 Rents receivable 1,536 1,536 Financial liabilities 5.23 per cent Secured Bonds due 2017 229,675 229,675 5.29 2.5 Bank loan and interest rate swaps 53,819 53,753 66 4.88 4.5 Apart from the 5.23 per cent Secured Bonds as disclosed in note 13, the fair value of financial assets and liabilities is not materially different from their carrying value in the financial statements.
Considering the effect on the Secured Bonds, it is estimated that an increase of 150 basis points in interest rates as at the balance sheet date would have decreased their fair value by approximately 5,102,000 2012: 8,175,000, and a decrease of 150 basis points would have increased their fair value by approximately 5,291,000 2012: 8,595,000.
The carrying value of the Secured Bonds in the financial statements would have remained unchanged.
Considering the effect on the 50 million bank loan and related interest rate swap combined, it is estimated that an increase of 150 basis points in interest rates as at the balance sheet date would have decreased their fair value by approximately 2,403,000 2012: 3,107,000, and a decrease of 150 basis points would have increased their fair value by approximately 2,562,000 2012: 3,359,000.
The carrying value of the interest rate swap liability in the financial statements would have been adjusted by these amounts, thereby increasing decreasing net assets and income for the year.

Financial instruments continued Considering the effect on the forward interest rate swap, it is estimated that an increase of 150 basis points in interest rates as at the balance sheet date would have decreased its fair value by 400,000 2012: 394,000, and a decrease of 150 basis points would have increased its fair value by approximately 415,000 2012: 421,000.
The carrying value of the forward interest rate swap liability in the financial statements would have been adjusted by these amounts, thereby increasing decreasing net assets and income for the year.
When the Group retains cash balances, they are ordinarily held on interest-bearing deposit accounts.
The benchmark which determines the interest income received on interest-bearing cash balances is the bank base rate which was 0.5 per cent as at 31 December 2013 2012: 0.5 per cent.
The Companys policy is to hold cash in variable rate or short-term xed rate bank accounts and not usually in xed rate securities with a term greater than three months.
Considering the effect on cash balances, an increase of 150 basis points in interest rates would have increased net assets and income for the year by 2,414,000 2012: 2,297,000.
A decrease of 150 basis points would have had an equal but opposite effect.
The calculations are based on the cash balances at the respective balance sheet dates.
Market price risk The Groups strategy for the management of market price risk is driven by the investment policy as outlined within the Business Model and Strategy on page 7.
The management of market price risk is part of the investment management process and is typical of commercial property investment.
The portfolio is managed with an awareness of the effects of adverse valuation movements through detailed and continuing analysis, with an objective of maximising overall returns to shareholders.
Investments in property and property-related assets are inherently difficult to value due to the individual nature of each property.
As a result, valuations are subject to substantial uncertainty.
There is no assurance that the estimates resulting from the valuation process will reect the actual sales price even where such sales occur shortly after the valuation date.
Such risk is minimised through the appointment of external property valuers.
The basis of valuation of the property portfolio is set out in detail in the accounting policies and note 9.
The Group may also hold investments in indirect property funds including listed property companies which in turn invest directly in commercial property.
In addition to the price risk attaching to the underlying assets, such funds also carry the risk that the investment cannot be disposed of at its net asset value due to a lack of liquidity.
The Company did not hold any investments in indirect property funds at 31 December 2013 or 31 December 2012.
Any changes in market conditions will directly affect the profit or loss reported through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Details of the Groups investment property portfolio held at the balance sheet date are disclosed on page 17.
A 15 per cent increase in the fair value of the direct properties at 31 December 2013 would have increased net assets and income for the year by 137,127,000 2012: 130,372,000.
A decrease of 15 per cent would have had an equal but opposite effect.
The calculations above are based on the investment property valuations at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole.
Capital commitments and post-balance sheet events The Group had capital commitments totalling 17,901,000 as at 31 December 2013 2012: 11,379,000.
These commitments related mainly to expected property purchases at Oakenshaw Road, Solihull 4,500,000 and 1 Barrett Street, London W1 6,275,000 along with other development work relating to the existing property portfolio, mainly at Solihull, Sears Retail Park.
Deposits relating to expected purchases totalling 5,128,000 were paid into escrow accounts prior to the year end are included in trade and other receivables.
The purchase at Oakenshaw Road, Solihull subsequently completed on 8 January 2014.
In addition to the capital commitments above, the Group had agreed a forward commitment to purchase four pre-let ofce blocks situated in Prime Four Business Park, Kingswells, Aberdeen for approximately 95 million, plus costs.
These ofce blocks remained under development at 31 December 2013.
The purchases of Blocks 1 and 2 subsequently completed during March 2014 for a combined cost of 65.0 million, with the consideration falling payable on completion of the development of each block.
The Groups 30 million loan facility see note 14 was drawn down on 20 March 2014 and used to partially finance the latter purchase.
Blocks 3 and 4 are expected to be purchased later in April 2014 for a cost of around 30.4 million.
The overall net initial yield for all four Blocks is 6.8 per cent.

Lease length The Group leases out its investment properties under operating leases.
The total future income based on the unexpired lessor lease length at the year end was as follows based on annual rentals : 2013 2012 000 000 Less than one year 51,025 52,152 Between two and five years 149,456 162,143 Over five years 159,340 154,301 Total 359,821 368,596 The largest single tenant at the year end accounted for 6.0 per cent 2012: 5.8 per cent of the current annual rental income.
Unoccupied property expressed as a percentage of estimated total rental value excluding properties under development was 6.0 per cent 2012: 7.0 per cent at the year end.
The Group has entered into commercial property leases on its investment property portfolio.
These properties, held under operating leases, are measured under the fair value model as the properties are held to earn rentals.
The majority of these non-cancellable leases have remaining non-cancellable lease terms of more than five years.
Operating segments The Board has considered the requirements of IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
The Board is of the view that the Group is engaged in a single segment of business, being property investment, and in one geographical area, the United Kingdom, and that therefore the Group has only a single operating segment.
The Board of Directors, as a whole, has been identified as constituting the chief operating decision maker of the Group.
The key measure of performance used by the Board to assess the Groups performance is the total return on the Groups net asset value.
As the total return on the Groups net asset value is calculated based on the net asset value per share calculated under IFRS as shown at the foot of the Balance Sheet, assuming dividends are re-invested, the key performance measure is that prepared under IFRS.
Therefore no reconciliation is required between the measure of profit or loss used by the Board and that contained in the financial statements.
The view that the Group is engaged in a single segment of business is based on the following considerations: one of the key financial indicators received and reviewed by the Board is the total return from the property portfolio taken as a whole.
there is no active allocation of resources to particular types or groups of properties in order to try to match the asset allocation of the benchmark.
the management of the portfolio is delegated to a single property manager, F&C REIT.
