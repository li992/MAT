Derivatives and financial instruments continued The fair value of all other assets and liabilities in notes 16, 18 and 19 is not significantly different from their carrying amount, with the exception of the 200m sterling 7.5 year bond which has a fair value of 216.6m 2012: 212.7m but is carried at its amortised cost of 200.0m.
The fair value of the 200m sterling 7.5 year bond has been determined by reference to the price available from the market on which the bond is traded.
The fuel price derivatives and interest rate swaps were valued externally by the respective banks by comparison with the market fuel price for the relevant date.
All other fair values shown above have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
As at 29 June 2013, the Group has used a level 2 valuation technique to determine the fair value of all financial instruments.
During the year ended 29 June 2013, there were no transfers between valuation levels.
Hedging activities Fuel derivatives The Group is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of fuel usage.
The Group closely monitors fuel prices and uses fuel derivatives to hedge its exposure to increases in fuel prices, when it deems this to be appropriate.
At the year end, the Group had various fuel price swaps in place.
For the 2014, 2015 and 2016 financial years cashflow hedges were placed over 130, 66 and 31 million litres of fuel respectively.
The fair value of the asset or liability has been recognised on the balance sheet.
The value has been generated since the date of the acquisition of the instruments due to the movement in market fuel prices.
As at 29 June 2013 the Group had derivatives against bus fuel of 126 million litres for the year ending 28 June 2014, representing approximately 100% of the anticipated fuel usage in our bus division.
As at 29 June 2013 the Group also had derivatives against bus fuel for the 2015 and 2016 financial years of 62 and 31 million litres respectively.
As at 29 June 2013 the Group had derivatives against rail fuel of 4 million litres for the year ending 28 June 2014, representing the anticipated fuel usage in London Midland and Southern.
As at 29 June 2013 the Group also had further derivatives for the 2015 financial year of 4 million litres against rail fuel.
The Groups hedging policy for the target percentage of anticipated bus fuel usage hedged for the next year and subsequent two years is as follows: 2014 2015 2016 Percentage to hedge as per Group policy 100.0% 50.0% 25.0% Actual percentage hedged 100.0% 50.0% 25.0% 8LI S %LIEH VSYT TPG %RRYEP 6ITSVX ERH %GGSYRXW
