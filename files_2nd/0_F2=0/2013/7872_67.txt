We therefore designated the assets and liabilities of these businesses as held for sale from 6 March 2013, the date at which these criteria were met.

On 15 October 2013 final Board approval was given and an agreement was signed for the sale of these businesses on this date, which subsequently completed on 1 January 2014.
