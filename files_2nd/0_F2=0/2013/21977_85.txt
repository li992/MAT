Under the 2006 Act, the Memorandum of Association serves a more limited role as historical evidence of the formation of the company.
Since August 2010, the provisions in relation to objects in BTs Memorandum are deemed to form part of BTs Articles, and have been deleted from those Articles because of shareholders passing a resolution to this effect.
Under the 2006 Act, BTs objects are unrestricted.
