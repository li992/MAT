SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS During the period there were three classes of equity-settled employee share incentive plans outstanding: a Save As You Earn SAYE.
Under this scheme employees enter into a savings contract for a period of three to seven years and options are granted on commencement of the contract, exercisable using the amount saved under the contract at the time it terminates.
Options under the scheme are granted at a discount of 20% to the market price of the shares at the time of the invitation and are not subject to performance conditions.
Exercise of options is subject to continued employment.
b Executive Share Option Plan ESOP.
Under this scheme executive share options are awarded at the prevailing market rate on the date of grant.
Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years after grant and upon the achievement of performance criteria in relation to earnings per share.
c Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
Under this scheme nil cost options are granted that will only vest provided the participant satisfies the minimum shareholding requirement and performance conditions relating to earnings per share, as set out in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 48, are met.
In 2010, HM Revenue & Customs HMRC approved an Approved Performance Share Plan APSP to enable participants in the LTIP to benefit from UK tax efficiencies.
As such, awards made in 2010 and future years comprise an HMRC approved option in respect of the first 30,000 worth of an award and an unapproved LTIP award for amounts in excess of this HMRC limit.
A further share award a linked award is also provided to enable participants to fund the exercise of the approved option.
This linked award is satisfied by way of shares from the Companys Employee Benefit Trust but these additional shares are not delivered to the participant.
Under these rules the LTIP options are still issued at nil cost to the employee.

The fair values of the SAYE, ESOP and LTIP rights are calculated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
The significant inputs into the model for all schemes unless otherwise stated were: 2013 2012 Dividend yield % 4.8 6.4 Expected volatility % 20.6 to 42.4 32.9 to 45.5 Risk free interest rate % 0.7 to 1.2 0.4 to 1.3 Expected life of rights SAYE 3 to 5 years 3 to 7 years LTIP 3 years 3 years The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the expected life of the rights.
The performance criteria of the ESOP and LTIP, as set out previously, are built into the pricing model.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the period in relation to the SAYE was 16.5p 2012: 14.5p.
The fair value of options granted during the period in relation to the LTIP was 127.1p 2012: 80.9p.
