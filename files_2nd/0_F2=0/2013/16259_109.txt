Financial statements Section 4: Financial position Section 4 contains financial statement notes that relate to the financial position of the Group at 31 December 2013, along with the relevant accounting policies.
4.1 Goodwill Accounting policy Goodwill is measured on acquisition as the excess of the aggregate of consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and in the case of business combinations achieved in stages the acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
If the initial amount of goodwill is negative, the amount is recognised in profit or loss as a gain on a bargain purchase.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment tests, the goodwill arising from each business combination is allocated to cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the combination and which represent the lowest level within the Group at which management monitors goodwill.
The impairment test requires the Group to estimate the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the goodwill relates: this is performed with the assistance of external advisors.
Recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
The value in use of a CGU is measured by discounting the estimated future cash flows of the CGU to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate.
Fair value less costs to sell is generally measured using an earnings multiple approach using revenue and EBITA multiples obtained from comparable businesses and transactions.
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill Goodwill is allocated and monitored by management at a CGU level, consisting of the five business units operating across the Groups operating segments.
Not all business units are active in all segments: there are 11 CGUs at 31 December 2013 2012: 29 CGUs.
The reduction in CGUs in 2013 is due to the Delta sale 12 CGUs, the UBM Channel sale three CGUs, the merger of UBM Techweb and UBM Electronics three CGUs and the merger of UBM Live and UBM Built Environment one CGU.
For reporting purposes, the CGUs have been aggregated into the reportable segments, as shown in the tables below.
The CGUs are individually tested for impairment each year.

Goodwill of 23.6m was transferred from the Data Services segment to the Other Marketing Services segment to be consistent with the product reporting, as described in Section 2: Segment information.
Impairment testing for these businesses was performed before the reallocation took place.
Impairment tests for goodwill For the years ended 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012, the carrying amount of each CGU excluding the Delta businesses in 2012 has been compared with its estimated value in use.
The UBM Tech Events and Print CGUs have been impaired by 3.1m and 0.7m respectively during the year as a result of the restructuring detailed in Note 3.5.
The UBM Electronics Events CGU was impaired by 1.0m during the year ended 31 December 2012.
The following key assumptions were used by management in the value in use calculations: Pre-tax discount rate % Perpetuity growth rate % Cash flow forecasts Events 2013: 13.313.9 2013: 2.02.2 Event revenue is expected to continue to grow with continued 2012: 11.313.9 2012: 0.72.5 expansion in Emerging Markets.

Continued expansion in high growth markets such as China.
Continued investment in products, IT technology and in sales and marketing to drive continued growth in the changing competitive and technological environments.
Forecast cash flows For each CGU, the forecast cash flows for the first five years are based on the most recent financial budgets and forecasts approved by management.
The forecast cash flows, budgets and forecasts are based on assumptions that reflect past experience, long-term trends, industry forecasts and growth rates and management estimates see above.
For each CGU, the forecast cash flows beyond the period covered by the most recent financial budgets and forecasts approved by management are based upon the weighted average projected real gross domestic product growth rate in 2018 of each of the territories in which the CGUs operate 2012: 2017.
Growth rates for each territory have been weighted based on contribution to 2014 budgeted revenue 2012: contribution to 2013 budgeted revenue.
The growth rates used in the value in use calculation range from 1.4% to 2.2% 2012: 0.7% to 2.5%, depending on the territories and industries in which each CGU operates.
UBM plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 83 Financial statements Section 4: Financial position continued 4.1 Goodwill continued Discount rate The discount rate for each CGU is based on the risk-free rate for 20 year US government bonds, adjusted for a risk premium to reflect the increased risk of investing in equities, the systemic risk of the specific CGU and taking into account the relative size of the CGU and the specific territories in which it operates.
The increased risk of investing in equities is assessed using an equity market risk premium which reflects the increased return required over and above a risk free rate by an investor who is investing in the whole market.
The equity market risk premium used is based on studies by independent economists and historical equity market risk premiums.
The risk adjustment for the systematic risk, beta, of the CGU reflects the risks specific to the CGU for which the forecast cash flows have not been adjusted.
The adjustment to the rate has been determined by management using an average of the betas of comparable companies within respective sectors.
Sensitivities As the UBM Tech Print CGU has been impaired to nil, no further impairment loss could be recognised through adverse changes in key assumptions.
Other than as disclosed below, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
The estimated recoverable amounts of UBM Connect Events and UBM Connect Online are not significantly higher than their carrying amounts.
The tables below show the goodwill in each CGU, the amount by which the recoverable amount of the CGU exceeds the carrying amount the headroom and the reasonably possible percentage changes needed in isolation in each of the key assumptions that would cause the recoverable amount of the CGU to be equal to its carrying amount.
The cash flow forecasts for 2013 and 2012 are expressed as the compound average growth rates in the initial five year forecasts used for the impairment testing.
