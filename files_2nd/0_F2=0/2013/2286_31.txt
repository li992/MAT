Business and geographical segments The Group has in excess of 190 locations across the world serving a range of market sectors with various thermal processing services.
The range and type of services offered is common to all market sectors.
In accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments, the segmentation of Group activity reflects the way the Group is managed by the chief operating decision maker, being the Group Chief Executive, who on a monthly basis reviews the operating performance of six operating segments, split between the Aerospace, Defence & Energy ADE and Automotive & General Industrial AGI business areas, as follows: ADE Western Europe: ADE North America: ADE Emerging markets: AGI Western Europe: AGI North America: and AGI Emerging markets.
The split of operating segments by geography reflects the divisional reporting structure of the Group.
In accordance with the aggregation criteria of IFRS 8, the operating segments are aggregated into the Groups two key business areas, ADE and AGI, the split being driven by customer behaviour and requirements.
Customers in the ADE segment tend to operate and purchase more globally and have long supply chains, whilst customers in the AGI segment tend to purchase more locally and have shorter supply chains.
Bodycote plants do not exclusively supply services to customers of a given market sector.
Allocations of plants between ADE and AGI is therefore derived by reference to the preponderance of markets served.

Goodwill continued The Group recorded a 4.5m adjustment to goodwill which relates to the confirmation of various preliminary estimates for acquisitions made in 2012.
The adjustments can be summarised as deferred tax adjustments as detailed in note 19, purchase price variances arising from the settlement of working capital balances against target working capital amounts and amendments to fixed asset values following receipt of detailed third party valuations as detailed in note 12.
The adjustments were made during the 12 month retrospective measurement period, as permitted by IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
These adjustments are not considered significant in relation to the financial statements.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the business units that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
After recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to the Groups operating segments as follows: 2013 2012 m m ADE: Western Europe 26.7 26.7 North America 44.7 44.9 AGI: Western Europe 17.6 17.4 North America 40.5 36.6 Emerging markets 6.2 6.2 135.7 131.8 The Group tests goodwill at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for those calculations are the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs in respect of future cash flows.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash generating units.
This rate is risk adjusted, for specific countries, where the Group perceives a risk premium is appropriate.
The rates used to discount the forecast cash flows for cash generating units are between 12.3% 2012: 11.3% and 14.3% 2012: 13.3%.
The recoverable amount is the sum of the discounted cash flows as forecasted for the coming five years, together with a further estimate of cashflows in perpetuity.
The forecasted sales reflect managements expectation of how sales will develop at this point in the economic cycle.
The expected profit margin reflects managements experience of each cash generating units profitability at the forecast level of sales.
As outlined in the Business review, these forecasts take into account the current and expected economic environment both in respect of geography and market sectors.
Cash flows after five years are based on an estimated growth rate of 3.1% 2012: 3.2%, being the historical weighted average growth in GDP in the markets that the Group operates in.
Growth rates by cash generating unit range from 2.75% to 6%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
If the goodwill allocated to a cash generating unit represents more than 15% of the Groups total goodwill carrying value then the cash generating unit is considered to be individually significant.
The Group considers the North America ADE Heat Treatment and North America AGI Heat Treatment cash generating units to be significant cash generating units.
The long term growth rates applied to cash flows after five years and the rates used to discount the forecast cash flows for these significant cash generating units are shown below: Goodwill carrying Long term Discount value growth rate rate Cash generating unit m % % North America ADE Heat Treatment 42.1 3.2 12.3 North America AGI Heat Treatment 40.5 3.2 12.3 The Group has conducted sensitivity analyses on the key assumptions applied to the value in use calculations for each cash generating unit.
A decline in sales of 10.9% per annum in perpetuity would result in the recoverable amount of goodwill for the Group being reduced to its carrying value.
The directors do not believe such a decline to be likely.
Declines in sales of 36.1% and 6.5% per annum in perpetuity for North America ADE Heat Treatment and North America AGI Heat Treatment cash generating units, respectively, would result in the recoverable amount of goodwill for these cash generating units being reduced to their carrying values.
The directors do not believe such declines to be likely.
The Board has concluded that no impairment charge is required in 2013.

An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the supply of services of 6.1m 2012: 6.2m.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.

Other financial assets continued Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high creditratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Further disclosure of the Groups financial instrument risk management activities is set out in note 18.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 17.9m 2012: 20.6m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The average credit terms offered to customers is 41 days, with a range from 17 days to 75 days.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are individually impaired trade receivables with a gross balance of 8.9m 2012: 8.9m.
The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of the expected proceeds.

Derivative financial instruments continued In accordance with IFRS 7 Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments, the Groups financial instruments are considered to be classified as level 2 instruments.
Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liabilities, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Fair value is determined using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
The Groups interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its fixed rate borrowings fair value risk and floating rate borrowings cash flow risk.
From time to time the Group will use interest rate derivative contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate movements within Group policy.
However, at the balance sheet date, the Group had no interest rate derivative contracts.

Treasury activities have the objective of minimising risk and treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines reviewed and authorised by the Board.
The Group uses a number of derivative instruments that are transacted, for risk management purposes only, by specialist treasury personnel.
The use of financial instruments, including derivatives, is permitted when approved by the Board, where the effect is to minimise risk for the Group.
Speculative trading of derivatives or other financial instruments is not permitted.
There has been no significant change during the financial year, or since the end of the year, to the types or scope of financial risks faced by the Group.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group might not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price.
Liquidity risk arises as a result of mismatches between cash inflows and outflows from the business.
This risk is monitored on a centralised basis through regular cash flow forecasting, a three-year rolling strategic plan, an annual budget agreed by the Board each December and a quarterly re-forecast undertaken during the financial year.
To mitigate the risk, the resulting forecast net debt cash is measured against the liquidity headroom policy which, at the current net debt cash levels, requires committed facilities plus term loans in excess of one year to exceed net debt by 50% minimum facilities of 75m.
As at 31 December 2013, the Group had revolving credit committed borrowing facilities of 229.0m 2012: 226.4m which exceeded net cash of 15.0m 2012: net debt of 34.2m by 244.0m 2012: 192.2m.
The Group also uses uncommitted short-term bank facilities to manage short-term liquidity but these facilities are excluded from the liquidity headroom policy.
The Group manages longerterm liquidity through committed bank facilities and will, if appropriate, raise funds on capital markets.
As at 31 December 2013 the Groups principal committed bank facilities have the following maturity dates: 125m Revolving Credit Facility 31 August 2016 2.7 years 125m Revolving Credit Facility 1 March 2018 4.2 years $10m Letter of Credit Facility 31 August 2016 2.7 years Cash management pooling, netting and concentration techniques are used to minimise borrowings.
As at 31 December 2013, the Group had gross cash of 16.9m 2012: 10.0m.

Derivative financial instruments continued Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises on borrowings and cash balances and derivative liabilities and assets which are at floating interest rates.
Changes in interest rates could have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the Groups net profit.
Under the Groups interest rate management policy, the interest rates on each of the Groups major currency monetary assets and liabilities are managed to achieve the desired mix of fixed and variable rates for each major net currency exposure.
The major interest rate risk is to UK rates but exposures also exist to rates in the USA, Europe and Sweden.
Measurement of this interest rate risk and its potential volatility to the Groups reported financial performance is undertaken on a monthly basis and the Board uses this information to determine, from time to time, an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rates.
As at 31 December 2013, 18% of gross debt and 0% of gross cash were at fixed rates 2012: 2% of gross debt, 0% of gross cash.
The average tenure of the fixed rate debt was 3.1 years 2012: 3.5 years.
Currency risk Bodycote has operations in 26 countries and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange translation risk when the profits and net assets of these entities are consolidated into the Group accounts.
90% of the Groups sales are in currencies other than sterling EUR 36%, USD 35% and SEK 7%.
Cumulatively over the year, sterling rates moved such that the sales for the year were 14.2m better than if sales had been translated at the rates prevailing in 2012.
It is Group policy not to hedge exposure for the translation of reported profits.
The Groups balance sheet translation policy is not to actively hedge currency net assets.
However, where appropriate, the Group will still match centrally held currency borrowings to the net assets.
The Group principally borrows in sterling but also maintains debt in US Dollar, Euro and Swedish Krona, consistent with the location of the Groups assets.
The Group recognises foreign exchange movements in equity for the translation of net investment hedging instruments and balances.
Transaction foreign exchange exposures arise when entities within the Group enter into contracts to pay or receive funds in a currency different from the functional currency of the entity concerned.
It is Group policy to hedge exposure to cash transactions in foreign currencies when a commitment arises, usually through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts.
Even though approximately 90% of the Groups sales are generated outside the UK, the nature of the business is such that cross border sales and purchases are limited and, other than interest, such exposures are immaterial for the Group.
Market risk sensitivity analysis The Group has measured the estimated charge to the income statement and equity of either an instantaneous increase or decrease of 1% 100 basis points in market interest rates or a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling against all other currencies from the applicable rates as at 31 December 2013, for all financial instruments with all other variables remaining constant.
This analysis is for illustrative purposes only.
The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of market risks on net post employment benefit obligations.
Interest rate sensitivity The interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or expense of variable interest financial instruments: changes in market interest rates only affect the income statement in relation to financial instruments with fixed interest if these are recognised at their fair value: and changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments.
Under these assumptions, a one percentage point fall or rise in market interest rates for all currencies in which the Group has variable net cash or net borrowings at 31 December 2013 would reduce or increase profit before tax by approximately 0.2m 2012: 0.4m.
There is no significant impact on equity.
Currency sensitivity Taking the 2013 sales by currency, a 10% weakening strengthening in the 2013 cumulative average rates for all currencies versus sterling would have given rise to a 61.7m -50.5m movement in sales respectively.
The impact on headline operating profit is affected by the mix of losses and profits in the various currencies.
However, taking the 2013 operating profit mix, a 10% weakening strengthening in 2013 cumulative average rates for all currencies would have given rise to a 11.7m -9.6m movement in headline operating profit.
Counterparty risk Counterparty risk encompasses settlement risk on derivative financial instruments and money market contracts and credit risk on cash, time deposits and money market funds.
The Group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties via their credit ratings where applicable and through its policy, thereby limiting its exposure to any one party to ensure there is no significant concentration of credit risk.
Group policy is to enter into such transactions only with counterparties with a long-term credit rating of AA3 or better.
However, acquired businesses occasionally have dealings with banks with lower credit ratings.
Business with such banks is moved as soon as practicable.

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 146.5m 2012: 122.3m available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 12.9m 2012: 18.7m of such losses, based on management forecasts of future taxable profits against which the assets can be recovered in the relevant jurisdictions.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 133.6m 2012: 103.6m of such losses where there remains uncertainty over the timing of utilisation relating to future profitability.
The majority of losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
A deferred tax liability of 0.4m 2012: 0.3m relating to the temporary differences on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries has not been recognised as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignificant.

The Group provides for the costs of environmental remediation that have been identified, either as part of acquisition due diligence, or in other circumstances where remediation by the Group is required.
This provision is reviewed annually and is separated into Restructuring Environmental and Environmental to separately identify environmental provisions relating to the restructuring programme from those arising in the ordinary course of business.
The increase in restructuring provisions is due to the ongoing implementation of the global restructuring initiatives.
In addition, 0.8m 2012: 2.4m of reorganisation and redundancy costs have been recognised in relation to the establishment of an accounting Shared Service Centre in Prague.
The majority of cash outflows in respect of these liabilities are expected to occur within five years.
Whilst the Groups use of chlorinated solvents and other hazardous chemicals continues to reduce, the Group remains exposed to contingent liabilities in respect of environmental remediation liabilities.
In particular, the Group could be subjected to regulatory or legislative requirements to remediate sites in the future.
However, it is not possible at this time to determine whether and to what extent any liabilities exist, other than for those recognised above.
Therefore no provision is recognised in relation to these items.

Bodycote Incentive Plan BIP The Company operates the BIP under which Executive Directors and senior executives received a conditional award of Bodycote shares up to a maximum of 175% of base salary.
Vestings of awards are based upon two performance measures, over a three year period.
Fifty percent of the award is subject to a return on capital employed ROCE performance condition and fifty percent of the award is subject to an earnings per share EPS performance condition.
In the event that threshold performance for both EPS and ROCE is not achieved none of the conditional awards will vest.
Bodycote Co-investment Plan CIP The CIP permits executives to invest in shares up to a value equivalent to 40% of net basic salary.
The CIP provides for the grant of awards of matching shares to participants on an annual basis in a maximum ratio of 1:1 to the gross investment made in deferred shares.
Deferred shares must be held for three years and matching shares are subject to an absolute Total Shareholder Return TSR target.

Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution schemes The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for employees in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Canada and the United States of America.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
Where there are employees who leave the schemes prior to vesting fully in the contributions, the contributions payable by the Group are reduced by the amount of forfeited contributions.
The Groups employees in Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Italy and the Netherlands are members of state-managed retirement benefit schemes operated by the governments of each country.
The relevant subsidiaries are required to contribute a specified percentage of payroll costs to the retirement benefit schemes to fund the benefits.
The only obligation of the Group with respect to these retirement benefit schemes is to make the specified contributions.
The total cost charged to income of 5.8m 2012: 5.1m represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
As at 31 December 2013 contributions of 0.2m 2012: 0.3m due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operated a number of pension schemes and provided leaving service benefits to certain employees during the year.
The defined benefit obligation less fair value of assets at the end of the year and total expense recognised in the income statement are summarised below as follows: 2013 2012 Restated m m UK scheme 4.8 4.2 Non-UK schemes 13.7 14.8 18.5 19.0 Total expense recognised in income statement 2013 2012 Restated m m UK scheme 1.2 1.1 Non-UK schemes 1.0 1.0 2.2 2.1 Further details of the Groups defined benefit arrangements are given in the Finance Directors report on pages 22 and 23.
UK scheme The Group sponsors the Bodycote UK Pension Scheme which is a funded defined benefit arrangement for certain UK employees, and pays out pensions at retirement based on service and final pensionable pay.
The scheme is funded by the Group and current employee members.
The scheme exposes the Company to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.
The scheme operates under UK trust law and the trust is a separate legal entity from the Group.
The scheme is governed by a board of trustees, composed of two member representatives, two employer representatives and one independent trustee.
The trustees are required by law to act in the best interests of scheme members and are responsible for setting certain policies e. g. investment, funding together with the Company.
Funding of the scheme is based on a separate actuarial valuation for funding purposes for which the assumptions may differ from the assumptions above.
Funding requirements are formally set out in the Statement of Funding Principles, Schedule of Contributions and Recovery Plan agreed between the trustees and the Group.
The actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 6 April 2011 and updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2013.
The contributions made by the employer over the financial year have been 1.5m, comprising 0.4m in respect of benefit accrual and 1.1m in respect of deficit recovery and ongoing expense.
It is the policy of the Group to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur outside of the profit and loss account and in Other Comprehensive Income.

The LDI portion of assets has been put in place to reduce interest rate and inflation risk.
