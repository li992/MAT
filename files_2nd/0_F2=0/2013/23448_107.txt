A convertible bond is a tradable debt that can be converted into a predetermined amount of the company's equity during its life.
In the case of Electra, 100 million of Convertible Bonds were raised in December 2010.
Each bond was priced at 1,000 per bond and generates 5% interest per annum payable semi-annually in equal instalments in arrears on 29 June and 29 December in accordance with the terms of the Prospectus.
85 Bondholders can convert their bonds into Electra shares at any time within the life of the bond expires 2017 in accordance with the terms of the Prospectus.
The conversion price in effect immediately upon issue of the bonds is 2,050p.
The Convertible Bond is listed on the London Stock Exchange and can be traded like other listed securities.
In the unlikely event of Electra winding up, the Bondholders would rank above the ordinary shareholders in terms of being entitled to the capital of Electra.

Share Fraud Warning Boiler Room Scams We are aware that in the past a number of shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters.
These are typically from overseas based 'brokers' who target UK shareholders, offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares.
These operations are commonly known as 'Boiler Room' scams.
Please be very wary of any such calls or correspondence.
Ask for the name and organisation of the person calling you and check if they can be found on the FCA Register.
If they are not listed, please report it directly to the FCA using their consumer helpline 0800 111 6768 or at www.
You may also wish to advise us by telephoning 020 7214 4200 or emailing ir@electrapartners.
It is very unlikely that either the Company or the Companys Registrars, Equiniti, would make unsolicited telephone calls to shareholders.
Such calls would only relate to official documentation already circulated to shareholders and never be in respect of investment advice.
Please remember that if you use an unauthorised firm to buy or sell shares, you will not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme if things go wrong.
