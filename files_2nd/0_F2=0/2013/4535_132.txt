102 Notes to the financial statements continued 12 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the financial year, excluding any shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has one class of dilutive potential ordinary shares, those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the financial year.

Goodwill represents the goodwill for a portfolio of sites, which has been allocated to groups of cash-generating units CGUs split on a regional basis according to the level at which management monitors that goodwill.
This allocation was primarily undertaken subsequent to the acquisition in December 2003 of the Debenhams stores by Debenhams plc.
The CGUs are set out below: North Midlands South-East South-West South Other Total m m m m m m m Goodwill 31 August 2013 155.7 180.1 176.0 181.1 100.6 25.5 819.0 For the purposes of this impairment review, the recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These cash flow projections are based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period.
The key assumptions used in these projections are sales growth and discount rates.
The five year plan is built up using managements previous experience and incorporates managements view of current economic conditions and trading expectations.
Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated based on the assumption of 2% 2012: 2% growth after year five.
The growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the retail sector in which the CGUs operate.
The post-tax discount rate used to calculate the value-in-use was 7.4% 2012: 8.2% and reflects the specific risks in the retail business.
Management determined the gross margin for each CGU based on performance of individual stores and its expectations for the market development.
The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.
The discount rates used are post-tax and risk-free rates.
Based on the value-in-use calculations, there is substantial headroom on a region by region basis and a reasonably possible change in the assumptions used would not cause an impairment to goodwill.
As a result of the impairment review, as at 31 August 2013 no impairment of goodwill has been required 2012: nil.
