Disposal of TNK-BP and investment in Rosneft Disposal of TNK-BP BP announced on 22 November 2012 that it, Rosneft and Rosneftegaz the Russian state-owned parent company of Rosneft had signed definitive and binding sale and purchase agreements SPAs for the sale of BPs 50% interest in TNK-BP to Rosneft, and for BPs further investment in Rosneft.
The transaction would consist of three tranches: BP to sell its 50% shareholding in TNK-BP to Rosneft for cash consideration of $25.4 billion which included a dividend of $0.7 billion received from TNK-BP in December 2012 and Rosneft shares representing a 3.04% stake in Rosneft.
BP would use $4.8 billion of the cash consideration to acquire a further 5.66% stake in Rosneft from the Russian government at a price of $8 per share representing a premium of 12% to the Rosneft share price on the bid date of 18 October 2012.
BP would use $8.3 billion of the cash consideration to acquire a further 9.8% stake in Rosneft from a Rosneft subsidiary at a price of $8 per share.
The net result of the overall transaction was that BP would receive $12.3 billion in cash including $0.7 billion of TNK-BP dividends received by BP in December 2012 and acquire an 18.5% shareholding in Rosneft.
Combined with BPs existing 1.25% shareholding, this would result in BP owning 19.75% of Rosneft.
On completion, the transactions between BP, Rosneft and the Rosneft subsidiary were instead settled on a net basis, so that BP received the 9.80% stake in Rosneft directly rather than receiving and immediately paying $8.3 billion in cash: however, the net result was the same.
BP accounts for its investment in Rosneft as an associate, and so equity accounts for its share of Rosnefts earnings, production and reserves.
See Note 18 for more information on BPs investment in Rosneft.
The gain on disposal of BPs investment in TNK-BP, recognized in the TNK-BP segment in 2013, was $12.5 billion as shown in the table below.

The net cash inflow relating to the transaction included in net cash flow from investing activities in the cash flow statement was $11.8 billion.
Part of the gain arising on the disposal, amounting to $3.0 billion, was deferred due to BP selling its investment in TNK-BP to Rosneft, which in turn is now accounted for by BP as an associate.
The deferred gain will be released to BPs income statement over time as the TNK-BP assets are depreciated or amortized.
Investment in Rosneft BPs investment in Rosneft is included in the group balance sheet within investments in associates, as described in Note 1.
The investment is measured at cost less the deferred gain described above, plus post-acquisition changes in BPs share of Rosnefts net assets.
