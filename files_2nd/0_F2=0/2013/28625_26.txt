Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies Rathbone Brothers Plc the company is a public company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006.
1.1 Developments in reporting standards and interpretations Standards affecting the reported results or the financial position In the current year, the group has adopted the amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits, which has affected the amounts reported in these financial statements.
Comparatives have been restated to reflect the impact of the change.
The group has changed its accounting policy with respect to the basis for determining the income or expense related to defined benefit pension schemes Schemes.
Under IAS 19, the group determines the net interest income or expense for the year arising on the Schemes by applying a single discount rate, based on the long-term return on high-quality corporate bonds, to the net surplus or deficit at the beginning of the reporting period: taking into account any changes during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments.
Previously, the group determined interest income on Schemes assets based on the long-term rate of expected return on those assets.
The amendments to IAS 19 have reduced profit after tax by 276,000 and increased other comprehensive income by the same amount.
The income tax charge for the year has been reduced by 69,000 and the deferred tax charge through other comprehensive income has been increased by the same amount.
There has been no impact on shareholders equity or total assets.
Profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2012 has been reduced by 233,000 and other comprehensive income has been increased by the same amount.
The income tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2012 has been reduced by 75,000 and the deferred tax charge through other comprehensive income has been increased by the same amount.
Changes in accounting disclosure Fee and commission income was previously presented net of broker commissions paid.
Following a review of broker contracts, the group has concluded that the broker commissions receivable and payable should be shown gross in the income statement and has re-presented these costs as fee and commission expense.
This re-presentation has increased fee and commission income by 1,666,000 in 2013 2012: 1,549,000 and fee and commission expense by the same amount.
The re-presentation has had no impact on net operating income, profit or equity in either period.
Standards not affecting the reported results or the financial position The following new and revised standards and interpretations have been adopted in the current year.
Their adoption has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements but may impact the accounting for future transactions and arrangements: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurements IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 10 introduced a new control model that focuses on whether the group has power over the investee, exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and ability to use its power to affect those returns.
Consequently, the group reassessed the control it has over its 100% owned subsidiaries and 19.9% owned associates.
The group concluded that it controlled its subsidiaries as the parent entity has power over these subsidiaries and uses this to control the returns it receives.
The group has significant influence over, but not control of, associates and therefore these are not consolidated.
There was no change to the number of subsidiaries the group consolidates following the adoption of IFRS 10.
New standards and interpretations A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2013 and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
None of these is expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the group except for IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRIC 21 Levies.
The effective date for IFRS 9 is yet to be confirmed and the effective date for IFRIC 21 is 1 January 2014.
These standards were adopted early.
Mandatory adoption is required from 1 January 2014 80 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2013 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies IFRS 9 Financial Instruments could change the classification and measurement of financial assets.
The group does not plan to adopt this standard early and the extent of the impact has not been determined.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments has not yet been adopted by the EU.
IFRIC 21 Levies will change the point at which the group recognises a liability in respect of Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS levies.
From 1 January 2014, the group will recognise a liability in respect of FSCS levies from the date at which the triggering event specified in the legislation occurs.
The triggering event for recognition of FSCS levies will change from 31 December of the preceding financial year to 1 April of the current financial year, resulting in levies recognised in the current financial year being derecognised and recognised in the following financial year.
If the company had adopted the amendments to IFRIC 21 in 2013, it would have resulted in an increase in profit after tax of 92,000 2012: 111,000 and would have resulted in an increase in equity of the same amount.
1.2 Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and entities controlled by the company its subsidiaries and special purpose entities, together the group, made up to 31 December each year.
The group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Subsidiaries and special purpose entities are fully consolidated from the date on which control is obtained and deconsolidated from the date that control ceases: their results are included in the consolidated financial statements up to the date that control ceases.
Intercompany transactions and balances between group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
Associates are companies over which the group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies of the associates note 1.4.
For associates and subsidiaries with non-coterminous year ends, financial statements are drawn up to 31 December for the purposes of equity accounting.
1.3 Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition date fair value.
Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they arise within twelve months of the acquisition date.
Later changes in the fair value of contingent consideration are charged to profit or loss or other comprehensive income, except for obligations that are classified as equity, which are not remeasured.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for deferred tax assets or liabilities, and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements which are measured in accordance with applicable accounting policies described in this note.
1.4 Investments in associates Investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method and are recognised initially at cost.
The consolidated financial statements include the groups share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associates from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
1.5 Basis of preparation The consolidated and company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.
The company financial statements are presented on pages 130 to 150.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair value notes 1.13 and 1.17.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below and, unless otherwise stated, have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2013 81 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies 1.6 Going concern The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the company and the group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Further detail is contained in the directors report on page 48.
1.7 Foreign currencies The group and companys functional and presentational currency is sterling.
Transactions in currencies other than the relevant group entitys functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in profit or loss for the period.
1.8 Income Net interest income Interest income or expense from interest-bearing financial instruments, except those classified as held for trading, is calculated using the effective interest method and recognised within net interest income.
Dividends received from money market funds are included in net interest income when received.
The effective interest method is the method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or liability or group of assets and liabilities and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the expected future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument, or when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the instrument.
The application of the method has the effect of recognising income or expense receivable or payable on the instrument evenly in proportion to the amount outstanding over the period to maturity or repayment.
In calculating effective interest, the group estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument but excluding future credit losses.
Net fee and commission income Portfolio or asset management fees, trail commissions receivable or payable and fees from advisory services are recognised on a continuous basis over the period that the related service is provided.
Commission charges for executing transactions on behalf of clients are recognised when the transaction is dealt.
Initial charges receivable from the sale of unit holdings in the groups collective investment schemes and related rebates are recognised at the point of sale.
Dividend income Dividend income from final dividends on equity securities is accounted for on the date the security becomes ex-dividend.
Interim dividends are recognised when received.
1.9 Operating leases Lease agreements which do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased assets to the group are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
The impact of any lease incentives is spread over the term of the lease.
1.10 Share-based payments The group engages in cash-settled and equity-settled share-based payment transactions in respect of services received from its employees.
Equity-settled awards For equity-settled share-based payments, the fair value of the award is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares or share options granted on the grant date.
The cost of the employee services received in respect of the shares or share options granted is recognised in profit or loss over the vesting period, with a corresponding credit to equity.
82 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2013 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies The fair value of the awards or options granted is determined using a binomial pricing model, which takes into account the current share price, the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the companys share price over the life of the option or award, any applicable exercise price and other relevant factors.
Only those vesting conditions that include terms related to market conditions are taken into account in estimating fair value.
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of shares or share options included in the measurement of the cost of employee services so that ultimately, the amount recognised in profit or loss reflects the number of vested shares or share options, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Where vesting conditions are related to market conditions, the charges for the services received are recognised regardless of whether or not the market-related vesting condition is met, provided that any non-market vesting conditions are also met.
Shares purchased and issued are charged directly to equity.
Cash-settled awards For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised for the services received to the balance sheet date, measured at the fair value of the liability.
At each subsequent balance sheet date and at the date on which the liability is settled, the fair value of the liability is remeasured with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.
1.11 Taxation Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on net taxable income for the year.
Current tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, together with any adjustment to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the liability is settled or when the asset is realised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences may be utilised, except where the temporary difference arises: from the initial recognition of goodwill: from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction, which affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit, other than in a business combination: or in relation to investments in subsidiaries and associates, where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is the groups intention not to reverse the temporary difference in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
1.12 Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand.
Cash equivalents comprise money market funds which are realisable on demand and loans and advances to banks with a maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition.
For the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
1.13 Financial assets Initial recognition Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2013 83 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies Classification and subsequent valuation Financial assets are classified in the following categories: At fair value through profit or loss Financial instruments are classified in this category if they are held for trading, or if they are designated in this category by the group.
Financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss are carried at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value taken directly to profit or loss.
Derivatives are categorised as held for trading.
Fair values of derivatives are determined using valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models and option pricing models as appropriate.
All derivatives are included in assets when their fair value is positive, and in liabilities when their fair value is negative, unless the company has the legal ability and intention to settle net.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise when the group provides money, goods or services to a debtor or purchases a loan or other debtor with no intention of trading the receivable.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method note 1.8, less any impairment.
If the fair value of the loan on initial recognition is lower than the amount advanced, the shortfall is charged to profit or loss.
Held to maturity Held to maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities other than those that meet the definition of loans and receivables or that the group has classified as available for sale or fair value through profit or loss that the group has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity.
Held to maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method note 1.8, less any impairment.
Available for sale Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
Available for sale investments are those intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, and which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices.
Available for sale financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available for sale financial assets are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the available for sale reserve in equity.
When the financial asset is sold, derecognised or impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is recycled to profit or loss.
Trade date accounting Financial assets, excluding loans and receivables, are recognised on trade date, being the date on which the group commits to purchase the asset.
Loans and receivables are recognised when cash is advanced to the borrowers.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows have expired or the group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
Fair value measurement The fair values of quoted financial instruments in active markets are based on current bid prices.
If an active market for a financial asset does not exist, the group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques.
These include the use of recent arms length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets carried at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that a financial asset carried at amortised cost, or a group of such financial assets, has suffered an impairment loss, the recoverable amount of the asset, or group of assets, is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss.
The group measures the amount of the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset, or group of assets, and the present value of estimated future cash flows from the asset, or group of assets, discounted at the effective interest rate of the asset, or group of assets, at initial recognition.
The present value of estimated future cash flows excludes future credit losses that have not been incurred.
Any impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.
84 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2013 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies All impairment losses are reviewed at least at each reporting date.
If subsequently the amount of the loss decreases as a result of a new event, the relevant element of the outstanding impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.
Interest on impaired financial assets is recognised at the original effective interest rate applied to the carrying amount as reduced by an allowance for impairment.
Financial assets carried at fair value When a decline in the fair value of a financial asset classified as available for sale has been recognised in other comprehensive income and there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss is removed from equity and recognised in profit or loss.
The loss is measured as the difference between the amortised cost of the financial asset and its current fair value.
Impairment losses on available for sale equity instruments are not reversed through profit or loss, but those on available for sale debt instruments are reversed, if there is an increase in fair value that is objectively related to a subsequent event.
1.14 Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost, which includes directly attributable acquisition costs, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets to their estimated residual value over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method, on the following bases: leasehold improvements: over the lease term plant, equipment and computer hardware: over three to 10 years The assets residual lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount and these are included in profit or loss.
1.15 Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill arises through business combinations and represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a business at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is allocated to groups of cash generating units.
Cash generating units are identified as the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributed amount of goodwill that has not been subject to impairment is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2004, being the date of the groups transition to IFRS, has been retained at the previous UK GAAP carrying amounts and is tested for impairment annually.
Client relationships Individually purchased client relationships are initially recognised at cost see note 2.1.
Client relationships acquired as part of a business combination are initially recognised at fair value.
Client relationships are subsequently carried at cost less accumulated amortisation, which is calculated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives normally 10 to 15 years, but not more than 15 years.
Computer software and software development costs Costs incurred to acquire and bring to use computer software licences are capitalised and amortised through profit or loss over their expected useful lives three to four years.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the group are recognised as intangible assets when the group is expected to benefit from future use of the software and the costs are reliably measurable.
Other costs of producing software are charged to profit or loss as incurred.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised using the straight line method over their useful lives not exceeding four years.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2013 85 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies 1.16 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets At each balance sheet date the group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use.
In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the groups cash generating units.
The carrying amount of each cash generating unit is compared to its value-in-use, calculated using a discounted cash flow method.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
Client relationship intangibles are tested for impairment on a portfolio basis by comparing the fair value of funds under management for each acquired portfolio of clients with their associated amortised value.
An example of evidence of impairment would be lost client relationships.
In determining whether a client relationship is lost, the group considers factors such as the level of funds withdrawn and the existence of other retained family relationships.
When client relationships are lost, the full amount of unamortised cost is recognised immediately in profit or loss and the intangible asset is derecognised.
If the recoverable amount of any asset other than client relationships or goodwill is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
1.17 Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and classified as fair value through profit or loss if designated as such or if held for trading or at amortised cost.
The group has not designated any liabilities as fair value through profit or loss and holds no liabilities as held for trading.
Deposits and borrowings After initial recognition, deposits and borrowings, except deposits on demand, are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method through net interest income note 1.8.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discounts or premiums on settlement.
Deposits on demand continue to be held at face value.
1.18 Provisions and contingent liabilities Provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits, that can be reliably estimated, will occur.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation, discounted using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations that depend on the outcome of uncertain future events or those present obligations where the outflows of resources are uncertain or cannot be measured reliably.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless the likelihood of crystallisation is judged to be remote.
1.19 Retirement benefit obligations surplus on retirement benefit schemes The groups net asset liability in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets at bid price are deducted.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
The cost of providing benefits under defined benefit plans is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Net remeasurements of the defined benefit asset liability are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in other comprehensive income.
86 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2013 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies Past service cost is recognised immediately in the period of a plan amendment.
The amount recognised in the balance sheet for death in service benefits represents the present value of the estimated obligation, reduced by the extent to which any future liabilities will be met by insurance policies.
Contributions to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged to profit or loss as an expense as they fall due.
The company determines the net interest on the net defined benefit asset liability for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit asset liability.
1.20 Segmental reporting The group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is provided internally to the executive committee, which is the groups chief operating decision maker.
Operating segments are organised around the services provided to clients: a description of the services provided by each segment is given in our business model on pages 8 and 9.
No operating segments have been aggregated in the groups financial statements.
Transactions between operating segments are reported within the income or expenses for those segments: intra-segment income and expenditure is eliminated at group level.
Indirect costs are allocated between segments in proportion to the principal cost driver for each category of indirect costs that is generated by each segment.
1.21 Fiduciary activities The group commonly acts as trustee and in other fiduciary capacities that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf of individuals, trusts, retirement benefit plans and other institutions.
Such assets and income arising thereon are excluded from these financial statements, as they are not assets of the group.
Largely as a result of cash and settlement processing, the group holds money on behalf of some clients in accordance with the Client Money Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority or the Jersey Financial Services Commission, as applicable.
Such monies and the corresponding amounts due to clients are not shown on the face of the balance sheet as the group is not beneficially entitled to them.
1.22 Financial guarantees The group provides a limited number of financial guarantees which are backed by assets in clients portfolios.
Financial guarantees are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value.
Guarantees are subsequently measured at the higher of the best estimate of any amount to be paid to settle the guarantee and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation, which is recognised over the life of the guarantee.
2 Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation and uncertainty The group makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
2.1 Client relationship intangibles note 21 The group assesses whether payments made to newly recruited investment managers under contractual agreements represent payments for the acquisition of client relationship intangibles or remuneration for ongoing services provided to the group.
Payments made for the acquisition of client relationship intangibles are capitalised whereas those that are judged to be in relation to the provision of ongoing services are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
The group determines a suitable period during which awards accruing to new investment managers are capitalised.
Typically, this will be for 12 months after the cessation of any non-compete period, which is in line with acquisition accounting under IFRS 3.
After the defined period has elapsed, any payments made are charged to profit or loss.
During the year the group capitalised 13,245,000 of payments made to investment managers and expensed 487,000 2012: 7,873,000 capitalised and nil expensed.
A reduction in the capitalisation period by one month would decrease client relationship intangibles by 56,000 and decrease profit before tax by 56,000.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2013 87 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 2 Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation and uncertainty The group makes estimates as to the expected duration of client relationships to determine the period over which related intangible assets are amortised.
The amortisation period is estimated with reference to historical data on account closure rates and expectations for the future.
During the year client relationship intangible assets were amortised over a 10 to 15 year period.
Amortisation of 6,306,000 was charged during the year.
A reduction in the average amortisation period of one year would increase the amortisation charge by approximately 600,000.
At 31 December 2013, the carrying value of client relationship intangibles was 52,487,000.
2.2 Loan notes note 15 The group holds loan notes Notes with a nominal value of 5,000,000 issued in 2008 by the acquirer of the groups Jersey trust operations.
The Notes are repayable on the occurrence of certain events, principally the refinancing of the operations disposed of.
The carrying value of the Notes, net of provision for impairment, was 2,835,000 at 31 December 2013 2012: 2,821,000.
The impairment has been calculated using a discounted cash flow model based on the estimated repayment date of the Notes, using a discount rate equal to the initial effective interest rate of the loan.
Changing the estimated repayment date of the Notes by one year would result in an increase or decrease in their carrying value, net of provision for impairment, of approximately 240,000.
A 1% increase decrease in the assumed rate at which interest accrues under the loan would increase decrease the net carrying value, net of provision for impairment, by approximately 90,000 with a consequent equal change in profit before tax.
2.3 Retirement benefit obligations note 26 The group makes estimates about a range of long-term trends and market conditions to determine the value of the surplus or deficit on its retirement benefit schemes, based on the groups expectations of the future and advice taken from qualified actuaries.
Long-term forecasts and estimates are necessarily highly judgmental and subject to risk that actual events may be significantly different to those forecast.
If actual events deviate from the assumptions made by the group then the reported surplus or deficit in respect of retirement benefit obligations may be materially different.
The principal assumptions underlying the reported surplus of 1,614,000 and information on the sensitivity of the retirement benefit obligations to changes in underlying estimates is set out in note 26.
2.4 Legal proceedings note 32 Note 32 to the consolidated financial statements refers to two related legal claims that are ongoing.
As with all disputes of this nature, the eventual outcome is uncertain and depends on the outcome of the Jersey claim which is now not expected to come to trial until 2015, on the outcome of the Court of Appeal hearing in the insurance proceedings and on whether either or both cases are subject to a negotiated settlement at any stage.
There is a risk that the groups insurance cover for the year in question will not be effective in relation to the Jersey claim or will prove insufficient to cover losses, in which case any obligation could be material.
The board believes that, whilst legal costs may continue to be incurred, it is more likely than not that any final judgment in relation to the above claims will result in no liability to the company, and accordingly no provision has been made 2012: no provision.
88 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2013 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3 Segmental information For management purposes the group is currently organised into two operating segments: Investment Management and Unit Trusts.
The products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues are described in our services on pages 8 and 9.
Complementary services, as described in our services, are reported within the Investment Management segment.
These segments are the basis on which the group reports its performance to the executive committee, which is the groups chief operating decision maker.
Certain items of income are presented within different categories of operating income in the financial statements compared to the presentation for internal reporting.

The decrease in fair value of the investment property in the year of 34,000 2012: increase of 19,000 was due to a reduction in management's estimate of its realisable value.
The relocation was completed in 2012 and no further additions in relation to the move were recognised during 2013.

Investment in associates Although the group holds less than 20% of the equity shares of both companies, it exercises significant influence by virtue of its contractual right to appoint one director to the board of directors of both companies.
The options held by the group to acquire the remaining shares in the associates are not exercisable until the third quarter of 2015.
Therefore, they do not represent substantive rights to direct the activities and policies of the associates.
The group is, therefore, not judged to control the associates and they are not consolidated.
The movements in the groups investment in associates are as follows: 2013 2012 000 000 At 1 January 1,237 Additions 1,216 Share of profit 89 21 Dividends received 30 At 31 December 1,296 1,237 The results of the associates, and their aggregated assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2013, are as follows: Assets Liabilities Revenues Profit % interest Name Country of incorporation 000 000 000 000 held Vision Independent Financial Planning Limited England and Wales 493 31 1,083 268 19.9 Castle Investment Solutions Limited England and Wales 208 1 461 181 19.9 701 32 1,544 449 Groups share of profit 89 Derivative financial instruments As part of the transaction to acquire these holdings, the group has also entered into certain option contracts over the equity instruments of these companies.
Under these contracts the group has the right to acquire the remaining 80.1% of the share capital of both associates for a variable exercise price in the third quarter of 2015.
If the group does not exercise its right to acquire the associates remaining share capital, the founders of the associates have the right to re-purchase the groups stakes in the associates for 2,000,000 in the fourth quarter of 2015.
The group also has the right to sell its entire holdings in the associates to the founders for a consideration of 1 at any time until 29 February 2016.
The option contracts are valued together and carried at fair value.
At 31 December 2013, the fair value of the option contracts was 1,030,000 2012: 784,000 see note 17.
The fair value of the option contracts is calculated using a probability weighted expected return model note 30.

No impairment was recognised during the year.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2013 2012 000 000 Investment management 45,287 45,287 Trust and tax 1,954 1,954 47,241 47,241 The recoverable amounts of goodwill allocated to the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the board, covering the forthcoming year.
The key assumptions underlying the budgets are that organic growth rates, revenue margins and profit margins will be in line with recent historical rates and equity markets will be flat for the forthcoming year.
Budgets are extrapolated for up to 10 years using an annual growth rate in profit before tax of 3% for the investment management CGU and 1% for the trust and tax CGU, based on revenue growth of 7% and 3% respectively as well as the groups expectation of future industry growth rates.
A ten year extrapolation period is chosen based on the groups assessment of the likely duration of client relationships.
The group estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 10% for investment management and 12% for trust and tax 2012: 10% and 12% respectively, based on a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital.
The group judge these discount rates appropriately reflect the markets in which the CGUs operate and, in particular, the relatively small size of the trust and tax CGU.
Based on the above assumptions, the calculated recoverable amount of the goodwill allocated to the trust and tax CGU at 31 December 2013 was 2,832,000.
Reducing the assumed growth rate for income in the trust and tax CGU by two percentage points would reduce the calculated recoverable amount of the allocated goodwill to 2,010,000.
No reasonably foreseeable changes to the assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation for the investment management CGU would result in an impairment of the goodwill allocated to it.

Deferred, variable costs to acquire client relationship intangibles at 31 December 2013 includes 3,943,000 in relation to the purchase of Taylor Young Investment Management Limiteds private client base 2012: nil.
The final amount payable will be calculated based on the value of funds under management that have transferred from Taylor Young Investment Management Limited to the group, measured on 30 April 2014.
At 31 December 2012, this included 1,081,000 in relation to deferred variable consideration for the purchase of R. M. Walkden & Co. Limited.
During the ordinary course of business the group may be subject to complaints, as well as threatened and actual legal proceedings which may include lawsuits brought on behalf of clients or other third parties, both in the UK and overseas.
Any such material matters are periodically reassessed, with the assistance of external professional advisors where appropriate, to determine the likelihood of the group incurring a liability.
In those instances where it is concluded that it is more likely than not that a payment will be made, a provision is established to the groups best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the relevant balance sheet date.
The timing of settlement of provisions for client compensation or litigation is dependent, in part, on the duration of negotiations with third parties.
Property-related and other provisions include 973,000 in relation to dilapidation provisions expected to arise on leasehold premises held by the group 2012: 797,000.
Dilapidation provisions are calculated using a discounted cash flow model: during the year, the impact of discounting has increased the provisions by 125,000 2012: 51,000.
Provisions payable after one year are expected to be settled within two years of the balance sheet date 2012: two years, except for property-related provisions of 973,000 2012: 786,000, which are expected to be settled within 23 years of the balance sheet date 2012: 24 years, which corresponds to the longest lease for which a dilapidations provision is being held.
26 Long term employee benefits The group operates a defined contribution group personal pension scheme and contributes to various other personal pension arrangements for certain directors and employees.
The total of contributions made to this scheme during the year was 2,882,000 2012: 2,223,000.
The group also operates a defined contribution scheme for overseas employees, for which the total contributions were 7,000 2012: 22,000.
The group operates two defined benefit pension schemes: the Rathbone 1987 Scheme and the Laurence Keen Scheme.
The schemes are currently both clients of Rathbone Investment Management, with investments managed on a discretionary basis, in accordance with the statements of investment principles agreed by the trustees.
Scheme assets are held separately from those of the group.
The trustees of the schemes are required to act in the best interest of the schemes beneficiaries.
The appointment of trustees is determined by the schemes trust documentation and legislation.
The group has a policy that one third of all trustees should be nominated by members of the schemes.
The Laurence Keen Scheme was closed to new entrants and future accrual with effect from 30 September 1999.
Past service benefits continue to be calculated by reference to final pensionable salaries.
From 1 October 1999, all the active members of the Laurence Keen Scheme were included under the Rathbone 1987 Scheme for accrual of retirement benefits for further service.
The Rathbone 1987 Scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 31 March 2002.
The group provides death in service benefits to all employees through the Rathbone 1987 Scheme.
Third party insurance is purchased for the benefits where possible and 828,000 of related insurance premiums were expensed to profit or loss in the year 2012: 614,000.
The estimated present value of the uninsured death in service benefits is included in long term employee benefits liabilities.
The schemes are valued by independent actuaries at least every three years using the projected unit credit method, which looks at the value of benefits accruing over the years following the valuation date based on projected salary to the date of termination of services, discounted to a present value using a rate that reflects the characteristics of the liability.
The valuations are updated at each balance sheet date in between full valuations.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out as at the following dates: Rathbone 1987 Scheme 31 December 2010 Laurence Keen Scheme 31 December 2010 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2013 105 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 26 Long term employee benefits The next triennial valuation of both schemes will be carried out during 2014, based on 31 December 2013 data, and may result in changes to the funding commitments described below.
The assumptions used by the actuaries, to estimate the schemes liabilities, are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions.
Due to the timescale covered by the liability, these assumptions may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The principal actuarial assumptions used, which reflect the different membership profiles of the schemes, were: 2013 2012 2013 2012 Laurence Keen Laurence Keen Rathbone 1987 Rathbone 1987 Scheme Scheme Scheme Scheme % % % % Rate of increase in salaries 4.50 4.00 4.50 4.00 Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.60 3.40 3.40 3.00 Rate of increase of deferred pensions 3.50 3.00 3.50 3.00 Discount rate 4.60 4.50 4.60 4.50 Inflation 3.50 3.00 3.50 3.00 Inflation assumptions are based on the Retail Prices Index Over the prior year the financial assumptions have been amended to reflect changes in market conditions.
Specifically: i the discount rate has been increased by 0.1% to reflect an increase in the yields available on AA-rated corporate bonds at a term consistent with the average duration of the liabilities: ii the assumed rate of future inflation has been increased by 0.5% to reflect an increase in expectations of long-term inflation as implied by changes in the fixed interest and index-linked gilts market: and iii the assumed rates of salary growth and future increases to pensions in payment have been increased for consistency with the change in the assumed rate of future inflation.
The assumed duration of the liabilities for the Laurence Keen Scheme is 18 years 2012: 18 years and the assumed duration for the Rathbone 1987 Scheme is 24 years 2012: 24 years.
The normal retirement age for members of the Laurence Keen Scheme is 65 60 for certain former directors.
The normal retirement age for members of the Rathbone 1987 Scheme is 60 for service prior to 1 July 2009 and 65 thereafter, following the introduction of pension benefits based on Career Average Revalued Earnings CARE from that date.
The assumed life expectancy for the membership of both schemes is based on the S1NA actuarial tables.
The assumed life expectations on retirement were: 2013 2013 2012 2012 Males Females Males Females Retiring today: aged 60 28.9 31.0 28.8 30.9 aged 65 24.1 26.1 24.0 26.0 Retiring in 20 years: aged 60 31.4 33.1 31.3 33.0 aged 65 26.4 28.1 26.3 28.0 There have been no changes to any of the demographic assumptions since the prior year.
In particular, the same mortality assumptions have been used for the current year as the prior year.

A maximum of 5% of UK equities may be invested in companies outside the FTSE 350 and not more than 5% of the total portfolio can be invested in hedge funds.
The trustees have initiated a programme of reducing the equity exposure of the portfolio over a 10-year period as the scheme matures by switching a proportion of the schemes assets into fixed income and index-linked securities on the occurrence of a series of time-based and or market-based trigger events.
At 31 December 2013, 28,825,000 2012: 19,657,000 of the schemes assets had been switched under the programme.
In the Laurence Keen Scheme, not more than 55% of the assets may be held in equities.
A maximum of 15% of UK equities may be invested in companies outside the FTSE 350 and not more than 15% of the assets may be held in alternative assets.

108 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2013 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 26 Long term employee benefits The four key assumptions affecting the results of the valuation are the discount rate, future inflation, future salary growth and mortality.
In order to demonstrate the sensitivity of the results to these assumptions, the actuary has recalculated the defined benefit obligations for each scheme by varying each of these assumptions in isolation whilst leaving the other assumptions unchanged.
For example, in order to demonstrate the sensitivity of the results to the discount rate, the actuary has recalculated the defined benefit obligations for each scheme using a discount rate that is 0.5% higher than used for calculating the disclosed figures.
A similar approach has been taken to demonstrate the sensitivity of the results to the other key assumptions.
A summary of the sensitivities in respect of the total of the two schemes defined benefit obligations is set out below: Combined impact on schemes liabilities Decrease increase Decrease increase 000 % 0.5% increase in: discount rate 16,902 11.7 rate of inflation 10,811 7.5 rate of salary growth 5,306 3.7 1 year increase to longevity at 60 4,247 2.9 The total regular contributions made by the group to the Rathbone 1987 Scheme during the year were 2,508,000 2012: 3,762,000 based on 14.8% of pensionable salaries 2012: 22.6%.
Additional lump sum contributions of 1,750,000 were paid in 2013 2012: 2,874,000.
The group makes regular contributions of 14.8% of pensionable salaries and the group has committed to make additional annual contributions to the scheme of 2,750,000 in 2014 and 2,420,000 in 2015.
Active members of the Rathbone 1987 Scheme are required to make annual contributions to the scheme.
Currently, these contributions represent an average of 7.7% of pensionable salaries 2012: 7.8%.
With effect from 31 March 2002 the Rathbone 1987 Scheme was closed to new entrants and, consequently, the current pension cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
The total contributions made by the group to the Laurence Keen Scheme during the year were 476,000 2012: 756,000.
Additional lump sum contributions of 10,000 were paid in 2013 2012: 17,000.
Annual contributions of 336,000 will continue to be made to the Laurence Keen Scheme until December 2017.

30 Financial risk management The group has identified the financial, business and operational risks arising from its activities and has established policies and procedures to manage these items in accordance with its risk appetite, as described in the group risk committee report on page 53.
The group categorises its financial risks into the following primary areas: i credit risk which includes counterparty default risk : ii liquidity risk: iii market risk which includes fair value interest rate risk, cash flow interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and price risk : and iv pension risk.
The groups exposures to pension risk are set out in note 26.
The groups financial risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse the financial risks that the group faces, to set appropriate risk tolerances, limits and controls and to monitor the financial risks and adherence to limits by means of reliable and up-to-date information systems.
The group regularly reviews its financial risk management policies and systems to reflect changes in the business, counterparties, markets and the range of financial instruments that it utilises.
The treasury department, reporting through the banking committee, has principal responsibility for monitoring exposure to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.
Procedures and delegated authorities are documented in a group treasury manual and policy documents prescribe the management and monitoring of each type of risk.
The primary objective of the groups treasury policy is to manage short term liquidity requirements whilst maintaining an appropriate level of exposure to other financial risks in accordance with the groups risk appetite.
i Credit risk The group takes on exposure to credit risk, which is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due, through its banking, treasury, trust and pensions advisory activities.
The principal source of credit risk arises from placing funds in the money market and holding interest-bearing securities.
The group also has exposure to credit risk through its loan book, guarantees given on clients behalf and a loan made to the acquirers of the groups Jersey operations in 2008 note 15.
It is the groups policy to place funds generated internally and from deposits by clients with a range of high-quality financial institutions and the Bank of England.
Investments are spread to avoid excessive exposure to any individual counterparty.
Loans made to clients are secured against clients assets that are held and managed by group companies.
Exposure to credit risk is managed through setting appropriate ratings requirements and lending limits.
Limits are reviewed regularly, taking into account the ability of borrowers and potential borrowers to meet repayment obligations.
The group categorises its exposures based on the long term ratings awarded to counterparties by Fitch or Moodys.
Each exposure is assessed individually, both at inception and in ongoing monitoring.
In addition to formal external ratings, the banking committee also utilises market intelligence information to assist its ongoing monitoring.
112 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2013 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 30 Financial risk management i Credit risk The groups financial assets are categorised as follows: Cash and balances with central banks note 13 The group has exposure to central banks through its deposits held with the Bank of England.
Settlement balances Settlement risk arises in any situation where a payment in cash or transfer of a security is made in the expectation of a corresponding delivery of a security or receipt of cash.
The majority of transactions are carried out on a delivery versus payment basis, which results in securities and cash being exchanged within a very close timeframe.
Settlement balances outside standard terms are monitored on a daily basis.
The Investment Management and Unit Trusts businesses have exposure to market counterparties in the settlement of trades.
Settlement balances arising in the Investment Management segment are primarily in relation to client trades and risk of non-settlement is borne by clients.
Loans and advances to banks note 14 and debt and other securities note 16 The group has exposures to a wide range of financial institutions through its treasury portfolio, which includes bank deposits, certificates of deposit and money market funds.
These exposures principally arise from the placement of clients cash, where it is held under a banking relationship, and the groups own reserves.
The groups policy requires that all such exposures are only taken with counterparties that have been awarded a minimum long term rating of A by Fitch or equivalent rating by Moodys.
Counterparty limits are also in place to limit exposure to an individual counterparty or connected group of counterparties.
Counterparty exposures are monitored on a daily basis by the treasury department and reviewed by the banking committee on a monthly basis, or more frequently when necessary.
The banking committee may suspend dealing in a particular counterparty, or liquidate specific holdings, in the light of adverse market information.
Loans and advances to customers note 15 The group provides loans to clients through its investment management operations the investment management loan book.
The group is also exposed to credit risk on overdrafts on clients investment management accounts, trade debtors arising from the trust, tax and pensions advisory businesses trust and pension debtors and other debtors.
a Overdrafts Overdrafts on clients investment management accounts arise from time-to-time due to short term timing differences between the purchase and sale of assets on a clients behalf.
Overdrafts are actively monitored and reported to the banking committee on a monthly basis.
b Investment management loan book Loans are provided as a service to investment management clients who are generally asset rich but have short to medium term cash requirements.
Such loans are normally made on a fully secured basis against portfolios held in Rathbones nominee name.
Extensions to the initial loan period may be granted subject to credit criteria.
The banking committee reviews all loans on a monthly basis and approves all loan extensions.
Where possible, repayment plans are established with clients before loans become overdue or uncovered.
At 31 December 2013, the total lending exposure limit for the investment management loan book was 120,000,000 2012: 85,000,000, of which 89,188,000 had been advanced 2012: 65,046,000 and a further 15,941,000 had been committed 2012: 3,002,000. c Trust and pension debtors Trust and pension debtors relate to fees which have been invoiced but not yet settled by clients.
The collection and ageing of trust and pension debtors are reviewed on a monthly basis by the management committees of the groups trust and pension advisory companies.
Impairment provisions are made for any debts which are considered to be doubtful for collection.
d Other debtors Other loans and advances to customers are principally constituted by the loan made to the acquirers of the groups Jersey trust operations in 2008 note 15.
Such debts do not usually arise within the course of the groups day-to-day operations and therefore they are not subject to formalised standard lending criteria.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2013 113 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 30 Financial risk management i Credit risk Derivative financial instruments note 20 At 31 December 2013, the only derivative financial instruments held by the group were the option contracts over shares in the groups associates.
These options expose the group to credit risk from the potential for non-delivery by the associate companies founders, who are private individuals.
Impairment and provisioning policies Impairment provisions are recognised for financial reporting purposes only for losses that have been incurred at the balance sheet date, based on objective evidence of impairment.
All credit exposures are reviewed individually, at least annually, or more regularly when individual circumstances require.
Impairment allowances on credit exposures are determined by an evaluation of the incurred loss at the balance sheet date on a case-by-case basis.
The assessment considers, where applicable, the value of any collateral held, any changes to the external credit rating and the anticipated receipts for each individual exposure.
Impairment provisions for credit risk, which relate solely to trust and pension debtors and other debtors, are set out in note 15.

For on-balance sheet assets, the exposures set out above are based on gross carrying amounts.
Of the total maximum exposure 18.3% is derived from loans and advances to banks and customers 2012: 23.9% and 56.0% represents investments in debt securities 2012: 59.9%.
The credit risk relating to off-balance sheet exposures for financial guarantees reflects the groups gross potential exposure of guarantees held on balance sheet note 1.22.
Cash and balances with central banks All cash and balances with central banks were neither past due nor impaired.
The credit quality of these balances is analysed below by reference to the long term credit rating awarded by Fitch, or equivalent rating by Moodys, as at the balance sheet date.

All loans initially made subject to standard lending criteria remained within those criteria at 31 December 2013 2012: all loans.
An exposure is reported as past due when the contractual due date for settlement has passed and the balance has not been repaid, except in the case of trust and pension debtors, where a normal settlement period of up to 30 days is expected.

The banking committee actively monitors counterparties and may reduce risk by either suspending dealing or liquidating investments in the light of adverse market information, for example in anticipation of or in response to any formal Fitch or Moodys rating downgrade.
This may happen in relation to specific banks or banks within a particular country or sector.
a Geographical sectors The following table analyses the groups credit exposures, at their carrying amounts, by geographical region as at the balance sheet date.

The primary objective of the groups treasury policy is to manage short to medium term liquidity requirements.
In addition to setting the treasury policy, Rathbone Investment Management the Bank performs an annual assessment of liquidity adequacy in accordance with the regulatory requirements of the PRA our Individual Liquidity Adequacy Assessment.
The Bank faces two principal risks, namely that a significant proportion of client funds are withdrawn over a short period of time retail funding risk and the risk that marketable assets may not be capable of being realised in the time and at the value required marketable assets risk.
Retail funding risks are monitored by daily cash mismatch analyses and Basel Committee ratios using expected cash and asset maturity profiles and regular forecasting work.
This is supported by stress tests which cover firm-specific idiosyncratic scenarios and or the effects of unforeseen market wide stresses.
Marketable assets risk is primarily managed by holding cash and marketable instruments that are realisable at short notice.
The group operates strict criteria to ensure that investments are liquid and placed with high-quality counterparties.
A minimum liquid assets buffer to be held in eligible liquid assets is set by the board at least annually in conjunction with an amount prescribed by the PRA.
The group does not rely on external funding to finance its activities.

Included within the amounts due to customers on demand are balances which historical experience shows are unlikely to be called in the short term.
A prudent level of highly liquid assets is retained to cover reasonably foreseeable short term changes in client deposits.
All debt securities are readily marketable and can be realised through disposals.
The group holds 6,333,000 of equity investments 2012: 4,198,000, which are subject to liquidity risk but are not included in the table above.
These assets are held as available for sale securities and have no fixed maturity date: cash flows arise from receipt of dividends or through sale of the assets.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2013 119 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 30 Financial risk management ii Liquidity risk Derivative cash flows The groups exposure to derivative financial instruments is limited to option contracts over the equity instruments of its associates.
These contracts do not create an obligation for the group to deliver cash or a financial asset and therefore they are not included in the liquidity tables note 20.
Off-balance sheet items Cash flows arising from the groups off-balance sheet financial liabilities note 32 are summarised in the table below.
The contractual value of the groups commitments to extend credit to clients and maximum potential value of financial guarantees are analysed by the duration of the commitment.

Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The groups principal exposure to cash flow interest rate risk arises from the mismatch between the repricing of its financial assets and liabilities.
In particular, customer accounts and loan balances are repriced very shortly after changes in base rates, whereas the yield on the groups interest-bearing assets is correlated to the future expectation of base rates and varies depending on the maturity profile of the groups treasury portfolio.
The average maturity mismatch is controlled by the banking committee, which generally lengthens the mismatch when the yield curve is expected to rise and shortens it when the yield curve is expected to fall.
The table below shows the consolidated repricing profile of the groups financial assets and liabilities, stated at their carrying amounts, categorised by the earlier of contractual repricing or maturity dates.

The potential total profit or loss is calculated on the basis of the average number of days to repricing of the interest-bearing liabilities compared with the period to repricing on a corresponding amount of interest-bearing assets.
At 31 December 2013, the Bank had a net present value sensitivity of 3,398,000 2012: 2,126,000 for an upward 2% shift in rates.
The group held no forward rate agreements at 31 December 2013 2012: none.
Foreign exchange risk The group is exposed to translational foreign exchange risk as it undertakes transactions in foreign currencies and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
The group monitors its currency exposures that arise in the ordinary course of business on a daily basis and significant exposures are managed through the use of spot contracts, from time-to-time, so as to reduce any currency exposure to a minimal amount.
The group has no structural foreign currency exposure.
122 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2013 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 30 Financial risk management iii Market risk The group does not have any material exposure to transactional foreign exchange risk.
The table below summarises the groups exposure to foreign currency translation risk at 31 December 2013.

A 10% weakening of the euro against sterling, occurring on 31 December 2013, would have reduced equity and profit after tax by 65,000 2012: reduced by 55,000.
A 10% strengthening of the US dollar or euro would have had an equal and opposite effect.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other exchange rates, remain constant.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2013 123 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 30 Financial risk management iii Market risk Price risk Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or foreign exchange risk.
The group is exposed to price risk through its holdings of equity investment securities, which are reported at their fair value note 16.
At 31 December 2013, the fair value of equity securities recognised on the balance sheet was 6,333,000 2012: 4,198,000.
A 10% fall in global equity markets would, in isolation, result in a pre-tax impact on net assets of 617,000 2012: 420,000 : there would be no impact on profit after tax.
A 10% rise in global markets would have had an equal and opposite effect.
Fair values The fair values of the groups financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values, with the exception of held to maturity investment debt securities note 16.
Debt securities comprise bank and building society certificates of deposit, which have fixed coupons.
Fair value for held to maturity assets is based on market bid prices, and hence would be categorised as level 1 within the fair value hierarchy see below.
The table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique used to determine the fair value.
Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2013 000 000 000 000 Assets Available for sale securities: equity securities 5,642 691 6,333 money market funds 47,652 47,652 Derivative financial instruments 1,030 1,030 Total financial assets 5,642 47,652 1,721 55,015 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2012 000 000 000 000 Assets Available for sale securities: equity securities 3,584 614 4,198 money market funds 51,551 51,551 Derivative financial instruments 784 784 Total financial assets 3,584 51,551 1,398 56,533 The group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.
There have been no transfers between levels during the year 2012: none.
The fair value of listed equity securities is their quoted price.
Money market funds are demand securities and changes to estimates of interest rates will not affect their fair value.
The fair value of money market funds is their daily redemption value.
124 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2013 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 30 Financial risk management Fair values Level 3 financial instruments Available for sale equity securities The fair value of unlisted equity securities is calculated by reference to tangible net asset values from the published information of the underlying company with a 25% liquidity discount applied.
A five percentage point increase in the liquidity discount applied to the calculation of the fair value of the unlisted equity securities would, in isolation, result in a decrease in fair value of 46,000 2012: 41,000.
A five percentage point decrease would have an equal and opposite effect.
Derivative financial instruments The fair value of the option contracts is calculated using a probability weighted expected return model, based on potential valuation outcomes under a range of business growth forecast scenarios.
The key assumptions underlying the forecast growth in profitability of the associates in the model are the growth of funds under management, revenue margins and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the cash flows.
The key assumptions are flexed in each scenario to generate a potential valuation for the options.
The probability of each scenario occurring is estimated, based on the groups judgment in light of the economic conditions prevailing at the time.
The fair value of the options is calculated as the weighted average of the valuations derived under each scenario, taking account of the associated probabilities of occurrence.
Changing one or more of the key assumptions to reasonably possible alternatives would have the following effects on the fair value of the contracts.
These effects have been calculated by running the valuation model using the alternative estimates of the key assumptions.
Any interrelationship between the assumptions is not considered to have a significant impact within the range of reasonably possible alternative assumptions.
Impact on fair value of: Increase in Decrease in the assumption the assumption 000 000 10% change in the fees and commission charged to Vision clients 712 569 5 percentage point change in commissions payable 543 696 10% change in the rate of growth in funds under management 292 293 1 percentage point change to the discount rate 214 232 Changes in the fair values of financial instruments categorised as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy were as follows: 2013 2013 2012 2012 Available for Derivative Available for Derivative sale equity financial 2013 sale equity financial 2012 securities instruments Total securities instruments Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 At 1 January 614 784 1,398 569 569 Total unrealised gains and losses recognised in: profit or loss 246 246 other comprehensive income 77 77 45 45 Acquired during the year note 20 784 784 At 31 December 691 1,030 1,721 614 784 1,398 The gain relating to the derivative financial instruments is included within other operating income and the gain relating to the available for sale equity securities is included within revaluation of available for sale investment securities in other comprehensive income.
There were no other gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial instruments categorised as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2013 125 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 31 Capital management Rathbone Brothers Plcs capital is defined for accounting purposes as total equity.
From time-to-time, the group runs small overnight overdraft balances as part of working capital.
The group had no other external borrowings at 31 December 2013 2012: nil.
The groups objectives when managing capital are to: safeguard the groups ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders: maintain a strong capital base to be able to support the development of the business when required: optimise the distribution of capital across group companies, reflecting the requirements of each business: strive to make capital freely transferable across the group where possible: and comply with regulatory requirements at all times.
Rathbones is classified for capital purposes as a banking group and performs an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, which is presented to the PRA on an annual basis.
Regulatory capital resources for ICAAP purposes are calculated in accordance with published rules.
These require certain adjustments to and certain deductions from accounting capital, the latter largely in respect of intangible assets.
The ICAAP compares regulatory capital resources against regulatory capital requirements derived using the PRAs Pillar I and Pillar II methodology.
The group has adopted the standardised approach to calculating its Pillar I credit risk component and the basic indicator approach to calculating its operational risk component.
Capital management policy and practices are applied at both group and entity level.
At 31 December 2013 the groups regulatory capital resources, including retained earnings for 2013, were 132,214,000 2012: 118,378,000.
The increase in reserves during 2013 was partially offset by an increase in intangible assets.
In addition to a variety of stress tests performed as part of the ICAAP, and daily reporting in respect of treasury activity, capital levels are monitored and forecasted on a monthly basis to ensure that dividends and investment requirements are appropriately managed and appropriate buffers are kept against adverse business conditions.
Regulatory capital requirements have been met throughout the financial years ended 31 December 2012 and 2013.
32 Contingent liabilities and commitments a Indemnities are provided in the normal course of business to a number of directors and employees who provide tax and trust advisory services in connection with them acting as trustees directors of client companies and providing other services.
As reported in the 2012 report and accounts, a claim relating to the management of a Jersey trust has been filed against a former employee and director of Rathbone Trust Company Jersey Limited RTCJ and others.
Hawksford Trust Company Jersey Limited as RTCJ is now known has also recently been joined in as a defendant.
RTCJ was a subsidiary of the company from March 2000 until October 2008.
Although the board believes that this claim will be unsuccessful, a possible material obligation may arise.
Due to the complexity of the claim, the number of parties involved and the impact of the insurance cover available, it is not practicable to estimate reliably the value of any possible obligation for the company.
Professional indemnity cover of 50 million under the relevant year of the companys civil liability insurance policy is made up of a first layer of 5 million and an excess layer of a maximum of 45 million.
The limit of the indemnity given jointly by RTCJ and the company to the employee in question is 40 million per event.
The group has sought to confirm the position of the companys civil liability professional indemnity insurers in relation to the claim and issued proceedings to confirm insurance cover against the excess insurers.
The trial of those proceedings took place in October 2013 and judgment was handed down on 8 November 2013.
In the judgment, the judge ruled in favour of the company and the employee on all the substantive coverage points on the insurance policy, confirming that the employee was covered by the policy in respect of liability for the wrongful acts alleged in the Jersey proceedings.
However, he also ruled that the insurers should have a right of subrogation whereby they could, upon payment of any sums to the employee, take over any rights of action which the employee might have against the company pursuant to an indemnity granted to him jointly by RTCJ and the company.
The company and the former employee in question have filed notices to appeal subrogation aspects of the judgment, and insurers have filed notices to cross-appeal coverage aspects of the judgment.
The hearing of these appeals before the Court of Appeal is expected to take place in the second half of 2014.
There is therefore a risk that the groups insurance cover for the year in question will not be effective in relation to the Jersey claim or will prove insufficient to cover losses, in which case any obligation could be material.
The board believes that it is more likely than not that any final judgment in relation to the above claims will result in no liability to the company, and accordingly no provision has been made.

d The group leases various offices and other assets under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
The leases have varying terms and renewal rights.
The companys agreement to lease space at 1 Curzon Street, London, under which total payments over the lease term at 31 December 2013 were 31,428,000, provides for an upward only reset to market rents in 2018.

The financial impact of unexpected FSCS levies is largely out of the groups control as they result from other industry failures.
There is uncertainty over the level of future FSCS levies as they depend on the ultimate cost to the FSCS of industry failures.
The group contributes to the deposit class, investment fund management class and investment intermediation levy classes and accrues levy costs for future levy years when the obligation arises.
Levies of 786,000 have been included within administrative expenses in 2013 2012: 1,022,000.
It is only possible for the group to estimate its share of these losses until invoices are received.
In addition to the FSCS levies accrued in the year further levy charges may be incurred in future years, although the ultimate cost remains uncertain.
