Exceptional items and certain remeasurements i Exceptional items In the year to 31 March 2013, the following exceptional items were recorded: Impairments and other charges: On 21 March 2013, the Group announced the results of a comprehensive review of generation operations.
This review was conducted in the context of challenging energy market conditions including continued extremely low spark spreads, the early introduction of the Carbon Price Floor at a high level, the ongoing constraints on coal plant arising from the Industrial Emissions Directive and the ongoing uncertainty around the Electricity Market Reform proposals.
The conclusions of the review were that around 2,000MW of the Groups existing thermal generation capacity will cease operation during the 2013 14 financial year, with the main stations affected being Ferrybridge, Keadby, Slough, Uskmouth and Peterhead.
Related to this, the Group has reassessed the carrying value of its associate investments at Barking Power Limited and Derwent Cogeneration Limited.
Accordingly, combined impairment charges of 306.9m have been recognised of which 277.9m relates to property, plant and equipment and 33.0m relates to investments less 4.0m of related deferred tax.
In addition to this, further impairment charges of 84.6m were recognised following a detailed review of the groups investments 25.8m, property, plant and equipment 25.4m, intangible assets 25.5m and other assets 7.9m.
This included further impairment of legacy Metering assets 23.4m, charges related to wind development pipeline assets 20.0m and the reassessment of the recoverable value of certain associate investments and other assets 41.2m.
The Group recognised current asset impairments and other related charges in relation to the settlement of certain claims associated with the outage at Medway power station in 2008 09 43.0m.
In addition, the group recognised charges in relation to the impairment of carbon dioxide emissions allowances purchased to cover the emissions liabilities at the groups thermal plants 139.3m.
Provisions for onerous contracts, restructuring and other liabilities.
On review of the Groups provisions at 31 March 2013, certain provisions for onerous contracts were released 37.4m and other provisions for restructuring related to the announcement on 21 March 2013, doubtful debts, project exit costs and potential contractual settlement were recognised 44.3m.
Changes in UK corporation tax rates.
The Emergency Budget on 22 June 2010 announced that the UK corporation tax rate would reduce from 28% to 24% over a period of four years starting in 2011.
The March 2011 Budget accelerated the reductions and the March 2012 Budget confirmed a further acceleration of the reduction in rate to 24% effective from 1 April 2012.
The Finance Act 2012 confirmed the reduction to 23% as being effective from 1 April 2013.
This was substantively enacted on 17 July 2012.
A revised rate of 22% is expected to be enacted by 2014.
As the rate change to 23% has been substantively enacted it has the effect of reducing the groups net deferred tax liabilities recognised at 31 March 2013 by 22.0m 45.7m.
It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further 1% rate reduction due to legislation not being enacted, although this will further reduce the Groups future current tax charge and the reduce the Groups deferred tax liabilities assets accordingly.
In the year to 31 March 2012, the following exceptional items were recorded: Exceptional charges were recognised in relation to the impairment of goodwill 49.3m, property, plant and equipment 305.1m, current receivables 5.0m, held for sale assets 9.9m and intangible assets 109.3m.
These were recognised as a result of the longterm view of spark spreads at Medway and Keadby, leading to a change the way in which the plants are operationally configured, and also following the goodwill impairment review of the Gas Storage CGU and updated development expectations associated with legacy Metering assets 30.0m and North Sea exploration assets 22.0m.
In addition, further impairment charges in respect of the station running hours at Ferrybridge and in respect of the future prospects for the European wind portfolio were recognised.
Carbon dioxide emissions allowances recognised as intangible assets purchased to cover the emissions liabilities at the Groups thermal plants were impaired based on prevailing market prices.
Exceptional charges were also recognised in relation to commodity contracts associated with thermal Generation assets 37.4m.
In addition costs associated with Retail restructuring and the impairment of other financial assets 35.6m were recognised as exceptional in the year to 31 March 2012. ii Certain remeasurements Certain remeasurements arising from IAS 39 are disclosed separately to aid understanding of the underlying performance of the Group.
