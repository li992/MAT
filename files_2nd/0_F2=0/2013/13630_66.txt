These calculations use cash flow projections on actual operating results and management forecasts.
Strategic Report 01-41 95 Directors 42-45 Governance 46-71 Financial Statements 72-123 Company Information 124-126 11. gOOdwill continued The key assumptions in the annual impairment review which cover all CGUs are set out below: i Management forecasts The three year plan is a bottom up process which takes place as part of the annual budget process.
The three year plan is prepared by each reporting entities management reflecting their view of the local market, known projects and experience of past performance.
The annual budget and the three year plan are approved by the Board each year.
ii Long term growth rates In the period after the three year plan growth rates are forecast at 2% per annum for each CGU 2012: 2%.
A rate of 2% is considered to be prudent given the significant organic growth of the business over the last 10 years.
iii Discount rates All Rotork divisions operate in the same industry sectors and markets around the world.
Therefore discount rates for each of the CGUs are considered to be 10.5 % 2012: 10.4% which represents a reasonable rate for a market participant in this sector.
Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken for each CGU to assess the impact of any reasonable change in assumptions.
Using the key assumptions above there is no reasonable change that would cause the carrying values of any CGU to exceed the recoverable amount apart from Soldo and Fairchild, the sensitivities for which are explained below.
With regard to Soldo, which has only been part of the Group for 14 months, downside sensitivities have been assessed.
An increase in the discount rate to 14.9% would result in the goodwill being impaired.
If the long term growth rate was 3% rather than 2%, the discount rate would need to increase to 15.7% for the goodwill to become impaired.
With regard to Fairchild, downside sensitivities have been assessed and an increase in the discount rate to 15.0% 2012: 12.8% would result in the goodwill being impaired.
If the long term growth rate was 3% rather than 2%, the discount rate would need to increase to 15.8% 2012: 13.6% for the goodwill to become impaired.
It is anticipated that as Soldo and Fairchild become more established within the Group and each of the companies leverage the sales network opportunities the long term growth rate should comfortably exceed the 2.0% growth rate assumed in the forecast.
