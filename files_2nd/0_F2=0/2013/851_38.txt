As at 31 December 2013, the reduction in the rate of corporation tax to 20 per cent had been substantively enacted.
Factors affecting the tax expense for the year are explained as follows: 2012 2013 restated million million Profit before income tax from continuing operations 255 254 Expected income tax expense 59 62 Non-deductible expenses pre-exceptional 12 9 Non-deductible expenses exceptional 1 Non-taxable income pre-exceptional 6 5 Impact of providing deferred tax on pension surplus at 20.0 per cent 2012: 35.0 per cent 21 1 Impact of change in UK tax rate to 20.0 per cent 2012: 23.0 per cent on deferred tax 3 Overseas income and expenses taxed at rates other than 23.25 per cent 2012: 24.5 per cent 25 3 Change in recognition of deferred tax assets 28 11 Other adjustments in respect of prior years 24 10 Effects of results of joint ventures 4 4 Total income tax expense for the year for continuing operations 69 47 112 AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2013 Overview Strategic report Governance Financials 8 Income tax continuing operations continued 2012 2013 restated million million Tax recognised directly in equity Current tax 1 Deferred tax note 15 21 27 Tax charge recognised directly in equity 21 26 As at 31 December 2013, the deferred tax liability arising on the UK pension surplus has been measured at the substantively enacted UK tax rate of 20 per cent.
It was previously measured at 35 per cent being the tax rate that would be applied if the surplus was refunded.
The change in the year reflects the fact there is no longer any reasonable expectation of a refund of the pension surplus in advance of anything that may become due on the eventual winding-up of the scheme.
The impact of the change is a deferred tax credit in respect of continuing operations of 21 million, a deferred tax credit in respect of discontinued operations of 4 million and a deferred tax charge of 12 million recognised in other comprehensive income.
9 Loss profit for the year from discontinued operations Discontinued operations represent the residual assets and retained obligations in respect of businesses sold in prior years, as well as the UK conventional power business, which was discontinued in the year.
In accordance with IFRS 5, the post-tax results of discontinued operations are disclosed separately in the consolidated income statement.
The results of the discontinued operations are as follows: 2012 2013 restated million million Revenue 15 70 Cost of sales and net operating expenses 25 74 Loss before exceptional items and income tax 10 4 Attributable tax 2 1 8 3 Loss on disposal 6 11 Tax on disposals 6 3 Other exceptional items 17 Tax on exceptional items 4 Loss profit for the year from discontinued operations 8 2 Other exceptional items in 2012 related to the recognition of an insurance receivable, following the Supreme Court judgement onmesothelioma liability.

The review of goodwill for indications of impairment by management is performed against the three core geographies ofAmericas, Europe and Growth Regions, being the lowest level of cash-generating units CGU monitored forgoodwill purposes.
This is consistent with the integration of acquisitions into the three segments in order to generate synergies.
Goodwill has been allocated between geographic segments on a relative fair value basis.
The recoverable amount of the CGU has been based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections included in the financial budgets approved by management covering a two-year period and pre-tax discount rates as set out in the table below.
Given the current market conditions, management believe that the discount rates chosen are conservative.
For the purposes of the calculation of the recoverable amount, the cash flow projections beyond the two-year period include 2 per cent growth per annum 2012: 2 per cent, which is in line with long-term average growth rates for the regions in which the CGUs operate.
The value in use has been compared to the carrying value foreach CGU and no impairment is required nor has been charged in respect of any of the CGUs.
The financial budgets reflect managements judgement of the future cash flows which includes past experience and 1 expectations of future performance.
The most significant assumptions relate to EBITA margin and the conversion of EBITA into cash cash conversion.
Revenue is underpinned by a secure order book for each CGU and the order book remains strong at 4.1 billion as at 31 December 2013 2012: 3.6 billion.
The selection of EBITA margin takes into account the margins being generated on contracts in progress and managements view of the margin on orders received, and is consistent with Vision 2015 objectives.
The cash conversion reflects past experience and current contract mix.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed, at the individual CGU level, in order to review the impact of changes in key assumptions.
For example, a 10 per cent decrease in volume, with all other assumptions held constant, or a 1 per cent decrease in margin, with all other assumptions held constant, did not identify any impairments.
Similarly, zero growth after the initial two-year period, with all other assumptions held constant or a 1 per cent increase in discount rate, did notidentify any impairments.

AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2013 119 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 14 Retirement benefit assets and liabilities Defined benefit schemes The group operates a number of pension schemes for UK and overseas employees.
The principal defined benefit schemes are in the UK, with the main schemes being the AMEC Staff pension scheme and the AMEC Executive pension scheme.
These schemes were closed to new members during 2012 but remain open to further accrual.
The majority of overseas members are in defined contribution schemes.
Contributions by the group into defined contribution schemes are disclosed in note 6.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits was amended in June 2011.
The impact on the group has been to replace interest cost and expected return on plan assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit asset liability.
Details of the restatement are included in note 1.
The groups main defined benefit plans are average salary plans for UK employees the AMEC Staff pension scheme andthe AMEC Executive pension scheme, which require contributions to be made to a separately administered fund.
These schemes are governed by the employment laws of the UK.
The level of benefits provided depends on the members length of service and salary each year.
Once the benefits are in payment, the pension is adjusted each year relative to the UKs Retail Prices Index.
The defined benefit plans require contributions to be made to a separately administered fund.
The fund is established under trust law and is governed by a Board of Trustees, which consists of employers and employees representatives together with two independent trustees.
The Board of Trustees is responsible for the administration of the plan assets and for the definition of the investment strategy.
Every three years, the Board of Trustees is required to review the level of funding in the pension plans as required by legislation.
The Board of Trustees decides the contribution levels in consultation with the employers based on the results of this triennial review.
In the event that there is a funding deficit, the Trustees and employers will agree a recovery plan to eliminate that deficit over as short a period as is reasonably affordable.
Due to the nature of the liabilities, the pension plans are exposed to inflation, interest rate risk and changes in the life expectancy for pensioners.
As the plan assets include significant investments in quoted equities, the group is also exposed to equity market risk.
The valuations used have been based on the most recent valuation of the two major UK schemes as at 31 March 2011 andupdated by the schemes actuaries for the requirement to assess the present value of the liabilities of the schemes asat 31 December 2013.
The assets of the schemes are stated at their aggregate market value as at 31 December 2013.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries in relation to the main UK schemes are as follows: 31 December 31 December 2013 2012 per cent per cent Rate of discount 4.6 4.5 Rate of inflation 3.3 2.9 Rate of increase in salaries 3.3 2.9 Rate of increase in pensions in payment service before after 1 January 2008 3.2 2.2 2.8 2.0 The main overseas schemes as at 31 December 2013 consist of three funded defined benefit schemes held in Canada and The Law Companies Group, Inc Pension Plan that was acquired as part of the acquisition of MACTEC.
A discount rate of 4.9 per cent 2012: 4.3 per cent and salary inflation rate of 2.75 per cent 2012: 2.75 per cent have been used for the three defined benefit schemes held in Canada.
A discount rate of 4.7 per cent 2012: 3.7 per cent has been used for the Law Companies Group, Inc. Pension Plan retirement scheme.
No further benefits are being accrued in this scheme.

124 AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2013 Overview Strategic report Governance Financials 15 Deferred tax and liabilities continued Factors affecting the tax charge in future years There are a number of factors that may affect the groups future tax charge including the resolution of open issues with taxauthorities, corporate acquisitions and disposals, the use of brought-forward losses and changes in tax legislation andtax rates.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items: 31 December 31 December 2013 2012 million million Deductible temporary differences 33 20 Tax losses 20 14 53 34 Tax losses and deductible temporary differences not recognised by the group do not expire under current tax legislation.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the group can utilise these assets.
In addition, claims have been made to HM Revenue & Customs HMRC to offset tax losses of up to 79 million against thegroups UK taxable profits.
These losses were generated in a legacy German business in accounting periods up to 31December 2002.
If successful, the claims will result in a refund of UK corporation tax.
The amount and availability oftherefund depends on a number of factors which are currently being discussed with HMRC.
This potential refund isnotincluded as an asset in the accounts.
Unrecognised deferred tax liabilities No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of 355 million 2012: 551 million of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and joint ventures because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is not probable that such differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of unrecognised deferred tax liabilities in respect of these unremitted earnings is estimated to be 16 million 2012: 29 million.

126 AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2013 Overview Strategic report Governance Financials 19 Capital and financial risk management Capital management The objective of the groups capital management is to ensure that it has a strong financial position from which to grow the business to meet its Vision 2015 targets and is able to maximise shareholder value.
The appropriate capital structure for the group comprises of a mix of debt and equity.
The mix is determined by considering business profile and strategy, financial policies and availability and cost of funding.
The group is currently in a net cash position.
The long-term net debt is expected to be no more than two times EBITDA.
The group may exceed this operating parameter should the business profile require it.
However, it is expected that any increases would be temporary given the net operational cash flows of the group.
The group has committed banking facilities of 477 million 2012: 377 million.
This consists of a 377 million multi-currency revolving facility that was taken out on 18 July 2012.
The facility is committed for five years and is available for general corporate purposes.
In addition on 9 April 2013 the group entered into a 100 million Sterling term loan for a period of 12months.
As at 31 December 2013, 120 million 2012: 150 million of the loans and facilities had been utilised.
In February 2012, the board approved a share buyback programme of 400 million.
During the year a total of 4 million shares 31 December 2012: 33 million shares have been purchased under this programme.
During 2012 this included theuse of forward share purchase contracts through close periods.
The group completed the buyback programme on8February 2013.
No changes were made to the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during 2013 or 2012.
Financial risk management The principal financial risks to which the group is exposed are: foreign currency exchange risk: funding and liquidity risk: counterparty credit risk: and interest rate risk.
The board has approved policies for the management of these risks.
The groups treasury department manages funding, liquidity, credit risk and risks arising from movements in interest and foreign currency rates within a framework of policies and guidelines approved by the board.
The treasury department does not operate as a profit centre and the undertaking of speculative transactions is not permitted.
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines authorised and reviewed by the board, most recently in October 2013.
Foreign currency exchange risk The group publishes its consolidated accounts in Sterling.
The majority of the groups trading income is denominated in the local currency of the business operations which provides a natural hedge against the currency of its cost base.
Where commercial contracts are undertaken which are denominated in foreign currencies, the group seeks to mitigate the foreign exchange risk, when the cash flow giving rise to such exposure becomes certain or highly probable.
This is achieved through the use of forward currency arrangements, which may include the purchase of currency options.
There are currently no material transactional exposures which have been identified and remain unhedged.
AMEC has no reason to believe that any outstanding forward contract will not be able to be settled from the underlying commercial transactions.
A portion of the groups earnings is generated in non-Sterling currencies.
Such overseas profits are translated into Sterling at the average exchange rate prevailing throughout the year.
There is currently no hedging in place for profits generated in non-Sterling currencies but the impact on group profits is monitored on an ongoing basis.
In addition, the group has various assets denominated in foreign currencies, principally US Dollars and Canadian Dollars.
A proportion of these assets, including unamortised goodwill, had been designated in net investment hedges using cross-currency instruments.
The policy was changed in 2009 to cease translation hedging for core assets of the business and the remaining hedging contracts matured during the year.
In specific circumstances, for example the planned repatriation of foreign assets, the group may from time to time enter into new net investment hedges to manage foreign exchange risks.
AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2013 127 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 19 Capital and financial risk management continued Hedging of foreign currency exchange risk cash flow hedges The group looks to mitigate the foreign exchange risk typically arising where contracts are awarded in, or involve costs in, non-local currency.
Forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps are used for this purpose and are designated as cash flow hedges.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of forward contracts and swaps designated as cash flow hedges are as follows: 2013 2012 2013 2012 Notional Notional Carrying Carrying contract contract amount and amount and amount amount fair value fair value million million million million Current assets 56 13 3 Current liabilities 12 13 68 26 3 The following tables indicate the periods in which the cash flows associated with the forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are expected to occur and the periods in which they are expected to impact profit or loss: 2013 Carrying Expected 12 months 1 to 2 2 to 5 amount cash flows or less years years million million million million million Forward exchange contracts Assets 3 56 55 1 Liabilities 12 12 3 68 67 1 2012 Carrying Expected 12 months 1 to 2 2 to 5 amount cash flows or less years years million million million million million Forward exchange contracts Assets 13 12 1 Liabilities 13 9 3 1 26 21 4 1 There was no charge for ineffectiveness recognised in either 2013 or 2012.
Hedging of foreign currency exchange risk fair value through income statement Certain forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps are not designated as cash flow hedges and changes in their fair value are recognised through the income statement.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of these forward contracts and swaps are as follows: 2013 2012 2013 2012 Notional Notional Carrying Carrying contract contract amount and amount and amount amount fair value fair value million million million million Current assets 36 71 2 Current liabilities 13 73 49 144 2 128 AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2013 Overview Strategic report Governance Financials 19 Capital and financial risk management continued Hedging of foreign currency exchange risk net investment hedges The group previously had forward foreign exchange contracts which had been designated as hedges of the net investments in core subsidiaries in Canada and the US.
The group revised its policy and the existing hedging contracts were not replaced when they matured.
All such remaining hedging contracts matured during the year.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of swaps designated as net investment hedges are as follows: 2013 2012 2013 2012 Notional Notional Carrying Carrying contract contract amount and amount and amount amount fair value fair value million million million million Current liabilities 14 3 A net foreign exchange loss for the year of 1 million 2012: gain of 1 million was recognised in the translation reserve inrespect of these forward foreign exchange contracts and currency interest rate swaps.
Other financial derivative assets and liabilities The group has other financial derivative assets of 1 million 2012: 1 million and financial derivative liabilities of1million 2012: 1 million.
Sensitivity analysis The group hedges its material transaction-related exposures and hence has no material transactional profit or loss sensitivity.
Funding and liquidity risk The groups policy aims to ensure the constant availability of an appropriate amount of funding to meet both current and future forecast requirements consistent with the groups budget and strategic plans.
The group will finance operations and growth from its existing cash resources and the 477 million committed banking facilities.
The requirement to enter into additional external facilities has been kept under review during the year.
Appropriate facilities will be maintained to meet ongoing requirements for bank guarantees and letters of credit.
Counterparty credit risk The group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its financial instruments.
The effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk is a key component of the groups risk management activities.
The credit risk associated with customers is considered as part of each tender review process and is addressed initially through contract payment terms.
Where appropriate, payment security is sought.
Credit control practices are applied thereafter during the project execution phase.
A right to interest and suspension is normally sought in all contracts.
Credit risks arising from treasury activities are managed by a central treasury function in accordance with the board approved treasury policy.
The objective of the policy is to diversify and minimise the groups exposure to credit risk from itstreasury activities by ensuring that surplus funds are placed with a diversified range of 25 to 30 mainstream banks andwith each counterparty up to a pre-approved limit.
These limits are set at prudent levels by the board and are based primarily on credit ratings set by Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch.
Credit ratings are monitored continually by the group treasury department.
The group treasury department monitors counterparty exposure on a global basis to avoid an over-concentration ofexposure to any one counterparty.

Trade receivable exposures are typically with large companies and government-backed organisations and the credit ratings of these organisations are monitored.
Credit risks are minimised through the use of letters of credit, parent company guarantees, insurance instruments and forward funding where achievable.
The groups most significant customer in 2013 accounted for around 8 per cent 2012: 15 per cent of continuing revenues, and around 4 per cent 2012: similar percentage of current trade and other receivables.
The revenue was generatedin theAmericas.
Interest rate risk The group was in both a net cash and net deficit position during the year.
When the group is in a net cash position long-term interest rate hedging for periods beyond three to six months is not considered appropriate as the surplus cashis viewed as temporary.
The 377 million multi-currency revolving credit facility is subject to an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin depending onleverage.
The 100 million Sterling term loan is subject to an interest rate of LIBOR plus a fixed margin.

Legal claims and actions AMEC has taken internal and external legal advice in considering known or reasonably likely legal claims and actions by or against the company.
Consequently, it carefully assesses the likelihood of the success of a claim or action.
AMEC makes an appropriate provision for those legal claims or actions against the company on the basis of the likely outcome but makes no provision for those which are, in its view, unlikely to succeed.
Provisions of 37 million 2012: 40 million are shown in note 21 in respect of these claims.
Known and reasonably likely legal claims or actions for which a provision has not been established are not expected to have a material impact on the group.
The possibility of other claims being made in the future is considered by AMEC, butin general their occurrence or outcome cannot be predicted within any degree of certainty.
