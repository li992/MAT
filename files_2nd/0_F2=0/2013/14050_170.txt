Goodwill continued Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis has been performed for each key assumption and, except as noted below, the Directors have not identified any reasonably possible change in a key assumption that would cause the carrying value of net assets, including goodwill, to exceed the recoverable amount.
Sensitivity analysis shows that a 1% increase in the discount rate would result in an impairment of the Americas CGU of 40m, the Health CGU of 3m and the Global Services CGU of 58m.
A 1% increase in the discount rate would not cause the operating assets, including goodwill, to exceed their recoverable amount on any other CGU.
Sensitivity analysis shows that a 1% decrease in the terminal growth rate would result in an impairment of the Americas CGU of 14m, the Health CGU of 1m and the Global Services CGU of 41m.
A 1% decrease in the terminal growth rate would not cause the operating assets, including goodwill, to exceed their recoverable amount on any other CGU.
If the short term growth rate were to equal the terminal growth rate applied to the Health CGU forecast this would result in an impairment of 20m.
