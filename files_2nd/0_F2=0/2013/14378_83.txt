When shares recognised as equity are repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, net of any tax effects, is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented in the treasury share reserve.
When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented within share premium.
They are not listed on any stock exchange and have extremely limited rights and effectively have no value.
These rights are summarised as follows: The holder shall not be entitled to participate in the profits of the Company: The holder shall not have any right to participate in any distribution of the Companys assets on a winding up or other distribution except that after the return of the nominal amount paid up on each share in the capital of the Company of any class other than the deferred shares and the distribution of a further $1,000 in respect of each such share there shall be distributed to a holder of a deferred share for each deferred share held by him an amount equal to the nominal value of the deferred share: The holder shall not be entitled to receive notice, attend, speak or vote at any general meeting of the Company: and The Company may create, allot and issue further shares or reduce or repay the whole or any part of its share capital or other capital reserves without obtaining the consent of the holders of the deferred shares.
The Groups objectives when managing capital are to ensure the Group has adequate funds to continue as a going concern and sufficient flexibility within the capital structure to fund the ongoing growth of the business and to take advantage of business development opportunities including acquisitions.
The Group determines the amount of capital taking into account changes in business risks and future cash requirements.
The Group reviews its capital structure on an ongoing basis and uses share buy-backs, dividends and the issue of new shares to adjust the retained capital.
The Group considers the capital that it manages to be as follows: 2013 2012 2011 $ million $ million $ million Share capital 184 193 191 Share premium 535 488 413 Capital redemption reserve 10 Treasury shares 322 735 766 Retained earnings and other reserves 3,640 3,938 3,349 4,047 3,884 3,187 Smith & Nephew ANNuAl report 2013 138 FiNANCiAl StAtemeNtS Notes to the Group accounts continued 19 Equity continued 19.2 Treasury shares Treasury shares represents the holding of the Companys own shares in respect of the Smith & Nephew Employees Share Trust and shares bought back as part of the share buy-back programme.
On 2 May 2013, as part of the new Capital Allocation Framework, the Group announced the start of a new share buy-back programme to return $300m of surplus capital to its Shareholders.
The programme has now been suspended as a result of our agreement to acquire ArthroCare Corp. announced on 3 February 2014.
As at 31 December 2013, a total of 18.2m ordinary shares 2.0% had been purchased at a cost of $226m and 51.0m ordinary shares 5.7% had been cancelled.
The maximum number of ordinary shares held in treasury during 2013 was 65.2m 7.3% with a nominal value of $13.0m.
The Smith & Nephew 2004 Employees Share Trust Trust was established to hold shares relating to the long-term incentive plans referred to in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The Trust is administered by an independent professional trust company resident in Jersey and is funded by a loan from the Company.
The cost of the Trust is charged to the income statement as it accrues.
A partial dividend waiver is in place in respect of those shares held under the long-term incentive plans.
The trust only accepts dividends in respect of nil-cost options and deferred bonus plan shares.
The waiver represents less than 1% of the total dividends paid.
