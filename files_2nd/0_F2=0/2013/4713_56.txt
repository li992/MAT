Included within aggregate remuneration is a 16 million charge 2012 88 million gain: 2011 64 million charge in respect of exceptional operating items.
Employers pension costs include 13 million 2012 13 million: 2011 7 million in respect of defined contribution plans, representing contributions payable to these plans by the group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
Post employment benefits The group operates a number of pension plans throughout the world, devised in accordance with local conditions and practices.
The larger plans are generally of the defined benefit type and are funded by payments to separately administered trusts or insurance companies.
The principal plans are in the United Kingdom, Ireland and the United States where benefits are based on employees length of service and salary at retirement.
All valuations were performed by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method to determine pension costs.
The most recent full valuations of the significant defined benefit pension plans were carried out as follows: United Kingdom on 31 March 2012: Ireland on 31 December 2009: and United States on 1 January 2013.
The triennial valuation of the principal plan in Ireland as at 31 December 2012 is in progress.
The results of this valuation are expected to be agreed by Diageo and the trustee in calendar year 2013.
The measurement dates used to calculate the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are the respective balance sheet dates.
In the United Kingdom, the Diageo Pension Scheme a final salary defined benefit pension plan the UK Scheme closed to new members in November 2005 and the Guinness Ireland Group Pension Scheme in Ireland the Irish Scheme closed to new members in May 2013.
Employees who have joined Diageo in the United Kingdom thereafter have been eligible to become members of the Diageo Lifestyle Plan a cash balance defined benefit pension plan and in Ireland to become members of the personal retirement savings account.
The assets of the UK and Irish pension plans are held in separate trusts administered by trustees to meet long term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
The trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plans beneficiaries.
The two largest pension plans are the UK Scheme in the United Kingdom and the Irish Scheme in Ireland.
For the UK Scheme, the trustee is Diageo Pension Trust Limited.
The appointment of the directors to the board is determined by the Schemes trust documentation.
As required by legislation, one-third of all directors of the Trust are nominated by members of the UK Scheme.
Two member nominated directors have been appointed from the pensioner member community and two from the active member community.
For the Irish Scheme, the appointment of trustees is a Diageo Ireland decision.
Currently Diageo Ireland makes four nominations and appoints three further candidates nominated by representative groupings.
The group also operates a number of plans, primarily in the United States, which provide employees with post employment benefits in respect of medical costs.
These plans are generally unfunded.
In addition, there are a number of other plans which provide post employment benefits other than pensions and medical benefits.
These plans are also included in the figures presented below.
a The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the groups deficit surplus in the main post employment plans at 30 June in the relevant year.
The assumptions used to calculate the charge credit in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 30 June are based on the assumptions disclosed as at the previous 30 June.
Employee costs and post employment benefits continued statements For the main plans in the United Kingdom and Ireland, the salary increase assumptions include an allowance for age related 125 promotional salary increases.
For example in the United Kingdom salary increase assumptions comprise one percentage point above Auditors report in respect of the Group RPI inflation and 0.1 of a percentage point 2012 0.1 and 2011 0.3 of a percentage point for age related promotional salary increases.
126 The salary increase assumption in the United States is not a significant assumption as only a minimal amount of members pension Consolidated entitlement is dependent on a member's projected final salary.
The assumption for medical inflation in the United States and Ireland income statement reduces by 0.5 of a percentage point per year until it reaches 5%.
127 In assessing the groups post retirement liabilities, the mortality assumption for the UK Scheme is based on the CMI birth year tables Consolidated with scaling factors based on the experience of the plan and with suitable future improvements.
The mortality assumption for the Irish statement of Scheme is also based on the mortality experience of that plan with suitable future improvements.
The mortality assumptions for the comprehensive income other plans around the world are based on relevant standard mortality tables and standard mortality improvements in each country.
For the main UK and Irish pension funds, the table below illustrates the expected age at death of an average worker who retires 128 Consolidated currently at the age of 65, and one who is currently

In the Irish plans there are interest statement of rate swaps and repurchase agreements with a fair value gain of 54 million 2012 73 million.
comprehensive income The asset classes include some cash holdings that are temporary.
This cash is likely to be invested imminently and so has been included in the asset class where it is anticipated to be invested in the long term.

129 Post employment benefit assets and liabilities are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet, depending on whether an Consolidated individual plan is in surplus or deficit, as follows: statement of changes in equity 2013 2012 million million 130 Consolidated Non-current assets 312 22 statement of Non-current liabilities 864 1,107 cash flows 552 1,085 131 Accounting policies of the group The expected long term rates of return for equities have been determined by reference to government bond rates minimum risk rates 135 in the countries in which the plans are based.
As at 30 June 2012, to reflect the additional risks associated with equities, expected long Notes to the term rates of return on equities included a risk premium of 4.5% per year in excess of the expected return from government bonds.
This consolidated risk premium was a long term assumption which is set after taking actuarial advice and considering the assumptions used by other FTSE financial statements 100 companies.
The expected long term rates of return for other assets were determined in a similar way, by including an appropriate 183 risk premium relative to government bonds in the relevant country.
As the accounting for post employment benefits will change from Auditors report 1 July 2013 see note 1 b it is no longer necessary to estimate an expected long term rate of return on the assets held by the post inrespect of thecompany employment plans.
The investment strategy for the groups funded post employment plans is decided locally by the trustee of the plan and or 184 Company Diageo, as appropriate, and takes account of the relevant statutory requirements.
The objective for the investment strategy is to achieve balance sheet a target rate of return in excess of the movement on the liabilities, while taking an acceptable level of investment risk relative to the 185 liabilities.
This objective is implemented by using specific allocations to a variety of asset classes that are expected over the long term to Accounting policies deliver the target rate of return.
Most investment strategies have significant allocations to equities, with the intention that this will result of the company in the ongoing cost to the group of the post employment plans being lower over the long term, within acceptable boundaries of risk.
187 Each investment strategy is also designed to control investment risk by managing allocations to asset classes, geographical exposures Notes to the and individual equity exposures.
company financial At 30 June 2013, approximately 30% and 77% 2012 33% and 57% of the UK Schemes liabilities were hedged against future statements movements in interest rates and inflation, respectively, through the use of swaps.
At 30 June 2013, approximately 37% and 45% 190 Principal group 2012 37% and 45% of the Irish Schemes liabilities were hedged against future movements in interest rates and inflation, respectively, companies through the use of swaps.
The discount rates used are based on the yields of high quality fixed income investments.
For the UK plans, which represent approximately 66% of total plan liabilities, the discount rate is determined by reference to the yield curves of AA rated corporate bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows are similar to those of the plans.
A similar process is used to determine the discount rate for the non-UK plans.

During the year ended 30 June 2011 whisky inventory was transferred into the partnership.
The group retains control over the partnership which at 30 June 2013 held inventory with a book value of 695 million 2012 565 million.
The partnership is fully consolidated in the group financial statements.
The UK Scheme acquired a limited interest in the partnership, and as a partner, is entitled to a distribution from the profits of the partnership each year from the date the partnership was established until the year ending 30 June 2024.
This profit share was 25 million in the year ended 30 June 2013 2012 25 million and is expected to be approximately the same amount for the next 11 years.
In 2024 the group will be required, dependent upon the funding position of the UK Scheme at that time, to pay an amount expected to be no greater than the deficit at that time, up to a maximum of 430 million in cash, to the UK Scheme to buy out the UK Schemes interest in the partnership.
If the UK Scheme is in surplus at an actuarial triennial valuation without allowing for the value of the PFP, then Diageo can exit the PFP with the agreement of the trustees.
Under IAS 19 Employee benefits the interest in the partnership does not represent a plan asset for group reporting purposes and therefore the UK Schemes deficit position presented in these financial statements does not reflect the UK Schemes interest in the partnership.
Accordingly, distributions from the partnership to the UK Scheme are reflected in the consolidated group financial statements on a cash basis as distributions are paid.
The group has also agreed to make conditional contributions into escrow if the deficit at the 2015 or 2018 actuarial triennial valuation is in excess of 211 million and 84 million, respectively.
The escrow account would be payable to the UK Scheme by 31 March 2019.
During the year ended 30 June 2013 the group made an additional one off cash contribution of 400 million to the UK Scheme.
In addition to the deficit funding, Diageo continues to make a cash contribution in respect of current service costs based on the UK Scheme trustees valuation.
This contribution is expected to be 55 million to the UK Scheme for the year ending 30 June 2014.
The group has also agreed a deficit funding arrangement with the trustees of the Irish Scheme under which it contributes to the Irish Scheme 21 million 18 million per annum until the year ending 30 June 2029.
The agreement also provides for additional cash contributions into escrow of up to 188 million 161 million if an equivalent reduction in the deficit is not achieved over the 18 year period from 2010 to 2028.
As part of this funding plan, Diageo has granted to the Irish Scheme a contingent asset comprising mortgages over certain land and buildings and fixed and floating charges over certain receivables of the group up to a value of 200 million 171 million.
In addition, the group expects to make cash contributions of up to 97 million 82 million to the Irish Scheme in the year ending 30 June 2014.
The group also expects to make cash contributions of 50 million to all the other UK and Irish post employment plans and a cash contribution of 65 million to all other defined benefit post employment plans in the year ending 30 June 2014.
