DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES All of the Groups financial derivatives are held for economic hedging purposes, although not all may be designated for hedge accounting in accordance with the provisions of IAS 39.
The analysis below therefore splits derivatives between those accounted for as hedges and those which, while representing an economic hedge, do not qualify for this treatment.
All of the financial derivatives shown are valued using methodologies where the principal inputs are directly or indirectly derived from market data and are therefore classi ed within level two of the fair value hierarchy laid down by IFRS 7.
The Groups securitisation borrowings are denominated in sterling, euros and US dollars.
All currency borrowings are swapped at inception so that they have the effect of sterling borrowings.
These swaps provide an effective hedge against exchange rate movements, but the requirement to carry them at fair value leads, when exchange rates have moved signi cantly since the issue of the notes, to large balances for the swaps being carried in the balance sheet.
This is currently the case with both euro and US dollar swaps, although the debit balance is compensated for by retranslating the borrowings at the current exchange rate.
Derivative financial assets and liabilities are included within Financial Assets note 28 and Financial Liabilities note 47 respectively.
