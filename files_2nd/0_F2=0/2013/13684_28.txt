As permitted by IFRS 1 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group has chosen to adopt IFRS 2 Share-based Payments for share options granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested by 1 January 2005.
On this basis, the fair value of employee share options granted is calculated at grant date using an appropriate option pricing model.
The resulting cost is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the options with a corresponding increase in equity.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its service and non-market estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable and the charge to the income statement is adjusted accordingly.
Where the Company grants share options to employees of its subsidiaries, the amount equal to the amount which would otherwise have been charged in the income statement in respect of those options is accounted for as a capital contribution and the Companys cost of investment in its subsidiary is increased accordingly.

POLICIES AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The Groups policies and the risks associated with derivatives and financial instruments are as follows: The Board defines capital as the equity of the Group.
The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market a Market risk confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board of Directors monitors both the demographic spread of shareholders, as well as the Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, will affect the Groups net income or the return on capital employed and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.

The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security The Group does not actively engage in trading of financial assets for speculative purposes.
afforded by a sound capital position.
b Interest rate risk There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
The Group has bank borrowings mainly in euros and sterling and during the prior year issued USPP notes denominated in US dollars and euros.
Interest rate swaps are used to reduce the exposure of the Group to fluctuations in interest rates which are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The Company is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
INTEREST RATE RISK PROFILE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES The interest rate profile of the Groups borrowings at the year end is given in note 19.
An increase of 1% in the interest rate charged during the year on borrowings after the effect of interest rate swaps would have reduced profits before tax by approximately 1.3m 2012: 1.8m before accounting for The interest rate profile of the Groups net debt is shown in note 19. exchange differences.
The Groups floating rate loans bear interest based on Libor or Euribor.
The floating rate borrowings under the banking facilities are typically rolled over c Liquidity risk for a period of three months or less, based on the appropriate Libor Euribor rate.
During the year the Group had in place floating to fixed interest rate In order to improve liquidity and ensure continuity of funding, the Group has a credit agreement with nine recognised international banks providing swaps for euros.
At the year end, one swap remained in place for a nominal value of 16.9m 2012: two swaps 25.0m with a maturity date of March 2014 a 200m multi-currency revolving credit facility, maturing in September 2015.
During the prior year the Group issued $92m and 35m USPP notes and at a fixed rate of 2.468%.
The market value of the interest rate swap at the year end was 0.4 m 2012: 0.6 m. expiring in December 2018 and $124m and 25m USPP notes expiring in December 2021 and during the year agreed a 60m term loan, expiring in 2017, With respect to the USPP notes, $100m of the $216m issued in December 2011 was converted from fixed US dollar to floating euro by the use of five cross with a major UK bank.
currency interest rate swaps: three of these swaps totalling $50m expire in December 2018 with the remaining two, totalling $50m, expiring in December Further short term liquidity requirements are ensured through additional local overdraft facilities as appropriate.
These had a positive market value at the year end of 15.1m 2012: 7.9m.
d Foreign currency risk An increase of 1% in the interest rate charged during the year on borrowings not fixed by interest rate swaps would have reduced profit before tax by approximately 1.1m 2012: 1.8m before accounting for exchange differences, and would reduce net equity by approximately 1.0m 2012: 1.4m.
Of the Groups net assets, 73.9% 2012: 73.7% before borrowings are in non sterling currencies, mainly linked with the euro and held by subsidiaries located in mainland Europe.
The range of interest rates applicable to financial liabilities net of derivatives by principal currency is as follows: In December 2011 the Company issued $216m and 60m fixed rate USPP notes.
In order to manage the interest rate and foreign exchange exposure, 2013 2012 10 cross currency interest swaps were taken out totalling $200m.
These swapped $100m fixed rate into euro fixed rate, and $100m fixed rate into euro Sterling Euro US dollar Sterling Euro US dollar floating rate finance, including a change of principal currencies that will reverse on redemption.
In order to achieve hedge effectiveness these derivatives % % % % % % were designated as cash flow hedges for the US dollar sterling foreign exchange exposure and fair value hedges for the interest rate element as Fixed interest rate n a 4.3-4.8 4.8 n a 2.3-4.8 2.5-4.8 appropriate and a net investment hedge of the sterling euro foreign exchange exposure.
The remaining $16m and 60m were designated as net investment Floating rate interest margin above: hedges.
During the year the mark to market gain on foreign currency hedging instruments designated as fair value hedges taken to the income statement Euribor n a 1.4-2.2 n a n a 0.9-1.6 n a was 4.7m and the fair value adjustment on the related USPP notes was a loss of 4.7m.

The exchange gains or losses on these borrowings are included in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Interest received on cash balances is at normal commercial floating rates.
Exposure to foreign currency exchange risk is minimised by trading in the subsidiaries local currencies wherever possible, by intra-group hedges CURRENCY EXPOSURES and by the use of forward exchange contracts as appropriate.
