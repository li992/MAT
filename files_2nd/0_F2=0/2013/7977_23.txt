The exceptional tax credit of 0.6m represents tax relief on restructuring costs.
In 2012, the restructuring costs of 17.3m represented the cost of headcount reduction across the Group together with the closure of less profitable sites.
The restructuring was carried out to ensure that the Group maintained an organisational structure and efficient cost base across the Group.
Included within this was an impairment charge of 0.8m in respect of property, plant and equipment and 2.1m in respect of goodwill and other intangible assets.
1 Also during 2012, the Group closed two of its UK defined benefit pension schemes to future accrual.
The net gain to the Group of 1 19.2m comprised a curtailment gain of 25.5m net of costs of 6.3m associated with implementing the changes including the harmonisation of pension arrangements.
In 2012, the Group had also recognised a loss of 1.2m as a result of measuring at fair value its 51% equity interest in the Inchcape Independence group prior to the acquisition of the remaining 49%.
The 2012 exceptional tax credit of 0.5m represented relief on restructuring and property costs 3.1m credit, the use of brought 1 forward unprovided tax losses and other reliefs 1.7m credit, offset by a charge arising on pension scheme curtailment gains 4.3m charge.
In 2013 and 2012, restructuring costs have been reported as exceptional items in the consolidated income statement.
In 2013, these costs were reported as exceptional items in the first half of the year.
Given the recent FRC guidance, the Group will give further consideration to how costs of a similar nature are treated in future reporting periods.
2012 reported amounts were: net gain of 19.7m, curtailment gain of 26.0m, tax charge of 4.4m.

com 101 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 5 PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS The Group operates a number of pension and post-retirement benefit schemes for its employees in a number of its businesses, primarily in the UK.
A. UK SCHEMES: BENEFITS, GOVERNANCE, CASH FLOW OBLIGATIONS AND INVESTMENTS The Group operates four main defined benefit Final Salary pension schemes in the UK which are all closed to new employees and largely closed to future benefit accrual.
The schemes are the Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme, the Normand Pension Scheme, the Inchcape Overseas Pension Scheme and the TKM Group Pension Scheme.
The Group also operates a defined benefit Cash Balance scheme in the UK, called Cash, which is designed to meet regulatory requirements for auto-enrolment legislation.
BENEFIT STRUCTURE Final Salary schemes provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided depends on final salary at retirement or leaving date, if earlier and length of service.
The Group underwrites investment, mortality and inflation risks necessary to meet the obligations under the schemes.
In the event of poor returns, increased life expectancy or higher than expected inflation, the Group is required to address any shortfall through a combination of an increase in contributions or by making appropriate adjustments to the schemes.
Cash Balance schemes like the Inchcape Cash Pension scheme allow members to accrue a percentage of their earnings each year, which then grows to provide a lump sum payment on retirement.
Members have accrued benefits under this scheme with effect from 1 January 2013.
The Group underwrites the investment risk to normal retirement age 65, but all inflation and mortality risks associated with benefits are borne solely by the members.
GOVERNANCE Our UK schemes are registered with HMRC and comply fully with the regulatory framework published by the UK Pensions Regulator.
Benefits are paid to members from separate funds administered by Independent Trustees who are appointed by the Group.
The Trustees are required to act in the best interest of the members, and are responsible for making funding and investment decisions in conjunction with the Group.
The Group also has some minor unfunded arrangements relating to post-retirement health and medical plans in respect of past employees.
There are no material defined contribution schemes in the UK.
SCHEME SPECIFIC CASH OBLIGATION INVESTMENT DETAIL INCHCAPE MOTORS PENSION SCHEME CLOSED SCHEME The latest actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out at 5 April 2013 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit credit method.
The actuarial valuation determined that the duration of the liabilities is approximately 18 years and that a small surplus exists on a prudent funding basis.
The Group contributes 0.5m p. a. towards the administrative costs of running the scheme and no further review is scheduled until April 2016.
The investment strategy is to hold 65% of bonds which hedge inflation and interest rate risk, with the remaining 35% held in diversified growth funds which are designed to grow at a rate significantly faster than the liabilities, whilst spreading investment risk across a broad spectrum of asset classes.
Investment performance in excess of that assumed in the valuation is captured by increasing the proportion of hedging assets.
NORMAND PENSION SCHEME CLOSED SCHEME The latest actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out at 5 April 2011 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit credit method.
The actuarial valuation determined that the duration of the liabilities is approximately 24 years and that the scheme was approximately 97% funded on a prudent funding basis.
The Group contributes 0.4m p. a. towards the administrative costs of running the scheme and improving the funding ratio.
The next review is scheduled for April 2014.
The investment strategy is to hold 50% of bonds which hedge inflation and interest rate risk, with the remaining 50% held in diversified growth funds which are designed to grow at a rate significantly faster than the liabilities, whilst spreading investment risk across a broad spectrum of asset classes.

Investments are held in a balanced portfolio of equities and bonds.
TKM GROUP PENSION SCHEME CLOSED SCHEME The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this closed scheme was carried out at 5 April 2013 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit method.
The actuarial valuation determined that the duration of the liabilities is approximately 12 years and that the scheme is considered fully funded on a prudent basis.
No cash contributions are required by the Group and the next review is scheduled for April 2016.
The scheme has a prudent investment strategy with a swap overlay in place to fully hedge inflation and interest rate risks.
Approximately 15% of the assets are invested in diversified growth funds which are designed to grow at a rate significantly faster than the liabilities, whilst spreading investment risk across a broad spectrum of asset classes.
INCHCAPE CASH PENSION SCHEME This scheme is a new defined benefit scheme under which members accrue benefits with effect from 1 January 2013.
An interim valuation was carried out at 5 April 2013 which determined that the scheme was considered fully funded on a prudent basis.
The Group contributed 0.2m towards the administrative costs of running the scheme and the next review is in April 2016.
The initial investment strategy is to invest in diversified growth funds which are designed to grow at a rate significantly faster than the liabilities, whilst spreading investment risk across a broad spectrum of asset classes.
Any outperformance of the investments will be invested in investment grade corporate bonds to hedge against future adverse market moves.
OVERSEAS SCHEMES There are a number of smaller defined benefit schemes overseas, the most significant being the Inchcape Motors Limited Retirement Scheme in Hong Kong.
In general these schemes offer a lump sum on retirement with no further obligation to the employee and assets are held in trust in separately administered funds.
These schemes are typically subject to triennial valuations.
The overseas defined contribution schemes are principally linked to local statutory arrangements.
C. DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement is 6.3m 2012 4.8m.
There are no outstanding contributions to the defined contribution schemes at the year end 2012 nil.
D. DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS As the Groups principal defined benefit schemes are in the UK, these have been reported separately from the overseas schemes.
For the purposes of reporting, actuarial updates have been obtained for the Groups material schemes and these updates are reflected in the amounts reported in the following tables.
The 2012 numbers have been restated to reflect the adoption of IAS 19 revised, as explained in note 34. www.

106 Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 106 Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL  INFORMATION 5 PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS CONTINUED The following disclosures relate to the Groups defined benefit plans only.
E. RISK MANAGEMENT ASSET VOLATILITY Scheme liabilities are calculated on a discounted basis using a discount rate which is set with reference to corporate bond yields.
If scheme assets underperform this yield, then this will create a deficit.
The combined schemes hold approximately 70% of assets as defensive assets gilts, bonds, swaps which mitigate significant changes in yields, and active monitoring plans are in place to identify opportunities to increase the proportion of such assets further when economically possible.
As the schemes mature, the Group reduces the level of investment risk by investing more in government and corporate bonds that better match the liabilities.
However, the Group believes that due to the long term nature of the scheme liabilities, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of the long term investment strategy.
INFLATION RISK The majority of the Groups defined benefit obligations are linked to inflation.
Higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities, although in the majority of cases there are caps on the level of inflationary increases to be applied to pension obligations, and approximately 50% of the Groups total inflation risk is hedged through holding inflation-linked assets such as gilts and swaps.
LIFE EXPECTANCY The plans obligations are to provide a pension for the life of the member, so realised increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans benefit payments.
Future mortality rates cannot be predicted with certainty.
All of the schemes conduct scheme-specific mortality investigations annually, to ensure the Group has a clear understanding of any potential increase in liability due to pensioners living for longer than assumed.
The trustees of the scheme hedge this risk by adopting a prudent approach in their assumption for future improvements.
F. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The disclosures above are dependent on the assumptions used.
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the assumptions used for the UK schemes.
Changes in assumptions have an immaterial effect on the overseas schemes.
IMPACT ON THE DEFINED BENEFIT OBLIGATION United Kingdom 2013 2012 % % Discount rate -0.25% 4.0 4.8 Discount rate 0.25% -3.8 -4.6 Inflation -0.25% -3.4 -4.5 Inflation 0.25% 3.6 4.6 Mortality -1 year 3.3 3.0 The above analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
The above variances have been used as they are believed to be reasonably possible fluctuations.
G. EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS The Group has agreed to pay approximately 1.6m 2012 32.5m to its defined benefit plans in 2014.
The Group does not expect any material changes to the annual cash contributions over the next three years given the funding position of the largest schemes, which account for 90% of the Groups total pension liabilities.
The defined benefit obligations are based on the current value of expected benefit payment cash flows to members over the next several decades.
The average duration of the liabilities is approximately 18 years for the UK schemes.

com 111 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 11 INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED GOODWILL Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash generating units CGUs or group of CGUs hereafter collectively referred to as CGU groups that are expected to benefit from the synergies associated with that business combination.
These CGU groups represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes.
Unless otherwise stated, the Group evaluates goodwill in CGU groupings at a country operation level, e. g. UK Retail, Australia Retail.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to CGU groups within the following reporting segments: 2013 2012 m m United Kingdom 262.1 262.1 Russia and Emerging Markets 202.1 217.6 South Asia 19.4 20.5 Australasia 42.3 9.5 525.9 509.7 Goodwill is subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently where there are indications that the goodwill may be impaired.
Impairment tests were performed for all CGU groups during the year ended 31 December 2013.
The recoverable amounts of all CGU groups were determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on five year financial forecasts prepared by management.
The key assumptions for these forecasts are those relating to revenue growth, operating margins and the level of working capital required to support trading, which have been based on past experience, recent trading and expectations of future changes in the relevant markets.
They also reflect expectations about continuing relationships with key brand partners.
Cash flows after the five year period are extrapolated at an estimated average long term growth rate for each market.
The growth rates used vary between 2% and 5% and are consistent with appropriate external sources for the relevant markets.
Cash flows are discounted back to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate.
The discount rates used are calculated as the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for a risk premium attributable to the relevant country.
The pre-tax discount rates used vary between 10% and 12% and reflect long term country risk.
112 Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 112 Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL  INFORMATION 11 INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED The assumptions used with regards to pre-tax discount rates and long term growth rates in those reporting segments with material goodwill balances were as follows: Long term Discount rate growth rate United Kingdom 10% 2% Russia and Emerging Markets 10% to 12% 5% South Asia 10% 2% Australasia 11% 2% IMPAIRMENT No impairment charge was recognised in the year ended 31 December 2013.
In 2012, an impairment charge of 0.2m was recognised relating to sold sites.
SENSITIVITIES The Groups value in use calculations are sensitive to a change in the key assumptions used, most notably the discount rates and the long term growth rates.
With the exception of the Groups businesses in Russia and Lithuania, a reasonably possible change in a key assumption will not cause a material impairment of goodwill in any of the other CGU groups.
The Groups goodwill in the Russia and Emerging Markets segment at 31 December 2013 is allocated as follows: Impairment Net book Cost provision value m m m Russia 178.0 178.0 Latvia 44.2 44.2 Lithuania 21.6 21.6 Other 2.7 0.2 2.5 At 31 December 2013 246.5 44.4 202.1 The value in use calculations for the Groups business in Russia currently exceed the carrying value by approximately 9%.
A 0.5% reduction in the long term growth rate would reduce the headroom available to approximately 2% of the carrying value, whilst a 0.5% increase in the discount rate would almost eliminate the headroom.
The value in use calculations for the Groups business in Lithuania currently exceed the carrying value by approximately 34%.
A 0.5% increase in the discount rate or a 0.5% reduction in the long term growth rate would reduce the headroom to approximately 25% of the carrying value.

The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of 35m 2012 27m relating to tax relief on trading losses.
The asset represents 141m 2012 115m of losses at the standard blended rate of 24.5% 2012 23.4%.
The asset is not recognised, as 141m 2012 115m relates to losses which exist within legal entities that are not forecast to generate taxable income with reasonable certainty in the foreseeable future.
The deferred tax asset of 6.2m 2012 10.5m in respect of tax losses relates to trading losses in Russia 2.6m, Belgium 1.7m and other territories 1.9m where future profits are anticipated with reasonable certainty.

The key territory holding the losses is the UK.
No deferred tax is recognised on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures.
The vast majority of overseas reserves can now be repatriated to the UK with no tax cost.
There are a small number of territories that do not qualify for this treatment but the annual profits for these territories are self assessed for UK current tax each year and hence no deferred tax accrues.
If all overseas earnings were repatriated with immediate effect, a tax charge of 3.5m 2012 nil would be payable.
As the overseas reserves are anticipated to be repatriated within 12 months, the provision has been made to current tax.
The 11.4m 2012 13.1m net deferred tax liability for other timing differences consists of a 28.4m 2012 31.1m liability in respect of the net book value of tangible fixed assets that do not qualify for tax allowances and property revaluations and a 17.0m 2012 18.0m deferred tax asset in respect of provisions and other temporary differences between the accounts base and the tax base.

MARKET RISK AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being primarily UK interest rates and the Australian Dollar to Japanese Yen exchange rate.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges from movements in interest rates are assumed to be recorded fully in equity: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges from movements in interest rates have an immaterial effect on the consolidated income statement and equity due to compensating adjustments in the carrying value of debt: changes in the carrying value of financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the consolidated income statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the consolidated income statement.
D. INTEREST RATE RISK AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The Groups interest rate policy has the objective of minimising net interest expense, and protecting the Group from material adverse movements in interest rates.
Throughout 2013, the Group has borrowed at floating rates only after taking into account existing interest rate hedging activities.
This approach maximises the Groups exposure to the current low interest rate environment.
If hedging is deemed appropriate by management in the future, the Board has approved the fixing of up to 30% of gross borrowings.
Instruments approved for this purpose include interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options.
The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates arises primarily from the floating rate interest payable on the Groups 10 and 12 year loan notes, bank borrowings, supplier related finance and the returns available on surplus cash.
INTEREST RATE RISK TABLE The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact of floating rate borrowings.

com 125 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 23 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED E. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Group publishes its consolidated financial statements in Sterling and faces currency risk on the translation of its earnings and net assets, a significant proportion of which are in currencies other than Sterling.
TRANSACTION EXPOSURE HEDGING The Group has transactional currency exposures, where sales or purchases by an operating unit are in currencies other than that units functional currency.
For a significant proportion of the Group, these exposures are removed as trading is denominated in the relevant local currency.
In particular, local billing arrangements are in place for many of our businesses with our brand partners.
The principal exception is for our business in Australia, which purchases vehicles in Japanese Yen.
In this instance, the Group seeks to hedge forecast transactional foreign exchange rate risk using forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income to the extent it is effective and recycled into the consolidated income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the consolidated income statement.
Under IAS 39, hedges are documented and tested for hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis.
HEDGE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY DEBT The Group uses cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the forward foreign currency risk associated with the US$436m Private Placement.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the consolidated income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the consolidated income statement.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK TABLE The following table shows the Group sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates on its Japanese Yen financial instruments.
In this table, financial instruments are only considered sensitive to foreign exchange rates when they are not in the functional currency of the entity that holds them.
Increase decrease in Effect on exchange equity rate m 2013 Yen 10% 0.5 Yen -10% 0.5 2012 Yen 10% 0.9 Yen -10% 0.9 F. CREDIT RISK The amount due from counterparties arising from cash deposits and the use of financial instruments creates credit risk.
The Group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties via their credit ratings where applicable and through its policy of limiting its exposure to any one party to ensure that they are within Board approved limits and that there are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Group policy is to deposit cash and use financial instruments with counterparties with a long term credit rating of A or better, where available.
The notional amounts of financial instruments used in interest rate and foreign exchange management do not represent the credit risk arising through the use of these instruments.
The immediate credit risk of these instruments is generally estimated by the fair value of contracts with a positive value.
Credit limits are reviewed regularly.

The maximum exposure to credit risk for cash at bank, cash equivalents, receivables and other financial assets is represented by their carrying amount.
Total cash at bank of 290.3m 2012 324.4m includes cash in the Groups regional pooling arrangements which are offset against borrowings for interest purposes.
Netting of cash and overdraft balances in the consolidated statement of financial position only occurs to the extent that there is the legal ability and intention to settle net.
As such, overdrafts are presented in current liabilities to the extent that there is no intention to offset with the cash balance.
Trade receivables include amounts due from a number of finance houses in respect of vehicles sold to customers on finance arranged through the Group.
An independent credit rating agency is used to assess the credit standing of each finance house.
Limits for the maximum outstanding with each finance house are set accordingly.
Title to the vehicles sold on finance resides with the Group until cleared funds are received from the finance house in respect of a given vehicle.
G. LIQUIDITY RISK Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
Refer to the Strategic Report on page 36 for discussion of liquidity risks to the Group.

com 127 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 23 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED H. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT In accordance with IFRS 13, disclosure is required for financial instruments that are measured in the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value.
This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level for the following fair value measurement hierarchy: quoted prices in active markets level 1 : inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly level 2 : or inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data level 3.
The following table presents the Groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value: 2013 2012 Level 1 Level 2 Total Level 1 Level 2 Total m m m m m m Assets Derivatives used for hedging 106.2 106.2 116.1 116.1 Available for sale financial assets 9.7 9.7 6.7 6.7 9.7 106.2 115.9 6.7 116.1 122.8 Liabilities Derivatives used for hedging 41.4 41.4 62.6 62.6 Level 1 represents the fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets and is based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market level 2 is determined by using valuation techniques which include the present value of estimated future cash flows.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at their fair values.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps represents the difference between the value of the outstanding contracts at their contracted rates and a valuation calculated using the spot rates of exchange prevailing at 31 December 2013.
The Groups derivative financial instruments comprise the following: Assets Liabilities 2013 2012 2013 2012 m m m m Cross currency interest rate swap 89.8 111.8 Forward foreign exchange contracts 16.4 4.3 41.4 62.6 106.2 116.1 41.4 62.6 The ineffective portion recognised in the consolidated income statement that arises from fair value hedges amounts to a gain of 2.3m 2012 gain of 4.8m.

The cash flows relating to these contracts are generally expected to occur within 15 months of the end of the reporting period 2012 15 months.
The nominal principal amount of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts relating to transactional exposures at 31 December 2013 was 760.4m 2012 955.9m.
Net fair value gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in shareholders equity see note 25 on forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2013 are expected to be released to the consolidated income statement within 15 months of the end of the reporting period 2012 15 months.
FAIR VALUE HEDGE At 31 December 2013, the Group had in place five cross currency interest rate swaps.
Four of these total US$475m, which hedge changes in the fair value of the Groups 10 and 12 year loan notes.
Under these swaps, the Group receives fixed rate US Dollar interest of 5.94% on US$275m and 6.04% on US$200m and pays LIBOR 85bps and LIBOR 90bps for the 10 and 12 year notes respectively.
An additional US$39.2m cross currency interest rate swap was put in place after debt reduction in 2009 to offset the non-required portion of the original US$475m swaps.
Under this swap, the Group pays US Dollar interest of 6.04% on US$39.2m and receives LIBOR 214bps for the 12 year notes only.
The loan notes and cross currency interest rate swaps have the same critical terms.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The Groups capital structure consists of equity and debt.
Equity represents funds raised from shareholders and debt represents funds raised from banks and other financial institutions.
The primary objective of the Groups management of debt and equity is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to finance the Groups activities, both now and in the future, and to maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Directors consider the Groups capital structure and dividend policy at least twice a year prior to the announcement of results, taking into account the Groups ability to continue as a going concern and the requirements of its business plan.
The committed bank facilities and Private Placement borrowings are subject to the same interest cover covenant based on an adjusted EBITA measure to interest on consolidated borrowings.
The Group is required to maintain a ratio of not less than three to one and was compliant with this covenant throughout the year.
The Group monitors group leverage by reference to three tests: Adjusted EBITA interest cover, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and the ratio of net debt to market capitalisation.
2013 2012 Adjusted EBITA interest cover times 149.6 116.0 Net debt to EBITDA times n a n a Net debt market capitalisation percentage n a n a Calculated as Adjusted EBITA interest on consolidated borrowings.

ACQUISITIONS On 1 March 2013, the Group acquired the Trivett Automotive group in Australia.
Details of the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities as at the date of acquisition are set out below: 2013 m Assets and liabilities acquired, at fair value Intangible assets note 11 0.1 Property, plant and equipment note 12 37.5 Tax assets 4.8 Inventory 76.3 1 Trade and other receivables 15.5 Cash and cash equivalents 4.8 Trade and other payables 92.3 Provisions note 21 4.5 Borrowings 6.0 Tax liabilities 4.3 Net assets acquired 31.9 Goodwill 42.7 74.6 Purchase consideration Satisfied by Consideration Cash paid 78.9 Consideration Cash expected to be repaid 4.3 Purchase consideration 74.6 Net cash in business acquired 4.8 Borrowings in business acquired 6.0 Total consideration 75.8 1.
Included within Trade and other receivables are trade receivables with a fair value of 14.8m with the gross contractual amount being 14.9m.
The goodwill arising on acquisition is attributable to the anticipated future cash flows of the acquired business and synergies expected to arise following integration with the Groups existing business in Australia.
