36 The Mercantile Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31st January 2013 1.
Accounting Policies a Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts the SORP issued by the Association of Investment Companies in January 2009.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investments at fair value through profit or loss.
The policies applied in these accounts are consistent with those applied in the preceding year.
b Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy and information is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as held at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value which is taken to be their cost, excluding expenses incidental to purchase which are written off to capital at the time of acquisition.
Subsequently the investments are valued at fair value, which are quoted bid prices for investments traded in active markets.
For investments which are not traded in active markets, unlisted and restricted investments, the Board takes into account the latest traded prices, other observable market data and asset values based on the latest management accounts.
c Accounting for reserves Gains and losses on sales of investments including the related foreign exchange gains and losses, realised gains and losses on foreign currency, management fee and finance costs allocated to capital and any other capital charges, are included in the Income Statement and dealt with in capital reserves within Gains on sales of investments.
Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end including the related foreign exchange gains and losses, are included in the Income Statement and dealt with in capital reserves within Investment holding gains.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
d Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are included in revenue on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is included in capital.
UK dividends are included net of tax credits.
Overseas dividends are included gross of any withholding tax.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in revenue.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital.
Interest receivable from debt securities, together with any premiums or discounts on purchase, are allocated to revenue on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective interest of those securities.
Deposit interest receivable is taken to revenue on an accruals basis.
Underwriting commission is taken to revenue on a receipts basis.
Underwriting commission is recognised in revenue where it relates to shares that the Company is not required to take up.
Where the Company is required to take up a proportion of the shares underwritten, the same proportion of commission received is deducted from the cost of the shares taken up, with the balance taken to revenue.
Property income distributions are taken to revenue on an accruals basis.
e Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are allocated wholly to the revenue column of the income statement with the following exceptions: The management fee is allocated 30% to revenue and 70% to capital, in line with the Boards expected long term split of revenue and capital return from the Companys investment portfolio.
Expenses incidental to the purchase of an investment are included within the cost of the investment and those incidental to the sale are deducted from the sale proceeds.
These expenses are commonly referred to as transaction costs and comprise brokerage commission and stamp duty.
Details of transaction costs are given in note 10 on page 42.
The Mercantile Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 37 f Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest method and in accordance with the provisions of FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Presentation and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement.
Finance costs are allocated 30% to revenue and 70% to capital, in line with the Boards expected long term split of revenue and capital return from the Companys investment portfolio.
Breakage costs incurred on the early repayment of loans are charged 100% to capital.
g Financial instruments Cash and short term deposits may comprise cash and demand deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Other debtors and creditors do not carry any interest, are short term in nature and are accordingly stated at nominal value, with debtors reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The debentures in issue, bank loans and overdrafts are measured at amortised cost.
They are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Finance costs, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest method.
h Taxation Current tax is provided at the amounts expected to be received or paid.
Deferred tax is accounted for in accordance with FRS 19: Deferred Tax.
Deferred tax is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences but deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.
Tax relief is allocated to expenses charged to the capital column of the income statement on the marginal basis.
On this basis, if taxable income is capable of being entirely offset by revenue expenses, then no tax relief is transferred to the capital column.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rate which is expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and is measured on an undiscounted basis.
i Value Added Tax VAT Expenses are disclosed inclusive of the related irrecoverable VAT.
Recoverable VAT is calculated using the partial exemption method, based on the proportion of zero rated supplies to total supplies.
j Foreign currency In accordance with FRS 23: The effects of changes in Foreign Exchange Rates the Company is required to nominate a functional currency, being the currency in which the Company predominantly operates.
The Board, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its shareholders operate, has determined that sterling is the functional currency.
Sterling is the also the currency in which the accounts are presented.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets, liabilities and equity investments held at fair value, denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.
k Dividends payable In accordance with FRS 21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date, dividends are included in the accounts in the year in which they are paid.
l Repurchases of ordinary shares for cancellation The cost of repurchasing ordinary shares including the related stamp duty and transactions costs is charged to Capital reserves and dealt with in the Reconciliation of Movement in Shareholders Funds.
Share repurchase transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis.
The nominal value of ordinary share capital repurchased and cancelled is transferred out of Called up share capital and into Capital redemption reserve.

Taxation a Analysis of tax charge in the year Overseas withholding tax 32 44 Current tax charge for the year 32 44 b Factors affecting the current tax charge for the year The tax assessed for the year is lower 2012: higher than the Companys applicable rate of corporation tax for the year of 24.33% 2012: 26.32%.
The factors affecting the current tax charge for the year are as follows: 2013 2012 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Net return loss on ordinary activities before taxation 31,675 257,722 289,397 31,599 119,913 88,314 Net return on ordinary activities before taxation multiplied by the Companys applicable rate of corporation tax of 24.33% 2012: 26.32% 7,707 62,704 70,411 8,317 31,561 23,244 Effect of: Non taxable scrip dividends 86 86 379 379 Non taxable UK dividend income 6,380 6,380 7,771 7,771 Non taxable overseas dividend income 2,165 2,165 1,317 1,317 Non taxable capital gains losses 65,422 65,422 28,561 28,561 Unrelieved expenses 924 2,718 3,642 1,150 3,000 4,150 Overseas withholding tax 32 32 44 44 32 32 44 44 c Deferred taxation The Company has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 43,368,000 2012: 43,396,000 based on a prospective corporation tax rate of 23% 2012: 25%.
The reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax was substantively enacted on 12th July 2012 and is effective from 1st April 2013.
The deferred tax asset has arisen due to the cumulative excess of deductible expenses over taxable income.
Given the composition of the Companys portfolio, it is not likely that this asset will be utilised in the foreseeable future and therefore no asset has been recognised in the accounts.
Given the Companys status as an Investment Trust Company and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval, the Company has not provided for deferred tax on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

This debenture stock is carried in the Companys balance sheet at amortised cost rather than fair value.
Hence movement in interest rates will not affect equity but may have an impact on the share price and discount which is not likely to be material.
The Company has no significant holdings of fixed interest rate securities whose fair value would be affected by interest rate movements.
The Company does not normally hold a significantly high level of cash balances and there is an overdraft facility available when required.
The exposure of financial assets and financial liabilities to floating interest rates, giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are re-set, is shown below: 2013 2012 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates Cash at bank and short term deposits 139,879 18,447 Total exposure 139,879 18,447 Interest receivable on cash balances, or paid on overdrafts, is at a margin below or above LIBOR respectively 2012: same.
The above year end amounts are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year as the level of cash balances and drawings on the loan facility have fluctuated.
The maximum and minimum net cash balances during the year are as follows: 2013 2012 000 000 Maximum interest rate exposure during the year net cash balances 191,707 186,949 Minimum interest rate exposure during the year net cash balances 18,447 18,447 Interest rate sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets to a 1% 2012: 1% increase or decrease in interest rates in regards to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities.
This level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary financial instruments held at the balance sheet date with all other variables held constant.

The Mercantile Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 49 ii Market price risk Market price risk includes changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk, which may affect the value of equity investments.
Management of market price risk The Board meets on at least four occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objective and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Market price risk exposure The Companys total exposure to changes in market prices at 31st January comprises its holdings in equity investments as follows: 2013 2012 000 000 Equity investments held at fair value through profit or loss 1,417,134 1,276,762 The above data is broadly representative of the exposure to market price risk during the year.
Concentration of exposure to market price risk An analysis of the Companys investments is given on pages 13 to 15.
This shows that the majority of the investments value is in the UK.
Accordingly there is a concentration of exposure to that country.
However it should be noted that an investment may not be entirely exposed to the economic conditions in its country of domicile or of listing.
Market price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets to an increase or decrease of 10% 2012: 10% in the fair values of the Companys equities.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys equities, adjusting for changes in the management fee but with all other variables held constant.
2013 2012 10% Increase 10% Decrease 10% Increase 10% Decrease in fair value in fair value in fair value in fair value 000 000 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 213 213 192 192 Capital return 141,227 141,227 127,230 127,230 Total return after taxation 141,014 141,014 127,038 127,038 Net assets 141,014 141,014 127,038 127,038 b Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
The Boards policy is for the Company to remain fully invested in normal market conditions and that short term borrowings be used to manage short term liabilities and working capital requirements and to gear the Company as appropriate.

c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in loss to the Company.
Management of credit risk Portfolio dealing The Company invests in markets that operate DVP Delivery Versus Payment settlement.
The process of DVP mitigates the risk of losing the principal of a trade during the settlement process.
The Manager continuously monitors dealing activity to ensure best execution, a process that involves measuring various indicators including the quality of trade settlement and incidence of failed trades.
Counterparty lists are maintained and adjusted accordingly.
The Mercantile Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 51 Cash Counterparties are subject to daily credit analysis by the Manager and trades can only be placed with counterparties that have a minimum credit rating of A1 P1 from Standard & Poors and Moodys respectively.
Exposure to JPMorgan Chase Bank JPMorgan Chase Bank is the custodian of the Companys assets.
The custody agreement grants a general lien over the securities credited to the securities account.
The Companys assets are segregated from JPMorgan Chase Banks own trading assets and are therefore protected from creditors in the event that JPMorgan Chase Bank were to cease trading.
However, no absolute guarantee can be given to investors on the protection of all of the assets of the Company.
Credit risk exposure The following amounts shown in the Balance Sheet, represent the maximum exposure to credit risk at the current and comparative year end.

d Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities All financial assets and liabilities are either carried in the balance sheet at fair value or the balance sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value except for the debenture stock which the Company has in issue.
The fair value of this debenture stock has been calculated using discounted cash flow techniques, using the yield on a similarly dated gilt plus a margin based on the 5 year average for the AA Barclays Sterling Corporate Bond spread.

The Boards policy is to limit gearing within the range 10% net cash to 20% geared.
Gearing for this purpose is defined as the excess amount above shareholders funds of Total Assets including net current assets liabilities less cash cash equivalents, expressed as a percentage of net assets.

This review includes: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Managers views on the market: the need to buy back equity shares, either for cancellation or to hold in Treasury, which takes into account the share price discount or premium: the opportunity for issues of new shares, including issues from Treasury: and the level of dividend distributions in excess of that which is required to be distributed.
