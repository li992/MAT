Drax Group plc 107 Annual report and accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 General information Simplifying the numbers Throughout this document these boxes will explain in plain English what the disclosures mean, and why they are important to understanding our financial position and performance.
In general, the notes to the financial statements include additional information required by law, International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS or other regulations to facilitate a better, more detailed understanding of the primary financial statements set out on pages 102 to 106.
Delivering our biomass strategy Where relevant to do so, we have set out key elements of our business model and strategy see pages 17 to 19 and how pursuit of this has impacted our financial results.
Drax Group plc the Company is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act.
The Company and its subsidiaries together the Group operate in the electricity generation and supply industry within the UK.
The address of the Companys registered office and principal establishment is Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire YO8 8PH, United Kingdom.
The principal operating companies of the Group are disclosed in note 4 to the Companys separate financial statements, which follow these consolidated financial statements.
The principal activities of the Group are the sourcing of fuel in the US and at Drax Power Station, the generation and sale of electricity at Drax Power Station, and the sale of electricity to business customers by Haven Power Limited Haven Power.
2 Basis of preparation This section describes the accounting standards we have followed in preparing these financial statements and the interpretation of accounting standards into accounting policies which are relevant to our Group.
Wherever possible, we have explained how our accounting policies work in practice within the relevant note to the consolidated financial statements, and have not sought to repeat that information here.
We have also made some changes in the way we present our income statement this year, which are described in detail below.
We have not changed any of our accounting policies this year, nor have any new accounting standards had a material effect on our financial statements.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and therefore the consolidated financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, as explained in Operational and financial performance on page 43, and on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial assets and liabilities that have been measured at fair value.
Basis of consolidation These consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial results of the Company and of all entities controlled by the Company, made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The impact of all intra-group transactions is eliminated on consolidation.
Accounting policies Those accounting policies that are material to the understanding of our financial statements have been incorporated within the relevant note or are set out below: Revenue recognition Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided in the normal course of business, net of trade discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes, and excluding transactions with or between group companies.
Revenues from the sale of electricity are recorded based upon output delivered at rates specified under contract terms or prevailing market rates as applicable.
Revenues from sales of ROCs and LECs are recorded at the invoiced value, net of VAT.
Revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership have been substantially transferred to a third party, that being when the ROC or LEC is transferred to the account of that third party.
Revenue from the sale of electricity direct to customers through our retail business, Haven Power is recorded after deduction of agreed discounts, VAT and Climate Change Levy.
Revenue is recognised on the supply of electricity when a contract exists, supply has taken place, a quantifiable price has been established or can be determined and the receivables are expected to be recovered at the point of sale.
Energy supplied, but not yet measured or billed is calculated based on consumption statistics and selling price estimates.
Financials Governance Sustainable business review Marketplace, performance and risk Overview Drax Group plc 10 8 Annual report and accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 2.
Basis of preparation continued Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the translation at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the income statement.
Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations with a functional currency other than sterling are translated to sterling using published exchange rates at the reporting date.
The income and expenses of such operations are translated to sterling using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the retranslation of these operations are recognised in reserves.
Presentation of financial statements During 2013 the Group conducted a review of its financial statements and concluded that an alternative presentation of the income statement would result in more relevant information for users in accordance with IAS 1.
As a result of this review, the Group now presents EBITDA as a separate line item on the face of the income statement.
EBITDA is defined as profit before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and unrealised gains or losses on derivative contracts.
As a result of this change, it has also been necessary to split depreciation and amortisation out from operating and administrative expenses.
EBITDA is the primary financial performance measure reviewed by the Board, as described in note 4.
Presentation on the face of the income statement joins up the financial statements with the commentary in Operational and financial performance, and also the segmental disclosure provided in note 4.
The revised presentation will be maintained in future periods.
In addition, underlying profit after tax for the year has been presented on the face of the income statement for the first time.
Underlying profit after tax excludes the post-tax impact of unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts, and is used under our current distribution policy to calculate proposed dividends for the period.
A reconciliation from profit for the year attributable to equity holders to underlying profit after tax is provided in note 9.
The reconciliation of operating and administrative expenses disclosed in the prior year to the current presentation is as follows: 2012 2012 Revised Operating and administrative expenses 271.0m 212.5m Depreciation and amortisation 58.5m Total 271.0m 271.0m Applying the previous presentation to the current year results would result in operating and administrative costs for 2013 of 279.9 million.
Drax Group plc 10 9 Annual report and accounts 2013 Adoption of new and revised accounting standards In 2013, a number of new, amended or revised standards and interpretations became effective.
The Group adopted the following standards from 1 January 2013: IFRS 1 amended Government loans.
IFRS 7 amended Disclosures: Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in other entities.
IAS 1 amended Presentation of financial statements other comprehensive income.
IAS 27 revised Separate financial statements.
IAS 28 revised Investments in associates and joint ventures.
Annual improvements to IFRS 2009-2011 cycle.
The adoption of these standards and interpretations has not had a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
The additional disclosures required by IAS 19 revised have been included in note 32 to these financial statements.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and relevant interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective and some of which were pending endorsement by the EU : IFRS 9 Financial Instruments the latest amendment issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB removed the mandatory effective date for IFRS 9, to be set once the draft standard is fully completed in 2014.
IAS 32 amended Offsetting financial assets and liabilities effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
IAS 36 amended Recoverable amount disclosures for non-financial assets effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
IAS 39 amended Novation of derivatives and continuation of hedge accounting effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
IFRIC 21 Levies effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
Investment entities amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
The Group is in the process of assessing the full impact of adopting IFRS 9.
Following the removal of the mandatory effective date for this standard by the IASB the Group will continue to monitor developments, but intends to adopt the standard in the earliest permitted accounting period, subject to endorsement by the EU.
Adoption of the other standards in future periods is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
Financials Governance Sustainable business review Marketplace, performance and risk Overview Drax Group plc 110 Annual report and accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3 Accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of income and expenditure recorded during the period.
These estimates are based on our reasonable knowledge of the amount, event or actions that require judgement, but the actual amount may ultimately differ from the initial or subsequent estimates.
Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The most important of these judgements those that carry the most significant risk of an outcome that differs from the amount recognised in the financial statements are as follows: Property, plant and equipment Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account prices prevailing at each balance sheet date.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are also reviewed for impairment where there has been a trigger event that is, an event which may have resulted in impairment by assessing the present value of estimated future cash flows and net realisable value compared with net book value.
The calculation of estimated future cash flows and residual values is based on managements reasonable estimates of future prices, output and costs, and is therefore subjective.
Derivatives Derivative financial instruments are stated in the balance sheet at their fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded for each period in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.
The fair values of derivative instruments for commodities and foreign exchange rates are determined using forward price curves.
Forward price curves represent the Groups estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement of a commodity or foreign exchange payment or receipt, at future dates.
The Group generally bases forward price curves upon readily obtainable market price quotations, as the Groups commodity and forward foreign exchange contracts do not generally extend beyond the actively traded portion of these curves.
However, the forward price curves used are only an estimate of how future prices will move and are, therefore, subjective.
Where derivative financial instruments include options these are valued using an option pricing model.
Inputs to the model include market commodity prices, forward price curves, the term of the option, discount rate and assumptions around volatility based on historical movements.
The inputs include assumptions around future transactions and market movements, as well as credit risk and are, therefore, subjective.
ROCs and LECs ROCs and LECs are stated within the balance sheet at fair value on the date of recognition and subsequently written down to net realisable value where appropriate.
Inherent in the calculation of this fair value and in the estimate of net realisable value is an assumption regarding future sales prices in the market.
Historic experience indicates that the assumptions used in the valuation are reasonable: however actual sales prices may differ.
Other accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions CESP The Group has a contingent liability in respect of the Community Energy Saving Programme CESP.
The assessment of whether to make a provision for such a liability requires judgement.
See note 34 for further details.
Pensions The Group operates an approved defined benefit scheme.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method and actuarial valuations of the plan assets and liabilities are carried out as at the balance sheet date.
Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates, inflation rates, salary and pension increases, and mortality rates.
These actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate.
The Group believes that the assumptions utilised in recording obligations under the scheme are reasonable based on prior experience, market conditions and the advice of scheme actuaries.
However, actual results may differ from such assumptions.
Taxation In accounting for taxation the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and expenditure for tax purposes.
The Group believes that these assumptions are reasonable based on prior experience and consultation with advisers.
Full provision is made for deferred taxation at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end date unless future rates have been substantively enacted.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered, taking into account the nature of the losses, and the certainty of the relevant offsetting income streams.
Impairment The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy detailed in note 10.
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations require the use of estimates.
Drax Group plc 111 Annual report and accounts 2013 4 Segmental reporting We view our operational business as two distinct areas or segments the generation of electricity at Drax Power Station Generation and the supply of power to business customers Retail.
The respective financial performance of these segments is shown here and described in far greater detail in Operational and financial performance starting on page 28.
The costs incurred by our US business, which is still in the development phase, during the current and previous year have been included in the Generation segment.
The Generation business segment spans all three core activities of the Group in that it incorporates sourcing, generation and supply through its sales to the wholesale electricity market.
The Retail business segment contributes to the supply activities of the Group, through sales direct to the small and medium enterprise and industrial and commercial markets.
Grow our retail business The information below clearly demonstrates the good sales volume growth achieved by Haven Power, our retail business, in the year.
Information reported to the Board and for the purposes of assessing performance and making investment decisions is organised into two operating segments.
The measure of profit or loss for each reportable segment, presented to the Board on a regular basis is EBITDA.
Segment revenues and results The following is an analysis of the Groups results by reporting segment for the year ended 31 December 2013: Year ended 31 December 2013 Generation Retail Eliminations Consolidated m m m m Revenue External sales 1,311.5 750.6 2,062.1 Inter-segment sales 468.4 468.4 Total revenue 1,779.9 750.6 468.4 2,062.1 Result Segment EBITDA 235.5 5.5 230.0 Central costs Depreciation and amortisation 64.8 Unrealised losses on derivative contracts 110.2 Operating profit 55.0 Net finance costs 23.2 Profit before tax 31.8 Financials Governance Sustainable business review Marketplace, performance and risk Overview Drax Group plc 112 Annual report and accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 4.
Segmental reporting continued The following is an analysis of the Groups results by reporting segment for the year ended 31 December 2012: Year ended 31 December 2012 Generation Retail Eliminations Consolidated m m m m Revenue External sales 1,328.4 451.4 1,779.8 Inter-segment sales 301.6 301.6 Total revenue 1,630.0 451.4 301.6 1,779.8 Result Segment EBITDA 303.0 4.6 298.4 Central costs Depreciation and amortisation 58.5 Unrealised losses on derivative contracts 36.1 Operating profit 203.8 Net finance costs 13.6 Profit before tax 190.2 Assets and working capital are monitored on a Group basis, with no separate disclosure of asset by segment made in the management accounts, and accordingly no separate asset disclosure is made here.
However, spend on key capital projects is monitored.
Total spend on the biomass transformation project during 2013 was 228 million 2012: 180 million, of which 117 million relates to construction of assets within our US business.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Groups accounting policies, which are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
The revenue and results of both reporting segments presented are subject to seasonality as detailed in Operational and financial performance, page 43.
Major customers Total revenue for the year ended 31 December 2013 includes an amount of 222.3 million 2012: 355.7 million and 221.8 million derived from a single customer 2012: two customers, representing 10% or more of the Groups revenue for the year.
These revenues arose in the generation segment.
5 Operating expenses This note sets out the material components of the Operating and administrative expenses line on our consolidated income statement, page 102, including a detailed breakdown of the fees we paid to our auditor, Deloitte LLP, in respect of services they have provided to us during the year.
Years ended 31 December 2013 2012 m m The following charges have been included in arriving at operating profit: Staff costs note 31 93.3 84.3 Repairs and maintenance expenditure on property, plant and equipment 59.0 53.4 Other operating and administrative expenses 62.8 74.8 Total other operating and administrative expenses 215.1 212.5 Drax Group plc 113 Annual report and accounts 2013 Auditors remuneration Years ended 31 December 2013 2012 000 000 Audit fees: Fees payable for the audit of the Groups consolidated financial statements 293 273 Fees payable for the audit of the Companys subsidiaries pursuant to legislation 53 52 346 325 Other fees: Pursuant to legislation interim review 62 61 Other services 8 37 Total audit related fees 416 423 Taxation services 5 44 Total non-audit fees 5 44 Total auditors remuneration 421 467 6 Net finance costs Finance costs reflect expenses incurred in managing our debt structure such as interest payable on our bank loans as well as foreign exchange gains and losses and the unwinding of discounting on our provision for reinstatement and defined benefit pension.
These are offset by interest income that we generate through efficient use of short-term cash surpluses for example through investment in money market funds.
Years ended 31 December 2013 2012 m m Interest payable and similar charges: Interest payable on bank borrowings 13.5 6.1 Foreign exchange losses 4.0 0.6 Unwinding of discount on provisions note 22 0.9 1.0 Amortisation of deferred finance costs 2.9 3.2 Net finance cost in respect of defined benefit scheme note 32 1.7 1.1 Other financing charges 1.8 3.3 Total interest payable and similar charges 24.8 15.3 Interest receivable: Interest income on bank deposits 1.6 1.7 Total interest receivable 1.6 1.7 Following the refinancing of our previous revolving credit facilities in December 2012 see note 18, the amortisation of associated deferred finance costs was accelerated, resulting in an additional interest charge of 1.6 million in the 2012 figure above.
Financials Governance Sustainable business review Marketplace, performance and risk Overview Drax Group plc 114 Annual report and accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 7 Taxation The tax charge includes both current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the amount payable on this years taxable profits which are adjusted for items upon which we are not required to pay tax, or in some cases for items upon which we are required to pay additional tax in respect of tax-disallowed expenditure.
Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment which reflects where more or less tax is expected to arise in the future due to differences between the accounting and tax rules.
The tax credit charge reflects the estimated effective tax rate on profit before tax for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2013 and the movement in the deferred tax balance in the year, so far as it relates to items recognised in the income statement.
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax payable or recoverable on the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Changes in the rate of corporation tax Following the announcement of the 2013 Budget, the Finance Act 2013 the Act was enacted by Parliament in July 2013.
The Act confirmed reductions in the rate of corporation tax from 23% to 21% from 1 April 2014, and a further reduction in corporation tax to 20% from 1 April 2015, both of which were substantively enacted during the year, and therefore have been reflected in the deferred tax balances below.
Years ended 31 December 2013 2012 m m Tax credit charge comprises: Current tax 5.5 31.4 Deferred tax Before impact of corporation tax rate change 2.8 10.1 Impact of corporation tax rate change 22.3 15.1 Tax credit charge 19.6 26.4 Years ended 31 December 2013 2012 m m Tax on items credited to other comprehensive income: Deferred tax on actuarial losses on defined benefit pension scheme note 23 0.6 2.1 Deferred tax on cash flow hedges note 23 8.6 26.0 Impact of corporation tax rate change on deferred tax on cash flow hedges note 23 2.6 11.8 28.1 Drax Group plc 11 5 Annual report and accounts 2013 UK corporation tax is calculated at 23.25% 2012: 24.5% of the estimated assessable profit for the year.
Tax for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
The credit charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit per the income statement as follows: Years ended 31 December 2013 2012 m m Profit before tax 31.8 190.2 Profit before tax multiplied by the rate of corporation tax in the UK of 23.25% 2012: 24.5% 7.4 46.6 Effects of: Adjustments in respect of prior periods 7.3 7.6 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 1.2 1.3 Other 1.4 1.2 Impact of change to corporation tax rate 22.3 15.1 Total tax credit charge 19.6 26.4 8 Dividends Dividends are amounts we return to our shareholders and are paid as an amount per ordinary share held.
Our current dividend policy is to return 50% of underlying earnings see note 9 to our shareholders each year.
The remaining 50% is retained for reinvestment in the future growth of the business.
Years ended 31 December 2013 2012 m m Amounts recognised as distributions to equity holders in the year based on the number of shares in issue at the record date : Interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2013 of 8.7 pence per share paid on 11 October 2013 2012: 14.4 pence per share paid on 12 October 2012 35.0 52.6 Final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2012 of 10.9 pence per share paid on 17 May 2013 2012: 11.8 pence per share paid on 11 May 2012 43.8 43.1 78.8 95.7 At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting the Board will recommend to shareholders that a resolution is passed to approve payment of a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2013 of 8.9 pence per share equivalent to approximately 36 million payable on or before 17 May 2014.
The final dividend has not been included as a liability as at 31 December 2013.
Financials Governance Sustainable business review Marketplace, performance and risk Overview Drax Group plc 116 Annual report and accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 9 Earnings per share Earnings per share EPS represents the amount of our earnings post-tax profits that are attributable to each ordinary share we have in issue.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing our earnings by the weighted average number of ordinary shares that were in issue during the year.
Diluted EPS demonstrates the impact if all outstanding share options such as those to be issued under our employee share schemes see note 25, that are expected to vest on their future maturity dates, were exercised and treated as ordinary shares as at the balance sheet date.
In addition to EPS, we calculate underlying EPS as it reflects the figures upon which our annual dividends are calculated note 8.
Underlying EPS removes the post-tax effect of fair value movements on derivative contracts from earnings.
Multiplying underlying basic EPS by 50% will give the total dividends per share for the period.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below: Years ended 31 December 2013 2012 m m Earnings: Earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company for the purposes of basic and diluted earnings 51.4 163.8 After tax impact of unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts 90.9 29.0 Underlying earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company 142.3 192.8 Years ended 31 December 2013 2012 Number of shares: Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of basic earnings per share millions 402.3 371.7 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares under share plans 4.6 3.5 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of diluted earnings per share millions 406.9 375.2 Earnings per share basic pence 13 44 Earnings per share diluted pence 13 44 Underlying earnings per share basic pence 35 52 Underlying earnings per share diluted pence 35 51 Drax Group plc 117 Annual report and accounts 2013 10 Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business, when the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired.
All of our goodwill relates to the acquisition of Haven Power, our retail business, in 2009.
Other intangibles include amounts paid in respect of carbon emission allowances for future years.
Goodwill Carbon Total m m m Cost and carrying amount: At 1 January 2012 10.7 10.7 Additions at cost 39.0 39.0 At 1 January 2013 10.7 39.0 49.7 Utilisation 39.0 39.0 Additions at cost 26.5 26.5 At 31 December 2013 10.7 26.5 37.2 Goodwill Goodwill arising on the Haven Power acquisition has been allocated to the Haven Power cash-generating unit.
At 31 December 2013, the fair value of goodwill was significantly in excess of its book value reflecting its cash generative profile: accordingly a sensitivity analysis has not been disclosed.
The recoverable amount of Haven Power is calculated annually, based on a value in use calculation.
The key assumptions in this calculation relate to the discount rate and future cash flows.
Management estimates the discount rate using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the business.
The first five years of cash flows are based upon the five year Business Plan approved by the Board.
Future cash flows have been taken in perpetuity, assuming no growth rate is applied to the final year of the Business Plan.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows from Haven Power is 8% reflecting a reasonable assumption of the applicable cost of capital.
Carbon assets Carbon assets arise upon the purchase of CO emissions allowances in excess of the amount allocated and required for the 2 current financial year and are recognised at cost, net of any impairment.
The charge to the income statement, within fuel costs, reflects the cost of emissions allowances required to satisfy the obligation for the current year and takes into account generation and market purchases allocated to the current financial year, and the market price at the balance sheet date.
11 Property, plant and equipment This note shows the cost, depreciation and net book value of the physical assets controlled by us that we use in our business.
The cost of an asset is what we paid to purchase or construct the asset.
Depreciation is calculated by taking that cost, net of any residual value, to the income statement evenly over the useful economic life of the asset.
An assets net book value is simply its cost less any depreciation including impairment, if required charged to date.
We construct many of our assets under long-term projects.
Assets that are in the course of construction are not depreciated until they are ready for us to use in the way intended.
Delivering our biomass strategy Additions this year include a further 228 million on our biomass transformation project, which remains on schedule and budget.
Key developments in 2013 included the commissioning of the new receipt, storage and distribution systems at Drax Power Station required to support our first converted unit, and the commencement of construction of two wood pellet plants in Mississippi and Louisiana and a port facility at Baton Rouge in the US.
Accounting policy Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost.
Cost comprises the purchase price after deducting trade discounts and rebates, any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, and the estimate of the present value of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site.
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment in value.
Freehold land and assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write down assets to their residual value evenly over the estimated useful lives of the assets from the date of acquisition where relevant limited to the expected decommissioning date of the power station.
The estimated useful lives, beginning in 2004 when they were reset, are currently: Financials Governance Sustainable business review Marketplace, performance and risk Overview Drax Group plc 118 Annual report and accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 11.
Property, plant and equipment continued Years Main generating plant and freehold buildings Up to 35 Other plant and machinery 325 Decommissioning asset 35 Plant spare parts 35 Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear, and any provision for impairment.
Residual values are based on prices prevailing at each balance sheet date.
Costs relating to major inspections, overhauls and upgrades to the power station are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, if the recognition criteria are met: namely, when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Impairment At each balance sheet date the Group reviews its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that these assets may have suffered an impairment loss.
If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the net present value of expected future cash flows of the asset value in use or sales value net of expenses.
If an asset is impaired, a provision is made to reduce its carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount.
The discount rate applied to future cash flows for this purpose is a pre-tax rate based upon the Groups weighted average cost of capital and reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the business.
Plant and equipment includes assets held under finance lease agreements with a carrying value at 31 December 2013 of 1.0 million 2012: 1.0 million.
Additions during the year include 1.9 million 2012: nil of capitalised borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction of specific assets.
Drax Group plc 11 9 Annual report and accounts 2013 12 Inventories We hold stocks of fuels and other consumables that we use in the process of generating electricity.
This note shows the cost of coal, biomass, other fuels and plant consumables that we held at the end of the year, including items at Drax Power Station, and those owned by us but stored in off-site locations.
Our fuel stocks are valued at the lower of the weighted average cost to purchase and net realisable value.
The cost of fuel stocks includes the purchase price, import duties and other taxes including amounts levied on coal under the UK carbon price support mechanism and transport handling costs.
Delivering our biomass strategy The increasing cost of carbon, including the carbon price support mechanism, added 120 million to our fuel costs in 2013.
The relative economics of coal and biomass generation going forward underpins our transformation strategy.
As at 31 December 2013 2012 m m Coal 141.2 92.5 Biomass 40.9 48.1 Other fuels and consumables 14.4 17.0 196.5 157.6 The cost of inventories recognised as an expense in the year ended 31 December 2013 was 945.8 million 2012: 823.8 million.
13 ROC and LEC assets We earn ROC and LEC assets, which are accredited by the Office for Gas and Electricity Markets Ofgem, as a result of burning renewable biomass to generate electricity.
This note sets out the value of such assets we have earned but not yet sold.
Delivering our biomass strategy and growing our retail business As we generate more of our electricity by burning renewable biomass, the volume and therefore the total value of ROC and LEC assets we generate will increase.
As Haven Power grows, it provides us with a credit-efficient and timely route to market for these ROCs and LECs.
ROCs and LECs are recognised as current assets in the period they are generated and initially measured at fair value reducing the cost of biomass in the income statement based on anticipated sales prices.

The note includes prepayments, which are amounts paid by us for which we are yet to receive the goods or service in return e. g. carbon emissions allowances we have paid for that will be utilised in future years.
Trade and other receivables, given their short tenor, are measured at cost.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established subsequently where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable.

At 31 December 2013, the Group had amounts receivable from five 2012: five significant counterparties within the generation business, representing 69% 2012: 78% of trade receivables, all of which paid within 15 days of receipt of invoice in line with agreed terms.
The ageing profile, beyond a month, of the Groups receivables continues to be immaterial.
Counterparty risk is discussed in note 21.
Management does not consider there to be a significant concentration of credit risk and as a result, does not believe that a further credit risk provision is required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful debts of 5.6 million 2012: 4.7 million.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience, and includes 5.6 million in relation to Haven Power 2012: 4.6 million.

Allowances are purchased in the market and are recorded at cost.
2 18 Borrowings Borrowings are chiefly comprised of bank loans with fixed maturity repayment profiles between 2016 and 2020.
Maintaining an optimal capital structure In 2012 we executed a refinancing of our existing facilities, replacing them with a 400 million revolving credit facility which matures in April 2016, two new term loans of 100 million each with Prudential M&G and the UK Green Investment Bank, and a commodities trading line that allows trading counterparties to benefit from the security package offered to our senior lenders instead of us posting collateral for certain volumes of trades.
In April 2013, we agreed a new 75 million amortising term loan facility with Friends Life, underpinned by a guarantee from HM Treasury under the Infrastructure UK Guarantee Scheme.
This replaced 50 million of the 100 million facility with the UK Green Investment Bank, above.
The new loan facilities, which were fully drawn at the year end, enhance the financing structure executed in 2012 by providing additional liquidity and a smoother profile of debt maturities.
The Group measures all debt instruments, whether financial assets or financial liabilities, initially at the fair value of the consideration paid or received.
Subsequent to initial measurement, debt instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Transaction costs any such costs incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the financial instrument are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are, in effect, amortised through the income statement over the life of the instrument.

Borrowings continued Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down.
In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs.

We use financial coal contracts to swap floating for fixed prices or vice versa on fixed volumes of coal, and enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage our exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than sterling.
We hold these contracts for risk management purposes, to manage key risks facing the business including commodity price risk, and foreign currency risk see note 21.
The accounting rules for derivative contracts are complex we must account for them at fair value, which is in essence the difference between the price we have secured in the contract, and that we could achieve in the market now, at the balance sheet date.
The tables and narrative below provide additional detail around these values, how they are calculated and the changes in underlying market conditions that drive their movements.
Managing our principal risks and uncertainties A successful commercial hedging strategy is critical to our business model.
Our policy is to lock down exposures to commodity price movements and changes in foreign exchange rates using derivative contracts such as those described above.
This strategy aims to fide-risk the business, providing security and certainty over cash flows into the future.
Accounting policy Where possible, the Group has taken advantage of the own use exemption which allows qualifying contracts to be excluded from fair value mark-to-market accounting.
This applies to certain contracts for physical commodities entered into and held for our own purchase, sale or usage requirements, including forward contracts for the purchase of biomass, and coal from domestic sources.
Contracts which do not qualify for the own use exemption principally power, financial coal, CO emissions allowances and 2 forward foreign currency exchange contracts are accounted for as derivatives and recorded in the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in fair value reflected through the hedge reserve note 27 to the extent that the contracts are designated as effective hedges in accordance with IAS 39, or the income statement where the hedge accounting requirements are not met.
Derivative financial instruments with a maturity date within 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified as current assets or liabilities.
Instruments with a maturity date beyond 12 months are classified as non-current assets or liabilities.
Fair value accounting Forward contracts for the sale of power, purchase of coal from international sources, purchase of CO emissions allowances, 2 financial coal collectively Commodity contracts and foreign currency exchange contracts are marked-to-market and recorded in the balance sheet at fair value as follows: As at 31 December 2013 As at 31 December 2012 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Commodity contracts: Less than one year 27.8 52.3 33.0 70.6 More than one year but not more than two years 3.6 5.8 2.4 14.2 More than two years 0.1 Forward foreign currency exchange contracts: Less than one year 1.8 52.9 4.6 29.8 More than one year but not more than two years 1.5 73.0 0.6 10.8 More than two years 3.5 133.3 4.7 30.2 Total 38.3 317.3 45.3 155.6 Less: non-current portion Commodity contracts 3.7 5.8 2.4 14.2 Forward foreign currency exchange contracts 5.0 206.3 5.3 41.0 Total non-current portion 8.7 212.1 7.7 55.2 Current portion 29.6 105.2 37.6 100.4 The total movement in the fair value of these contracts of 168.9 million 2012: 141.8 million is recognised in the income statement or the hedge reserve, dependent upon whether the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 are met, as follows: Financials Governance Sustainable business review Marketplace, performance and risk Overview Drax Group plc 12 4 Annual report and accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 19.
Derivative financial instruments continued Years ended 31 December 2013 2012 m m Unrealised losses on derivative contracts recognised in arriving at operating profit 110.2 36.1 Unrealised losses on derivative contracts recognised in the hedge reserve note 27 58.7 105.7 Total unrealised losses on derivative contracts 168.9 141.8 Unrealised losses recognised in the income statement are primarily the result of changes in the fair value of our forward foreign exchange contracts in both the current and prior year.
Currency markets were volatile in 2013, which can be seen on the graph on page 39, with the US dollar in which many of our fuel purchases are denominated closing 2013 weaker than in 2012.
This, combined with the significant increase in the volume of currency contracts as we look to secure our sterling cash flows, drives the income statement movement.
Unrealised losses recognised in the hedge reserve reflect principally the fair value changes on our forward foreign exchange contracts that are designated in effective hedging relationships in accordance with IAS 39.
These are predominantly forward contracts for the purchase of US and Canadian dollars for highly probable future fuel purchases.
Fair value measurement Commodity contracts fair value The fair value of commodity contracts qualifying as derivative financial instruments, not excluded through the own use exemption, is calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date.
As contracts are generally short-term, forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price: the quoted price for financial liabilities is the current ask price.
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts fair value The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is determined using forward currency exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are discounted to reflect the credit risk inherent within the instrument.
The Group has reviewed all significant contracts for the presence of embedded derivatives.
Where contracts were found to contain embedded derivatives, they were considered to be closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, and therefore do not require separate valuation from their host contracts.
Categorisation within the fair value measurement hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset or liability as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The fair value of both commodity contracts and forward foreign currency exchange contracts is largely determined by comparison between forward market prices and the contract price: therefore these contracts are categorised as Level 2.
There have been no transfers during the year between Level 1, 2 or 3 category inputs.
20 Other financial instruments We hold a variety of other non-derivative financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, payables and receivables arising from our operations.
Fair value Cash and cash equivalents note 16, short-term investments note 15, trade and other receivables note 14, and trade and other payables note 17 generally have short times to maturity.
For this reason, their carrying values approximate to their fair value.
The Groups borrowings note 18 relate principally to amounts drawn down against term loans, the carrying amounts of which approximate their fair values by virtue of being floating rate instruments.
Drax Group plc 125 Annual report and accounts 2013 21 Financial risk disclosures IFRS require us to provide information that assists you in understanding the nature and extent of risks arising from the financial instruments we hold, described in the two previous notes.
Such risks include liquidity, credit and counterparty risk.
We also describe below the wider financial risks that we manage using financial instruments, for example how derivative contracts minimise our exposure to commodity market and foreign currency risk.
Risk The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of commodity and financial markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by the risk management committees as detailed in Principal risks and uncertainties page 46 which identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups trading function under policies approved by the Board of directors.
Commodity price risk The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of electricity, the price of coal, sustainable biomass and other fuels, and the price of CO emissions allowances.
Price variations and market cycles have 2 historically influenced the financial results of the Group and are expected to continue to do so.
The Group has a policy of securing forward power sales with corresponding purchases of fuel and CO emissions allowances 2 when profitable to do so.
All commitments to sell power under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of electricity.
The Group purchases coal, sustainable biomass and other fuels under either fixed or variable priced contracts with different maturities from a variety of domestic and international sources.
All international physical coal purchase contracts transacted at a fixed price and financial coal contracts exchanging floating price coal for fixed price amounts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of coal.
The Group purchases CO emissions allowances under fixed price contracts with different maturity dates from a range 2 of domestic and international sources.
All commitments to purchase CO emissions allowances under fixed price contracts 2 are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of CO emissions allowances.
2 Commodity price sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to commodity prices for outstanding monetary items at the balance sheet date.
The analysis is based on the Groups commodity financial instruments held at each balance sheet date.
If commodity prices had been 5% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups: profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2013 would increase decrease by 6.3 million 2012: increase decrease by 5.4 million.
This is mainly attributable to the Groups exposure to financial coal derivatives: and other equity reserves would decrease increase by 27.0 million 2012: decrease increase by 32.0 million mainly as a result of the changes in the fair value of commitments to sell power.
Interest rate risk Historically the Group has been exposed to interest rate risk principally in relation to its bank debt, and has sought to mitigate this risk with interest rate hedges on a proportion of its debt facilities.
The Group has no interest rate swaps outstanding at the balance sheet date: however this risk management tool remains available to the Group.
Information about the Groups instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk and their repayment schedules is included below.
Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
If interest rates had been 1% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit after tax and net assets for the year ended 31 December 2013 would decrease increase by 1.0 million 2012: decrease increase by 0.2 million as a result of the changes in interest payable during the period.
Financials Governance Sustainable business review Marketplace, performance and risk Overview Drax Group plc 126 Annual report and accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 21.
Financial risk disclosures continued Foreign currency risk Foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into to hedge fixed price international coal purchases in US dollars, biomass purchases in US dollars, Canadian dollars and euros, and CO emissions allowances purchases in euros.
As we progress our 2 biomass transformation plans, we are entering into an increasing volume of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising a variety of foreign currency exchange contracts.
Foreign currency sensitivity If sterling exchange rates had been 5% stronger weaker against other currencies and all other variables were held constant, the Groups: profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2013 would decrease increase by 198.9 million 2012: decrease increase by 86.5 million.
This is mainly attributable to the Groups exposure to foreign currency exchange contracts entered into in relation to fuel purchase contracts: and other equity reserves would decrease increase by 49.6 million 2012: decrease increase by 1.1 million as a result of the changes in the fair value of hedged foreign currency exchange contracts.
Liquidity risk The treasury function is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management under policies approved by the Board of directors.
Liquidity needs are monitored using regular forecasting of operational cash flows and financing commitments.
The Group maintains a mixture of cash and cash equivalents, and committed facilities in order to ensure sufficient funding for business requirements.
The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of non-derivative financial liabilities.
The tables include both interest and principal cash flows.
To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at the balance sheet date.

The weighted average interest rate payable at the balance sheet date on our term loans was 4.65% 2012: 5.02%.
Drax Group plc 127 Annual report and accounts 2013 The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of derivative financial instruments which are markedto-market based on the undiscounted net cash inflows outflows.
Where the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to projected commodity prices, or foreign currency exchange rates, as illustrated by the yield or other forward curves existing at the reporting date.

If a large supplier falls into financial difficulty and or fails to deliver against the contracts, there would be additional costs associated with securing fuel from other suppliers.
The Group enters into fixed price and fixed margin contracts for the sale of electricity to a number of counterparties.
The failure of one or more of these counterparties to perform their contractual obligations may cause the Group financial distress or increase the risk profile of the Group.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date, as summarised below: As at 31 December 2013 2012 m m Financial assets: Cash and cash equivalents 267.3 371.7 Short-term investments 20.0 30.0 Trade and other receivables 251.8 229.5 Derivative financial instruments 38.3 45.3 577.4 676.5 Trade and other receivables are stated gross of the provision for doubtful debts of 5.6 million 2012: 4.7 million.
Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by risk management committees.
Where considered appropriate, counterparties are required to provide credit support in the form of a parent company guarantee, letter of credit, deed of charge, or cash collateral.
In addition, where deemed appropriate the Group has purchased credit default swaps.
The investment of surplus cash is undertaken to maximise the return within Board approved policies.
These policies manage credit risk exposure by setting out minimum rating requirements, maximum investment with any one counterparty and the maturity profile.

Financial risk disclosures continued Capital management The Group manages its capital to ensure it is able to continue as a going concern, and maintain its credit rating while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders equity excluding the hedge reserve, less net cash.
Net cash comprises borrowings disclosed in note 18, cash and cash equivalents in note 16 and short-term investments in note 15.
Equity attributable to the shareholders of the Company comprises issued capital, capital reserves, and retained profits, excluding the hedge reserve see Consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Maintaining an optimal supporting capital structure is one of the Groups key priorities, and as such, our performance is detailed within Operational and financial performance.
The capital structure of the Group is as follows: As at 31 December 2013 2012 m m Borrowings 216.1 90.7 Cash and cash equivalents 267.3 371.7 Short-term investments 20.0 30.0 Net cash 71.2 311.0 Total shareholders equity, excluding hedge reserve 1,473.8 1,493.7 22 Provisions We make a provision for reinstatement to cover the estimated costs of decommissioning, demolishing and remediating our generation assets at the end of their useful economic lives.
The amount represents the present value i. e. it is discounted to reflect the time value of money of the expected costs.
Provisions are for liabilities of uncertain timing and or amount, and as such by their nature are estimated.
Provision is made for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Groups generating assets, when a legal or constructive obligation arises, on a discounted basis.
The amount provided represents the present value of the expected costs.
The discount rate used is a risk free pre-tax rate, reflecting the fact that the estimated future cash flows have built in risks specific to the liability.
An amount equivalent to the discounted provision is capitalised within property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets.
The unwinding of the discount is included in interest payable and similar charges.
Reinstatement m Carrying amount: At 1 January 2012 30.5 Unwinding of discount 1.0 At 1 January 2013 31.5 Unwinding of discount 0.9 At 31 December 2013 32.4 The initial provision and subsequent estimation increases are capitalised within property, plant and equipment and are being depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets.
The unwinding of the discount is included in finance costs note 6.
The provision is estimated using the assumption that the reinstatement will take place between 2039 and 2045, and has been estimated using existing technology at current prices based on independent third party advice, updated on a triennial basis.
Drax Group plc 129 Annual report and accounts 2013 23 Deferred tax Deferred tax is principally an accounting adjustment to reflect the tax charges or credits that are expected to arise in the future, as a result of differences between the accounting and tax rules relating to certain transactions that happened before the end of the current year.
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities during each year are shown below.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset as there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.

The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets with an estimated value of 6.1 million at 31 December 2013 2012: 4.0 million in respect of UK and US losses that are carried forward against future taxable income.
24 Issued equity Our ordinary share capital reflects the total number of shares issued, which are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange.
Maintaining an optimal capital structure In October 2012 we placed 36.5 million shares 9.9% of our issued capital at that time raising net proceeds, after transaction costs, of 187.7 million to help fund the capital investment required for our biomass transformation.
During 2013 this cash has driven investment in our US-based supply chain infrastructure, as described in Operational and financial performance.
Ordinary shares are classified as equity as evidenced by their residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
The share premium account note 26 records the difference between the nominal value of shares issued and the fair value of the consideration received, unless merger relief criteria within Companies Act 2006 are met, in which case the difference is recorded in retained earnings.

Additionally, on 31 January, 28 March and 11 April a total of 2,669 shares, 2,805 shares and 1,748 shares, respectively, were issued on early exercise of options under the Groups Savings-Related Share Option Plan by three separate individuals whose employment with the Group had terminated due to retirement.
25 Share-based payments We operate two share option schemes for our employees the Bonus Matching Plan BMP for directors and senior executives, and the Savings-Related Share Option SAYE Plan for all qualifying employees.
We incur a cost in respect of these schemes in our income statement, which is set out below along with a detailed description of each scheme and the number of options outstanding.
Share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a straight line basis over the relevant vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest.
Costs recognised in the income statement in relation to share-based payments during the year are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2013 2012 m m BMP 5.5 4.5 SAYE 0.3 0.2 5.8 4.7 Share Incentive Plan SIP Between 2008 and 2010, qualifying employees could buy up to 1,500 worth of Partnership shares in any one tax year.
Matching shares were awarded to employees to match any Partnership shares they bought, in a ratio of one-to-one, with the cost of Matching shares borne by the Group.
There were no awards under the SIP Partnership and Matching share plan in 2012, or 2013.

Under the scheme, annual awards of performance and service-related shares are made at nil consideration to executive directors and other senior executives up to a maximum of 150% of their annual bonus.
A proportion of the shares vesting is conditional upon whether the Groups TSR matches or outperforms an index determined in accordance with the scheme rules over three years.
For awards made from 2011, a proportion of the shares vesting is conditional upon performance against the internal Balanced Corporate Scorecard.
The fair value of the 2013, 2012 and 2011 BMP awards of 6.1 million, 5.8 million and 5.5 million, respectively, are being charged to the income statement on a straightline basis over the corresponding three year vesting periods.

The share premium and the merger reserve arose on the financial restructuring of the Group which took place in 2005.
Movements in share premium during 2013 reflect amounts received from the issue of shares under the Groups employee share schemes.
27 Hedge reserve The hedge reserve is a component of our equity reserves.
Changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts for purchases and sales of commodities and foreign currencies are recognised here, to the extent that they qualify as effective hedges under accounting rules.
The cumulative gains and losses unwind and are released as the related contracts mature, and we take delivery of the associated commodity or currency.
Managing our principal risks and uncertainties As described in note 19, all of our derivative contracts are entered into for the purpose of commercial hedging: however not all of these contracts qualify as effective hedges under IAS 39.
The changes in fair value of contracts that do not meet the definition of an IFRS effective hedge are recognised in the income statement.
Managing our principal risks and uncertainties is about locking down exposures to moving prices and securing market level dark green and bark spreads for the future.
The Group designates certain hedging instruments used to address commodity price risk and foreign exchange risk as cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item is documented, along with its risk management objectives.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instruments used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.
Changes in fair value of contracts designated into such hedging relationships are recognised within the hedge reserve to the extent they are effective.
Years ended 31 December 2013 2012 m m At 1 January 16.4 63.3 Losses gains recognised: Commodity contracts 6.2 24.1 Forward foreign currency exchange contracts 69.6 0.8 Released from equity: Commodity contracts 15.9 80.4 Forward foreign currency exchange contracts 1.2 0.4 Related deferred tax, net note 23 11.2 26.0 At 31 December 63.9 16.4 The Groups cash flow hedges relate to commodity contracts principally commitments to sell power and forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
Amounts are recognised in the hedge reserve as the designated contracts are marked-to-market at each period end for the effective portion of the hedge, which is generally 100% of the relevant contract.
Amounts held within the hedge reserve are then released as the related contract matures and the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss.
For power sales contracts, this is when the underlying power is delivered.
For FX contracts, this is when the associated foreign currency transaction is recognised.
Further information in relation to the Groups accounting for financial instruments is included in note 19.

The Drax Power Group section of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme is a defined benefit scheme: a pension arrangement under which participating members receive a pension benefit at retirement determined by the scheme rules.
Members are typically entitled to annual pensions on retirement of 1 80th of final pensionable salary for each year of service plus a tax-free lump sum of three times pension.
The Drax Power Limited Pension Plan, a defined contribution scheme, by contrast provides a retirement benefit that is dependent upon actual contributions made by the Group and members of the scheme.
The income statement charge for the defined benefit scheme is twofold the current past service cost is the increase in the overall liability to pay benefits earned by current employees of the Group in the current previous periods, the net interest cost reflects the unwinding of the pension deficit over time, offset by income earned by the schemes assets.
The income statement charge for the defined contribution scheme represents the contributions due to be paid by the Group in respect of the current period.
Defined contribution scheme The Group operates two defined contribution schemes, The Drax Power Limited Pension Plan and Haven Power Personal Pension Plan, for all qualifying employees.
Pension costs for the defined contribution scheme are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2013 2012 m m Total included in staff costs note 31 3.9 3.2 As at 31 December 2013, contributions of 0.7 million 2012: nil due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the scheme.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Defined benefit scheme The Group operates an approved defined benefit scheme on behalf of the Drax Power Group DPG section of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme ESPS.
This scheme was closed to new members as from 1 January 2002 unless they qualify through being existing members of another part of the ESPS.
The DPG ESPS exposes the Group to actuarial and other risks, the most significant of which are considered to be: Investment risk The scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
The Group holds a significant proportion of growth assets equities, hedge funds and property which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term, create volatility and risk in the short-term.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Groups long term objectives.
Interest rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed upon the Groups liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Groups bond holdings.
Longevity risk The majority of the Groups obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities of the scheme.
Inflation risk The majority of the Groups obligations to pay benefits are linked to inflation, and as such higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The majority of the assets held by the scheme are either unaffected or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
In most cases, caps on inflationary increases are in place, to protect against extreme inflation.
Other risks include operational risks such as paying out the wrong benefits, legislative risks and other demographic risks.
The Trustees insure certain benefits payable on death before retirement.
A contingent liability exists in relation to the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pension.
The last funding valuation of the DPG ESPS was carried out by Aon Hewitt, as a qualified independent actuary, as at 31 March 2010.
A valuation with an effective date of 31 March 2013 is currently ongoing.
Future valuations are required by law at intervals of no more than three years, therefore the next valuation will take place on or before 31 March 2016.
Drax Group plc 137 Annual report and accounts 2013 The initial results of the latest funding valuation at 31 March 2013 have been adjusted to 31 December 2013, taking into account experience over the period since 31 March 2013, changes in market conditions and differences in financial and demographic assumptions.
The principal assumptions used are as follows: As at 31 December 2013 2012 % p. a.
Discount rate 4.5 4.6 Inflation RPI 3.4 3.0 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.2 2.9 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.4 4.0 The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are that a member who retired in 2013 at age 60 will live on average for a further 27 years 2012: 26 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 29 years 2012: 28 years after retirement if they are female.
Similarly life expectancy at age 60 for male and female non-pensioners currently aged 45 is assumed to be 28 years and 31 years respectively 2012: 27 years and 30 years respectively.
The net liability recognised in the balance sheet is the excess of the present value of the defined benefit obligation over the fair value of the plan assets, determined as follows: As at 31 December 2013 2012 m m Defined benefit obligation 220.9 199.0 Fair value of plan assets 179.2 156.9 Net liability recognised in the balance sheet 41.7 42.1 The amounts recognised in the income statement, within other operating and administrative expenses and finance costs, are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2013 2012 m m Included in staff costs note 31 : Current service cost 5.8 5.7 Past service cost 0.1 Total included in other operating and administrative expenses 5.9 5.7 Included in finance costs note 6 : Interest on net defined benefit liability 1.7 1.1 Total included in finance costs 1.7 1.1 Total amounts recognised in the income statement 7.6 6.8 Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in full, as follows: Years ended 31 December 2013 2012 m m Cumulative actuarial losses on defined benefit pension scheme at 1 January 72.6 63.6 Actuarial losses on defined benefit pension scheme recognised in the year 2.8 9.0 Cumulative losses recognised in the statement of comprehensive income at 31 December 75.4 72.6 Financials Governance Sustainable business review Marketplace, performance and risk Overview Drax Group plc 138 Annual report and accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 32.
Retirement benefit obligations continued Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2013 2012 m m Defined benefit obligation at 1 January 199.0 182.4 Current and past service cost 5.9 5.7 Employee contributions 0.2 0.2 Interest cost 9.1 8.8 Actuarial losses 12.2 6.0 Benefits paid 5.5 4.1 Defined benefit obligation at 31 December 220.9 199.0 Actuarial losses arising from changes in demographic assumptions, changes in financial assumptions and gains arising from experience were 4.6 million 2012: nil, 17.1 million 2012: 4.3 million and 9.5 million 2012: 1.7 million loss respectively.
Employee contributions reduced from 1 April 2012 following the introduction of a salary sacrifice arrangement, whereby employees sacrifice pay equal to the contributions that they would otherwise have paid to the DPG ESPS, and in return the Group pays an equal amount to the DPG ESPS.
Changes in the fair value of plan assets are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2013 2012 m m Fair value of plan assets at 1 January 156.9 145.4 Interest income on plan assets 7.4 7.7 Remeasurement gains losses 9.4 3.0 Employer contributions 10.8 10.7 Employee contributions 0.2 0.2 Benefits paid 5.5 4.1 Fair value of plan assets at 31 December 179.2 156.9 Employer contributions included payment of 5.0 million 2012: 5.0 million to reduce the actuarial deficit.
The actual return on plan assets in the period was 16.8 million 2012: 4.7 million.
The fair values of the major categories of plan assets were as follows: As at 31 December 2013 2012 m m 1 Equities 74.8 62.3 2 Fixed interest bonds 71.2 61.1 Property 15.9 14.4 Hedge funds 17.2 16.9 Cash and other assets 0.1 2.2 Fair value of total plan assets 179.2 156.9 1 Under the Groups long-term asset strategy, 60% of assets are invested in return generating asset classes of which 5% is invested in emerging market equity.
The remaining 40% of assets are invested in liability-matching asset classes.
2 Fixed interest bonds include a mixture of corporate and government bonds.
Less than 1% has a sub-investment grade credit rating i. e. BB or lower.
The pension plan assets do not include any ordinary shares issued by Drax Group plc or any property occupied by the Group.
The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the scheme.
Drax Group plc 139 Annual report and accounts 2013 The assumptions for discount rate, inflation rate, rate of increase in pensions paid and expected return on plan assets all have a potentially significant effect on the measurement of the scheme deficit.
The following table provides an indication of the sensitivity of the pension deficit at 31 December 2013 to changes in these assumptions: Decrease Increase in net liability m 0.25 percentage point increase decrease to: Discount rate 9.8 10.2 1 Inflation rate RPI 8.6 8.5 1 year increase decrease to: Life expectancy for men and women 5.8 5.9 1 The sensitivity of the scheme liabilities to salary and pension increases is closely correlated with inflation.
The impact of corresponding decreases in these variables is included here.
The Group is exposed to investment and other experience risks, as described above, and may need to make additional contributions where it is estimated that the benefits will not be met from regular contributions and expected investment income.
The history of experience adjustments is as follows: As at 31 December 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 m m m m m Defined benefit obligation 220.9 199.0 182.4 167.2 146.5 Fair value of plan assets 179.2 156.9 145.4 129.9 113.4 Deficit 41.7 42.1 37.0 37.3 33.1 Experience adjustments on plan liabilities 8.7 1.7 4.3 9.6 23.1 Experience adjustments on plan assets 9.4 3.0 0.6 3.4 8.0 The defined benefit obligation includes benefits for current employees of the Group 70%, former employees of the Group who are yet to retire 5% and retired pensioners 25%.
The weighted-average period over which benefit payments are expected to be made, or the duration of the liabilities, is currently 22 years.
The Group expects to contribute 17.3 million to its pension plans during the 12 months ended 31 December 2014.
The Company intends to fund the deficit, agreed at the last triennial valuation, over the period to 31 December 2018.
Financials Governance Sustainable business review Marketplace, performance and risk Overview Drax Group plc 14 0 Annual report and accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 33 Capital and other financial commitments We have a number of financial commitments i. e. a certain, contractual requirement to make a cash payment in the future that are not recorded within our balance sheet as the contract is not yet due for delivery.
Such commitments include contracts for the future purchase of coal and biomass, operating leases for land and buildings, contracts for the construction of assets and contracts for the provision of services.
Delivering our biomass strategy We have made good progress towards securing near-term volumes of sustainable wood pellets and continue with negotiations for long-term supplies, which is reflected in the level of future commitments to purchase fuel, set out below.

Community Energy Saving Programme Drax Power Limited Drax Power was obliged under the Electricity and Gas Community Energy Saving Programme Order 2009 CESP to deliver energy saving measures to domestic consumers in specific low income areas of Great Britain during the period 1 October 2009 to 31 December 2012 the Obligation Period.
Drax Powers obligation was to deliver 895,138 lifetime tonnes of CO savings.
It entered into an agreement with a third party, pursuant to which the third party was obliged 2 to deliver its CESP obligation, for a total cost of 17 million.
The third party has failed to comply fully with its obligation under the agreement, leaving a significant shortfall against Drax Powers CESP obligation.
Drax Power is considering legal proceedings for breach of contract against the third party.
Drax Power entered into further agreements with additional third parties in order to rectify this shortfall so far as practicable.
Having taken account of the additional measures under those arrangements.
the Office for Gas and Electricity Markets Ofgem announced in May 2013 that Drax Power had achieved 37.1% of its CESP target at the end of the obligation period.
At the same time Ofgem also announced that it was launching an investigation into those companies that had failed to achieve their targets, including Drax Power.
The Gas and Electricity Markets Authority the Authority is the enforcement authority in relation to CESP.
Subject to the findings of Ofgems investigation, it will produce a statement of case or decide that there is no case to answer.
In the case of the former, a recommendation to an enforcement committee of the Authority will be made on enforcement action.
The Authority has wide powers of enforcement, including issuing a penalty or other means of enforcement.
Ofgem has also indicated that a settlement committee of the Authority will be established to consider proposals made by obligated parties to settle investigations.
Drax Group plc 14 1 Annual report and accounts 2013 Representatives of Drax Power had an initial meeting with the Ofgem enforcement team in June 2013, following which it received a formal information request.
Drax Power is co-operating fully with the investigation and has provided a full response to the information request.
In January 2014, Drax Power submitted responses to further information requests.
Ofgem informed Drax Power that it now needed to consider these, and expected to communicate the next steps in the investigation in Autumn 2014, or earlier if possible.
Those next steps will be to issue a statement of case, close the investigation, or update the timeframe for doing so.
As a result, it is not possible to predict accurately what, if any, enforcement action may be taken at this stage.
In the absence of any communication on enforcement subject to the findings of the investigation, it is not practicable to measure reliably the financial impact, if any.
Accordingly no provision has been recognised within the consolidated financial statements in relation to this matter.
Guaranteed Minimum Pension GMP The UK government intends to implement legislation to equalise the GMP, resulting in an increase in the value of GMP for males.
This would correspondingly increase the defined benefit pension obligation of the Group note 32.
At present, the methodology for implementing the equalisation is uncertain and thus the impact cannot be reliably measured.
As a result, no allowance has been made for GMP equalisation in the calculation of the defined benefit obligation within these consolidated financial statements.
