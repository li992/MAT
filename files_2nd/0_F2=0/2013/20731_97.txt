Alliance Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2013 | 117 Company Financial Performance An eight year record of the Companys Financial Performance is provided below.
Prior to the financial year ended 31 January 2007 there were two trusts, The Alliance Trust and The Second Alliance Trust, and the figures are therefore not directly comparable.
This explains why we have only shown an eight year record.
Our intention is over time to extend this to a 10 year record.
