Accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Share schemes The Group operates a number of equity-settled share based compensation schemes, under which services are received from employees including executive directors as consideration for equity instruments of the Company.
The cost of the share based incentives is measured with reference to the fair value of the equity instruments awarded at the date of grant.
Appropriate option pricing models, including Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo, are used to determine the fair value of the awards made.
The fair value takes into account the impact of any market performance conditions, but the impact of non-market performance conditions is not considered in determining the fair value on the date of grant.
Vesting conditions which relate to non-market conditions are allowed for in the assumptions used for the number of options expected to vest.
The estimate of the number of options expected to vest is revised at each balance sheet date.
In some circumstances, employees may provide services in advance of the grant date.
The grant date fair value is estimated for the purposes of recognising the expense during the period between the service commencement period and the grant date.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital contribution.
In the Companys accounts, the cost of the share based incentives is recognised over the vesting period of the awards as an increase in investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding increase in equity.
When options and awards are exercised, they are settled either via issue of new shares in the Company, or through shares held in an ESOP trust, depending on the terms and conditions of the relevant scheme.
The proceeds received from the exercises, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital and share premium.
Dividend distribution Dividend distributions to Burberry Group plcs shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividend becomes a committed obligation.
Final dividends are recognised when they are approved by the shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Investments in Group companies Investments in Group companies are stated at cost, less any provisions to reflect impairment in value.
Impairment of assets Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets net realisable value and value-in-use.
For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows income-generating units.
