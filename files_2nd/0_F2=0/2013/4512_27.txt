Innovating for the future Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Notes to the accounts 1 Segmental analysis The Group has two business units, Currency and Solutions.
Currency is a single operating unit.
Solutions consists of three operating units: Cash Processing Solutions, Security Products and Identity Systems.
The Board, which is the Groups chief operating decision maker, monitors the performance of the Group at an operating unit level and there are therefore four reportable segments.
The principal financial information reviewed by the Board is revenue and operating profit before exceptional items, measured on an IFRS basis.
The Holographics operation, previously part of Security Products, became part of the Currency business, on which it largely depends, from the first day of the 2012 13 financial year and comparatives have been re-presented accordingly.
The Groups segments are: Currency provides printed banknotes, banknote paper and banknote security features Solutions Cash Processing Solutions primarily focused on the production of large banknote sorters and authentication machines for central banks, complementing the Currency business Security Products produces security documents, including authentication labels, brand licensing products, government documents, cheques and postage stamps Identity Systems involved in the provision of passport, ePassport, national ID and eID, driving licence and voter registration schemes Solutions Cash Processing Security Identity Exceptional Currency Solutions Products Systems items Total 2013 m m m m m m Total revenue 298.1 61.2 45.1 84.4 488.8 Less: inter segment revenue 1.9 3.2 5.1 Revenue 296.2 61.2 41.9 84.4 483.7 Operating profit before exceptional items 38.0 8.9 16.3 63.2 Exceptional items operating note 3 1.8 2.1 3.7 7.6 Operating profit loss 36.2 6.8 16.3 3.7 55.6 Net interest expense 3.6 Retirement benefit obligations net finance expense 0.5 Profit before taxation 51.5 Segment assets 220.8 21.8 45.5 49.3 337.4 Unallocated assets 106.5 Total assets 443.9 Segment liabilities 112.2 8.9 23.8 21.9 166.8 Unallocated liabilities 343.7 Total liabilities 510.5 Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment 33.3 1.7 6.8 0.4 42.2 Capital expenditure on intangible assets 3.1 1.0 0.1 4.2 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 17.6 1.8 0.9 3.1 23.4 Amortisation of intangible assets 1.3 1.0 0.6 2.9 Inter segmental transactions are carried out on an arms length basis and eliminated upon consolidation.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted for the impact of the dilutive effect of share options.

A segment level summary of the goodwill allocation is presented below: 2013 2012 m m Currency 4.3 4.3 Cash Processing Solutions 3.5 3.4 7.8 7.7 The majority of the goodwill relates to the acquisition of CSI Inc in 2001 which was allocated to Currency and Cash Processing Solutions on the basis that the acquired business generated synergies for both CGUs.
The estimates of recoverable amounts are based on value in use calculations which utilise cash flow projections covering a five year period using the latest projections approved by management plus a terminal value.
The key assumptions underlying these projections are summarised below: a Currency: the volume and price of orders secured, particularly in respect of banknotes and banknote papers, are based on a combination of the current order book and past experience, taking into account: i Expectations in respect of economic growth and the banknote circulation policies of central banks ii The Groups knowledge of its customer base, gained through its longstanding relationships with them Material input prices and foreign exchange rates are also factors but are not considered significant in the context of the headroom available in the calculations.
b Cash Processing Solutions: unit sales of large sorters and the extent of maintenance income generated from these sales are based on a combination of orders on hand and past experience The pre tax discount rate used for both Currency and Cash Processing Solutions was 13.0 per cent 2011 12: 13.2 per cent.
The discount rates applied take into account the Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC and the relative risks associated with the CGUs operations.
The post tax discount rate used is unchanged compared to the prior year, reflecting the fact that the Groups WACC has not changed and the risks associated with the CGUs in question have not materially changed.
Cash flows beyond the period covered by the projections have been held constant.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed and management do not consider there to be any reasonably possible change in assumptions that could result in the assets recoverable amounts falling below their book values.

fide La Rue Annual Report 2013 78 Innovating for the future Business review Corporate governance Financial statements 12 Financial risk Financial risk management Overview The Groups treasury department, acting in accordance with policies approved by the Board, is responsible for the management of financial risks faced by the Group.
The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, the most significant of which are liquidity risk, market risk and credit risk.
The Groups financial risk management policies are established and reviewed regularly to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and in certain cases hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the Groups operating units.
Group Treasury provides written principles for overall financial risk management as well as policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, use of derivative financial instruments and the investment of excess liquidity.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group manages this risk by ensuring that it maintains sufficient levels of committed borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents.
The level of headroom needed is reviewed annually as part of the Groups planning process.
A maturity analysis of the carrying amount of the Groups borrowings is shown below in the reporting of financial risk section together with associated fair values.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return: a Currency risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US dollar and the euro.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities, unrecognised firm commitments and investments in foreign operations.
To manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities, entities in the Group use forward contracts, transacted with Group Treasury.
Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
Group Treasury is responsible for managing the net position in each currency via foreign exchange contracts transacted with financial institutions.
The Groups risk management policy aims to hedge firm commitments and between 60 per cent and 100 per cent of forecast exposures in each major currency for the subsequent 12 months to the extent that forecast transactions are highly probable.
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk.
The Groups policy is to manage the currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Groups foreign operations primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies and through foreign currency swaps.
The Groups policy is not to hedge net investments in subsidiaries or the translation of profits or losses generated in overseas subsidiaries.
b Interest rate risk All material financial assets and liabilities are maintained at floating rates of interest.
Where the Group has forecast average levels of net debt above 50m on a continuing basis, floating to fixed interest rate swaps will be used to fix the interest rate on a minimum of 50 per cent of the Groups net debt for a period of at least 12 months.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investment securities.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk.
Geographically, there is no concentration of credit risk.
Where appropriate, letters of credit are used to mitigate the credit risk from customers.
The Group has established a credit policy that ensures that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
The Group has a policy to procure advance payments during order negotiation which further reduces credit risk.
Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high credit quality financial institutions and the Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.

The valuation bases are classified according to the degree of estimation required in arriving at the fair values.
Level 1 valuations are derived from unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets, level 2 valuations use observable inputs for the assets or liabilities other than quoted prices, while level 3 valuations are not based on observable market data and are subject to management estimates.
Forward exchange contracts used for hedging The fair value of forward exchange contracts has been determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Interest rate swaps Interest rate swaps are measured by reference to third party bank confirmations and discounted cash flows using the yield curves in effect at the balance sheet date.
Embedded derivatives The fair value of embedded derivatives is calculated based on the present value of forecast future exposures on relevant sales and purchase contracts and using quoted forward foreign exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The movement in fair value of embedded derivatives is shown within revenue or operating expenses as appropriate, depending on the nature of the transaction.
Determination of fair values of non derivative financial assets and liabilities Trade and other receivables and payables Due to their short maturities, trade and other payables, and trade and other receivables have been stated at their book values which approximate to their fair values.
Non derivative financial liabilities Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
The interest rates used to discount estimated cash flows, where applicable, are based on sterling LIBOR.
At 30 March 2013 the discount rate used was 1.0 per cent 31 March 2012: 1.0 per cent.

The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity funding and debt financing, which represent the Groups definition of capital for this purpose: 2013 2012 Note m m Total equity attributable to shareholders of the Company 71.3 49.5 Net debt 20 76.7 24.8 Group capital 148.0 74.3 The Groups debt financing is also analysed in notes 16 and 20.
Included within the Groups net debt are cash and cash equivalent balances that are not readily available for use by the Group.
These balances are not significant, and are not readily available due to restrictions within some of the countries in which we operate.
Earnings per share and dividend payments are the two measures which, in the Boards view, summarise best whether the Groups objectives regarding equity management are being met.
The Groups earnings and dividends per share and relative rates of growth illustrate the extent to which equity attributable to shareholders has changed.
Both measures are disclosed and discussed within the business review and notes 6 and 7.
The Groups objective is to maximise sustainable long term growth of the earnings per share.
fide La Rues dividend policy is to provide shareholders with a competitive return on their investment, while assuring sufficient reinvestment of profits to enable the Group to achieve its strategy.
The dividend per share objective is monitored against the target of a full year dividend cover of 1.75 times.
The proposed total dividend for the year is covered 1.05 times, which although below the policy level, as in the previous year, reflects the Boards confidence in delivering the Improvement Plan.
The decision to pay dividends, and the amount of the dividends, will depend on, among other things the earnings, financial position, capital requirements, general business conditions, cash flows, net debt levels and share buy back plans.
There were no changes to the Groups approach to capital management during the year.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses available to carry forward to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets of 1.7m 2011 12: 1.7m in respect of losses amounting to 6.6m 2011 12: 7.0m that can be carried forward against future taxable income.
Similarly, the Group has not recognised deferred tax assets of 15.7m 2011 12: 16.3m in respect of overseas tax credits that are carried forward for utilisation in future periods.
Unremitted earnings totalled 483m at 30 March 2013 2011 12: 444m.
Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal can be controlled and it was considered unlikely that dividends would be paid from those subsidiaries.
UK capital losses of 330.2m are carried forward at 30 March 2013 2011 12: 330.2m.

This will reduce the UK Groups future current tax charge accordingly.
The UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at 30 March 2013 have been calculated based on the rate of 23 per cent substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
It was announced at the 2012 Autumn Statement and 2013 Budget that the main rate of UK corporation tax shall be reduced to 21 per cent from April 2014 and 20 per cent from April 2015.
These amendments were not substantively enacted at 30 March 2013 and therefore have not been reflected in the deferred tax figures on the balance sheet.

The majority of these provisions are expected to be utilised within one year.
Warranty provisions relate to present obligations for defective products and include known claims as well as anticipated claims that had not been reported at the balance sheet date.
The provisions are management judgements based on information currently available, past history and experience of the products sold.

The mortality assumptions used to assess the defined benefit obligation for the UK plan are based on tables issued by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau.
At 30 March 2013 mortality assumptions were based on the SAPS All lives tables, with future improvements in line with the CMI model, CMI 2011 and a long term rate of 1.0 per cent per annum.
At 31 March 2012 mortality assumptions were based on the PxA92 birth year tables multiplied by a rating of 125 per cent and allowance for medium cohort mortality improvements in future, with a 0.5 per cent mortality improvement underpin.
The resulting life expectancy for a 65 year old pensioner is 22.1 years 2011 12: 20.6 years.
In July 2010, the UK government announced changes to the inflation index used for statutory pension increases both for pensions in payment and pensions in deferment to apply to private sector pension schemes.
This has resulted in a small actuarial gain during the prior period in respect of the fide La Rue pension plans in the UK.

b Defined contribution pension plans The Group operates a number of defined contribution plans for which the charge in the consolidated income statement for the year was 4.1m 2011 12: 2.2m.
c IAS 19 Employee Benefits revised Amendments to IAS 19 will be effective for the 2013 14 financial year and require the replacement of the expected return on assets and interest charge on pension scheme liabilities with a net financing cost based on the discount rate.
IAS 19 requires retrospective adoption and therefore prior periods will be restated.
The Group estimates the impact of the change, had it been effective in 2012 13, would have been to increase operating costs by 1.4m, increase the net interest expense by 6.2m, with compensating adjustments in other comprehensive income leaving equity unchanged.
This would therefore reduce profit after tax by 7.6m, and reduce headline and basic EPS by 7.6p.
The estimated impact for the 2013 14 year is to reduce operating profits by 1.7m the Improvement Plan operating profit target will be impacted by the same amount and increase the net interest expense by 6.7m and hence reduce headline and basic EPS by 8.4p.

While the outcome of litigation and other disputes can never be predicted with certainty, having regard to legal advice received and the insurance arrangements of the Company and its subsidiaries, the Directors believe that adequate provision has been made to cover these matters.
The Group provides guarantees and performance bonds which are issued in the ordinary course of business.
In the event that a guarantee or bond is called, provision may be required subject to the particular circumstances, including an assessment of its recoverability.
In July 2010 the Board commissioned an investigation by external lawyers into issues that had been brought to its attention internally.
The investigation, which was completed in October 2010, found nothing of substance to support the matters raised other than in respect of some paper production issues where it was found that a small number of the many detailed specification parameters of some paper had fallen marginally short of specification.
It was also established that certain paper specification test certificates had been deliberately falsified.
The Board reported the findings of the investigation to the appropriate authorities, who are considering the matter, and has implemented a number of measures arising from the findings of the investigation.
Provision has been made in prior years for the costs associated with the paper production issues identified at this stage including the write off of trade receivables and other costs relating to the investigation, production and rectification of these matters.
Provision has not been made for the potential cost of resolutions or for potential fines from regulatory authorities.
The nature and extent of these resolutions will be the subject of ongoing discussions, the outcome of which cannot be estimated reliably at present.
The timing, response and outcome of the consideration by the authorities of the reported findings of the investigation is also uncertain and the financial consequences, if any, cannot be estimated reliably at present.
