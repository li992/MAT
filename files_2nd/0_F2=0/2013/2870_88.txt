In 2013 there was 1 main defined benefit pension scheme where the Group is the sole employing sponsor: The Capita Pension and Life Assurance Scheme Capita scheme.
Grouped together under Other schemes are smaller arrangements: two further schemes where the Group is the sole employing sponsor which transferred to the Group as a result of the acquisitions of Northgate Managed Services Limited and iQor UK during 2013: an allocated section of a local government pension scheme where the Group is the employing sponsor: a segregated section of a multi-employer scheme in which the Group is a participating employer: a segregated section in an industry wide scheme: and several schemes to which the Group makes contributions under Admitted Body status to our clients defined benefit pension schemes in respect of certain TUPE employees.
For the Admitted Body schemes, the Group will only participate in the schemes for a finite period up to the end of the contract with the client.
These pension schemes are HMRC registered pension schemes and are subject to standard UK pensions and tax law.
Details of the benefits provided by the schemes are set out in each schemes documentation.
For those schemes to which the Group makes contributions under Admitted Body status which are all part of the Local Government Pension Scheme and the allocated section of a local government pension scheme, responsibility for the governance of the schemes lies with boards which operate under a framework of corporate governance and are responsible for following the relevant statutory regulations.
For the other schemes, responsibility for the governance of the schemes lies with the trustees of the scheme and the nature of the relationship between the Group and the trustees is governed by regulations.
The appointment of trustees is determined by the trust documentation.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate funds administered by the trustees of the scheme or on behalf of the board in the case of the local government pension schemes to meet long term pension liabilities to beneficiaries.
The trustees or boards as appropriate of the schemes invest the assets in line with the Statement of Investment Principles.
The Statement of Investment Principles has been established after taking into consideration the liabilities of the schemes and the investment risk that the trustees or boards as appropriate are willing to accept for those schemes governed by trustees the Group will have been consulted before the Statement of Investment Principles was formally adopted.
For the non-local government pension schemes the scheme funding regime introduced by the Pensions Act 2004 required trustees to carry out regular funding assessments of the schemes and establish schedules of contributions and recovery plans when there is a shortfall in the schemes.
The recovery plans detail the amount and timing of the contributions required to eliminate the shortfall in the schemes.
Funding assessments are carried out at least every 3 years.
Approximate funding updates are produced at each scheme anniversary, when a full scheme funding assessment is not being undertaken.
At each scheme funding assessment the present value of the contributions detailed in the current recovery plans is compared with any shortfall revealed.
Where the contributions under the current recovery plans are no longer expected by the end of periods specified in the recovery plans to be sufficient to remove the shortfall, new recovery plans will need to be agreed between the trustees and the Group.
Options include increasing contributions due from the Group, extending the recovery periods with additional contributions paid after the expiry of current recovery periods or some combination of the 2.
The affordability to the Group of any increase in contributions is a primary consideration in the agreement of any new recovery plan.
Where the contributions are more than sufficient to remove the shortfall by the end of the recovery period, options include reducing contributions due, keeping the recovery period the same, or shortening the recovery period.
The most recent funding assessment of the Capita scheme was carried out as at 6 April 2011 and the level of funding disclosed was such that no recovery plan was required.
The next scheme funding assessment will be carried out with an effective date of 6 April 2014.
