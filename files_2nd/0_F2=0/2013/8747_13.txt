NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3 Exceptional items In the table below, property impairment relates to situations in which, owing to a poor trading performance, pubs are unlikely to generate sufficient cash in the future to justify their book value.
In the year, an exceptional charge of 15,551,000 2012: 7,823,000 was incurred in respect of the impairment of property, plant and equipment, other non-current assets and assets held for sale following a review of the companys assets, as required under IAS 36.
The onerous lease provision relates to pubs for which future trading profits, or income from subleases, are not expected to cover the rent.
The provision takes several factors into account, including the expected future profitability of the pub, but also the amount estimated as payable on surrender of the lease, where this is a possible outcome.
In the year, 3,278,000 2012: 2,229,000 was incurred in respect of onerous leases.
The loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment in the year relates to the sale of three pubs, and in the previous year related to the sale of three pubs.
