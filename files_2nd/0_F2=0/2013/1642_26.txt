b taxation Current tax including UK corporation tax and foreign tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the Balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only to the extent that, at the Balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in the future has been entered into by the subsidiary or associate.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a nondiscounted basis.
c foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at actual exchange rates as of the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss account.
d Sharebased payments The expense for sharebased payments is recognised in accordance with the accounting policy for the Consolidated financial statements of the Group and is recognised in the subsidiary companies employing the relevant employees.
The Company recognises the expense relating to the Executive Directors.
