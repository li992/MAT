Section 7 Review of Access Markets Section 7.4 - Wholesale ISDN2 Exchange Line Services Definition Wholesale ISDN2 Exchange Line Services are the links between an end user and the remote concentrator unit by means of ISDN2 technology.
Digital ISDN2 exchange lines are basic rate ISDN lines, which provide a means to deploy a wide range of digital services over a standard local loop.
A single ISDN2 line supports two 64kbit s channels for voice and data calls, plus a 16kbit s channel for signalling.
Key Regulatory Changes The existing regime was set in the Wholesale Fixed Narrowband Market Review published by Ofcom in September 2009.
ISDN2 regulation is now being reviewed as part of the Fixed Access Market Review FAMR published on 4 July 2013.
BT has already set out its position that the cost orientation regulation should be removed as part of its submission to the FAMR Call for Inputs in January 2013.
Ofcoms final statement is expected in Q4 2013 14 which will set the regulation from April 2014.
Summary Market Performance Total CCA Operating Return on Revenue Costs Return MCE Year m m m % 2013 132 63 69 29.5% 2012 134 66 68 28.1% Key Market Changes ISDN2 volumes have continued to decline over many years as alternatives including SIP Trunking, broadband and NGA services, along with further broadband penetration, provide opportunities for substitution.
Broadband has completely superseded ISDN2 in the residential segment and, where internet access is the primary requirement, broadband has replaced ISDN2 in the business segment.
The service is in long term decline and barriers to customers switching to alternatives are low.
