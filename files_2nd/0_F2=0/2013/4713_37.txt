Free cash flow Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure that comprises the net cash flow from operating activities aggregated with the net movements in loans and with the net purchase of property, plant and equipment and computer software that form part of net cash flow from investing activities.
The groups management believes the measure assists users of the financial statements in understanding the groups cash generating performance as it comprises items which arise from the running of the ongoing business.
The remaining components of net cash flow from investing activities that do not form part of free cash flow, as defined by the groups management, are in respect of the acquisition and sale of businesses.
The groups management regards the purchase and disposal of property, plant and equipment and computer software as ultimately non-discretionary since ongoing investment in plant, machinery and technology is required to support the day-to-day operations, whereas acquisitions and sales of businesses are discretionary.
Where appropriate, separate discussion is given for the impacts of acquisitions and sale of businesses, dividends paid and the purchase of own shares, each of which arises from decisions that are independent from the running of the ongoing underlying business.
The free cash flow measure is used by management for their own planning, reporting and incentive purposes since it provides information on those elements of performance which local managers are most directly able to influence.
For the reconciliation of free cash flow see page 76.
Return on average total invested capital Return on average total invested capital is a non-GAAP measure that is used by management to assess the return obtained from the groups asset base and is calculated to aid evaluation of the performance of the business.
The profit used in assessing the return on total invested capital reflects the operating performance of the business stated before exceptional items and finance charges after applying the tax rate before exceptional items for the year.
Average total invested capital is calculated using the average derived from the consolidated balance sheets at the beginning, middle and end of the year.
Average capital employed comprises average net assets for the year, excluding post employment benefit net liabilities net of deferred tax and average net borrowings.
This average capital employed is then aggregated with the average restructuring and integration costs net of tax, and goodwill written off to reserves at 1July2004, thedate of transition to IFRS, to obtain the average total invested capital.
Calculations for the return on average total invested capital for the years ended 30 June 2013, 30 June 2012 and 30 June 2011 were as follows: 2013 2012 2011 million million million Operating profit 3,431 3,158 2,595 Exceptional operating items 99 40 289 Share of associates profits after tax 199 213 176 Tax at the tax rate before exceptional items of 17.7% 2012 17.7%, 2011 17.4% 660 604 532 3,069 2,807 2,528 Average net assets excluding net post employment liabilities 8,210 7,111 6,221 Average net borrowings 7,957 7,438 6,805 Average restructuring and integration costs net of tax 1,413 1,353 1,274 Goodwill at 1 July 2004 1,562 1,562 1,562 Average total invested capital 19,142 17,464 15,862 Return on average total invested capital 16.0% 16.1% 15.9% 86 Diageo Annual Report 2013 5.
Economic profit Economic profit is a non-GAAP measure that is used by management to assess the groups return from its asset base compared to a standard cost ofcapital charge and is calculated to aid evaluation of the performance of the business.
The profit used in assessing the return from the groups asset base and the asset base itself are the same as those used in the calculation for the return on average total invested capital see above.
The standard capital charge applied to the average total invested capital is currently 8%, being managements assessment of a constant minimum level of return that the group expects to generate from its asset base.
Economic profit is calculated as the difference between the standard capital charge on the average invested assets and the actual return achieved by the group on those assets.
Calculations for economic profit for the years ended 30 June 2013, 30 June 2012 and 30 June 2011 were as follows: 2013 2012 2011 million million million Average total invested capital see above 19,142 17,464 15,862 Operating profit 3,431 3,158 2,595 Exceptional operating items 99 40 289 Share of associates profit after tax 199 213 176 Tax at the tax rate before exceptional items of 17.7% 2012 17.7%: 2011 17.4% 660 604 532 3,069 2,807 2,528 Capital charge at 8% of average total invested capital 1,531 1,397 1,269 Economic profit 1,538 1,410 1,259 6.
Tax rate before exceptional items Tax rate before exceptional items is a non-GAAP measure that is calculated by dividing the total tax charge on continuing operations before tax charges and credits classified as or in respect of exceptional items by profit before taxation adjusted to exclude the impact of sale of businesses and exceptional operating items, expressed as a percentage.
The measure is used by management to assess the rate of tax applied to the groups continuing operations before tax on exceptional items.
The tax rates from continuing operations before exceptional and after exceptional items for the years ended 30 June 2013, 30 June 2012 and 30 June 2011 were calculated as follows: Year ended Year ended Year ended 30 June 2013 30 June 2012 30 June 2011 million million million Tax before exceptional items a 584 533 463 Tax credits in respect of exceptional items 55 19 54 Exceptional tax charges credits 524 66 Taxation on profit from continuing operations b 529 1,038 343 Profit from continuing operations before taxation and exceptional items c 3,305 3,014 2,663 Sale of businesses 83 147 14 Exceptional operating items 99 40 289 Profit before taxation d 3,123 3,121 2,360 Tax rate before exceptional items a c 17.7% 17.7% 17.4% Tax rate from continuing operation after exceptional items b d 16.9% 33.3% 14.5% 7.

The share data, competitive set classifications and share of voice data contained in this document are taken from independent industry sources in the markets in which Diageo operates.
Net sales are sales after deducting excise duties.
Diageo incurs excise duties throughout the world.
In some countries excise duties are based on sales and are separately identified on the face of the invoice to the external customer.
In others it is effectively a production tax which is incurred when the spirit is removed from bonded warehouses.
In these countries excise duties are part of the cost of goods sold and are not separately identified on the sales invoice.
Changes in the level of excise duties can significantly affect the level of reported sales and cost of sales without directly reflecting changes in volume, mix or profitability, which are the variables that have an impact on the element of sales retained by the group.
Price mix is the number of percentage points by which the organic movement in net sales exceeds the organic movement in volume.
The difference arises because of changes in the composition of sales between higher and lower priced variants or as price changes are implemented.
