Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Executive Committee for the purposes of making strategic decisions and assessing performance.
The Executive Committee considers the business principally from a geographical perspective, but with the RB Pharmaceuticals in table referred to as RBP and Food businesses being managed separately given the significantly different nature of these businesses and the risks and rewards associated with them.
The Groups geographical segments comprise Europe and North America ENA : Latin America, North Asia, South East Asia and Australia and New Zealand LAPAC : and Russia and CIS, Middle East, North Africa, Turkey and Sub-Saharan Africa RUMEA.
The geographical segments derive their revenue primarily from the manufacture and sale of branded products in the health, hygiene and home categories.
RB Pharmaceuticals derives its revenue exclusively from the sales of buprenorphine-based prescription drugs, used to treat opiate dependence and Food derives its revenue from food products primarily sold in ENA.
The Scholl Footwear business, previously reported as part of RUMEA, is now reported as part of ENA.
Comparative information has been restated on a consistent basis.
The Executive Committee assesses the performance of the operating segments based on net revenue and operating profit before exceptional items.
Finance income and expense are not allocated to segments, as they are managed on a central Group basis.
Specific items of income and expense reported to the Executive Committee outside of the individual segment financial information, are shown in the Corporate segment.
For the year ended 31 December 2013 the Corporate segment had nil profit or loss 2012: 32m relating primarily to the disposal of the Paras Personal Care business.

The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 24% to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013.
Accordingly, the Companys profits for the year ended 31 December 2013 are taxed at an effective rate of 23.25% 2012: 24.5%.
UK income tax of 124m 2012: 138m is included within current tax and is calculated at 23.25% 2012: 24.5% of the estimated assessable profit for the year.
Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the relevant jurisdictions.
The total tax charge for the year can be reconciled to the accounting profit as follows: 2012 1 2013 restated m m Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 2,314 2,408 Tax at the notional UK corporation tax rate of 23.25% 2012: 24.5% 538 590 Effects of: Tax at rates other than the UK corporation tax rate 67 10 Adjustments to amounts carried in respect of unresolved tax matters 160 77 Incurrence utilisation of tax losses 1 7 Withholdings and local taxes 21 16 Adjustment in respect of prior periods 9 58 Impact of changes in tax rates 95 80 Exceptional items 20 8 Other permanent differences 5 13 Tax on profit on ordinary activities 574 583 1 Refer to note 1 for further details.
The tax charge is expected to be impacted by items in the nature of those listed above for the foreseeable future.
Following the enactment of legislation in the UK to reduce the corporation tax rate to 21% from 1 April 2014, the total tax charge in 2013 includes the impact on the income statement of calculating the UK deferred tax balances at the lower UK corporation tax rate.
The impact of this rate change is a 95m reduction in the tax charge in the income statement.

Basic Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net income attributable to owners of the parent 2013: 1,739m 2012: 1,821m by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year 2013: 718,384,234 2012: 724,238,235.
Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
The Company has two categories of potentially dilutive ordinary shares: Executive Share Options and Employee Sharesave schemes.
The options only dilute earnings when they result in the issue of shares at a value below the market price of the share and when all performance criteria if applicable have been met.
As at 31 December 2013, there were 4 million 2012: 4 million of Executive Share Options not included within the dilution because the exercise price for the options was greater than the average share price for the year.
The Directors believe that diluted earnings per ordinary share, adjusted for the impact of exceptional items after the appropriate tax amount, provides additional useful information on underlying trends to Shareholders in respect of earnings per ordinary share.

Software includes intangible assets under construction of 52m 2012: 31m.
The majority of brands, all of goodwill and certain other intangibles are considered to have indefinite lives for the reasons noted in the Accounting Policies and therefore are subject to an annual impairment review.
A number of small non core brands are deemed to have a finite life and are amortised accordingly.

RB Annual Report 2013 65 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements 9 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are allocated to a cash generating unit or a group of cash generating units together CGU for the purposes of impairment testing.
Cash Generating Units After considering all the evidence available, including how brand and production assets generate cash inflows and how management monitors the business, the Directors have concluded that the Groups CGUs are health sexual wellbeing, health VMS, health other, hygiene, home, and food.
Integration of the Schiff business was ongoing but not completed by year end.
As a result this business continued to be treated as its own CGU, health VMS.
This CGU will be reassessed following the completion of integration into the Groups operations in 2014.
An analysis of the net book amount of indefinite life assets and goodwill by CGU is shown below: 1 2013 2012 restated Indefinite Indefinite life assets Goodwill Total life assets Goodwill Total CGU Key brands m m m m m m Health sexual wellbeing Durex 1,915 956 2,871 1,952 976 2,928 Health other Gaviscon, Mucinex, Nurofen, Scholl, Strepsils 3,036 1,786 4,822 2,926 1,783 4,709 Health VMS Airborne, MegaRed, Move Free 801 352 1,153 815 357 1,172 Hygiene Bang, Clearasil, Dettol, Finish, Harpic, Lysol, Mortein, Veet 1,082 149 1,231 1,176 149 1,325 Home Air Wick, Calgon, Vanish, Woolite 781 42 823 786 42 828 Food Frenchs 30 30 31 31 7,645 3,285 10,930 7,686 3,307 10,993 1 Refer to note 26 for further details.
Indefinite life assets allocated to the Food CGU are not considered significant relative to the Groups total indefinite life assets.
As such the disclosures below do not include discussion on the assumptions specific to Food.
Annual Impairment Review Key Assumptions The annual impairment review for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives is based on an assessment of each CGUs value in use.
Value in use is calculated from cash flow projections, based on historical operating results and short-term budgets and medium-term business plans approved by management covering a four-year period with an extrapolated fifth year.
These projections exclude any estimated future cash inflows or outflows expected to arise from restructuring not yet implemented.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using the estimated long-term growth rates stated below.
Individual long-term growth rates are applied to each product type within a CGU, and as such ranges are provided in some cases below.
The long-term growth rates applied do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the market and countries in which the CGU operates.
Management has assessed the appropriate discount rate for each individual CGU, using a Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC for comparable companies operating in similar markets and geographies as the Group as the base discount rate, adjusted for risks specific to each CGU.
Due to the similar geographic and product diversification of their respective markets and risks associated with each CGU, a pre-tax discount rate of 11% was determined for each of the health sexual wellbeing, health other, hygiene and home CGUs 2012: 11%.
Health VMS is predominantly concentrated in one market, being the US.
Therefore a pre-tax discount rate of 14% was applied, reflecting the increased risk associated with this CGU from its market concentration and the fact that this is a relatively new business to the Group.
Key assumptions which are kept under constant review by management in the impairment review include future sales volumes, revenue growth rates and prices, and future levels of marketing support required to sustain, grow and further innovate brands.
The cash flow projections also take account of the expected impact from new product initiatives, efficiency initiatives and the maturity of the markets in which each CGU operates.
These key assumptions are based on past performance and our experience of volumes, growth rates and prices in our key markets.
Pre-tax discount CGU Growth % rate % Health sexual wellbeing 4 11 Health VMS 2.5 14 Health other 1-4 11 Hygiene 0-4 11 Home 0-2 11 Impairment Review In October 2013 an impairment review was performed by comparing the recoverable amount of each CGU with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
No impairment was considered necessary.
There were no significant changes in the period subsequent to the review.
Any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amounts of the health sexual wellbeing, health other, hygiene and home CGUs is based would not imply an impairment.
With a recoverable amount exceeding its carrying value by 19m, the health VMS CGU is the most sensitive to reasonably possible changes to key assumptions.
This is expected of a recent acquisition where the acquired intangible assets were valued at fair value and updated at the end of the hindsight period in December 2013.
Any significant change in assumptions could cause the carrying value to exceed the recoverable amount.
For example, if all other assumptions were held constant, a reduction of 100 bps of the assumed compound annual growth rate in undiscounted net cash flows would result in the carrying value of this CGU exceeding its recoverable amount by 15m.
Management expects that the completion of the integration of the business with the health other CGU in 2014 will realise planned synergies and hence minimise the risk of impairment.

As at 31 December 2013 the value of cash assets outside of netting agreements was 774m 2012: 824m and the value of overdrafts outside of netting agreements was 3m 2012: 5m.
Financial Risk Management The Groups multinational operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates foreign exchange risk, market prices, interest rates, credit risks and liquidity.
The Group has in place a risk management programme that uses foreign currency financial instruments, including debt, and other instruments, to limit the impact of these risks on the financial performance of the Group.
The Groups financing and financial risk management activities are centralised into Group Treasury GT to achieve benefits of scale and control.
GT manages financial exposures of the Group centrally in a manner consistent with underlying business risks.
GT manages only those risks and flows generated by the underlying commercial operations and speculative transactions are not undertaken.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies, guidelines and authority levels for all areas of Treasury activity and individually approves significant activities.
GT operates under the close control of the CFO and is subject to periodic independent reviews and audits, both internal and external.
Market Risk a Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
The Groups policy is to align interest costs and operating profit of its major currencies in order to provide some protection against the translation exposure on foreign currency profits after tax.
The Group may undertake borrowings and other hedging methods in the currencies of the countries where most of its assets are located.
It is the Groups policy to monitor and only where appropriate hedge its foreign currency transaction exposure.
These transaction exposures arise mainly from foreign currency receipts and payments for goods and services and from the remittances of foreign currency dividends and loans.
The local business units enter into forward foreign exchange contracts with GT to manage these exposures where practical and allowed by local regulations.
GT matches the Group exposures, and hedges the net position where possible, using spot and forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2013 was 5,287m payable 2012: 4,303m payable.
The Group has designated bonds totalling $1,000m 597m as the hedging instrument in a net investment hedge relationship.
The hedged risk is the foreign exchange currency risk on the value of the Groups net investment in assets and liabilities denominated in US dollars.
The net gain or loss under this arrangement is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The net effect on other comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2013 was a 6m gain 2012: nil.
Cash Flow Hedge Profile The Group held forward foreign exchange contracts denominated as cash flow hedges primarily in Euro, Australian dollars, Singapore dollars, Sterling and US dollars.
Notional value of the payable leg resulting from these financial instruments was as follows: 2013 2012 m m Euro 319 90 Australian dollar 177 90 Singapore dollar 120 43 Sterling 98 Canadian dollar 60 US dollars 32 1 Other 60 55 806 339 These forward foreign exchange contracts are expected to mature over the period January 2014 to January 2015 2012: January 2013 to January 2014.
There is no ineffective portion recognised in the income statement arising from cash flow hedges 2012: nil.
Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in other comprehensive income on forward exchange contracts in 2013 of 13m gain 2012: 3m gain are recognised in the income statement in the year or years during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement, which is generally within 12 months from the balance sheet date.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the derivative assets in the balance sheet.
In the case of cash flow hedges, these are denominated in a diverse range of currencies, where a fluctuation in one individual currency relationship, with all others held constant, does not have a significant effect on the income statement or Shareholders equity.
A fluctuation analysis has been performed for all currencies.
The largest potential fluctuation would be in respect of forward contracts between the Australian dollar and the Singapore dollar.
If the Singapore dollar had strengthened weakened by 5% against the Australian dollar, with all other variables held constant, the impact on Shareholders equity would have been 12m 2012: less than 1m.
As at 31 December 2013 if all other currencies had strengthened weakened by 5% against Sterling with all other variables held constant, this would have had an immaterial effect on the income statement or Shareholders equity 2012: immaterial.
RB Annual Report 2013 71 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements 14 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED The remaining major monetary financial instruments liquid assets, receivables, interest and non-interest bearing liabilities are directly denominated in the local functional currency or are transferred to the functional currency of the Group through the use of derivatives.
b Price risk Due to the nature of its business the Group is exposed to commodity price risk related to the production or packaging of finished goods, such as oil related, and a diverse range of other, raw materials.
This risk is, however, managed primarily through medium-term contracts with certain key suppliers and is not therefore viewed as being a material risk.
c Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The Group has both interest-bearing and non interest-bearing assets and liabilities.
The Group monitors its interest expense rate exposure on a regular basis.
The Group manages its interest income rate exposure on its gross financial assets by using a combination of fixed rate term deposits.
The Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a regular basis.
Various scenarios are simulated taking into consideration refinancing, renewal of existing positions, alternative financing and hedging.
Based on these scenarios, the Group calculates the impact on the income statement of a defined interest rate shift.
For each simulation, the same interest rate shift is used for all currencies, calculated on a full year and pre-tax basis.
The scenarios are only run for liabilities that represent the major interest-bearing positions.
Based on the simulations performed, the impact on the income statement of a 50 basis-point shift in interest rates would be a maximum increase of 11m 2012: 9m or decrease of 11m 2012: 9m, respectively for the liabilities covered.
The simulation is done on a periodic basis to verify that the maximum loss potential is within the limit given by management.
2. Credit Risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers.
The credit quality of trade and other receivables is detailed in note 13.
Financial institution counterparties are subject to approval under the Groups counterparty risk policy and such approval is limited to financial institutions with a BBB rating or above.
The Group uses BBB and higher rated counterparties to manage risk and uses BBB rated counterparties by exception.
The amount of exposure to any individual counterparty is subject to a limit defined within the counterparty risk policy, which is reassessed annually by the Board.
Derivative financial instruments are only traded with counterparties approved in accordance with the Board approved policy.
Derivative risk is measured using a risk weighting method.
The table below summarises the Groups major financial institution counterparties by credit rating lower of S&P and Moodys and balances cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits at the balance sheet date.
Liquidity Risk Cash flow forecasting is performed by the local business units and aggregated by GT.
GT monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
Funds over and above those required for short-term working capital purposes by the overseas businesses are generally remitted to GT.
The Group uses the remittances to settle obligations, repay borrowings, or, in the event of a surplus, invest in short-term instruments issued by institutions with a BBB rating or better.
Borrowing Facilities The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it.
The Group has bilateral credit facilities with high-quality international banks.
All of these facilities have similar or equivalent terms and conditions, and have a financial covenant, which is not expected to restrict the Groups future operations.
At the end of 2013, the Group had, in addition to its long-term debt of 598m 2012: 3m, committed borrowing facilities totalling 4,350m 2012: 4,000m, of which 3,500m exceeded 12 months maturity.
Of the total facilities at the year end, nil 2012: nil was utilised.
The committed borrowing facilities, together with available uncommitted facilities and central cash and investments, are considered sufficient to meet the Groups projected cash requirements.
The undrawn committed facilities available, in respect of which all conditions precedent have been met at the balance sheet date, were as follows: 2013 2012 m m Undrawn committed borrowing facilities: Expiring within one year 850 400 Expiring between one and two years 500 850 Expiring after more than two years 3,000 2,750 4,350 4,000 All borrowing facilities are at floating rates of interest.
72 RB Annual Report 2013 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements 14 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED The facilities have been arranged to cover general corporate purposes including support for commercial paper issuance.
All facilities incur commitment fees at market rates.
Headroom between net debt and available facilities at 31 December 2013 was 2,254m 2012: 1,574m.
The Groups borrowing limit at 31 December 2013 calculated in accordance with the Articles of Association was 61,689m 2012: 60,468m.

Capital Management The Group considers capital to be net debt plus total equity.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents, short-term available for sale financial assets and financing derivative financial instruments refer to note 16.
Total equity includes share capital, reserves and retained earnings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet.
2013 2012 m m Net debt note 16 2,096 2,426 Total equity 6,336 5,922 8,432 8,348 The objectives for managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, in order to provide returns for Shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an efficient capital structure to optimise the cost of capital.
In maintaining an appropriate capital structure and providing returns for Shareholders, the Company provided returns to Shareholders in 2013 in the form of dividends and the buy back of shares.
Refer to notes 27 and 22 respectively.
The Group monitors net debt and at year end the Group had net debt of 2,096m 2012: 2,426m.
The Group seeks to pay down net debt using cash generated by the business to maintain an appropriate level of financial flexibility.

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that there will be an outflow of resources to settle that obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Legal provisions include 222m 2012: nil of exceptional legal provisions in relation to a number of historic regulatory investigations by various government authorities in a number of markets.
These investigations involve mainly competition law inquiries.
The restructuring provision relates principally to redundancies, the majority of which is expected to be utilised within one year.
Other provisions include onerous lease provisions expiring between 2014 and 2016 of 6m 2012: 7m and environmental and other obligations throughout the Group, the majority of which are expected to be used within five years.

The Group is involved in a number of investigations by government authorities and has made provisions for such investigations, where appropriate.
Where it is too early to determine the likely outcome of these matters, the Directors have made no provision for such potential liabilities.
The Group from time to time is involved in disputes in relation to ongoing tax matters in a number of jurisdictions around the world.
Where appropriate, the Directors make provisions based on their assessment of each case.

The Groups most significant defined benefit pension plan UK is a final salary plan, which closed to new entrants in 2005.
As at 31 December 2013 there were 6,902 2012: 6,843 participants receiving benefits, 5,949 2012: 6,168 participants with deferred benefits and 365 2012: 516 active participants.
Trustees of the plan are appointed by the Group, active members and pensioner membership, and are responsible for the governance of the plan, including paying all administrative costs and compliance with regulations.
The plan is funded by the payment of contributions to the plans Trust, which is a separate entity from the rest of the Group.
The Group also operates a number of other post-retirement plans in certain countries.
The major plan is in the US US Retiree Health Care Plan, where salaried participants become eligible for retiree health care benefits after they reach a combined age and years of service rendered figure of 70, although the age must be a minimum of 55.
This plan closed to new members in 2009.
As at 31 December 2013 there were 2,422 2012: 2,691 eligible retirees and 1,061 2012: 1,193 current employees potentially eligible.

For the UK plan the mortality assumptions were based on the following tables: the average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at aged 60 on the balance sheet date is as follows: 2013 2012 UK US UK US years years years years Male 28.4 25.1 28.2 24.1 Female 30.3 27.5 30.1 25.8 The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at aged 60 15 years after the balance sheet date for the UK and 20 years after the balance sheet date for the US, is as follows: 2013 2012 UK US UK US years years years years Male 30.2 27.3 30.0 25.7 Female 32.2 29.4 31.9 26.7 For the UK plan the mortality assumptions were based on the standard SAPS mortality table with medium cohort improvements to 2009 scaled by 90% for males and 100% for females.
Allowance for future improvements is made by adopting the 2012 edition of the CMI series with a long term trend of 1.5% per annum.
For the US plan the mortality assumptions were determined using the RP2000 Generational Mortality Table.
The sensitivity of the UK defined benefit obligation to changes in the principal assumptions Change in Defined Change in assumption Benefit Obligation Discount rate Increase 0.1% Decrease by 1.8% RPI increase Increase 0.1% Increase by 1.4% Life expectancy Members younger by 1 year Increase by 2.3% The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in one assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.

All Total equities and Total bonds are quoted investments.
All Total other assets are unquoted investments.
Through its defined benefit pension plans and post-employment medical plans, the group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: Asset volatility: The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if plan assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
Both the UK and US plans hold equities, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term while providing volatility and risk in the short-term.
As the plans mature, the Group intends to reduce the level of investment risk by investing more in assets that better match the liabilities.
All the UK plans have agreed with the Company a plan to fide-risk the investment strategy of the plans at a pace that is commensurate with a planned return to full funding over a reasonable time scale.
The fide-risking plan provides for a proportion of the investment portfolio to move from equity holdings to government and corporate bonds over time.
The corporate bonds are global securities with an emphasis on the UK and US.
However, the Group believes that due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities and the strength of the supporting Group, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of the Groups long-term strategy to manage the plans efficiently.
Changes in bond yields: A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans bond holdings.
78 RB Annual Report 2013 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements 21 PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT COMMITMENTS CONTINUED Inflation risk: Some of the Group pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation.
The majority of the plans assets are either unaffected by fixed interest bonds or loosely correlated with equities inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
In the US plans, the pensions in payment are not linked to inflation, so this is a less material risk.
Life expectancy: The majority of the plans obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member.
Whilst the plans allow for an increase in life expectancy, increases above this assumption will result in an increase in the plans liabilities.
This is particularly significant in the UK plan, where inflationary increases result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.
Change in regulations: The Group is aware that future changes to the regulatory framework may impact the funding basis of the various plans in the future.
The Groups pensions department monitors the changes in legislation and analyses the risks as and when they occur.
Investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
A large portion of assets in 2013 consists of quoted equities and quoted bonds, although the group also invests in property, and cash.
The group believes that quoted equities offer the best returns over the long term with an acceptable level of risk.
The Trustees of all the UK funds have moved the overwhelming majority of their assets to low cost investment funds in consultation with the Company whilst maintaining a prudent diversification.
For the largest UK plan, a full independent actuarial valuation was carried out at 5 April 2010 and a new valuation is currently underway with an effective date of 5 April 2013.
For the US plan, a full independent actuarial valuation was carried out at 1 January 2012.
The Group has agreed that it will aim to eliminate the pension plan deficit in the UK and Ireland over the next four years.
Funding levels are monitored on an annual basis and the current agreed contribution rate is 19.5% of pensionable salaries in the UK and nil in the US.
The triennial valuation for the largest UK plan effective date 5 April 2013 is due to be finalised during 2014, and any further contributions in excess of the ongoing contribution rate of 19.5% will be finalised at that time.
The total contribution expected for 2014 is 54m and will be finalised when the current UK plan valuation is signed off by the Group and Trustee.
The Group considers that the contribution rates set at the last valuation date, and any future further contributions in excess of the contribution rate, will be sufficient to eliminate the deficit over the agreed period and that regular contributions, which are based on service costs, will not increase significantly.
For the purpose of IAS19 the projected unit valuation method was used for the UK and US plans, rolling forward the preliminary UK plan triennial valuation results at 5 April 2013 and the 1 January 2012 US plan valuation to 31 December 2013.
For the largest UK plan, the weighted average duration of the deferred benefit obligation is 17.3 years 2012: 17.3 years.

RB Annual Report 2013 79 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements 23 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Group operates a number of incentive schemes, including a share option scheme, a restricted share scheme, and other share award schemes.
All schemes are equity settled.
The charge for share-based payments for the year was 55m 2012: 49m.
Executive Share Awards Share options and restricted shares Executive share awards are awarded to the Top400 Management Group.
Executive Share Awards have a contractual life of ten years but vest according to the following compound average annual growth CAAG rates in adjusted earnings per share over a three-year period: Adjusted earnings per CAAG share growth over % of options and per year % three years % shares vesting 9 29.5 100 8 26.0 80 7 22.5 60 6 19.1 40 The cost is spread over the three years of the performance period.
For Executive Committee and Top40 members vesting conditions are not retested.
For remaining Top400 members the targets can be retested over four or five years.
If any target has not been met any remaining shares or options which have not vested will lapse.
Other Share Awards Other share awards represent SAYE Schemes offered to all staff within the relevant geographic area and a number of Senior Executive Share Ownership Policy Plan SOPP awards.
Other share awards have contractual lives of three to seven years and are generally not subject to any vesting criteria other than the employees continued employment.
Individual tranches of these other share awards are not material for detailed disclosure and therefore have been aggregated in the tables below.
All outstanding Executive and Other share awards as at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 are included in the tables below which analyse the charge for 2013 and 2012.
The Group has used the Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair value of one award on the date of the grant of the award.
Options outstanding at 31 December 2013 that could have been exercised at that date were 4,360,531 2012: 5,672,533 with a weighted average exercise price of 28.35 2012: 26.08.
RB Annual Report 2013 81 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements 23 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED The assumptions made within the valuation calculation with respect to the achievement of performance criteria are based on the Directors expectations in light of the Groups business model and relevant published targets.
Under the terms of the plans, early exercise may only be granted in exceptional circumstances and therefore the effect of early exercise is not incorporated into the calculation.
The calculation also assumes that there will be no leavers in the following year.
No material modifications have been made to the plans in 2013 or 2012 for the purposes of the valuation.
Volatility: An estimate of future volatility is made with reference to historical volatility over a similar time period to the performance period or the contractual life as appropriate.
Historical volatility is calculated based on the annualised standard deviation of the Groups daily share price movement, being an approximation to the continuously compounded rate of return on the share.
National Insurance contributions are payable in respect of certain share-based payment transactions and are treated as cash-settled transactions.
The weighted average share price for the year was 45.80 2012: 35.79.

25 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS On 19 March 2013 the Group purchased an additional 25% of Shanghai Manon Trading Company Limited, thereby increasing its share to 75.01%.
The consideration for the transaction amounted to 28m, including transaction costs.
Key management compensation is disclosed in note 5a.
The principal subsidiary undertakings included in the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2013 are disclosed in note 2 to the Parent Company financial statements.
Collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb BMS On 8 May 2013 the Group received regulatory approval for a three-year collaboration agreement with BMS for a number of market-leading over-thecounter consumer health care brands in Brazil, Mexico and certain other parts of Latin America.
This arrangement, which also includes personnel, supply contracts and an option to acquire legal title to the related intellectual property at the end of the collaboration period for a multiple of earnings, was secured for an upfront cash payment of $482m 311m.
This transaction is accounted for as a business combination under IFRS 3 Revised Business Combinations.
The collaboration agreement provides the Group with an immediate health care platform, distribution network and infrastructure in Latin America and trusted brands with a strong fit with the Groups existing health portfolio.
All assets and liabilities were recognised at the following provisional fair values.
The amount of consideration transferred over the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the Group financial statements.
Provisional fair value m Intangible asset 57 Deferred tax assets 4 Provisions 16 Net assets acquired 45 Goodwill 36 Consideration transferred for net assets and goodwill 81 Payment for prepaid option 250 Total consideration transferred 331 Cash consideration 311 Deferred consideration 20 Total consideration transferred 331 Related to the transaction, payments totalling 250m have been attributed to the future option to acquire legal title to the related intellectual property.
The option is exercisable by the Group at the end of the collaboration period, subject to certain payments, in addition to the 331m, to be made at that time.
The prepayment of this option is not an asset purchased as part of the business combination under IFRS 3 Revised, and is therefore disclosed separately in the table above.
The prepayment is included in other non-current receivables.
The intangible asset acquired relates to the three-year collaboration agreement.
Goodwill represents the strategic premium to establish an immediate platform, infrastructure and distribution network in the Latin American over-thecounter consumer health care market, the value of expected synergy savings, and assembled workforce.
Acquisition related costs of 3m are included in net operating expenses and exceptional items in the income statement.
The fair values of identifiable net assets are stated at provisional amounts which will be finalised within the 12-month hindsight period following acquisition.
Provisional fair value adjustments cover the recognition of acquired intangibles and their associated deferred tax and accounting policy alignment.
All assets and liabilities are included within the LAPAC operating segment and the health category.
The amount of revenue and profit of the BMS business since acquisition were not material in the context of the Group Income Statement.
Had the business been acquired on 1 January 2013, the revenue and profit of the Group for the year would not have been materially different to those appearing in the Group Income Statement.

Schiff is a leading provider of branded vitamins, nutrition supplements and nutrition bars predominantly in the US.
Schiffs vitamins, minerals and supplements VMS product portfolio includes a number of market-leading brands in the specialist product category in the US.
This transaction has been accounted for by the acquisition method.

The table below sets out the movements from the provisional fair values detailed in the 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements and the updated final fair values at acquisition date.
The adjustments made to restate the Group balance sheet primarily relate to the recognition of a minor brand intangible, and adjustments to provisions for legal matters and trade related expenses due to additional information which has come to light during the hindsight period and recognition of related deferred tax liabilities.
These adjustments have been recorded as a prior year restatement of the balance sheet of the Group as at 31 December 2012.
There is no impact to the Group income statement for the year ended 31 December 2012.
