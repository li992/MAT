Year ended 31 December 2013 Year ended 31 December 2012 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Net profit on ordinary activities before taxation 30,886 274,660 305,546 29,326 118,555 147,881 Corporation tax at 23.25% 2012: 24.5% 7,181 63,858 71,039 7,185 29,046 36,231 Effects of: Non-taxable UK dividends 3,951 3,951 3,953 3,953 Non-taxable overseas dividends 4,608 4,608 4,407 4,407 Withholding tax written off1, 6231, 623 1,603 1,603 Non taxable gains on investments held at fair value through profit or loss 67,395 67,395 31,902 31,902 Excess management expenses not utilised in year3, 1833, 183 2,313 2,313 Unused loan relationship deficits for the year1, 7061, 706 1,677 1,677 Preference dividends not deductible in determining 19 19 21 21 taxable profit Capitalised expenses 3,537 3,537 2,856 2,856 Disallowable expenses 7 7 20 20 Current tax charge 1,623 1,623 1,603 1,603 c Deferred tax Due to the Companys status as an investment trust, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on income outstanding at the end of the year as this will be covered by unrelieved business charges and eligible unrelieved foreign tax 2012: nil.
d Factors that may affect future tax charges The Company has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 2 8,338,000 2012: 27,727,000 arising as a result of having unrelieved loan relationship deficits and eligible unrelieved foreign tax.
It is unlikely that the Company will obtain relief for these in the future so no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
