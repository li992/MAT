Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information St. Jamess Place plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 171 b experience assumptions The principal experience assumptions have been set on a best estimate basis.
The persistency assumptions are derived from the Groups own experience or, where insufficient data exists, from external industryexperience.
The expense assumptions include allowance for both the costs charged by the relevant third party administrators for acquisition and maintenance, and the corporate costs incurred in respect of covered business.
The corporate costs have been apportioned so that the total maintenance costs represent the anticipated ongoing expenses, including systems development costs, which are expected to arise in future years in meeting the policy servicing requirements of the in-force business.
Mortality and morbidity assumptions have been set by reference to the Groups own experience, published industry data and the rates set by the Groups reassurers.
c tax The EEV result has been calculated allowing for tax and has been grossed up to a pre-tax level for presentation in the profit and loss account.
The corporation tax rate used for this grossing up is 20.3% 2012: 21.3% for UK life and pensions business, 12.5% 2012:12.5% for Irish life and pensions business and 20.5% 2012: 21.7% for unit trust business.
Future tax has been determined assuming a continuation of the current tax legislation.
The reduction in tax rates for UK business reflects the changes in tax rate enacted in the year.
