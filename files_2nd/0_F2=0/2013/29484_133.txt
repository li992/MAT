Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information St. Jamess Place plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 169 Notes to the European Embedded Value Basis I.
BASIS OF PREPARATION The supplementary information on pages 166 to 176 shows the Groups results as measured on a European Embedded Value EEV basis.
This includes results for the life, pension and investment business, including unit trust business.
The valuation is undertaken on a basis determined in accordance with the EEV Principles issued in May 2004 by the Chief Financial Officers Forum, a group of chief financial officers from 19 major European insurers as supplemented by the Additional Guidance on EEV Disclosures issued in October 2005 together the EEV Principles.
The treatment of all other transactions and balances is unchanged from the primary financial statements on an IFRS basis.
The EEV basis recognises the long-term nature of the emergence of shareholder cash returns by reflecting the net present value of expected future cash flows.
Under the EEV methodology, profit is recognised as it is earned over the life of the products within the covered business.
The embedded value of the covered business is the sum of the shareholders net worth in respect of the covered business and the present value of the projected profit stream.
METHODOLOGY a Covered business The covered business is the life, pension and investment business, including unit trust business, undertaken by the Group.
b Calculation of eeV on existing business Profit from existing business comprises the expected return on the value of in-force business at the start of the year plus the impact of any changes in the assumptions regarding future operating experience, plus changes in reserving basis other than economic assumption changes, plus profits and losses caused by differences between the actual experience for the period and the assumptions used to calculate the embedded value at the end of the period.
c allowance for risk The allowance for risk in the shareholder cash flows is a key feature of the EEV Principles.
The EEV Principles set out three main areas of allowance for risk in the embedded value: the risk discount rate: the allowance for the cost of financial options and guarantees: and the cost of holding both prudential reserves and any additional capital required.
The reported EEV allows for risk via a risk discount rate based on a bottom-up market-consistent approach, plus an appropriate additional margin for non-market risk.
The Group does not offer products that carry any significant financial guarantees or options.
d non-market risk Best estimate assumptions have been established based on available information and when used within the market consistent calculations provide the primary evaluation of the impact of non-market risk.
However, some non-market operational risks are not symmetric, with adverse experience having a higher impact on the EEV than favourable experience.
Allowance has been made for this by increasing the risk discount rate by 0.8% 2012: 0.8%.
e the risk discount rate A market-consistent embedded value for each product class has been calculated.
In principle, each cash flow is valued using the discount rate applied to such a cash flow in the capital markets.
However in practice, where cash flows are either independent or move linearly with market movement, it is possible to apply a simplified method known as the certainty equivalent approach.
Under this approach all assets are assumed to earn the risk free rate and are discounted using that risk free rate.
A market-consistent cost of holding the required capital has also been calculated.
As part of this approach, an appropriate adjustment has been made to reflect the fact that the value of tax relief on expenses does not move linearly with market movements.
Finally, an additional allowance for non-market risk has been made by increasing the discount rate by 0.8%.
For presentational purposes, a risk discount rate has then been calculated which under the EEV basis gives the same value determined above.
This provides an average risk discount rate for the EEV and is described in relation to the risk free rate.
This average risk discount rate has also been used to calculate the published value of new business.
