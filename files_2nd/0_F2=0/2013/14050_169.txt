The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The annual impairment test is performed immediately prior to the year end based on financial plans approved by senior management covering a five-year period.
The recoverable amount of each CGU is based on value in use calculations derived from these plans.
The plans include a terminal value based on the projections for the final year of that plan, with a growth rate assumption applied to subsequent periods.
The results of the impairment test are further reviewed after the year end in light of any significant changes in the environment.
Key assumptions The key assumptions affecting the CGUs within each operating segment are discussed below.
The table shows the key assumptions applied in the impairment review across the CGUs.
These assumptions are revised year on year in light of changes to the current economic environment.
