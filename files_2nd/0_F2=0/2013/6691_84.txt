Financial risk management objectives and policies Financial risk factors and management The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, a sterling bond, hire purchase and finance lease contracts, and cash and short term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide an appropriate level of net debt to fund the Groups activities, namely working capital, fixed asset expenditure, acquisitions and dividends.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps and fuel swaps.
The purpose of these is to manage the interest rate and fuel price risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout 2013 and 2012, the Groups policy that no trading in derivatives shall be undertaken and derivatives are only purchased for internal benefit.
The main financial risks arising from the Groups activities are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
Risks arising from fuel derivatives are explained in note 22.
8LI S %LIEH VSYT TPG %RRYEP 6ITSVX ERH %GGSYRXW MRERGMEP WXEXIQIRXW Interest rate risk The Group borrows and deposits funds and is exposed to changes in interest rates.
The Boards policy toward cash deposits is to deposit cash short term on UK money markets.
Interest payable on senior bank borrowings is based on re-fixing the rate of interest over short periods of time of up to 36 months.
During the year the Group has partially managed interest rate risk by hedging.
Excluding fixed rate debt, the Group has net borrowings and hence the present adverse risk is an increase in interest rates.
The maturity and interest rate profile of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group as at 29 June 2013 and 30 June 2012 is as follows: Average Within More than r 1 1-2 years 2-3 years 3-4 years 4-5 years Total ate year 5 years % m m m m m m m Year ended 29 June 2013 Floating rate assets liabilities Variable rate loans 1.82 136.2 136.2 Gross floating rate liabilities 136.2 136.2 Cash assets 0.59 248.9 248.9 Long term deposits 3.60 1.6 1.6 Net floating rate assets liabilities 248.9 1.6 136.2 114.3 Fixed rate liabilities 200m sterling 7.5 year bond 5.38 200.0 200.0 Obligations under finance lease and hire purchase contracts 8.36 1.6 1.1 0.5 0.4 3.6 Net fixed rate liabilities 1.6 1.1 0.5 0.4 200.0 203.6 Year ended 30 June 2012 Floating rate assets liabilities Variable rate loans 1.92 138.5 138.5 Interest rate swaps 2.40 80.6 80.6 Gross floating rate assets liabilities 80.6 138.5 57.9 Cash assets 0.79 253.7 253.7 Long term deposits 3.60 1.6 1.6 Net floating rate assets liabilities 334.3 1.6 138.5 197.4 Fixed rate liabilities 200m sterling 7.5 year bond 5.38 200.0 200.0 Obligations under finance lease and hire purchase contracts 8.20 3.2 1.4 0.9 0.4 0.3 6.2 Interest rate swaps 2.40 80.6 80.6 Net fixed rate liabilities 83.8 1.4 0.9 0.4 0.3 200.0 286.8 Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is re-priced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.

Financial risk management objectives and policies continued At 29 June 2013, the Group had no interest rate swaps 2012: three interest rate swaps totalling 80.0m as all interest rate swaps expired during the year ended 29 June 2013.
During the year ended 29 June 2013, these three interest swaps have resulted in a realised loss of 0.5m 2012: 1.6m.
The net fixed rate liability at 29 June 2013 was nil 2012: 0.6m.
Interest rate risk table The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.

On 24 March 2010, the Group raised a 200m bond of 7.5 years maturing on 29 September 2017.
The level of drawdown and prevailing interest rates are detailed in note 19.
Available liquidity as at 29 June 2013 and 30 June 2012 was as follows: 2013 2012 m m Five year syndicated facility 2016 275.0 275.0 200m 7.5 year 5.375% sterling bond 2017 200.0 200.0 Total core facilities 475.0 475.0 Amount drawn down at 29 June 2013 333.0 335.0 Headroom 142.0 140.0 The Groups road passenger vehicles can be financed by hire purchase or finance lease arrangements, or term loans at fixed rates of interest over two to five year primary borrowing periods.
This provides a regular inflow of funding to cover expenditure as it arises.
8LI S %LIEH VSYT TPG %RRYEP 6ITSVX ERH %GGSYRXW MRERGMEP WXEXIQIRXW Foreign currency risk On 26 July 2010, a $10.0m five year facility was agreed with RBS to ensure dollar investment in our US joint venture is funded by dollar borrowings to provide an effective foreign currency hedge.
The amount drawn on the facility reflects the investment in and the working capital requirements of the Groups share in its US joint venture.
As the investment and borrowings are both denominated in US $ this provides a natural hedge over the Groups foreign currency exposure.
Credit risk The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables see note 16 and cash deposits see note 17.
The maximum credit risk exposure of the Group comprises the amounts presented in the balance sheet, which are stated net of provisions for doubtful debt.
A provision is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of future cashflows.
The majority of the Groups receivables are with public or quasi-public bodies such as the DfT.
The Group does not consider these counterparties to be a significant credit risk.
Other than this, the Group does not consider it has significant concentrations of credit risk.
Risk of exposure to non-return of cash on deposit is managed through a treasury policy of holding deposits with banks rated Aor A3 or above by at least one of the credit rating agencies.
Our treasury policy outlines the maximum level of deposit that can be placed with any one given financial institution.
Contractual payments The tables below summarise the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 29 June 2013 and 30 June 2012 based on contractual undiscounted payments.

Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Managing capital The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 29 June 2013 and 30 June 2012.
The Group applies the primary objective by managing its capital structure such that net debt adjusted to exclude restricted cash to EBITDA before exceptionals is within a range which retains an investment grade debt rating of at least BBB-.
In the year ended 2 July 2011, the Group obtained investment grade long term credit ratings from Standard & Poors and Moodys as follows: Standard & Poors BBBStable outlook Moodys Baa3 Stable outlook Those ratings have been maintained in the year ended 29 June 2013.
The Groups policy is to maintain an adjusted net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5x to 2.5x through the cycle.
The Groups calculation of adjusted net debt is set out in note 19 and includes cash and short term deposits, interest-bearing loans and borrowings, and excludes restricted cash.
During the year no specific actions were required to be taken by the Group to maintain this ratio and ensure the investment grade debt rating.
Adjusted net debt at the year end was 299.6m 2012: 296.0m, equivalent to 1.87x 2012: 1.80x EBITDA operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and exceptional items.
Operating leases The Group uses operating leases for bus and coach purchases across the Group primarily where the vehicles service specific contracts to mitigate the risk of ownership at the end of the contract.
This results in 2.6m 2012: 2.3m of cost within operating charges which would otherwise have been charged to interest.
The Group holds operating leases for its bus fleet with an asset capital value of 44.2m 2012: 55.9m.
The majority of assets in the rail division are financed by operating leases, in particular rolling stock.
Leases are entered into by the respective operating companies and are not the subject of parent company guarantees.
