102 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 24 Government grants and loans The Group through its Canadian subsidiaries Ultra Electronics Tactical Communication Systems UETCS and Ultra Electronics Maritime Systems UEMS participates in three Canadian programmes that provide government support in relation to the development of certain of its products.
Under the Strategic Aerospace and Defence Initiative SADI, the Canadian Federal Government provides a long-term funding arrangement in respect of certain eligible research and development project costs.
Under this arrangement, up to $32m will be provided to UETCS and reimbursed at favourable rates of interest over the period 2016 to 2030.
Up to $8m will be provided to UEMS and reimbursed at favourable rates of interest over the period 2020 to 2033.
The benefit of the below market rate of interest has been calculated as the difference between the proceeds received and the fair value of the loans and has been credited to profit in the year.
The fair value of the loans have been calculated using a market interest rate for a similar instrument applicable at the time the agreements were signed.
UETCS also participates in the Investissement Quebec IQ research and development programme, whereby IQ shares in the cost of research and development of certain specified new products.
Under this arrangement IQ will finance up to $14m of eligible costs associated with these specified projects.
This funding is repayable under a royalty arrangement over the period 2014 to 2021 if these products are successfully brought to market.
Royalties only become payable when sales of these products are made.
As there is no minimum repayment, funding received in respect of the IQ programme has been included in the income statement.
Amounts recognised in the financial statements in respect of these programmes were as follows: 2013 2012 000 000 Fair value of SADI loan brought forward 2,914 1,680 Contributions 1,282 970 Interest charged to finance costs 539 327 Foreign exchange differences 398 63 Fair value of SADI loan carried forward 4,337 2,914 Government grants credited to profit in the year 2013 2012 000 000 SADI 1,128 1,841 IQ 426 787 Other 265 - 1,819 2,628 Ultra Electronics Limited received a 265,000 grant from the Technology Strategy Board in the year.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so.
The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets of 3.47 million 2012: 3.40 million relating to tax losses, due to uncertainty as to their recoverability.
There are no temporary differences which arise in respect of undistributed earnings.
The main rate of UK corporation tax will reduce from 23% to 21% from 1 April 2014 and to 20% from 1 April 2015.
The rate of 20% has been used to calculate the deferred tax balances at 31 December 2013 as this rate reduction was enacted before the balance sheet date.

This is an approved scheme and vesting is unconditional.
Options vest after three years and lapse after ten years from the date of grant.
Executive Share Option Scheme The Executive Share Option Scheme provides share options for nominated employees in the UK, US and Canada.
This is an unapproved scheme and vesting is unconditional.
Options vest after three years and lapse after seven years from the date of grant.
Long-Term Incentive Plan Details in relation to the LTIP are included in the Directors Remuneration report on pages 63 to 75.

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historic volatility of the Groups share price.
Share options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the year.
The weighted average share price during the year was 17.65.
The fair value of options granted during the year was 1,869,986 2012: 1,912,376.
The Groups equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The fair value for all schemes other than the LTIP schemes are measured by use of the Black Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions: Share save CSOP ESOS LTIP 2013 Weighted average share price 15.82 17.14 17.10 n a Weighted average exercise price 14.60 17.10 17.07 n a Expected volatility % 25.2 25.7 25.8 n a Expected option life years 3.6 65 n a Risk-free interest rate % 1.1 1.5 1.1 n a Expected dividends % 2.2 1.6 2.2 n a Figures in the above table show an average across the invested schemes at year end.

Introduction 108 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 31 Retirement benefit schemes Some UK employees of the Group are members of the Ultra Electronics Limited defined benefit scheme which was established on 1 March 1994.
The scheme is a final salary scheme with the majority of members accruing 1 60th of their final pensionable earnings for each year of pensionable service.
The scheme was closed to new members in 2003.
A new defined contribution plan was introduced for other employees and new joiners in the UK.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit scheme was carried out as at 6 April 2013.
The Group also operates two defined contribution schemes for overseas employees.
In addition to these schemes, the Groups Tactical Communication Systems business based in Montreal, Canada, has three defined benefit schemes.
Defined contribution schemes The total cost charged to income in respect of the defined contribution schemes was 4,916,000 2012: 5,889,000.
Defined benefit schemes The UK defined benefit scheme was actuarially assessed at 31 December 2013 using the projected unit method.
The Canadian defined benefit schemes were actuarially assessed at 31 December 2013 using the projected unit method.
In the UK, Ultra Electronics Limited sponsors the Ultra Electronics Pension Scheme, a funded defined benefit pension scheme.
The scheme is administered within a trust which is legally separate from the Company.
Trustees are appointed by both the Company and the schemes membership and act in the interest of the scheme and all relevant stakeholders, including the members and the Company.
The Trustees are also responsible for the investment of the schemes assets.
This scheme provides pensions and lump sums to members on retirement and to their dependants on death.
Members who leave service before retirement are entitled to a deferred pension.
Active members of the scheme pay contributions via salary sacrifice and the Company pays the balance of the cost as determined by regular actuarial valuations.
The Trustees are required to use prudent assumptions to value the liabilities and costs of the scheme whereas the accounting assumptions must be best estimates.
Responsibility for making good any deficit within the scheme lies with the Company and this introduces a number of risks for the Company.
The major risks are: interest rate risk: inflation risk: investment risk: longevity risk.
The Company and Trustees are aware of these risks and manage them through appropriate investment and funding strategies.
The Trustees manage governance and operational risks through a number of internal controls policies, including a risk register.
The scheme is subject to regular actuarial valuations, which are usually carried out every three years.
The actuarial valuation as at 6 April 2013 has been finalised and will result in an increase in the additional deficit payment required from 7.2m in 2013 to 8.0m in 2014, 8.5m in 2015 and 9.0m for the following 8.5 years.
The next actuarial valuation is due to be carried out with an effective date of 6 April 2016.
These actuarial valuations are carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Pensions Act 2004 and so include deliberate margins for prudence.
This contrasts with these accounting disclosures, which are determined using best estimate assumptions.
The results of the 6 April 2013 valuation have been projected to 31 December 2013 by a qualified independent actuary.
The figures in the following disclosure were measured using the Projected Unit Method.
Key financial assumptions used in the valuation of these schemes were as follows: UK Canada UK Canada 2013 2013 2012 2012 Discount rate 4.45% 4.45% 4.70% 4.70% Inflation rate RPI 3.40% 3.40% 2.85% 2.85% Inflation rate CPI 2.40% n a 2.05% n a Expected rate of salary increases 3.90% 3.90% 3.35% 3.35% Future pension increases pre 6 4 08 3.10% 3.40% 2.75% 2.85% Future pension increases post 6 4 08 2.00% n a 1.85% n a For each of these assumptions there is a range of possible values.
Relatively small changes in some of these variables can have a significant impact on the level of the total obligation.
For the UK scheme, a 0.1% reduction in the inflation assumption to 3.3% and a 0.1% increase in the discount rate to 4.55% would decrease the schemes liabilities by 1.8% and 1.9% respectively.
If the members life expectancy were to increase by 1 year, the scheme liabilities would increase by 2.9%.
The average duration of the scheme liabilities is 19 years 2012: 22 years.
The key demographic assumption used was in relation to the mortality rates of current and future pensioners.
Due to the size of the scheme the mortality rates were based on standard tables, namely: Current pensioners 95% SAPS S1PMA 105% SAPS S1PFA c2002 MC1% imps from 2002 Future pensioners 95% SAPS S1PMA 105% SAPS S1PFA c2002 MC1% imps from 2002 The mortality assumptions used in the valuation of the UK scheme make appropriate allowance for future improvements in longevity and are set out below: 2013 2012 Current pensioners at 65 males 22 years 22 years Current pensioners at 65 females 24 years 24 years Future pensioners at 65 males 24 years 24 years Future pensioners at 65 females 26 years 25 years Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 109 Notes to accounts Group continued 31 Retirement benefit schemes continued Amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of the Groups defined benefit schemes were as follows: UK Total UK Canada Total 2012 Canada 2012 2013 2013 2013 m 2012 m m m m As restated m As restated Past service cost --- --- Current service cost 4.7 0.1 4.8 5.2 0.2 5.4 Administration expenses 0.6 0.3 0.9 0.4 - 0.4 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 11.0 0.5 11.5 11.1 0.5 11.6 Expected return on pension scheme assets 7.7 0.4 8.1 7.2 0.5 7.7 Loss on settlements - 0.3 0.3 --- 8.6 0.8 9.4 9.5 0.2 9.7 Of the current service cost for the year, 3.7 million 2012: 4.2 million has been included in cost of sales, and 1.1 million 2012: 1.2 million has been included in administrative expenses.
