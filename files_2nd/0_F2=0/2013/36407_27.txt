Notes forming part of the Company financial statements i Accounting policies Accounting convention The Company financial statements are prepared under UK GAAP and the historical cost convention as modied by the revaluation of investments in subsidiary undertakings.
The Company has prepared its financial statements on a going concern basis, see page 129.
Subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures Shares in subsidiary undertakings are carried at amounts equal to their original cost and any subsequent movement in the revaluation reserve of those subsidiaries, thus reecting in the Companys balance sheet the surplus arising from the revaluation and the sale of investments and investment properties of those subsidiaries, limited to the value of the Group balance sheet.
Other investment The Companys other investment is carried at cost less provision for impairment.
Accounting policies for share-based payments, other investment, deferred tax and financial instruments are the same as those of the Group and are set out on pages 72 to 74.
The Company, together with another Group company, contributes to a dened benefit pension scheme for its employees.
The Companys share in the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme cannot be readily determined on a consistent and measurable basis.
As a result, the directors consider it appropriate to account for the contributions to the scheme as if it were a dened contribution scheme.
Accordingly the directors have taken the multi employer exemption allowable under the accounting standards.
Details of the Groups pension plan can be found on pages 91 to 92. ii Loss attributable to members of the parent undertaking As permitted by section 408 Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account.
