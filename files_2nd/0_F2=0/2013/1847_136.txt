The most recent full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out at 30 November 2010.
The results of this valuation have been updated to 30 June 2013 by a quali ed independent actuary.

The assets of the fide ned bene t scheme have been calculated at fair bid value.
The liabilities of the Scheme have been calculated at each balance sheet date using the following assumptions: Principal actuarial assumptions 2013 2012 Weighted average assumptions to determine bene t obligations Discount rate 4.70% 4.80% Rate of price in ation 3.40% 2.90% Weighted average assumptions to determine net cost Discount rate 4.80% 5.50% Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 4.91% 6.10% Rate of price in ation 2.90% 3.50% Members are assumed to exchange 15% of their pension for cash on retirement.
The assumptions have been chosen by the Group following advice from Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited, the Groups actuarial advisers.
The following table illustrates the life expectancy for an average member on reaching age 65, according to the mortality assumptions used to calculate the Scheme liabilities: Assumptions Male Female Retired member born in 1948 life expectancy at age 65 24.2 years 26.6 years Non-retired member born in 1968 life expectancy at age 65 25.9 years 28.7 years The base mortality assumptions are based upon the S1NA mortality tables.
The Group has carried out a mortality investigation of the Schemes membership to ensure that this is an appropriate assumption.
Allowance for future increases in life expectancy is made in line with the medium cohort projection, with an underpin on the annual rate of improvement in mortality of 1.25% 2012: 1.25%.

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily Government bonds, the historical level of risk premium associated with other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the actual asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
The actual return on Scheme assets was as follows: 2013 2012 m m Actual return on Scheme assets 31.4 15.5 The five-year history of experience adjustments arising on Scheme liabilities assets were as follows: 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 Present value of fide ned bene t obligations m 308.3 280.5 250.6 248.3 201.9 Fair value of Scheme assets m 294.9 259.1 238.8 202.2 170.4 fide cit in the Scheme m 13.4 21.4 11.8 46.1 31.5 Experience adjustment in Scheme liabilities m 6.8 Percentage of Scheme liabilities % 2.7 Experience adjustment in Scheme assets m 18.6 0.7 18.5 17.6 20.5 Percentage of Scheme assets % 6.3 0.3 7.7 8.7 12.0 Amount recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income m 4.8 24.1 22.0 26.3 14.1 Percentage of Scheme assets % 1.6 9.3 9.2 13.0 8.3 The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses since 30 June 2005 recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income is a loss of 13.8m.
