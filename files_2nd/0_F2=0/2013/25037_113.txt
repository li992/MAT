1 This simple example assumes IG Markets is 100% hedged on the client trade and makes an equal and opposite gain on our broker position to the amount paid to the client.
The cost of our hedging with the broker has been ignored for simplicity.
Thus our net profit is 25.58, which is recorded in trading revenue and consists of the commission and financing charges levied on the client sTEP 3 Traditionally, clients who held long positions overnight would need to pay a funding charge, while clients with short positions would receive interest if held overnight.
This charge or interest is calculated as the one-month sterling LIBOR rate - a spread.
However, with current market interest rates lower than the spread, clients with short positions also incur a charge.
As at 15 May 2012, the current LIBOR rate was 0.68%, while the spread was 2.5%, resulting in a net financing charge of 1.82% for short CFD positions held overnight which for UK CFDs means those open at 10pm UK time.
A corresponding long CFD position would incur a charge of 3.18%.
Closing price day one 80.75p Daily interest charged 0.81 calculated as 20,000 x 80.75p x 1.82% 365 days 162 | IG GROUP HOLDINGS PLC | 2013 ANNUAL REPORT 163
