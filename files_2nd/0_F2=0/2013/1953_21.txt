In the ordinary course of business inventories have been written back by a net 3.2 million 2012 written down by 14.7 million in the year.
There has been no exceptional write-down of inventories in the period 2012 nil as outlined in note 5 on page 67.
Land with a carrying value of 53.2 million 2012 56.4 million was used as security for land payables note 17.
The directors consider all inventories to be essentially current in nature although the Groups operational cycle is such that a proportion of inventories will not be realised within 12 months.
It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specic inventory will be realised as this is subject to a number of issues including consumer demand and planning permission delays.
The Company has no inventory.

Other financial assets comprise loans, largely with non xed repayment dates and variable repayment amounts, provided as part of sales transactions that are secured by way of a second legal charge on the related property.
The assets are recorded at fair value, being the estimated amount receivable by the Group, discounted to present day values.
The fair value of future anticipated cash receipts takes into account the directors view of future house price movements, the expected timing of receipts and the likelihood that a purchaser defaults on a repayment.
The directors revisit the future anticipated cash receipts from the assets at the end of each reporting period.
The difference between the anticipated future receipt and the initial fair value is charged over the estimated deferred term tocost of sales, with the financial asset increasing to its full expected cash settlement value on the anticipated receipt date.
The imputed interest credited 2012 charged to cost of sales for the year ended 31 July 2013 was 0.125 million 20120.113million.
Credit risk, which the directors currently consider to be largely mitigated through holding a second legal charge over the assets, is accounted for in determining present values.
The directors review the financial assets for impairment at the end of each reporting period.
There were no indicators of impairment at 31 July 2013 2012 nil.
None of the other financial assets are past their due dates 2012 nil.
At initial recognition, the fair value of the assets is calculated using a discount rate, appropriate to the class of assets, which reects market conditions at the date of entering into the transaction.
The directors consider at the end of each reporting period whether the initial market discount rate still reects up to date market conditions.
If a revision is required, the fair value of the asset is re-measured at the present value of the revised future cash ows using this revised discount rate: the difference between this value and the carrying value of the asset is recorded against the carrying value of the asset and recognised directly in the statements of comprehensive income.
The directors considered that there was no material difference between the initial market discount rate and the market discount rate at 31 July 2013 or 31 July 2012 and accordingly have not recognised any movements directly within the statements of comprehensive income to date.
The Company has no other financial assets.

18 Financial risk management The Groups financial instruments comprise cash, preference shares, bank loans and overdrafts and various items such as trade receivables, other financial assets and trade payables that arise directly from its operations.
The main objective of the Groups policy towards financial instruments is to maximise returns on the Groups cash balances, manage the Groups working capital requirements and finance the Groups ongoing operations.
The Companys only financial instruments are cash and preference shares.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base to underpin the future development of the business in order to deliver value to shareholders.
The Group nances its operations through reinvested profits, bank borrowings, cash in hand, preference shares and the management of working capital.
From time to time, the trustees of the Bellway Employee Share Trust 1992 the'Trust' also purchase shares for the future satisfaction of employee share options.
Management of financial risk The main risks associated with the Groups financial instruments have been identied as credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk.
The Board is responsible for managing these risks and the policies adopted, which have remained largely unchanged during the year, are set out below.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk is limited by the fact that the Group generally receives cash at the point of legal completion of its sales.
There is no specic concentration of credit risk in respect of home sales as the exposure is spread over a number of customers.
In respect of trade receivables and other financial assets, the amounts presented in the balance sheet are stated after adjusting for any doubtful receivables, based on the judgement of the Groups management through using both previous experience and knowledge of the current position see note 15.
In managing risk the Group assesses the credit risk of its counterparties before entering into a transaction.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period or subsequently and the Group does not anticipate any losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
In relation to land payables, certain payables are secured on the respective land asset held see note 17.
No other security is held against any other financial assets of the Group.
The Board considers the Groups exposure to credit risk to be acceptable and normal for an entity of its size given the industry in which it operates.
Overview Performance Governance Accounts Other Information 75 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2013 18 Financial risk management continued Liquidity risk The Group nances its operations through a mixture of equity comprising share capital, reserves and reinvested profits and debt comprising bank overdraft facilities and borrowings.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by monitoring existing facilities and cash ows against forecast requirements based on a two year rolling cash forecast.
The Groups banking arrangements outlined below are considered to be adequate in terms of exibility and liquidity for its medium-term cash ow needs therefore mitigating the Groups liquidity risk.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk reects the Groups exposure to uctuations to interest rates in the market.
The risk arises because the Groups overdraft and oating rate bank loans bear interest based on LIBOR.
For the year ended 31 July 2013 it is estimated that an increase of 1% in interest rates applying for the full year would decrease the Groups profit before taxation by 0.649 million 2012 0.199 million.
Housing market risk The Group is affected by movements in UK house prices.
These in turn are affected by factors such as credit availability, employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and supply of land with planning.
Whilst it is not possible for the Group to fully mitigate housing market risk on a national macroeconomic basis the Group does continually monitor its geographical spread within the UK, seeking to balance investment in areas offering the best immediate returns with a long-term spread of its operations throughout the UK to minimise the effect of local microeconomic uctuations.
Land purchased on deferred terms The Group sometimes acquires land on deferred payment terms.
In accordance with IAS 39 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement' the deferred creditor is recorded at fair value being the price paid for the land discounted to present day.
The difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value is amortised over the deferred term to finance expenses, increasing the land creditor to its full cash settlement value on the payment date.
The maturity prole of the total contracted cash payments in respect of amounts due on land creditors at the balance sheet date is as follows: Balance at Total Within one 12 years 25 years More than 31 July contracted year or on 5 years cash payment demand 000 000 000 000 000 000 At 31 July 2013 146,019 150,551 108,403 18,064 21,442 2,642 At 31 July 2012 120,591 126,783 90,088 20,538 14,862 1,295 The maturity prole of the total contracted payments in respect of financial liabilities excluding amounts due on land creditors shown separately above is as follows: Balance at Total Within one 12 years 25 years More than 31 July contracted year or on 5 years cash payment demand 000 000 000 000 000 000 Bank loans oating rates 30,000 30,015 30,015 Preference shares 20,000 21,900 21,900 Trade and other payables 122,612 122,612 117,754 4,858 At 31 July 2013 172,612 174,527 169,669 4,858 Bank loans oating rates 62,000 62,230 62,230 Preference shares 20,000 23,800 1,900 21,900 Trade and other payables 108,126 108,126 102,804 5,322 At 31 July 2012 190,126 194,156 166,934 21,900 5,322 The interest rates on the preference shares apply to the whole term of the relevant instruments.
The imputed interest rate on land payables reects market interest rates available to the Group on oating rate bank loans at the time of acquiring the land.
At the year end, the Group had 270.0 million 2012 238.0 million of undrawn bank facilities available.
The Companys only financial liabilities are preference shares as disclosed in the maturity prole above.

Expected long-term rates of return The expected long-term return on cash is related to bank base rates at the balance sheet date.
The expected return on bonds is determined by reference to UK long dated gilt and bond yields at the balance sheet date.
The expected rate of return on equities has been determined by setting an appropriate risk premium above gilt bond yields having regard to market conditions at the balance sheet date.
The expected long-term rates of return are as follows: Period Period commencing commencing 1 August 2012 1 August 2011 % per annum % per annum Equities 5.40 5.40 Bonds 3.90 5.00 Cash 2.50 3.90 Overall for Scheme 4.65 5.26 Actual return on the Scheme assets The actual return on the Scheme assets over the year ended 31 July 2013 was 12.1% 31 July 2012 0.8%.

Awards under the LTIP and SMP have been made to executive directors and the Group Company Secretary, with awards under the annual bonus scheme also made to senior employees.
The awards take the form of ordinary shares in the Company.
Share options issued under the Bellway p. l. c. 1995 Employee Share Option Scheme '1995 ESOS' have been granted to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors.
The last tranche of shares was awarded to directors in October 2003.
No further options may be granted under this scheme.
Options issued under the Bellway p. l. c. 1996 Employee Share Option Scheme '1996 ESOS' have been granted to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors.
The last tranche of shares was awarded to employees in May 2006.
The Bellway p. l. c. 2005 Employee Share Option Scheme '2005 ESOS' replaces the 1995 ESOS.
Awards may be granted on a discretionary basis to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors and are subject to performance conditions.
The Bellway p. l. c. 2007 Employee Share Option Scheme '2007 ESOS' replaces the 1996 ESOS.
It is an unapproved discretionary scheme which provides for the grant of options over ordinary shares to employees and executive directors.
It is, however, the current intention that no executive directors of the Company should be granted options under these schemes.
Awards will be available to vest after three years, subject to objective performance targets.
Options issued under the SRSOS are offered to all employees including the executive directors.
An outline of the performance conditions in relation to the LTIP and the SMP is detailed under the long-term incentive scheme section on pages 47, 48 and 50 within the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration.
Various small share option awards were made for years 2003 through to 2007 to employees, mainly at divisional management level, under the term of the Deferred Bonus Plan DBP.
These shares are held in the Bellway Employee Share Trust 1992 normally for three years.
The shares can then be transferred into the employees name.
Share-based payments have been valued by an external third party using various models detailed overleaf, based on publicly available market data at the time of the grant, which the directors consider to be the most appropriate method of determining their fair value.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 1,155.6p 2012 775.3p.
Valuation methodology For the LTIP options granted prior to 24 October 2011, a Monte Carlo simulation method was used which allows the Groups performance, in terms of TSR, to be measured against its comparator companies.
Individual share price volatilities were calculated for each of the comparator companies.
A correlation assumption, appropriate to the building sector, was also used.
For LTIP and SMP options granted after 24 October 2011 half of the performance criteria is based on TSR against comparator companies with the other half based on TSR measured against the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts and financial service companies.
A simplied Monte Carlo simulation method has been used to determine the Groups TSR performance against the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts and financial service companies.
In the case of the DBP, a simplied Black Scholes method is applied with an exercise price and dividend yield of zero.
This is because no performance conditions attach to the award and no dividends are credited to the individual.
The result is that the fair value equates to the face value of the award.
The Black Scholes method is used for the SRSOS due to the relatively short exercise window of six months.
