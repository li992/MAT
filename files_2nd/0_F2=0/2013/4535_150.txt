The Group establishes provisions in connection with litigation where it has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and where it is more likely than not an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
In September 2013, Debenhams plc received a Statement of Objections from the Office of Fair Trading OFT addressing the possibility of anti-competitive behaviour with respect to retail selling prices for the Shock Absorber range of sports bra products in the UK during the years of 2009, 2010 and 2011.
Debenhams is reviewing the Statement of Objections, will be responding to the OFT in due course as required and continues to dispute the OFTs findings.
However, whilst the matter is still under review the possibility cannot be ruled out that the Groups performance, cash flows or financial condition could be affected by the outcome of this matter.
There are a number of contingent liabilities that arise in the normal course of business which if realised are not expected to result in a material liability to the Group.
