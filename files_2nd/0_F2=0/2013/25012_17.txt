ICAP plc 88 Annual Report 2013 Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Basis of preparation Preparation of financial statements The consolidated financial statements of the Group and the separate financial statements of ICAP plc have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as issued by the IASB and as endorsed by the EU.
IFRSs comprise accounting standards issued by the IASB and its predecessor body as well as interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRIC and its predecessor body.
In publishing the parent company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, ICAP plc has taken advantage of the exemption in section 408 3 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement, individual statement of comprehensive income and related notes that form a part of these financial statements.
The financial statements are prepared in pound sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and presented in millions.
ICAP plc is domiciled in the UK.
The significant accounting policies adopted by the Group and Company are included within the notes to which they relate and are shaded in blue.
The preparation of financial statements requires management to apply judgements and the use of estimates and assumptions about future conditions.
Management considers impairment of goodwill and other intangibles assets arising on consolidation note 6 and tax note 9 to be the areas where increased judgement is required.
Further information about key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty, are set out in the relevant notes on the financial statements.
Estimates and assumptions are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Due to the inherent uncertainty in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be based on amounts which differ from those estimates.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
Presentation of the income statement The Group maintains a columnar format for the presentation of its consolidated income statement.
The columnar format enables the Group to continue its practice of improving the understanding of its results by presenting profit for the year before acquisition and disposal costs and exceptional items.
This is the profit measure used to calculate adjusted EPS note 2 and is considered to be the most appropriate as it better reflects the Groups underlying earnings.
Profit before acquisition and disposal costs and exceptional items are reconciled to profit before tax on the face of the consolidated income statement.
The column acquisition and disposal costs includes: any gains, losses or other associated costs on the full or partial disposal of investments, associates, joint ventures or subsidiaries and costs associated with a combination that do not constitute fees relating to the arrangement of financing: amortisation or impairment of intangibles assets arising on consolidation: any re-measurement after initial recognition of deferred contingent consideration which has been classified as a liability: any gains or losses on the revaluation of previous interests.
The column may also include items such as gains or losses on the settlement of pre-existing relationships with acquired businesses and the re-measurement of liabilities that are above the value of indemnification.
Items which are of a non-recurring nature and material, when considering both size and nature, are disclosed separately to give a clearer presentation of the Groups results.
These are shown as exceptional items on the face of the consolidated income statement.
On the face of the consolidated income statement, basic and diluted EPS have also been disclosed.
Basis of consolidation The Groups consolidated financial statements include the results and net assets of the Company, its subsidiaries and the Groups share of joint ventures and associates.
An entity is regarded as a subsidiary if the Group has control over its strategic, operating and financial policies and intends to hold the investment on a long-term basis for the purpose of securing a contribution to the Groups activities.
The results of companies acquired during the year are included in the Groups results from the effective date of acquisition.
The results of companies disposed of during the year are included up to the effective date of disposal.
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group.
For purchases from noncontrolling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity.
Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.
On consolidation, the accounting policies of Group companies the Company and its subsidiaries are consistent with those applied by the Group.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated as part of the consolidation process.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
ICAP plc Annual Report 2013 89 Financial statements Basis of preparation continued Basis of consolidation continued A joint venture is an entity in which the Group has an interest and, in the opinion of the directors, exercises joint control over its operating and financial policies.
An interest exists where an investment is held on a long-term basis for the purpose of securing a contribution to the Groups activities.
Joint ventures are proportionately consolidated, whereby the Groups consolidated income statement and balance sheet include the Groups share of the income and assets on a line-by-line basis.
The Group classifies investments in entities over which it has significant influence, but not control, and that are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures, as associates.
Investments in associates are recognised using the equity method.
Under this method, such investments are initially stated at cost, including attributable goodwill, and are adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in the Groups share of net assets.
Foreign currencies In individual entities, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the prior month closing exchange rate between the functional currency and the foreign currency.
At each end of the reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period.
Exchange differences are recognised in the consolidated income statement, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where these form part of the net investment of an overseas business or are designated as hedges of a net investment or cash flow and, therefore, the changes in value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
On consolidation, the results of businesses with non-pound sterling functional currencies are translated into the presentational currency of the Group at the average exchange rates for the period where these approximate to the rate at the date of the transactions.
Assets and liabilities of overseas businesses are translated into the presentational currency of the Group at the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period.
Exchange differences arising are recognised within other comprehensive income.
Cumulative translation differences arising after the transition to IFRS are taken to the consolidated income statement on disposal of the net investment.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a non-pound sterling entity are treated as assets and liabilities of that entity and translated into the presentational currency of the Group at the period closing rate.
Where applicable, the Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising before the date of transition to IFRS as denominated in the presentational currency of the Group.
In the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash flows denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the presentational currency of the Group at the average exchange rate for the year or at the rate prevailing at the time of the transaction where more appropriate.
Future accounting developments At 31 March 2013, a number of standards and amendments to standards had been issued by the IASB which are not effective for these consolidated financial statements.
In addition to the standards and amendments to standards described below, IASB is also continuing to work on projects on insurance, revenue recognition and lease accounting, which together with the following could represent significant changes to accounting requirements in the future.
IFRS10 Consolidated financial statements requires a parent to present consolidated financial statements as those of a single economic entity, replacing the requirements previously contained in IAS27 Consolidated and separate financial statements and SIC-12 Consolidation special purpose entities.
The standard has been endorsed by the EU for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
IFRS11 Joint arrangements replaces IAS31 Interests in joint ventures and requires a party to a joint arrangement to determine the type of joint arrangement in which it is involved by assessing its rights and obligations and then account for those rights and obligations in accordance with that type of joint arrangement.
IFRS12 Disclosure of interests in other entities requires the extensive disclosure of information that enables users of financial statements to evaluate the nature of, and risks associated with, interests in other entities and the effects of those interests on its financial position, financial performance and cash flows.
IFRS13 Fair value measurement replaces the guidance on fair value measurement in existing IFRS accounting literature with a single standard.
The standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
In June 2011, the IASB issued amendments to IAS19 Employee Benefits IAS19 revised.
The revised standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 with early adoption permitted.
IAS19 revised is required to be applied retrospectively.
ICAP plc 90 Annual Report 2013 Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Future accounting developments continued In December 2011, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS7 Disclosures Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities which requires the disclosures about the effect or potential effects of offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities and related arrangements on an entitys financial position.
The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods.
The amendments are required to be applied retrospectively.
In December 2011, the IASB issued amendments to IAS32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities which clarify the requirements for offsetting financial instruments and address inconsistencies in current practice when applying the offsetting criteria in IAS32 Financial Instruments: Presentation.
The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 and are required to be applied retrospectively.
IAS27 2011 Separate financial statements carries forward the existing accounting and disclosure requirements of IAS27 2008 for separate financial statements, with some minor clarifications.
The requirements of IAS28 2008 and IAS31 for separate financial statements have been incorporated into IAS27 2011.
The revised standard has been endorsed by the EU for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
IAS28 2011 Associates and Joint Ventures includes the requirements for joint ventures and associates, to be equity accounted following the issue of IFRS11Joint arrangements.
The impact on the Group financial statements of adopting IFRS10, IFRS11, IFRS13, IAS19R, IAS32, IAS27 2011 and IAS28 2011 is currently under review.
However, the adoption of these standards is not expected to have a material impact.
In November 2009, the IASB issued IFRS9 Financial Instruments which introduced new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets.
The IASB is in the process of amending the requirements for classification and measurement to address practice and other issues.
IFRS9 is required to be applied retrospectively but prior periods need not be restated.
The final IFRS9 requirements for classification and measurement and impairment remain uncertain and so ICAP remains unable to provide a date by which it will apply IFRS9 as a whole and it remains impracticable to quantify the effect of IFRS9 as at the date of the publication of these financial statements.
Financial risk management The Group operates internationally and is exposed to a variety of financial risks including currency, interest rate, market price, liquidity and credit.
The Groups overall financial risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance by using derivative instruments to lower funding costs, alter interest rate exposures arising as a result of mismatches between assets and liabilities or to achieve greater certainty of future costs.
The use of derivatives forms part of the Groups overall risk management framework as determined by the board through the GRACC.
The Groups funding and exposure to interest rate and FX rate risk are managed by the Groups treasury function in accordance with a policy framework approved by the GRACC.
The framework lays out the Groups appetite for risk and the steps to be taken to manage these risks.
The GRACC receives bi-monthly reports on the activities of the treasury function and is also responsible for approving significant transactions such as new financing arrangements or changes to the Groups hedging strategy.
The GRACC sets and monitors treasurys counterparty limits in conjunction with the risk team.
The Groups exposure to market price risk arises mainly through counterparties to matched principal and exchange traded transactions failing to fulfil their obligations or through trade mismatches and other errors.
In matched principal transactions, the Group acts as an intermediary by serving as counterparty for identified buyers and sellers in matching, in whole or in part, reciprocal back-to-back trades.
In order to facilitate customer transactions and provide liquidity, the Group may participate in certain marketplaces by posting quotations.
On occasion, the act of posting quotations in pursuit of customer orders can result in the Group becoming principal to unmatched trades.
In exchange traded transactions, the Group executes the trade as principal and then novates the contract to its client.
A failure by the client to accept the trade would result in the Group becoming exposed to market price risk.
The market price risk the Group faces in these situations is restricted to short-term price movements in the underlying instrument temporarily held by the Group and movements in FX rates.
Any such market price risk arising is identified, monitored and reported to senior management on a daily basis and to the GRACC.
Policies and procedures are in place to reduce the likelihood of such trade mismatches and, in the event that they arise, the Groups policy is to liquidate or hedge and liquidate these principal positions as soon as reasonably practicable.
The Company is not exposed to market price risk as it holds no listed investments, and has no trading activity.
Details of the exposure and ways in which the Group and Company manages currency and interest rate risk are disclosed in note 11, liquidity risk in note 7 and credit risk in note 16.
