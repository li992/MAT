Pension arrangements Restatements IAS 19 revised 2011 and the related consequential amendments have impacted the accounting for the Groups defined benefit schemes, by replacing the combined interest cost on liabilities and expected return on plan assets with a net interest charge on the net defined benefit liability.
Prior year comparatives have been restated as set out in note 5e.
Following recent guidance from the FRRP regarding the treatment of a schedule of contributions in relation to a minimum funding requirement under IFRIC 14, the Group has reconsidered the appropriate accounting treatment for its pension funding obligations.
The Group is party to deficit repair schedules in respect of both the Travis Perkins Pension and Dependants Benefit Scheme the TP scheme and the BSS Pension Benefit Scheme BSS scheme.
Under the terms of the agreement with the Trustees of the TP scheme dated 16 June 2010 and amended in December 2012 and August 2013, the Group is committed to a series of annual payments to make good a historic shortfall as assessed on an actuarial basis.
The restated Group balance sheets at 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2012 reflect the present value of payments due under the schedule as at those dates.
The agreement provides for the suspension of the payment in the event that the scheme is 100% funded on an actuarial basis, and the funding position is monitored on a quarterly basis.
At 31 December 2012 the scheme was 91% funded on an actuarial basis but had reached 99% funded at 31 December 2013.
