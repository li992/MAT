Pensions The primary pension arrangement in the UK is a funded final salary pension plan under which retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity.
The UK plan is closed to new joiners but remains open to ongoing accrual for current members.
New joiners in the UK are eligible for membership of a defined contribution plan.
The obligation and cost of providing the pension benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method.
The date of the most recent actuarial review was 31 December 2013.
The principal plans are subject to a formal actuarial valuation every three years in the UK.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the main UK pension plan was as at 31 December 2011.
The material financial assumptions used for estimating the benefit obligations of the plans are set out below.
The assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year, and are used to evaluate accrued pension and other post-retirement benefits at 31 December and pension expense for the following year.
Financial assumptions used to determine benefit obligation % 2013 2012 2011 Expected long-term rate of return 6.9 6.9 7.0 Discount rate for pension plan liabilities 4.6 4.4 4.8 Rate of increase in salaries 5.1 4.9 5.1 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.3 3.1 3.2 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.3 3.1 3.2 Inflation for pension plan liabilities 3.3 3.1 3.2 Financial assumptions used to determine benefit expense % 2013 2012 2011 Discount rate for pension plan service costs 4.4 4.8 5.5 Discount rate for pension plan other finance expense 4.4 4.8 5.5 Inflation for pension plan service costs 3.1 3.2 3.5 Our discount rate assumption is based on third-party AA corporate bond indices and we use yields that reflect the maturity profile of the expected benefit payments.
The inflation rate assumption is based on the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds.
The inflation assumptions are used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions.
Our assumption for the rate of increase in salaries is based on our inflation assumption plus an allowance for expected long-term real salary growth.
This includes allowance for promotion-related salary growth of 0.7%.
In addition to the financial assumptions, we regularly review the demographic and mortality assumptions.
The mortality assumptions reflect best practice in the UK, and have been chosen with regard to the latest available published tables adjusted where appropriate to reflect the experience of the group and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future.
Mortality assumptions 2013 2012 2011 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 60 27.8 27.7 27.6 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 40 30.7 30.6 30.5 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 60 29.5 29.4 29.3 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 40 32.2 32.1 32.0 The fair values of the various categories of asset held by the pension plan at 31 December are set out below.
