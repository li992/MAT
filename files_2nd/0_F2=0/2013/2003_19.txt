HIGHLIGHTS BUILDING HOMES FOR EVERYONE RUNNING A SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS TRADING & FINANCIAL REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES General Information The Berkeley Group Holdings plc the Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The address of its registered ofce is Berkeley House, 19 Portsmouth Road, Cobham, Surrey, KT11 1JG.
The Company and its subsidiaries together the Group are engaged in residential-led, mixed-use property development.
Further information about the nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Directors Report on page 58.
Basis of preparation These Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with European Union endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, IFRS-IC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and on the going concern basis.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are disclosed on page 93.
There were no new standards, amendments or interpretations that were adopted by the Group and effective for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 May 2012 that were material to the Group.
Furthermore, there are no standards, amendments or interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
Basis of consolidation a Subsidiaries The Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the financial statements of the Parent Company and all its subsidiary undertakings.
The accounting date for subsidiary undertakings is 30 April.
Subsidiary undertakings are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group.
Control exists where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain the benets from its activities.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are fide-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest.
The excess of cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of identiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
b Non-controlling interests Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identied separately from the Groups equity therein.
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and those interests share of changes in the equity since the date of the combination.
c Joint ventures Entities which are jointly controlled with another party or parties joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
The results attributable to the Groups holding in joint ventures are shown separately in the consolidated income statement.
The amount included in the consolidated statement of financial position is the Groups share of the net assets of the joint ventures plus net loans receivable.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of joint ventures is accounted for in accordance with the policy set out above.
The carrying value of goodwill is included in the carrying value of the investment in joint ventures.
On transfer of land and or work in progress to joint ventures, the Group recognises only its share of any profits or losses, namely that proportion sold outside the Group.
Segmental reporting Operating segments are identied in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
The Group determines its reportable segments having regard to permitted aggregation criteria with the principal condition being that the operating segments should have similar economic characteristics.
The Group is predominantly engaged in residential-led, mixed-use property development, comprising residential revenue, revenue from land sales and commercial revenue.
For the purposes of determining its operating segments, the chief operating decision-maker has been identied as the Executive Committee of the Board.
This committee approves investment decisions, allocates the Groups resources and reviews the internal reporting in order to assess performance.
The Group has determined that its operating segments are the management teams that report into the Executive Committee of the Board.
These management teams are all engaged in residential-led, mixed-use development in the United Kingdom and, having regard to the aggregation criteria in IFRS 8, the Group has one reportable operating segment.
In addition to its development activities, the Group holds certain residential properties for investment purposes.
These investment activities represent a separate segment which is included within Other activities, as it does not meet the size thresholds to be disclosed as a separate reportable segment.
Revenue Revenue represents the amounts receivable from the sale of properties during the year and other income directly associated with property development.
Properties are treated as sold and profits are recognised when contracts are exchanged and the building work is physically complete.
Rental income is recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Any lease incentives are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income.
BERKELEY ANNUAL REPORT 2013 91 5 P10 BERK AR13 91-109. indd 91 22 07 2013 17:12 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Expenditure Expenditure recorded in inventory is expensed through cost of sales at the time of the related property sale.
Net operating expenditure is recognised in respect of goods and services received when supplied in accordance with contractual terms.
Provision is made when an obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
Taxation The taxation expense represents the sum of the current tax payable and deferred tax.
Current tax, including UK corporation tax, is provided at the amounts expected to be paid or received using the tax rules and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the reporting date.
Deferred taxation is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised on all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill, or from the initial recognition except in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit, or from differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred taxation is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which taxable temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred taxation is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to reserves, in which case the deferred taxation is also dealt with in reserves.
Deferred taxation assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred taxation assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Intangible assets Where the cost of acquiring new and additional interests in subsidiaries, joint ventures and businesses exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, the resulting premium on acquisition goodwill is capitalised and its subsequent measurement is based on annual impairment reviews and impairment reviews performed where an impairment indicator exists, with any impairment losses recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at historic purchase cost less accumulated depreciation.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of the assets on a straight line basis to their residual value over their estimated useful lives at the following annual rates: Freehold buildings 2% Fixtures and ttings 15% 20% Motor vehicles 25% Computer equipment 33 1 3 % Freehold property disclosed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements consists of both freehold land and freehold buildings.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Computer equipment is included within xtures and ttings.
The assets residual values, carrying values and useful lives are reviewed on an annual basis and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Where an impairment is identied, the recoverable amount of the asset is identied and an impairment loss, where appropriate, is recognised in the income statement.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benets associated with the item will ow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within net operating expenses in the income statement.
Investment properties Investment properties, which are properties held to earn rental income, are recognised using the cost model and are carried in the statement of financial position at historic cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided to write off the element of the cost of the assets that relates to buildings at 2% per annum on a straight line basis.
No depreciation is charged on the element of the cost of the assets that relates to land.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets are classied as held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable.
They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Inventories Property in the course of development and completed units are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Direct cost comprises the cost of land, raw materials and development costs but excludes indirect overheads.
Provision is made, where appropriate, to reduce the value of inventories and work in progress to their net realisable value.
Land purchased for development, including land in the course of development, is initially recorded at fair value.
Where such land is purchased on deferred settlement terms, and the fair value differs from the amount that will subsequently be paid in settling the liability, this difference is charged as a finance cost in the income statement over the period to settlement.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within net operating expenses.
When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against net operating expense in the income statement.

Share capital Ordinary shares and redeemable preference shares are classied as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled, sold or reissued.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value which is considered to be their fair value.
Trade payables on extended terms are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate.
The discount to nominal value is amortised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, and it is probable that an outow of resources will be required to settle that obligation, and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Deposits New property deposits and on account contract receipts are held within current trade and other payables.
Employee benets a Pensions The Group accounts for pensions under IAS 19 Employee benets.
The Group has both dened benefit and dened contribution plans.
The dened benefit plan was closed to future accrual with effect from 1 April 2007.
For the dened benefit scheme, the obligations are measured using the projected unit method.
The calculation of the net obligation is performed by a qualied actuary.
The operating and nancing costs of these plans are recognised separately in the income statement: service costs are set annually on the basis of actuarial valuations of the scheme and nancing costs are recognised in the period in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
In accordance with IAS 19 the Group does not recognise on the statement of financial position any surplus in the scheme.
Pension contributions under dened contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
b Share-based payments Where the Company operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
Leasing agreements Payments and receipts under operating lease agreements are charged or credited against profit on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Accounting estimates and judgements Management applies the Groups accounting policies as described above when making critical accounting judgements, of which no individual judgement is deemed to have a significant impact upon the financial statements, apart from those involving estimations, which are detailed below.
a Carrying value of land and work in progress and estimation of costs to complete The Group holds inventories stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Such inventories include land, work in progress and completed units.
As residential development is largely speculative by nature, not all inventories are covered by forward sales contracts.
Furthermore due to the nature of the Groups activity and, in particular the scale of its developments and the length of the development cycle, the Group has to allocate site-wide development costs between units being built and or completed in the current year and those for future years.
It also has to forecast the costs to complete on such developments.
In making such assessments and allocations, there is a degree of inherent estimation uncertainty.
The Group has established internal controls designed to effectively assess and centrally review inventory carrying values and ensure the appropriateness of the estimates made.
b Deferred tax Assumptions are made as to the recoverability of deferred tax assets, especially as to whether there will be sufficient future profits to fully utilise these in future years.
c Share-based payments Assumptions are made in determining the fair value of employee services received in exchange for the grant of options under share-based payment awards at the date of grant.

Remuneration paid to the auditors in respect of audit related assurance services relates to the interim review.
Remuneration paid to the auditors in respect of taxation advisory services was incurred primarily in connection with corporate activity in the year.
All other non-audit services include remuneration advisory services.
In 2011 12 0.6m of these costs were one-off in nature, comprising taxation and remuneration services towards the implementation of the Groups strategy to return 13 per share to shareholders over the next 10 years and the associated 2011 LTIP.
In addition to the above services, the Groups auditor acted as auditor to The Berkeley Final Salary Plan.
The appointment of auditors to the Groups pension scheme and the fees paid in respect of the audit are agreed by the trustees of the scheme, who act independently of the management of the Group.

Details of Directors emoluments are set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 61 to 77.
Share-based payments The Group operates three equity-settled share based payments schemes.
The charge to the income statement in respect of share-based payments in the year relating to grants of share options awarded under the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan and deferred shares or notional shares under the Bonus Plan, was 11.8m 2012: 8.2m.
The charge to the income statement attributable to key management is 10.9m 2012: 7.1m.
2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan Part A On 29 June 2009 the balance of the shares originally awarded under the 2004 b Long-Term Incentive Plan, totalling 5,330,340 shares, were replaced by options under Part A of the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Scheme, with an exercise price of 2.85 per share, in accordance with the shareholder approval obtained at the Extraordinary General Meeting on 15 April 2009.
These will become exercisable by the relevant Executive Directors on 31 January 2014, subject to continued employment at that date.
During the year, no options lapsed 2012: 880,390, on the departure of a Director, leaving 4,441,950 outstanding.
Part B Part B of the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan covers 6,830,000 share options with an exercise price of 8.25.
Vesting of the options is in two tranches: 50% on 15 April 2015 and 50% on 15 April 2016.
The options are conditional on continued employment at the relevant vesting date and the satisfaction of the underpin condition that Net Assets per Share are at least 5.94 at 15 April 2015.
During the year, 180,000 options lapsed on the departure of employees 2012: 530,000 leaving 6,120,000 options outstanding.
Bonus Plan Under the terms of the Bonus Plan set out in the Remuneration Report participants to the plan are entitled to 50% of the balance of their plan account at the end of each financial year.
The remaining balance is deferred in shares or notional shares.
BERKELEY ANNUAL REPORT 2013 95 5 P10 BERK AR13 91-109. indd 95 22 07 2013 17:12 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5 DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES CONTINUED 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan The Company announced in June 2011 as part of a strategic review of the business a long term plan to return approximately 1.7 billion to shareholders over the next 10 years.
The rules were subsequently amended and approved at the 2012 Annual General Meeting to allow the returns to be made through a combination of dividends 13 per share and share buy backs distributions.
The cumulative distributions required by the plan on or before the relative milestone dates are set out below: Cumulative distributions 30 September 2015 568.7m 30 September 2018 1,136.1m 30 September 2021 1,703.6m A new long term remuneration plan was proposed to support this strategy, the 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan 2011 LTIP, which was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 5 September 2011 and the amendment at the Annual General Meeting on 5 September 2012.
The key features of the 2011 LTIP are: if the Company returns 1.7 billion to shareholders over a ten year period via a series of dividend payments 13 per share and share buy backs by the milestone dates referred to above, participants will be entitled to exercise options and receive a number of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company at the end of the ten year period.
the maximum number of shares capable of being earned by all participants are 19,616,503 shares, being 13% of the fully diluted share capital of the Company at the date of approval of the plan.
the exercise price of options granted under the 2011 LTIP will be 13 per share less an amount equal to the value of all dividends paid between the date of approval of the 2011 LTIP and 30 September 2021, provided the exercise price cannot be less than zero.
The fair value of the options granted during that year, determined using the current market pricing model, was 3.17 for options which vest on 30 September 2021.
The inputs into the current market option pricing model were: Inputs Grant date 5 September 2011 Vesting date 30 September 2021 Share price at grant date p 1,236 Exercise price p nil Discount rate 6.3% The discount rate was determined by calculating the Groups expected cost of capital over the vesting period at the grant date.
Pensions During the year, two principal pension schemes were in place for employees.
The Berkeley Group plc Group Personal Pension Plan and the St George PLC Group Personal Pension Plan are dened contribution schemes.
The assets of these schemes were held in separate trustee administered funds.
The Berkeley Final Salary Plan is a dened benefit scheme which was closed to future accrual with effect from 1 April 2007.
Dened contribution plan Contributions amounting to 2.7m 2012: 2.4m were paid into the dened contribution schemes during the year.
Dened benefit plan The Berkeley Final Salary Plan is subject to an independent actuarial valuation at least every three years.
The most recently nalised valuation was carried out as at 30 April 2013.
The method adopted in the 2013 valuation was the projected unit method, which assumed a return on investment both prior to and after retirement of 5.70% per annum and pension increases of 3.25% per annum.
The market value of the Berkeley Final Salary Plan assets at 30 April 2013 was 16.0m and was sufficient to cover 100% of the schemes liabilities.
Following the nalisation of the 2007 valuation, with effect from 1 July 2008, employers required regular contributions were reduced to zero.
Following the nalisation of the 2010 valuation this position remained unchanged.
Notwithstanding this the Group made additional voluntary contributions of 0.6m during the year 2012: 0.6m.
The major assumptions used by the actuary for the 30 April 2013 valuation were: 30 April 30 April Valuation at: 2013 2012 Rate of increase in salaries Discount rate 4.30% 4.80% Ination assumption RPI 3.25% 3.25% Ination assumption CPI 2.50% 2.50% Rate of increase in pensions in payment post-97 Pre-97 receive 3% p. a. increases 3.25% 3.25% The mortality assumptions are the standard S1PA CMI 2009 X [1.0%] 2012: S1PA CMI 2009 X [1.0%] base table for males and females, both adjusted for each individuals year of birth to allow for future improvements in mortality rates.
The life expectancy of male and female pensioners now aged 65 retiring at age 65 on the balance sheet date is 22.0 years and 24.0 years respectively 2012: 22.1 and 24.1.

7 EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE Basic earnings per ordinary share is calculated as profit for the financial year attributable to shareholders of the Group divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.

At 30 April 2013, the Group had four categories of potentially dilutive ordinary shares: 4.4 million 2.85 share options under the 2009 LTIP Part A, 6.1 million 8.25 share options under the 2009 LTIP Part B: 19.6 million nil share options under the 2011 LTIP: and 0.5 million shares under the Bonus Plan.
A calculation is done to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value based on the aggregate of the exercise price of each share option and the fair value of future services to be supplied to the Group which is the unamortised share-based payments charge.
The difference between the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value and the total number of options is used in the diluted earnings per share calculation.

The goodwill balance is tested annually for impairment.
The recoverable amount has been determined on the basis of the value in use of the business using the current five year pre-tax forecasts.
Key assumptions are as follows: i Cash ows beyond a five year period are not extrapolated: ii A pre-tax discount rate of 11.62% 2012: 11.19% based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
The Directors have identied no reasonably possible change in a key assumption which would give rise to an impairment charge.
The market value of the properties held at 30 April 2013 is 43.9m 30 April 2012: 114.5m as determined by the Directors taking into account all relevant factors including their nature and location.
No independent valuation was undertaken.

The Groups objective when managing capital is to maintain an appropriate capital structure in the business to allow management to focus on creating sustainable long-term value for its shareholders, with exibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise in the short and medium term.
This allows the Group to take advantage of prevailing market conditions by investing in land and work in progress at the right point in the cycle or delivering returns to shareholders through dividends or share buy backs.
Last year the Group put in place a long-term strategic plan to see 13 per share returned to shareholders over the next 10 years.
This plan, reported in more detail in the Trading and Financial Reviews on pages 41 to 51, ensures there is sufficient working capital retained in the business to continue investing selectively in new land opportunities as they arise.
The Group monitors capital levels principally by monitoring net cash debt levels, cash ow forecasts and return on average capital employed.
The Group considers capital employed to be net assets adjusted for net cash debt.
The increase in capital employed in the year of 120.0m reects further investment in land and work in progress during the year.
The Groups financial instruments comprise financial assets being: trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents and financial liabilities being: bank loans, trade payables, deposits and on account receipts, loans from joint ventures and accruals.
Cash and cash equivalents and borrowings are the principal financial instruments used to finance the business.
The other financial instruments highlighted arise in the ordinary course of business.
As all of the operations carried out by the Group are in sterling there is no direct currency risk, and therefore the Groups main financial risks are primarily: liquidity risk the risk that suitable funding for the Groups activities may not be available: market interest rate risk the risk that Group nancing activities are adversely affected by uctuation in market interest rates: and credit risk the risk that a counterparty will default on their contractual obligations resulting in a loss to the Group.
Financial instruments: Financial assets The Groups financial assets can be summarised as follows: 2013 2012 m m Current Trade receivables 105.9 105.3 Cash and cash equivalents 66.8 2.7 172.7 108.0 Trade receivables are non-interest bearing.
Cash and cash equivalents are short-term deposits held at either oating rates linked to LIBOR or xed rates.
Financial instruments: Financial liabilities The Groups financial liabilities can be summarised as follows: 2013 2012 m m Current Bank loans 4.7 48.1 Trade payables 381.1 369.7 Deposits and on account contract receipts 426.1 422.9 Loans from joint ventures 0.1 0.1 Accruals 72.0 56.7 Other loans 17.4 901.4 897.5 Non-current Trade payables 115.5 30.4 Other loans 12.5 115.5 42.9 Total financial liabilities 1,016.9 940.4 All amounts included above are unsecured.
Current bank loans have term expiry dates within twelve months of the balance sheet date and are held at oating interest rates linked to LIBOR.
Trade payables and other current liabilities are non-interest bearing.
Other loans represent a loan from the Homes and Communities Agency on which interest is payable based on a proportionate share of the net rental income arising from the properties to which the loan relates.
This loan was repaid following completion of the sale of 534 HCA funded residential properties on 5 June 2013 see note 15.
The maturity prole of the Groups non-current financial liabilities, all of which are held at amortised cost, is as follows: 2013 2012 m m In more than one year but not more than two years 27.7 20.7 In more than two years but not more than five years 87.8 22.2 In more than five years 115.5 42.9 106 BERKELEY ANNUAL REPORT 2013 5 P10 BERK AR13 91-109. indd 106 22 07 2013 17:12 HIGHLIGHTS BUILDING HOMES FOR EVERYONE RUNNING A SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS TRADING & FINANCIAL REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The carrying amounts of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities approximate to fair value.
Current trade receivables and current trade and other payables approximate to their fair value as the transactions which give rise to these balances arise in the normal course of trade and, where relevant, with industry standard payment terms and have a short period to maturity less than one year.
Non-current trade payables comprise long-term land payables, which are held at their discounted present value calculated by discounting expected future cash ows at prevailing interest rates and yields as appropriate.
The discount rate applied reects the nominal, risk-free pre-tax rate at the balance sheet date, applied to the maturity prole of the individual land creditors within the total.
Non-current loans approximate to fair value as they are held at variable market interest rates linked to LIBOR.
Liquidity risk This is the risk that suitable funding for the Groups activities may not be available.
Group management addresses this risk through review of rolling cash ow forecasts throughout the year to assess and monitor the current and forecast availability of funding, and to ensure sufficient headroom against facility limits and compliance with banking covenants.
The committed borrowing facilities are set out below.
The contractual undiscounted maturity prole of the Groups financial liabilities, included at their carrying value in the preceding tables, is as follows: 2013 2012 m m In less than one year 901.4 897.5 In more than one year but not more than two years 27.9 21.0 In more than two years but not more than five years 89.0 22.5 In more than five years 1,018.3 941.0 Market interest rate risk The Groups cash and cash equivalents and bank loans expose the Group to cash ow interest rate risk.
The Groups rolling cash ow forecasts incorporate appropriate interest assumptions, and management carefully assesses expected activity levels and associated funding requirements in the prevailing and forecast interest rate environment to ensure that this risk is managed.
If interest rates on the Groups cash debt balances had been 50 basis points higher throughout the year ended 30 April 2013, profit after tax for the year would have been 26,000 higher 2012: 14,000 lower.
This calculation is based on the monthly closing net cash debt balance throughout the year.
A 50 basis point increase in interest rate represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change for the year ended 30 April 2013.
The Groups loan stock amounts to nil 2012: 9,000 and so no sensitivity analysis has been prepared against this interest bearing financial liability as any impact would not be material.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk encompasses the financial assets being: trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Trade receivables are spread across a wide number of customers, with no significant concentration of credit risk in one area.
There has been no impairment of trade receivables during the year 2012: nil, nor are there any provisions held against trade receivables 2012: nil, and no trade receivables are past their due date 2012: nil.
The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited because counterparties are leading international banks with long-term A credit-ratings assigned by international credit agencies.
Committed borrowing facilities The Group has committed borrowing facilities as follows: 2013 2012 Available Drawn Undrawn Termination Available Drawn Undrawn Termination m m m date m m m date Revolving credit facility one 275 275 May-17 200 10 190 Nov-13 Revolving credit facility two 250 250 Apr-18 250 25 225 Apr-16 525 525 450 35 415 At 30 April 2013 the total drawn down balance across both facilities was nil.
In addition, at 30 April 2013 there were bank bonds in issue of 0.2m 2012: 4.7m.
The Group completed the renancing of its main banking facilities on 24 May 2012, increasing available facilities from 450 million to 525 million, with maturity dates extended to May 2017 in the case of revolving credit facility one and April 2017 in the case of revolving credit facility two, a level that is commensurate with the capital structure and requirements of the Group.
The revolving credit facilities are secured by debentures provided by certain Group holding companies over their assets.
The facility agreement contains financial covenants, which is normal for such agreements, all of which the Group is in compliance with.
A one year extension was granted on 8 April 2013 for revolving credit facility two which extended the maturity date on this facility until April 2018, and on 24 May 2013 for revolving credit facility one, which extended the maturity date on this facility until May 2018.

This is a scheme whereby eligible employees may enter into an arrangement, at commercial rates, with the Group for the construction or renovation of their own home.
There were no balances outstanding at the year end.
ii Mr A W Pidgley, a Director of the Company, contracted to purchase an apartment at Ebury Square, London SW1 on 20 March 2012 from Berkeley Homes PCL Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, for 6,050,000, Apartment 1.
Mr Pidgley is also a Director of Berkeley Homes PCL Limited.
Approval for this purchase was received from shareholders at the 2012 Annual General Meeting and the purchase then became unconditional.
Approval is now being sought at this Annual General Meeting for Mr Pidgley to a be released from his contract to purchase the property Apartment 1 and simultaneously b purchase a different property at Ebury Square from Berkeley Homes PCL Limited in lieu of the above property for 10,500,000 Apartment 2.
Mr R C Perrins, a Director of the Company, contracted to purchase an apartment at 190 Strand, London WC1 for 2,100,000 on 31 May 2013 from SES Manager Limited and SES Nominee Limited, subsidiaries of St Edward Homes Limited, a joint venture vehicle, owned by The Prudential Assurance Company Limited, part of the Prudential Group, and The Berkeley Group plc, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
Mr Perrins is also a Director of St Edward Homes Limited.
Both the agreement between Berkeley Homes PCL Limited and Mr Pidgley for Apartment 2 and the agreement between SES Manager Limited and SES Nominee Limited and Mr Perrins are a standard form sale and purchase agreement used by the respective companies on the respective developments, save that they are conditional upon the agreement of shareholders.
In respect of Mr Pidgley, the agreement in respect of Apartment 2 is conditional on both the release of Mr Pidgley from the agreement for the sale and purchase of Apartment 1 and to the sale of Apartment 2 to Mr Pidgley.
Under the contractual arrangements it is not possible for Mr Pidgley to acquire both Apartment 1 and Apartment 2 nor for him to be released from the agreement for Apartment 1 unless the agreement to acquire apartment 2 simultaneously becomes unconditional.
As these transactions are in excess of 100,000, they each constitute a substantial property transaction with a Director of the Company under sections 190 and 191 of the Companies Act 2006 and are therefore conditional on the approval of shareholders, which will be sought at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting on 2 September 2013.
Transactions with Joint Ventures During the financial year there were no transactions with joint ventures other than movements in loans.
In 2009 inventory was sold to St Edward Homes Limited for 17,411,000 being the share of the transaction attributable to the other venturer in the joint venture.
