NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED PRIOR YEAR ADJUSTMENT The Company has restated its calculation of effective yield on its index-linked bonds in the year ended 30 April 2012 as it had not applied the correct rate of inflation during that period as well as in the years ended 30 April 2009, 2010 and 2011.
There is no impact on the current years numbers or the restated net asset value of the Company for any of the prior periods: the effect is simply a transfer to capital and revenue reserves.
