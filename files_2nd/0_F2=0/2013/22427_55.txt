In pursuing its investment objective and policy, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for distribution by way of dividends.
These risks market risk comprising market price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit and counterparty risk and the directors approach to the management of them, are set out below.

The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks are set out below and have not changed from the previous accounting period.
16.1 Market risk The fair value of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises market price risk see note 16.1.
2 and interest rate risk see note 16.1.
The Portfolio Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision, and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
1 Market price risk Market price risk changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of investments.
The Companys investments are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about the future prices of the investments.

The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance.
The Board monitors the Managers compliance with the Companys objectives, including investment strategy and asset allocation.
When appropriate, the Company may buy sell put or call options or futures on indices and on equity investments in its portfolio to manage its exposure to price risk or to generate income.

Concentration of exposure to market price risk An analysis of the Companys investment portfolio is shown on pages 10 and 11.
This shows that the majority of the Companys investments are in UK listed companies.
Accordingly, there is a concentration of exposure to the UK, though it is recognised that an investments country of domicile or of listing does not necessarily equate to its exposure to the economic conditions in that country.
Market price risk sensitivity The sensitivity of a the return after taxation for the year and b the Companys net assets to an increase or decrease of 10% in the fair values of the Companys investments at each balance sheet date is shown on the next page.

2 Currency risk The Company is not itself materially exposed to currency risk, although some of the investments will be in companies that have operations that involve currency risk and pay dividends in foreign currencies.
Management of the risk Investment income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
However, the Company does sometimes hedge foreign currency exposure ahead of the declaration of dividends from companies in which it invests.

3 Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect: the level of income receivable from cash at bank and on deposit the interest payable on the Companys variable rate bank borrowings.
Management of the risk The Company, generally, does not hold significant cash balances.

The figures in the more than 5 years columns do not include the ongoing annual finance cost of 157,000.
Interest rate risk sensitivity The Company is not materially exposed to changes in interest rates.
16.2 Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Companys assets is in investments in quoted equities that are readily realisable.
For details of the Companys bank borrowing facility, see note 14.
The Board gives guidance to the Manager as to the maximum amount of the Companys resources that should be invested in any one company.
The policy is that the Company should remain fully invested in normal market conditions and that short term borrowings should be used to fund short term cash requirements.
Liquidity risk exposure The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at 30 June 2013, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, is given in the table above.
16.3 Credit and counterparty risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
Management of the risk The risk is not significant and is managed as follows: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, whose credit standard is reviewed periodically by the Portfolio Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker cash at bank is held only with reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings.
44 The City of London Investment Trust plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 16 Risk management policies and procedures continued Stock lending transactions are carried out with a number of approved counterparties, whose credit rating is reviewed regularly by the Manager and limits are set on the amount that may be lent to any one counterparty.
Stock lending is the temporary transfer of securities by a lender to a borrower, with an agreement by the borrower to return equivalent securities to the lender at an agreed future date.
Stock lending revenue is received for making the investments available to the borrower, which increases the returns on the portfolio.
In all cases securities lent continue to be recognised on the balance sheet.
Details of the value of securities on loan at the year end, and the collateral held, can be found in note 4.
In summary, the exposure to credit and counterparty risk at 30 June 2013 was to cash at bank of 179,000 2012: nil and to other debtors of 8,236,000 2012: 6,238,000.
16.4 Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The financial assets and financial liabilities are either carried in the balance sheet at their fair value or the balance sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value due from brokers, dividends and interest receivable, due to brokers, accruals, cash at bank and bank overdrafts.
At 30 June 2013 the aggregate fair value of the debenture stocks was 56,318,000 2012: 60,555,000 and the aggregate fair value of the preferred and preference stock was 2,605,000 2012: 2,257,000.
These valuations are obtained from brokers based on market prices.
The debenture stock, preference stock and preferred ordinary stock are carried in the balance sheet at par.
16.5 Fair value hierarchy disclosures The table below sets out fair value measurements using the FRS 29 fair value hierarchy.
Financial assets at fair value through Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total profit or loss at 30 June 2013 000 000 000 000 Equity investments 956,501 347 956,848 Derivatives 43 43 Total 956,458 347 956,805 Financial assets at fair value through Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total profit or loss at 30 June 2012 000 000 000 000 Equity investments 766,208 347 766,555 Total 766,208347766,555 The total carrying value of loans and receivables, as stated in note 13, is a reasonable approximation of their fair value as at the year end date.
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset as follows: Level 1 valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets Level 2 valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 Level 3 valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies note on page 31.
There have not been any transfers during the year between any of the levels.
A reconciliation of fair value movements within Level 3 is set out below.
