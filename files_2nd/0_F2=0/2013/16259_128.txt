Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 6.4 Discontinued operations and assets held for sale Accounting policy Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale if: their carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale, rather than continuing use: they are available for immediate sale: and the sale is highly probable.
A disposal group consists of assets that are to be disposed of, by sale or otherwise, in a single transaction together with the directly associated liabilities.
Goodwill arising from business combinations is included for cash-generating units which are part of the disposal group.
On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets or components of a disposal group are remeasured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Any impairment on a disposal group is first allocated to goodwill and then to remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis.
Impairment on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in the income statement.
Gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment.
No amortisation or depreciation is charged on non-current assets including those in disposal groups classified as held for sale.
Assets classified as held for sale are disclosed separately on the face of the statement of financial position and classified as current assets or liabilities, with disposal groups being separated between assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale.

Delta was classified as held for sale at 31 December 2012.
