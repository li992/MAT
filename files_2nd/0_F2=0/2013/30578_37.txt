FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS EXPOSURE TO RISK AND RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES CONTINUED a Foreign currency risk A significant proportion of the Companys portfolio is denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency, and the currency in which it reports its results.
As a result, movements in exchange rates can significantly affect the sterling value of those items.
Rate of exchange against sterling at 31 March 2013 2012 U. S. dollar 1.518 1.598 Japanese yen 142.765 131.487 Swiss franc 1.438 1.444 Euro 1.183 1.120 Foreign currency exposure and sensitivity The fair values of the Companys monetary items that are denominated in foreign currency as at 31 March 2013 are shown below: 2013 2013 2013 2012 2012 2012 Current Current Current Current assets liabilities Investments assets liabilities Investments 000 000 000 000 000 000 U.

The Investment Manager does not hedge against foreign currency movements, but takes account of the risk when making investment decisions.
Foreign currency borrowing facilities are available and are currently being utilised, to limit the Companys exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates, which might otherwise adversely affect the value of portfolio investments.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that the income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
Foreign currency sensitivity The following table details the sensitivity of the Companys profit or loss after taxation for the year and shareholders funds to a 10% increase and decrease in sterling against the U. S. dollar 2012: 10% increase and decrease, a 10% increase and decrease in sterling against the Japanese yen 2012: 10% increase and decrease, and a 10% increase and decrease in sterling against the Swiss franc 2012: 10% increase and decrease.
These percentages have been determined based on market volatility in exchange rates over the previous 12 months.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys foreign currency financial instruments held at each Balance Sheet date.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS EXPOSURE TO RISK AND RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES CONTINUED b Interest rate risk Interest rate movement may affect: the interest payable on the Companys variable rate borrowings: the level of income receivable from floating and fixed rate securities and cash at bank and on deposit: the fair value of investments of fixed interest securities.
Management of the risk The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions and borrowing under the multicurrency loan facility.
The Company, generally, does not hold significant cash balances except when required for collateral against the Companys derivative positions, with short term borrowing being used when required.
Interest rate exposure The Company has a loan facility with Goldman Sachs which is repayable on demand.
31.4 million was drawn down under this facility at 31 March 2013.
The exposure of financial assets and liabilities to floating interest rates, giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are re-set, is shown below.
Floating rate The floating interest rate exposure of the financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk at 31 March 2013 in respect of cash was nil 2012: nil.
At 31 March 2013 there was an overdraft position at Goldman Sachs of 31,419,000 2012: 64,359,000.
Fixed rate At 31 March, the Company held 2.7% of the portfolio in convertible bonds 2012: 3.3% of the portfolio.
This percentage is deemed not to be material and accordingly no sensitivity analysis has been presented.
c Other price risk Other price risk may affect the value of the Companys investments.
If market prices at the Balance Sheet date had been 25% higher or lower 2012: 25% higher or lower while all other variables remained constant, the revenue return would have decreased increased by 66,000 2012: 49,000, and the capital return would have increased decreased by 137,191,000 2012: 116,168,000 and the return on equity would have increased decreased by 137,125,000.
The calculations are based on the portfolio valuations as at the respective Balance Sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS EXPOSURE TO RISK AND RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES CONTINUED ii Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted equities and other quoted securities that are readily realisable.
The Company has a loan facility repayable on demand with Goldman Sachs.
Interest on the facility is charged at the Federal Funds effective rate plus 1 week LIBOR-OIS Spread plus 35 basis points.
In order to ensure diversification within the portfolio, the Board gives guidance to the Investment Manager concerning exposure limits to individual companies.
Geographical and sectoral exposure are also reviewed regularly by the Directors.
Liquidity exposure Contractual maturities of the financial liabilities as at 31 March 2013, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required are as follows: 2013 3 months Not more than or less one year Total 31 March 2013 000 000 000 Current liabilities: Borrowings under the loan facility 31,419 31,419 Amounts due to brokers and accruals 26,935 26,935 58,354 58,354 2012 3 months Not more or less than one year Total 31 March 2012 000 000 000 Current liabilities: Borrowings under the loan facility 64,359 64,359 Amounts due to brokers and accruals 15,288 15,288 79,647 79,647 Worldwide Healthcare Trust PLC Annual Report 2013 228467 Finsbury WWH pp45-pp60 18 06 2013 10:41 Page 58 58 Notes to the Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued 18.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS EXPOSURE TO RISK AND RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES CONTINUED iii Credit risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
The carrying amounts of financial assets best represent the maximum credit risk at the Balance Sheet date.
The Companys listed investments are held on its behalf by Goldman Sachs acting as the Companys custodian.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of a custodian may cause the Companys rights with respect to securities held by that custodian to be delayed, however, the Board monitors the Companys risk to its custodians by reviewing continuously their internal control reports and their credit ratings.
Certain of the Companys assets are held by Goldman Sachs as collateral for the loan provided by them to the Company.
Such assets held by Goldman Sachs are available for rehypothecation.
As at 31 March 2013, assets with a total market value of 50.1 million 31 March 2012: 93.9 million were held as collateral.
In addition 4.5 million cash was held as collateral at Goldman Sachs 31 March 2012: 2.7 million.
Management of the risk The risk is not significant, and is managed as follows: by only dealing with brokers which have been approved by OrbiMed Capital LLC and banks with high credit ratings: by setting limits to the maximum exposure to any one counterparty at any time: and by monitoring the assets subject to rehypothecation.
