6. Business and geographical segments 107 reviewed by the Chief Executive to assess their performance.
All four divisions sell building materials to a wide range of customers, none of which are dominant, and operate almost exclusively in the United Kingdom and consequently no geographical information is presented.
Segment result represents the profit earned by each segment without allocation of certain central costs, finance income and costs and income tax expense.
Unallocated segment assets and liabilities comprise financial instruments, current and deferred taxation, cash and borrowings and pension scheme assets and liabilities.
During 2013 and 2012 there were no impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses recognised in profit or loss or in equity in any of the reportable segments.
