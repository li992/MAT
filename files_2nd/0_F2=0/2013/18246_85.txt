If a proxy appointment is submitted without indicating how the proxy should vote on any resolution, the proxy will exercise his her discretion as to whether and, if so, how he she votes.
A proxy need not be a member of the Company.
A proxy form which may be used to make such appointment and give proxy instructions accompanies this notice.

The return of a completed proxy form, other such instrument or any CREST Proxy Instruction as described in note 13 a below will not prevent a member attending the meeting and voting in person if he she wishes to do so.
A vote withheld option is provided on the form of proxy to enable you to instruct your proxy not to vote on any particular resolution.
However, it should be noted that a vote withheld in this way is not a vote in law and will not be counted in the calculation of the proportion of the votes For and Against a resolution.
