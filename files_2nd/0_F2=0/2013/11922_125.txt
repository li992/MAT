Retirement benefit and other post-retirement obligations Background The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans throughout the world.
The largest plan is the Pearson Group Pension Plan UK Group plan in the UK, which is sectionalised to provide both defined benefit and defined contribution pension benefits.
The defined benefit section was closed to new members from 1 November 2006.
The defined contributions section, opened in 2003, is open to new and existing employees.
Finally, there is a separate section within the UK Group plan set up for auto-enrolment.
The defined benefit section of the UK Group plan is a final salary pension plan which provides benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits depends on the length of service and final pensionable pay.
The UK Group plan is funded with benefit payments from trustee administered funds.
The UK Group plan is administered in accordance with the Trust Deed and Rules in the interests of its beneficiaries by Pearson Group Pension Trustee Limited.
At 31 December 2013 the UK Group plan has approximately 26,500 members, analysed in the following table: % Active Deferred Pensioners Total Defined benefit 3 25 32 60 Defined contribution 17 23 40 Total 20 48 32 100 The other major defined benefit plans are based in the US.
These are also final salary pension plans which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed pension payable for life, with the level of benefits dependent on length of service and final pensionable pay.
The majority of the US plans are funded.
The Group also has several post-retirement medical benefit plans PRMBs, principally in the US.
PRMBs are unfunded but are accounted for and valued similarly to defined benefit pension plans.
The defined benefit schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as life expectancy, inflation risks, and investment risk including asset volatility and changes in bond yields.
The Group is not exposed to any unusual, entity specific or plan specific risks.

Retirement benefit and other post-retirement obligations continued Assumptions The principal assumptions used for the UK Group plan and the US PRMB are shown below.
Weighted average assumptions have been shown for the other plans, which primarily relate to US pension plans.
2013 2012 UK Group Other UK Group Other % plan plans PRMB plan plans PRMB Inflation 3.4 2.5 2.5 3.0 2.5 2.5 Rate used to discount plan liabilities 4.4 4.4 4.4 4.4 3.6 3.6 Expected rate of increase in salaries 3.9 3.9 4.0 3.5 3.9 Expected rate of increase for pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.3 to 5.1 2.3 to 5.1 Initial rate of increase in healthcare rate 7.5 8.0 Ultimate rate of increase in healthcare rate 5.0 5.0 The UK discount rate is based on corporate bond yields adjusted to reflect the duration of liabilities.
The US discount rate is set by reference to a US bond portfolio matching model.
The inflation rate for the UK Group plan of 3.4% reflects the RPI rate.
In line with changes to legislation in 2010, certain benefits have been calculated with reference to CPI as the inflationary measure and in these instances a rate of 2.6% has been used.
The expected rate of increase in salaries has been set at 3.9% for 2013 with a short-term assumption of 3.0% for three years.
For the UK plan, the mortality base table assumptions have been derived from the SAPS all pensioners tables for males and the SAPS normal health pensioners tables for females, adjusted to reflect the observed experience of the plan, with CMI model improvement factors.
A 1.5% long term rate improvement on the CMI model is applied for males, and 1.25% for females.
For the US plans, the RP2000 table projected to 2020 is used, reflecting the mortality assumption most prevalent in the US.
Using the above tables, the remaining average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65 on the balance sheet date for the UK Group plan and US plans is as follows: UK US 2013 2012 2013 2012 Male 24.3 23.0 19.2 19.2 Female 24.4 24.2 21.1 21.1 The remaining average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65, 20 years after the balance sheet date, for the UK and US Group plans is as follows: UK US 2013 2012 2013 2012 Male 25.9 25.1 19.2 19.2 Female 25.9 26.1 21.1 21.1 178 Pearson plc Annual report and accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 25.

The trustee of the plan is required to act in the best interest of the plans beneficiaries.
Assets of the plan are divided into two elements: matching assets, which are assets that produce cashflows that can be expected to match the cashflows for a proportion of the membership, and include UK and overseas bonds, inflation linked property and infrastructure: return seeking assets, which are assets invested with a longer term horizon to generate the returns needed to provide the remaining expected cashflows for the beneficiaries, and include equities, property and alternative asset classes.
The benchmark allocation is 60% matching and 40% return seeking assets.
The most recent triennial actuarial valuation for funding purposes was completed as at 1 January 2012 and this valuation revealed a funding shortfall.
The Group has agreed that the funding shortfall will be eliminated by June 2017.
In 2013 the Group contributed 56m 2012: 48m towards the funding shortfall.
Following the completion of the triennial funding valuation the Group has agreed to contribute 41m per annum until 2017 in excess of regular contributions.
In addition, a mechanism has been agreed for the Group to make supplementary payments up to a maximum of 15m per annum if certain conditions are met.
If such payments are made they are expected to accelerate the end date for extinguishing the deficit.
Regular contributions to the plan in respect of the defined benefit sections are estimated to be 18m for 2014.
The Group expects to contribute $12m in 2014 and $12m in 2015 to its US defined benefit pension plans.

Retirement benefit and other post-retirement obligations continued Sensitivities The effect of a one percentage point increase and decrease in the discount rate on the defined benefit obligation and the total pension expense is as follows: 2013 All figures in millions 1% increase 1% decrease Effect: Decrease increase in defined benefit obligation UK Group plan 316.0 390.5 Decrease increase in defined benefit obligation US plan 16.1 20.0 The effect of members living one year more or one year less on the defined benefit obligation is as follows: 2013 1 year 1 year All figures in millions increase decrease Effect: Increase decrease in defined benefit obligation UK Group plan 79.2 76.2 Increase decrease in defined benefit obligation US plan 4.2 4.8 The effect of a half percentage point increase and decrease in the inflation rate is as follows: 2013 All figures in millions 0.5% increase 0.5% decrease Effect: Increase decrease in defined benefit obligation UK Group plan 106.1 99.5 Increase decrease in defined benefit obligation US plan 0.2 0.3 The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant, although in practice this is unlikely to occur and changes in some assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating these sensitivities the same method has been applied to calculate the defined benefit obligation as has been applied when calculating the liability recognised in the balance sheet.
This methodology is the same as prior periods.
