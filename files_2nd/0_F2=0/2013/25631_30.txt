Segment information Management has determined its operating segments based on the analysis used to make strategic decisions.
Business segment analysis The Group is organised on a worldwide basis into three main segments: Risk & Insurance, Employee Benefits and Head Office & Other operations.
These segments are consistent with the internal reporting structure of the Group.
The Risk & Insurance segment comprises JLTs global specialist, wholesale, reinsurance broking, personal lines and SME activities.
The Employee Benefits segment consists of pension administration, outsourcing and employee benefits consultancy, healthcare and wealth management activities.
Certain Risk & Insurance and Employee Benefits operating segments have been disclosed within the reporting segments given their individual size.
The Head Office & Other segment consists mainly of holding companies, central administration functions, the Groups captive insurance companies and the Groups investments in associates.
Segment results Management assesses the performance of the operating segments based upon a measure of underlying trading profit.
Segment results include the net income or expense derived from the trading activities of the segment together with the investment income earned on fiduciary funds.
Interest income on the Groups own funds and finance costs are excluded as they are not considered part of the trading activities of the Groups primary segments.
Income tax expense and the charge in respect of non-controlling interests are excluded from the segmental allocation.
Segment assets and liabilities Assets and liabilities are not allocated to individual segments and are therefore all reported within Head Office & Other.
Investments in associates The Group owns the following stakes in its principal associates: 26 per cent in Milestone, the holding company of Siaci Saint Honor, which operates principally in France: 20 per cent of GrECo which operates mainly in Austria and Eastern Europe: 25 per cent of MAG-JLT which operates mainly in Italy: and 25 per cent of March-JLT which operates mainly in Spain.
On 31st July 2013 the Group disposed of 25 per cent of JLT Energy France SAS which reduced its shareholding to 35 per cent and therefore from that date this company is treated as an associate.
The investment and the Groups share of the net profit of these associates are included in the Head Office & Other segment, together with the investment and results of the Groups other associates, Sterling Re Intermediaro fide Reaseguro SA fide CV and JLT Insurance Management Malta.
Other segment items Capital expenditure comprises additions to property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets.

Employee information continued Key management personnel are defined as persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group directly or indirectly, including any director of the Group.
This represents the Group Board of Directors and the Group Executive Committee only.
The Groups equity-settled share-based payments comprise the JLT Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 2013, Senior Executive Share Scheme, Executive Share Option Scheme and the Sharesave Schemes.
JLT Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 2013 The Group operates the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP for Executive Directors and persons discharging managerial responsibility PDMRs.
The scheme has been renewed in 2013.
Awards under the scheme are granted in the form of nil-priced options and are satisfied using marketpurchased shares.
The awards vest in full or in part depending on satisfaction of the performance conditions which are set out on pages 62 and 63 of the remuneration report.
The awards have a 3 year performance period and have a 10 year life from the date of grant.
Senior Executive Share Scheme The Group operates a Senior Executive Share Scheme for senior management and employees.
Awards under the scheme are granted in the form of nil-priced options and are satisfied using market-purchased shares.
The majority of awards have no specific performance criteria attached, other than the requirement that employees remain in employment with the Group.
Certain awards have been granted with specific performance targets defined for the individual executives.
In general these require targets for revenue and profit growth to be met over the vesting period.
The awards have a 10 year life from the date of grant.
Executive Share Option Scheme Options were granted at a fixed price usually market price and are exercisable after the vesting period usually 3 years.
Options are satisfied by the issue of new shares or market-purchased shares.
Some options carry performance conditions where they are only exercisable when earnings per share is in excess of RPI for the three consecutive financial accounting periods preceding the date of exercise.
This scheme is now closed for new grants and options were last granted under this scheme on 29th September 2006.
Sharesave Schemes The Sharesave Schemes is open to all employees and are exercised after either 3 or 5 years from the date of grant.
The price at which options are offered is not less than 80% of the market price on the date preceding the date of invitation.
All Sharesave Schemes options have no performance criteria attached, other than the requirement that the employee remains in employment with the Group.
All options must be exercised within 6 months of the vesting date.
Fair value of awards Under IFRS 2 the fair value of awards granted during the year, calculated using a Black-Scholes model, is set out below: Black-Scholes model assumptions Exercise Share price on Dividend Risk free Fair value of price Performance grant date Volatility yield Maturity interest rate one award pence period pence %% years % pence JLT Long Term Incentive Plan 2013 Senior Executive Share Scheme 2013 28 March - 2013 - 18 851.00 19.96 - 1 - 5 0.70 851.00 2013 8 May - 2013 - 16 877.50 20.04 -3 0.74 877.50 2013 15 May - 2013 - 16 914.50 19.50 -3 0.85 914.50 2013 30 September - 2013 - 18 945.00 18.96 - 1 - 5 1.32 945.00 The option holders who have awards under the Senior Executive Share Scheme also receive payments equating to the dividends payable on their shares subject to meeting the performance criteria.
Under the Black-Scholes model if the dividend yield is assumed to be zero then the fair value will equal the share price at date of grant.
The volatility has been calculated based on the historical share price of the Company, using a 3 year term.
All options granted under the share option schemes are conditional upon the employees remaining in the Groups employment during the vesting period of the option, the actual period varies according to the scheme in which the employee participates.
In calculating the cost of options granted, a factor is included to take account of anticipated lapse rates.
For Executive Share Option and Sharesave Schemes this is 20%.
For the JLT Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 2013 and the Senior Executive Share Scheme it is nil as both are issued with no cost to the employee.

The UK Government has announced various measures in relation to UK corporation tax including a 1% reduction in the headline rate of corporation tax from April 2013, and reductions of 2% in 2014 and 1% in 2015.
These reductions reduce the UK tax rate from 24% to 20%.
As at 31st December 2013 the 1% rate reduction to 23% is already in force and the subsequent 2% rate and 1% rate reductions have been enacted.
The impact of the 2% and the 1% reductions have therefore been incorporated into the income tax charge for the year ended 31st December 2013.

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis.
These instruments are included in level 1.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using internal and external models.
These models maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
During the year there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2.
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.
In respect of deferred and contingent consideration, unobservable inputs include managements assessment of the expected future performance of relevant acquired businesses.
