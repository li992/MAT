Croda International Plc Sharesave Scheme Sharesave The Sharesave scheme, established in 1983 and renewed in 2013, grants options annually in September to employees of the Group at a fixed exercise price, being the market price of the Companys shares at the grant date discounted by up to 20%.
Employees then enter into a savings contract over three to five years and, subject to continued employment, purchase options at the end of the period based on the amount saved.
Options are then exercisable for a 6 month period following completion of the savings contract.

Under the SIP scheme, employees enter into an agreement to purchase shares in the Company each month.
For each share purchased by an employee, the Company awards a matching share which passes to the employee after three years service.
The matching shares are allocated each month at market value with this fair value charge being recognised in the income statement in full in the year of allocation.
