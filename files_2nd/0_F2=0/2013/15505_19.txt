ACCOUNTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Telecom Plus PLC the Company is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2013 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interest in associates.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 20 May 2013. a Statement of compliance The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations as endorsed by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
b Basis of preparation The accounts are prepared on a going concern and historical cost basis.
The fair value basis is adopted for relevant assets and liabilities as required under IFRS.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The most significant assumptions in the financial statements relate to the recoverability of customer receivables, which are referred to in the Business Review under principal risks.
By virtue of section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from presenting a statement of comprehensive income.
The following standards and interpretations have become mandatory for the Company during the current accounting period, but where relevant to the Company they have not had a material impact on the financial statements: IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements amended : IAS 19 Employee Benefits amended : IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements: IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: IFRS 1 First time adoption of IFRS: Government loans amended : IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosure: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities: IFRS 13 Fair Value measurement: and IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine.
c Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries The Groups financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Telecom Plus PLC and its subsidiary.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control transfers to the Group and are included until the date on which the Group ceases to control them.
Transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
51 TELECOM PLUS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED ii Associates An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost and adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of an associate in excess of the Groups interest in that associate are not recognised.
d Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually and any impairment is recognised immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on acquisition.
e Revenue Revenue is the value of goods and services supplied to external customers and independent Distributors excluding value added tax and other sales related taxes.
For each of the Companys main income streams from the provision of fixed line telephony, broadband, mobile telephony, gas and electricity services, transactions are recorded as sales in the month when the provision of those services takes place.
The Companys customers are invoiced in the month following that in which the services are provided.
The Company also generates revenue as a result of joining fees paid by new Distributors and in relation to vehicles supplied to Distributors on hire purchase agreements.
These transactions are recorded as sales in the month the Distributor joins the Company or is supplied with the vehicle.
The recognition of revenue associated with the provision of gas and electricity services to customers by the Company relies on estimates of actual usage where meter readings are not available.
These estimates are based on historical usage information as adjusted for known factors such as variations in weather.
f Interest income Interest income is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as it accrues, using the effective interest rate method.
g Leases Payments on operating leases are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the lease term.
h Hire purchase agreements Hire purchase agreements relate to leases of assets where the Group has passed on substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and are therefore classified as finance leases.
When assets are leased out under finance leases, the present value of the minimum lease payments is recognised as a receivable.
i Taxation The tax charge for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Taxation is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
52 TELECOM PLUS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS ACCOUNTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Deferred tax is recognised, based on the balance sheet liability method, on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
j Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less a provision for depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost less estimated residual value of the assets in equal instalments over their expected useful lives.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Depreciation is provided on other assets at the following rates: Freehold buildings 50 years Plant and machinery 15 years Fixtures and fittings 7 years Leasehold improvements 3 years Computer and office equipment 3 to 5 years Motor vehicles 4 years The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when there is an indication that they may be impaired.
k Intangible assets Intangible assets which arise e. g. on the entering into of significant commercial contractual arrangements are capitalised and amortised over their useful life or, where appropriate and an indefinite life is chosen, made subject to an annual impairment review.
l Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business, representing the difference between the cost of acquisition and the fair value of the separable net assets acquired is capitalised and is subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
m Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
53 TELECOM PLUS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED n Investments In the Companys accounts, investments in subsidiary and associated undertakings are initially stated at cost.
Provision is made for any impairment in the value of these investments.
In the Group accounts investments in associated undertakings are shown at cost plus accumulated profits less any dividends received from the associated undertakings.
o Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, including related overheads, and net realisable value.
Cost is measured on a first in, first out basis.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
p Financial instruments The Group classifies financial instruments, or their component parts, on initial recognition as a financial asset, a financial liability or an equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
Financial instruments are recognised on trade date when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of a financial instrument not at fair value through profit and loss, transactions costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial instrument.
Financial instruments are derecognised on trade date when the Group is no longer a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
q Trade receivables Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash receipts over the short credit period is not considered to be material.
r Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits with banks and short term borrowings which comprise bank loans and overdrafts repayable on demand.
s Trade payables Trade payables are stated at their nominal value, as the interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash payments over the short payment period is not considered to be material.
t Share based payments The fair value at the date of grant of share based remuneration, principally share options, is calculated using a binomial pricing model and is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award.
The charge to the Statement of Comprehensive Income takes account of the estimated number of shares that will vest.
All share option based remuneration is equity settled, except as set out below.
The Company established a Joint Share Ownership Plan the JSOP on 30 March 2011.
On vesting, any gains made on awards granted under the JSOP may be settled either through: i a cash payment to the participant equal to the gain: or ii the transfer of legal and beneficial ownership to the participant of such number of shares as have full value equal to the gain.
54 TELECOM PLUS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS ACCOUNTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED JSOP awards are considered to be cash-settled and therefore a fair value liability is calculated using a binomial pricing model.
The fair value is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award.
At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is re-measured, with any changes in fair value recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
u Segmental reporting Financial information on operating segments that corresponds with information regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, Mr Andrew Lindsay, is disclosed in note 1 to the accounts.
v Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
w Pensions The Group makes contributions to certain employees personal pension plans.
These are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year in which they become payable.
x Dividends Final dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
y New standards issued but not yet effective The Group has not adopted any standards or interpretations in advance of the required implementation dates.
It is not expected that adoption of the majority of standards or interpretations which have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and endorsed by the EU, but have not been adopted, will have a material impact on the financial statements.
The following standards have been issued but are not yet effective: IAS 32 Financial instruments: Presentation amended : IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 Investment Entities amended : and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.
55 TELECOM PLUS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
SEGMENT REPORTING The Groups reportable segments reflect the two distinct activities around which the Group is organised: Customer Acquisition: and Customer Management.
Customer Acquisition revenues represent joining fees from the Groups Distributors, the sale of marketing materials and sales of equipment including mobile phone handsets and wireless internet routers.
Customer Management revenues are principally derived from the supply of fixed telephony, mobile telephony, gas, electricity and internet services to residential and small business customers.
The Board measures the performance of its operating segments based on revenue and segment result, which is referred to as operating profit.
The Group applies the same significant accounting policies across both operating segments.

The intangible asset is not being amortised as it is considered to have an indefinite life given the npower energy supply agreement does not have an end date and no notice of termination has been issued.
Accordingly, the asset was reviewed for impairment at 31 March 2013 by considering the future cash flows derived from the supply of energy under the agreement.
In light of the overall profitability of this arrangement, it was not necessary to consider more than one year of cash flows in determining that the asset was not impaired.

In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, the Group regularly monitors the carrying amount of its goodwill.
A review was undertaken at 31 March 2013 to assess whether the carrying amount of assets was supported by their value in use determined by the net present value of the future cash flows derived from the assets using cash flow projections based on current levels of profitability.
A pre-tax discount rate of 20% into perpetuity was used which was considered appropriate given the expectation that, for the foreseeable future, TML will continue to operate as a going concern.
The result of the review undertaken at 31 March 2013 indicated that no impairment was necessary.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Company has two share option plans, one of which is available to employees, the other to Distributors of the Company.
All new employees who have passed the requisite probationary period are issued with options over shares in the Company, further options are also granted to existing employees depending on their seniority and length of service The Telecom Plus PLC 2007 Employee Share Option Plan.
The Distributor scheme The Telecom Plus PLC 2007 Networkers and Consultants Share Option Plan exists to provide incentives to the people who are most successful in gathering new customers for the Company.
As it is not possible to measure directly the benefit received from these activities, the fair value of the benefit received has been measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
On 30 March 2011 the Company established a new Joint Share Ownership Plan The Telecom Plus PLC Joint Share Ownership Plan 2011 or the JSOP.
Under the terms of the JSOP 500,000 shares were issued to an Employee Benefit Trust the JSOP Share Trust administered by Barclays Wealth Guernsey Limited, which holds the shares jointly with the only current participant, Mr Lindsay.
The JSOP Share Trust was provided with an interest free loan from the Company to subscribe for the 500,000 shares, and therefore the transaction was cash flow neutral for the Company.
As set out in note t of the Significant Accounting Policies, JSOP awards are considered to be cash-settled and therefore a fair value liability is calculated using a binomial pricing model.
The fair value liability is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award.
At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is re-measured, with any changes in fair value recognised in the amortisation charge in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The following key assumptions were used to determine the fair value liability of the JSOP award of 304.1p per share as at 31 March 2013: a strike price of 553p per share, a share price of 1001p as at 28 March 2013 the last trading date before calculation, expected volatility of 24.9%, an expected life of 2 years, a risk free rate of 0.18% and an expected dividend yield of 3.1%.
Share based expenses have been charged in the consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as follows: 2013 2012 000 000 Distribution expenses 118 89 Administrative expenses 813 552 Total charge 931 641 A reconciliation of movements in the numbers of share options for the Group can be summarised as follows: 2013 2012 Number Weighted Number Weighted average average exercise exercise price price At 1 April 2,014,652 356p 2,121,019 289p Options granted 1,030,800 790p 340,500 656p Options exercised 417,850 242p 351,582 246p Options lapsed expired 383,815 718p 95,285 356p At 31 March 2,243,787 514p 2,014,652 356p The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised during the year was 882.5p 2012: 660.0p.

DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Treasury activities take place under procedures and policies approved and monitored by the Board.
They are designed to minimise the financial risks faced by the Group which primarily arise from credit, interest rate and liquidity risks.
Carrying amounts of financial instruments All financial assets, which include cash, trade and other receivables and accrued income, are classified as loans and receivables with a total value for the Group of 144,567,000 2012: 104,401,000 and for the Company of 146,331,000 2012: 105,881,000.
All financial liabilities, which include trade and other payables and accrued expenditure, are held at amortised cost with a total value for the Group of 105,316,000 2012: 72,635,000 and for the Company 108,193,000 2012: 74,497,000. Credit risk All customers are invoiced monthly and approximately 90% pay by direct debit: accordingly credit risk in respect of trade receivables is considered low due to the large number of customers supplied, each of whom represents an insignificant proportion of total revenue.
The Company has a universal supply obligation in relation to the provision of energy to domestic customers.
This means that although the Company is entitled to request a reasonable deposit from a potential new customer who is not considered creditworthy, the Company is obliged to supply domestic energy to anyone who submits a properly completed application form.
Where such customers subsequently fail to pay for the energy they have used delinquent customers, there is likely to be a delay before the Company is able to eliminate its exposure to future bad debt from them by either installing a pre-payment meter or disconnecting their supply, and the costs associated with preventing such delinquent customers from increasing their indebtedness are not always fully recoverable.
Historically the Company made a provision for delinquent customers which was included in accrued expenses and deferred income.
However, in the light of the proportionate reduction in the level of delinquent customers in recent years, it has been concluded that a provision for such customers is no longer required.
As at 31 March 2012 the provision for delinquent customers was 0.98m.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations primarily through the issue of equity shares and from cash generated and retained within the business.
Cash surpluses are placed on deposit with Barclays Bank PLC at money market rates to maximise returns.
The Groups profit and equity for the current year will not be significantly affected by changes in the UK base rate of - 1% from current levels, due to the policy of placing funds on fixed rate deposit for terms of up to 1 year.
Commodity price risk The Group is not exposed to any fluctuations in commodity prices due to the nature of the agreements with wholesale providers of telephony and energy services and its ability to pass the effect of any such fluctuations through to its customers.
Liquidity risk The Groups treasury management policies are designed to ensure continuity of funding.
Foreign currency risk The Group does not have any foreign currency exposure.
Interest rate and currency profile of financial assets and liabilities All financial assets and liabilities are denominated in Sterling.
Receivables due after one year include 3,215,000 2012: 2,750,000 due from employees and Distributors which earns interest at variable rates above Base Rate.
Borrowing facilities At 31 March 2013, the Group had an available overdraft facility of 5,000,000 2012: 5,000,000 and an available money market loan facility of 15,000,000 2012: 6,000,000.
These facilities are available to the Group until 25 August 2013.
73 TELECOM PLUS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 18.
DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED The facilities are secured by fixed and floating charges over the assets of the Company and through a cross guarantee with the Companys subsidiary TML.
Prior to 25 August 2013, the Group intends to finalise with Barclays Bank PLC Barclays the facilities it requires for the following year for the ongoing support of its day to day operations and for the refurbishment of Merit House.
Barclays has expressed a strong desire to support the Groups funding requirements and the directors are confident that all necessary facilities can be arranged prior to this date.
Fair values There is not considered to be any material difference between the fair value of any financial instruments and their net book amount due to the short term maturity of the instruments.
