The majority of the Groups defined benefit plans are funded plans.
The assets of most of the larger plans are held in trusts or similar funds separate from HSBC.
The plans are reviewed at least annually or in accordance with local practice and regulations by qualified actuaries.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the defined benefit obligations and related current service costs vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which the plans are situated.
At 31 December 2013, the present values of the defined benefit obligations of The HSBC Bank UK Pension Scheme was US$29,629m 2012: US$26,475m, The HSBC Group Hong Kong Local Staff Retirement Benefit Scheme was US$1,326m 2012:US$1,476m and the HSBC North America US Retirement Income Plan was US$3,892m 2012: US$4,374m.
These defined benefit pension plans covered 12% of HSBCs employees and represented 84% of the Groups present value of defined benefit obligations.
The Pension Risk section on page 260 and the Appendix to Risk on page 266 contain details about the characteristics and risks and amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows and policies and practices associated with these three schemes.
The determinations described in the Pension Risk section on page 260 for actuarial funding valuation purposes are based on different methods and assumptions from those used for financial reporting purposes, and as a result should neither be compared nor related to other determinations included in these financial statements.
There is no actuarial deficit in the Principal plan.
HSBC healthcare benefits plans HSBC also provides post-employment healthcare benefits under plans in the UK, the US, Bermuda, Canada, Mexico and Brazil, the majority of which are unfunded.
The majority of post-employment healthcare benefits plans are defined benefit plans and are accounted for in the same manner as defined benefit pension plans.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the defined benefit obligation and related current service cost vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which they are situated.
At 31 December 2013, the present value of the defined benefit obligation of HSBCs healthcare benefit plans was US$1,106m 2012: US$1,280m.
In aggregate, healthcare benefit plans comprised 3% of HSBCs present value of defined benefit obligations.

3 On transition to IAS 19 Revised, unrecognised past service cost of US$19m at 31 December 2012 has been recognised as an actuarial experience gain.
460 HSBC expects to make US$655m of contributions to defined benefit pension plans during 2014.
Benefits expected to be paid from the plans to retirees over each of the next five years, and in aggregate for the five years thereafter, are as follows: Benefits expected to be paid from plans 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019-2023 US$m US$m US$m US$m US$m US$m 1 HSBC Bank UK Pension Scheme.
In 2013, following consultation on various employee benefit proposals, HSBC announced to employees in the UK that the future service accrual for active members of the Defined Benefit Section DBS would cease with effect from 30 June 2015.
As a result, defined benefit pensions based on service to 30 June 2015 will continue to be linked to final salary on retirement underpinned by increases in CPI but all active members of the DBS will become members of the Defined Contribution Section from 1 July 2015.
As part of these amendments, the HSBC Bank UK Pension Scheme the Scheme will cease to deliver ill-health benefits to active members of the DBS and these benefits will, instead, be covered via insurance policies from 1 January 2015, consistent with other UK employees.
This resulted in a reduction in the defined benefit obligation of the Scheme and a corresponding gain of US$430m, recorded in Past service cost and gains losses on settlements in the table above.
The fair value of plan assets included derivatives entered into with HSBC Bank plc by the HSBC Bank UK Pension Scheme and the HSBC International Staff Retirement Benefits Scheme with positive fair values of US$2,827m at 31 December 2013 2012: US$5,226m and US$399m 2012: US$328m, respectively.
Further details of these swap arrangements are included in Note 44.
The actual return on plan assets for the year ended 31 December 2013 was a positive return of US$2,254m 2012: positive US$2,784m.

2 Rate of increase for pensions in the UK is for pensions in payment only, capped at 5%.
Deferred pensions are projected to increase in line with the CPI, capped at 5%.
For 2010, deferred pensions were projected to increase in line with the RPI, capped at 5%.
HSBC determines the discount rates to be applied to its obligations in consultation with the plans local actuaries, on the basis of current average yields of high quality AA rated or equivalent debt instruments, with maturities consistent with those of the defined benefit obligations.
In countries where there is not a deep market in corporate bonds, government bond yields are used.
The yield curve is extrapolated when the term of the liabilities is longer than the duration of available bonds, in which case the discount rate takes into account the term of the liabilities and the shape of the yield curve.
When determining the discount rate with reference to a bond index, an appropriate index for the specific region is used.
Light table with 1.01 rating for male pensioners and 1.02 rating for female pensioners.
2 The significant plans in Hong Kong are lump sum plans which do not use a post-retirement mortality table.
Actuarial assumption sensitivities The discount rate is sensitive to changes in market conditions arising during the reporting period.
The mortality rates used are sensitive to experience from the plan member profile.
The average number of persons employed by HSBC Holdings during 2013 was 1,525 2012: 1,323.
Employees of HSBC Holdings who are members of defined benefit pension plans are principally members of either the HSBC Bank UK Pension Scheme or the HSBC International Staff Retirement Benefits Scheme.
HSBC Holdings pays contributions to such plans for its own employees in accordance with the schedules of contributions determined by the Trustees of the plan and recognises these contributions as an expense as they fall due.
