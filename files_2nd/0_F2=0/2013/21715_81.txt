BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2013 14 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Companys main financial instruments comprise: a Cash and cash equivalents that arise directly from the Companys operations: b Shares held in AllBlue and AllBlue Leveraged: and c Shares held in ICS.
15 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments concerns its holding of shares in AllBlue Limited AllBlue and AllBlue Leveraged and the risks attaching to those shares which are market price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk and increased volatility due to leverage employed by the Underlying Funds as explained below.
The Company is not exposed directly to material foreign exchange risk as each class of shares in the Company is directly invested in shares of AllBlueand AllBlue Leveraged denominated in the same corresponding currency.
So far as the Company is concerned, the only risk over which the Board can exercise direct control is the liquidity risk attaching to its ability to realise shares in AllBlue, AllBlue Leveraged and ICS for the purpose of meeting share buy backs and ongoing expenses of the Company.
Thereafter the Board recognises that the Company has via its holding of shares in AllBlue, AllBlue Leveraged and ICS an indirect exposure to the risks summarised below.
For the shares held in the ICS Funds the Board notes that such shares may be realised on short notice on any business day with proceeds in respect thereof usually being transmitted by telegraphic transfer on the business day following receipt of the redemption notice by the ICS Fund subject to cut-off times depending on the specific ICS Fund in which shares are being redeemed.
It must also be noted that there is little or nothing which the Board can do to manage each of these risks within AllBlue and AllBlue Leveraged or the Underlying Funds in which AllBlue and AllBlue Leveraged invests the Underlying Fund s, under the current investment objective of the Company.
a Price Risk The success of the Companys activities will be affected by general economic and market conditions, such as interest rates, availability of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws, trade barriers, currency exchange controls and national and international political circumstances.
These factors may affect the level and volatility of securities prices and the liquidity of the Underlying Funds investments.
Volatility or illiquidity could impair the Underlying Funds profitability or result in losses.
Details of the Companys Investment Objective and Policy are given on page 20.
99 BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2013 15 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES continued a Price Risk continued Price sensitivity The Company invests substantially all its assets in AllBlue, AllBlue Leveraged and ICS and does not undertake any structural borrowing or hedging activity at the Company level.
Its performance is therefore directly linked to the NAV of AllBlue, which itself is driven by the NAVs of the Underlying Funds, each of which hold a large number of positions in listed and unlisted securities.
At 31 December 2013, if the NAV of AllBlue, AllBlue Leveraged and ICS had been 10% higher lower with all the other variables held constant, the net assets attributable to Shareholders for the year would have increased decreased as stated below, arising due to the increase in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
Increase in net assets Decrease in net assets attributable to Shareholders attributable to Shareholders 31 Dec 2013 31 Dec 2012 31 Dec 2013 31 Dec 2012 CCY CCY CCY CCY Sterling shareholders 76,164,610 85,620,190 76,164,610 85,620,190 Euro shareholders 1,541,547 1,729,885 1,541,547 1,729,885 Dollar shareholders 6,703,238 13,275,452 6,703,238 13,275,452 Total 84,291,946 94,691,620 84,291,946 94,691,620 The sensitivity is lower in 2013 than in 2012 because of a decrease in the net financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss at the reporting date.
b Credit Risk The nature of commercial arrangements made in the normal course of business between many prime brokers and custodians means that in the case of any one prime broker or custodian defaulting on its obligations to AllBlue and AllBlue Leveraged or any of the Underlying Funds, the effects of such a default may have negative effects on other prime brokers with whom AllBlue and AllBlue Leveraged or such Underlying Fund deals.
The Underlying Funds and, by extension, AllBlue and AllBlue Leveraged and the Company may, therefore, be exposed to systemic risk when AllBlue and AllBlue Leveraged or an Underlying Fund deals with prime brokers and custodians whose creditworthiness may be interlinked.
The assets of Underlying Funds or AllBlue Leveraged may be pledged as margin with prime brokers or other counterparties or held with prime brokers or banks.
In the event of the default of any of these prime brokers, banks or counterparties, AllBlue, AllBlue Leveraged and ICS or the Underlying Funds may not receive back all or any of the assets pledged or held with the defaulting party.
The maximum credit risk to which the Company was exposed at the year end was 841,609,126 2012: 958,378,839.
The main concentration of risk for the Company relates to the investments in AllBlue, AllBlue Leveraged and ICS.
100 BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2013 15 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES continued c Liquidity Risk In some circumstances, investments held by Underlying Funds of AllBlue and AllBlue Leveraged may be relatively illiquid making it difficult to acquire or dispose of them at the prices quoted on the various exchanges.
Accordingly, an Underlying Funds ability to respond to market movements may be impaired and, consequently, the Underlying Fund may experience adverse price movements upon liquidation of its investments which may in turn affect the value of AllBlue and AllBlue Leveraged and hence the Companys investment in AllBlue and AllBlue Leveraged.
Settlement of transactions may be subject to delay and administrative formalities.
There can be no assurance that the liquidity of the investments of AllBlue, AllBlue Leveraged and ICS and the Underlying Funds will always be sufficient to meet redemption requests as, and when, made.
Any such lack of liquidity may affect the ability of the Company to realise its shares in AllBlue, AllBlue Leveraged and ICS and the value of Shares in the Company.
For such reasons AllBlues, AllBlue Leverageds and ICSs treatment of redemption requests may be deferred in exceptional circumstances including if a lack of liquidity may result in difficulties in determining the NAV and the NAV per share in AllBlue.
This in turn would limit the ability of the Directors to realise the Companys investments in AllBlue and AllBlue Leveraged should they consider it appropriate to do so and may result in difficulties in determining the NAV of a Share in the Company.
There was no gating or suspension of AllBlue or AllBlue Leveraged during the year under review or in the previous year.
The market prices, if any, for such illiquid investments tend to be volatile and may not be readily ascertainable and the relevant Underlying Fund may not be able to sell them when it desires to do so or to realise what it perceives to be their fair value in the event of a sale.
The size of the Underlying Funds positions may magnify the effect of a decrease in market liquidity for such instruments.
Changes in overall market leverage, deleveraging as a consequence of a decision by the counterparties with which the Underlying Funds enter into repurchase reverse repurchase agreements or derivative transactions, to reduce the level of leveraging, or the liquidation by other market participants of the same or similar positions, may also adversely affect the Underlying Funds portfolios.
The sale of restricted and illiquid securities often requires more time and results in higher brokerage charges or dealer discounts and other selling expenses than does the sale of securities eligible for trading on national securities exchanges or in the over-the-counter markets.
The Underlying Funds may not be able readily to dispose of such illiquid investments and, in some cases, may be contractually prohibited from disposing of such investments for a specified period of time.
Restricted securities may sell at a price lower than similar securities that are not subject to restrictions on resale.
The Companys Shares in issue are traded on the London Stock Exchange Main Market for Listed Securities LSE.
However, in certain circumstances there may be a limited market for the Shares and it may not be possible for investors to achieve liquidation of their holding within a short time period or for the investor to realise the full anticipated value of the Shares.
101 BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2013 15 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES continued c Liquidity Risk continued The table below details the residual contractual maturities of financial liabilities: As at 31 December 2013 1-3 months Payable in the Total event of the continuation vote not passed Net assets at the end of the period attributable to shareholders - 841,552,800 841,552,800 Accrued expenses 106,761 - 106,761 Total 106,761 - 106,761 As at 31 December 2012 1-3 months Payable in the Total event of the continuation vote not passed Net assets at the end of the period attributable to shareholders - 958,305,726 958,305,726 Accrued expenses 107,270 - 107,270 Total 107,270 - 107,270 d Interest Rate Risk The prices of securities tend to be sensitive to interest rate fluctuations.
Unexpected fluctuations in interest rates could cause the corresponding prices of long positions and short positions adopted to move in directions which were not originally anticipated.
In addition, interest rate increases generally increase the interest or carrying costs of investments.
However, the Companys investments designated as at fair value through profit or loss and ordinary shares in issue are non interest bearing, and therefore are not exposed to interest rate risk.
The Companys own cash balances are not materially exposed to interest rate risk as cash and cash equivalents are held on floating interest rate deposits with banks and the Company does not rely on income from bank interest to meet day to day expenses.
e Leverage by Underlying Funds Certain Underlying Funds in which the Company may have an economic interest operate with a substantial degree of leverage and are not limited in the extent to which they either may borrow or engage in margin transactions.
The positions maintained by such Underlying Funds may in aggregate value be in excess of the NAV of AllBlue and AllBlue Leveraged.
102 BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2013 15 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES continued e Leverage by Underlying Funds continued This leverage presents the potential for a higher rate of total return but will also increase the volatility of AllBlue, AllBlue Leveraged and, as a consequence, the Company, including the risk of a total loss of the amount invested.
f Leverage by AllBlue Leveraged AllBlue Leverage operates with a substantial degree of leverage for the purposes of making investments and is not limited in the extent to which they either may borrow or engage in margin transactions although is expected to be an amount equal to approximately 50 per cent of AllBlue Leverageds NAV.
This leverage presents the potential for a greater rate of total return but will also increase exposure to capital risk and interest costs.
g Capital management The investment objective of the Company is to provide Shareholders with consistent longterm capital growth through an investment policy of investing substantially all of its assets in AllBlue or any successor vehicle to AllBlue.
As the Companys Ordinary Shares are traded on the LSE, the Ordinary Shares may trade at a discount to their NAV per Share.
However, in structuring the Company, the Directors have given detailed consideration to the discount risk and how this may be managed.
At the last Annual General Meeting held pursuant to section 199 of the 2008 Law, the Directors were granted authority to buy back up to 14.99 per cent of the Ordinary Shares in issue.
The Companys authority to make purchases of its own issued Ordinary Shares will expire at the conclusion of the next general meeting of the Company to be held pursuant to section 199 of the 2008 Law and renewal of such authority will be sought at that next general meeting.
The timing of any purchases will be decided by the Board.
The Directors intend that purchases will only be made pursuant to this authority through the market, for cash, at prices below the prevailing NAV per Share where the Directors reasonably believe such purchases will be of material benefit to the Company.
Following approval of the Court in Guernsey, the Company resolved to cancel the amount standing to the credit of its share premium account following Admission.
The amount released on cancellation has been credited as a distributable reserve in the books of account and may be used by the Company for the purpose of funding purchases of its Ordinary Shares as described above and the payment of dividends.
On 1 July 2008 The Companies Guernsey Law, 1994 as amended was replaced by the 2008 Law.
The 2008 Law does not require share premium to be held in a separate account and any premium at which Shares are issued can be used for all purposes, including the buy back of Shares and the payment of dividends, provided that the Company would after any distribution still meet the statutory Solvency Test as such is defined in the 2008 Law.
Accordingly, upon the issue of C Shares in August 2008, December 2009 and June 2010 the entire amount of share premium received on the issue of such C Shares was immediately transferred to distributable reserves.
