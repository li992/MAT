At December 2012 the fair value was 35 million net liability 18 million asset less 53 million liability.
The 11 million net liability fair value increase from 2012 is due to additional hedging of inter-company loans and deposits, external debt and legal provisions that are not designated as accounting hedges.
Fair value movements are taken to the income statement in the period to offset the exchange gains and losses on the related inter-company lending and borrowing, external debt and legal provisions.
Fair value hedges The Group has designated a series of interest rate swaps as a fair value hedge.
The risk being hedged is the variability of the fair value of the bond arising from interest rate fluctuations.
Gains and losses on fair value hedges are disclosed in Note 12, Finance expense.
The carrying value of bonds in a designated hedging relationship on page 191 includes 919 million 2012 - 970 million that is designated a hedged item in a fair value hedge relationship.
Net investment hedges During the year, certain foreign exchange contracts were designated as net investment hedges in respect of the foreign currency translation risk arising on consolidation of the Groups net investment in its European Euro and Japanese Yen foreign operations as shown in the table above.
The carrying value of bonds in a designated hedging relationship on page 191 includes 2,369 million 2012 - 2,309 million that is designated a hedging instrument in a net investment hedge relationship.
Cash flow hedges During 2013, the Group entered into forward foreign exchange contracts which it designated as cash flow hedges of its foreign exchange exposure arising on Euro and US dollar denominated coupon payments relating to the Groups European and US medium term notes.
At 31 December 2012, the Group designated a cash flow hedge of a foreign exchange exposure arising on the recognition of a liability denominated in Indian Rupee in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
In addition, the Group carries a balance in reserves that arose from pre-hedging fluctuations in long-term interest rates when pricing bonds issued during the year as disclosed in Note 32.

The maturity analysis of fixed rate debt is stated by contractual maturity and of floating rate debt by interest rate repricing dates.
For the purpose of this table, debt is defined as all classes of borrowings other than obligations under finance leases.

g Sensitivity analysis Foreign exchange and interest rate sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the assumption that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations as at 31 December.
Financial instruments affected by market risk include cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, trade receivables and payables and derivative financial instruments.
The following analyses are intended to illustrate the sensitivity of such financial instruments to changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.
Foreign exchange sensitivity The table below shows on an indicative basis only the Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange rates on its US dollar, Euro and Yen financial instruments.
These three currencies are the major foreign currencies in which GSKs financial instruments are denominated.
GSK has considered movements in these currencies and has concluded that a 10 cent or 10 yen movement in rates against Sterling is reasonable.
In this analysis, financial instruments are only considered sensitive to foreign exchange rates where they are not in the functional currency of the entity that holds them.
Obligations under finance leases, inter-company loans that are fully hedged to maturity and certain non-derivative financial instruments not in net debt are excluded as they do not present a material exposure.
Foreign exchange sensitivity on Group assets and liabilities other than financial instruments is not included in the calculation.
The movement in the income statement in the table below relates primarily to cash and cash equivalents, inter-company loans and deposits, inter-company trading balances, hedging instruments for legal provisions and trade receivables and payables which are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity that holds them.
Whilst the hedging instruments provide economic hedges, the related remeasurement of provisions is not included in the calculation.

The table below presents the Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange rates based on the composition of net debt as shown in Note 32 adjusting for the effects of foreign exchange derivatives that are not part of net debt but affect future foreign currency cash flows.
2013 2012 Increase Increase decrease in decrease in net debt net debt Impact of foreign exchange movements on net debt m m 10 cent appreciation of the US dollar 2012: 10 cent 447 460 10 cent appreciation of the Euro 2012: 10 cent 289 248 10 yen appreciation of the Yen 2012: 10 yen 10 15 An equivalent depreciation in the above currencies would have the following impact on net debt: 396 million, 244 million and 9 million for US dollar, Euro and Yen exchange rates respectively 2012 407 million, 211 million and 13 million.
Interest rate sensitivity The table below shows on an indicative basis only the Groups sensitivity to interest rates on its floating rate Sterling, US dollar and Euro financial instruments, being issued debt, bank borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and liquid investments.
GSK has considered movements in these interest rates over the last three years and has concluded that a 1% 100 basis points increase is a reasonable benchmark.
Debt and bank borrowings with a maturity of less than one year is floating rate for this calculation.
Interest rate movements on derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges are deemed to have an immaterial effect on the Group Income Statement due to compensating amounts in the carrying value of debt.
A 1% 100 basis points movement in interest rates is not deemed to have a material effect on equity.
2013 2012 Increase Increase decrease in decrease in income income Income statement impact of interest rate movements m m 1% 100 basis points increase in Sterling interest rates 2012: 1% 13 5 1% 100 basis points increase in US dollar interest rates 2012: 1% 16 1% 100 basis points increase in Euro interest rates 2012: 1% 8 12 The increase in interest income is due to higher levels of indicative cash at the balance sheet date.
These interest rates could not be decreased by 1% 100 basis points as they are currently less than 1.0%.
The maximum increase decrease in income would therefore be limited to 5 million, nil and 2 million for Sterling, US dollar and Euro interest rates respectively 2012 2 million, nil and nil.
h Contractual cash flows for non-derivative financial liabilities and derivative instruments The following tables provides an analysis of the anticipated contractual cash flows including interest payable for the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis.
The impact of interest rate swaps has been excluded.
For the purpose of this table, debt is defined as all classes of borrowings except for obligations under finance leases.
Interest is calculated based on debt held at 31 December without taking account of future issuance.
Floating rate interest is estimated using the prevailing interest rate at the balance sheet date.
Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated using spot rates at 31 December.
Contractual cash flows in respect of operating lease vacant space provisions are excluded from the table below as they are included in the Commitments under non-cancellable operating leases table in Note 40, Commitments.
