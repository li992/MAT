Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, will affect the Groups income and cash flows or the value of its financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters.
Under the management of the central treasury function, the Group enters into derivatives in the ordinary course of business and also manages financial liabilities in order to mitigate market risks.
All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Board and are undertaken only if they relate to underlying exposures.

Exchange contracts and non-sterling debt are financial instruments used as currency hedges of overseas net assets.
3.2 Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to a number of global interest rates through assets and liabilities denominated in jurisdictions to which these rates are applied, most notably US, Eurozone and UK rates.
The Group is exposed to these because market movements in these rates will increase or decrease the interest charge recognised in the Group Income Statement.
a Management of interest rate risk The Group adopts a policy of maintaining a portion of its liabilities at fixed interest rates and reviewing the balance of the floating rate exposure to ensure that if interest rates rise globally the effect on the Groups Income Statement is manageable.
Interest rates are managed using fixed and floating rate debt and financial instruments including interest rate swaps.
Floating rate liabilities comprise short-term debt which bears interest at short-term bank rates and the liability side of exchange contracts where the interest element is based primarily on three month inter-bank rates.
The Group has raised US dollar debt through the issuance of medium to long-term fixed rate loan notes.
In 1999 US$30m of this fixed rate exposure was hedged back to floating rates through the use of interest rate swaps covering loan notes with a maturity of 2014.
The interest component of the fair value of this portion of the loan notes has been designated as a hedged item and has been revalued accordingly in the accounts.
The fair value of these interest rate swaps is included in the balance sheet at 0.8m 2012: 2.1m with a corresponding uplift in the value of the debt the hedged item.
All cash surpluses are invested for short periods and are treated as floating rate investments.
Non-interest bearing financial assets and liabilities including short-term trade receivables and payables have been excluded from the two analyses overleaf.

6 Fair value Financial instruments included in financial statements are measured at either fair value or amortised cost.
The measurement of this fair value can in some cases be subjective, and can depend on the inputs used in the calculations.
The Group generally calculates its own fair values using comparable observed market prices and a valuation model using the respective and relevant market data for the instrument being valued.
6.1 Total financial assets and liabilities The table below sets out the Groups accounting classification of each class of financial assets and liabilities, and their fair values at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012.
Under IAS39, all derivative financial instruments not in a hedge relationship are classified as derivatives at fair value through the Income Statement.
The Group does not use derivatives for speculative purposes and transacts all derivatives with suitable investment grade counterparties.
All transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities.

Includes bank overdrafts of 1.7m presented in liabilities held for sale.
Valuation techniques for level 2 inputs Short-term borrowings subject to hedging arrangements of 19.0m and derivative assets and liabilities of 22.4m and 3.1m respectively are valued by Level 2 techniques.
The valuations are derived from discounted contractual cash flows using observable, and directly relevant, market interest rates and foreign exchange rates from market data providers.
Valuation techniques for level 3 inputs Contingent consideration of 8.6m and amounts payable to employees of 1.0m have been measured at fair value using significant unobservable level 3 inputs.
These amounts arose from the earn-out agreements relating to the acquisitions of AFP and NPSL, details of which are included in section 3.4.
Their fair values have been derived using a simple calculation which compares the expected performance of the AFP and NPSL businesses in their most recent forecasts with the target performances set out in the legal agreements for the acquisitions.
Given the long-term nature of the earn-out arrangements and the relatively short period that has elapsed since the businesses were acquired, the fair value of the contingent consideration of 8.6m measured at the dates of acquisition remains valid at the yearend.
The amounts payable to employees of 1.0m accrue over the duration of the earn-out period and the increase in the fair value of the amount payable from nil to 1.0m has been charged to the income statement as an exceptional item.
6.2 Valuation methodology Cash and cash equivalents, bank overdrafts, trade payables, trade receivables and other assets are carried at their book values as this approximates to their fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments.
Long-term and short-term borrowings, apart from any which are subject to hedging arrangements, are carried at amortised cost as it is the intention that they will not be repaid prior to maturity.
The fair values are evaluated by the Group based on parameters such as interest rates and relevant credit spreads.
Long-term borrowings which are subject to hedging arrangements are valued using appropriate discount rates to value the relevant hedged cash flows.
Derivative assets and liabilities, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and metal hedges, are valued using comparable observed market prices and a valuation model using foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves for the underlying commodities.
Investments are primarily in publically-quoted pooled funds held to fund overseas pension liabilities.
The fair value is based on the price quotation at the reporting date.
6.3 Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
7 Market risk sensitivity analysis on financial instruments This section shows how the fair value of financial instruments presented can change for a given change in market rates.
The values shown in the table below are estimates of the impact on financial instruments only.
The underlying risks that these financial instruments have been acquired to hedge will move in an opposite direction.
7.1 Overview In estimating the sensitivity of the financial instruments all other variables are held constant to determine the impact on profit before tax and equity.
The analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice market rates rarely change in isolation.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimates due to the movements in the underlying transactions, actions taken to mitigate any potential losses, the interaction of more than one sensitivity occurring, and further developments in global financial markets.
As such this table should not be considered as a projection of likely future gains and losses in these financial instruments.
7.2 Financial instruments sensitivity table The outputs from the sensitivity analysis are estimates of the impact of market risk assuming that the specified changes occur only to the financial instruments and do not reflect the opposite movement from the impact of the specific change on the underlying business that they are designed to hedge.
