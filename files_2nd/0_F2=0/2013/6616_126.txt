The table below provides an analysis of the anticipated contractual cash flows for the Groups derivative instruments, excluding embedded derivatives and equity options which are not material, using undiscounted cash flows.
Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated using spot rates at 31 December.
The gross cash flows of foreign exchange contracts are presented for the purposes of this table, though, in practice, the Group uses standard settlement arrangements to reduce its liquidity requirements on these instruments.
The amounts receivable and payable in less than one year have increased compared to 31 December 2012 due to higher levels of hedging of inter-company loans and external debt.
This is reflected in the increased principal amounts shown in the table below.

In addition, GSK operates the Performance Share Plan, whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GlaxoSmithKline plc at no cost, subject to the achievement by the Group of specified performance targets and the Share Value Plan, whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GlaxoSmithKline plc at no cost after a three year vesting period.
The granting of restricted share awards has replaced the granting of options to employees as the cost of the scheme more readily equates to the potential gain to be made by the employee.
Grants under share option schemes are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
Grants of restricted shares and share awards are normally exercisable at the end of the three year vesting performance period.
Grants under savings-related share option schemes are normally exercisable after three years saving.
Grants under share option schemes and awards under the Performance Share Plan are normally granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GSK plc but in some circumstances will be settled in cash.
Options under the share option schemes were granted at the market price ruling at the date of grant.
In accordance with UK practice, the majority of options under the savings-related share option schemes are granted at a price 20% below the market price ruling at the date of grant.
Share options awarded to the Directors and the CET are subject to performance criteria.
Option pricing For the purposes of valuing options and awards to arrive at the share based payment charge, the Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used.
The assumptions used in the model for 2011, 2012 and 2013 are as follows: 2013 2012 2011 Risk-free interest rate 0.7% 0.1% 0.5% 0.5% 1.9% Dividend yield 5.3% 5.2% 5.8% Volatility 20% 18% 23% 24% 28% Expected lives of savings-related share options and share award schemes 3-4 years 3-4 years 3-4 years Weighted average share price for grants in the year: Shares 16.14 14.35 11.90 ADS $50.49 $45.57 $39.10 0% for those plans where dividends are reinvested.
198 GSK Annual Report 2013 42 Employee share schemes continued Volatility is determined based on the three and five year share price history where appropriate.
The fair value of performance share plan grants take into account market conditions.
Expected lives of options were determined based on weighted average historic exercises of options.
There has been no change in the effective exercise price of any outstanding options during the year.

The percentage of each award that vests is based upon the performance of the Group over a defined measurement period with dividends reinvested during the same period.
For awards granted from 2011 onwards to Directors and members of the CET, the performance conditions are based on four equally weighted measures over a three year performance period.
The first measure is based on the achievement of adjusted free cash flow targets.
The second measure is based on relative TSR performance against a comparator group.
The remaining two measures are based on business-specific performance measures on business diversification and R&D new product performance.
For details on the calculation of these measures, see the Remuneration Report on pages 96 to 126.
For awards granted in 2009 and 2010 to Directors and members of the CET, 40% of the award is based on the achievement of adjusted free cash flow targets over a three year measurement period.
The remaining 60% of the award is based on relative TSR performance against a comparator group.
Half of the TSR element of each award is measured over three years and half over four years.
For those awards made to all other eligible employees the performance conditions consist of two parts, each of which applies to 50% of the award.
The first part of the performance condition compares GSKs EPS growth to the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index over the three year measurement period.
The second part of the performance condition is based on strategic or operational business measures, over a three year measurement period, specific to the employees business area.
The fair value of the awards is determined based on the closing share price on the day of grant.
For TSR performance elements, this is adjusted by the likelihood of that condition being met, as assessed at the time of grant.

Share Value Plan The Group operates a Share Value Plan whereby awards are granted, in the form of shares, to certain employees at no cost.
The awards vest after three years and there are no performance criteria attached.
The fair value of these awards is determined based on the closing share price on the day of grant, after deducting the expected future dividend yield over the duration of the award.

The trustees of the ESOP Trusts purchase shares on the open market with finance provided by the Group by way of loans or contributions.
Costs of running the ESOP Trusts are charged to the income statement.
Shares held by the ESOP Trusts are deducted from other reserves and held at the value of proceeds receivable from employees on exercise.
If there is deemed to be a permanent diminution in value this is reflected by a transfer to retained earnings.
The Trusts also acquire and hold shares to meet notional dividends re-invested on deferred awards under the SmithKline Beecham Mid-Term Incentive Plan.
The trustees have waived their rights to dividends on the shares held by the ESOP Trusts.
