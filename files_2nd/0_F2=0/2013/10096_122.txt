Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and accounts 2013 SECTION 5 CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING continued 52 weeks ended 28 December 2013 5.2 Borrowings continued Terms and debt repayment schedule This table provides information about the contractual terms of the Groups interest-bearing loans and borrowings, showing both the principal and carrying values, which are measured at amortised cost.
For more information about the Groups exposure to interest rate, liquidity, foreign currency and credit risks, see note 5.6.

Reflecting managements judgement that this is a non-substantive change to an existing facility, the Group accounted for this on a continuation accounting basis.
At the reporting date the amended terms of the borrowings provide no clear commercial incentive or contractual commitment to repay them over a specific period that is shorter than the contractual life of the facility and accordingly the Group calculates its effective interest rate and hence amortises transaction costs based on the contractual term of the facility.
The loans are secured by fixed charges over the shares in certain Group companies and certain intra-group receivables.
The nominal interest rate for secured bank loans in the table above represents the floating interest rate, including applicable margin, which prevailed at the reporting date.
The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge its interest rate exposure and these are described in note 5.4.
5.3 Lease obligations Accounting policies Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance leases.
Where land and buildings are held under finance leases the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings.
Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Finance lease payments Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Operating lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received and predetermined non-contingent rent increases are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense over the lease term.
Lease arrangements The Group undertook a sale and leaseback transaction during 2007, involving the property, plant and equipment of certain attractions.
The leases entered into are accounted for as finance or operating leases depending on the specific circumstances of each lease.
113 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and accounts 2013 SECTION 5 CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING continued 52 weeks ended 28 December 2013 5.3 Lease obligations continued Each of these lease agreements runs for a period of 35 years from inception and allows for annual rent increases based on the inflationary index in the United Kingdom and fixed increases in Continental Europe.
The Group has the option, but is not contractually required, to extend each of the lease agreements individually for two further terms of 35 years, subject to an adjustment to market rates at that time.
During 2012 the Group undertook a sale and leaseback transaction of the LEGOLAND Windsor Hotel.
The lease entered into is being accounted for as an operating lease.
The gain on the sale is deferred over the 35 year lease term, as the lease was not at fair value.
In addition, the Group also enters into operating leases for a number of its premises.
These leases are typically of a duration of between ten and 60 years, with rent increases generally determined based on local market practice.
The key contractual terms in relation to each lease are considered when calculating the rental charge over the lease term.
During 2013 83 million 2012: 76 million was recognised as an expense in the income statement in respect of operating leases.
The tables below set out the total lease obligations for the Group: Finance leases These tables provide information about the future minimum lease payments and contractual terms of the Groups finance lease liabilities, as follows: Present Present Future value of Future value of minimum minimum minimum minimum lease lease lease lease payments Interest payments payments Interest payments 2013 2013 2013 2012 2012 2012 m m m m m m 6 6 - 6 6 - Less than one year 26 26 - 24 24 - Between one and five years 259 174 85 254 170 84 More than five years 291 206 85 284 200 84 Nominal Year of 2013 2012 Currency interest rate maturity m m Finance lease liabilities GBP 5.64% 2042 54 54 Finance lease liabilities EUR 9.11% 2042 31 30 85 84 The nominal interest rate for finance leases in the table above represents the weighted average effective interest rate.
This is used because the table above aggregates finance leases with the same maturity date and currency.
