Franchise commitments comprise 51.4m dilapidation provisions on vehicles, properties, depots and stations across our three active rail franchises.
Of the dilapidation provisions, 26.6m are classified as current.
The provisions are based on managements assessment of most probable outcomes, supported where appropriate by valuations from professional external advisers.
During the year 12.0m has been released following the successful renegotiation of certain contract conditions, offset by ongoing provisions on other contracts.
The dilapidations will be incurred in order to meet the hand back requirements over the remaining period of the franchise, which is within the next one to two years.
Uninsured claims represent the cost to the Group to settle claims for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date based on an assessment of the expected settlement, together with an estimate of settlements that will be made in respect of incidents that have not yet been reported to the Group by the insurer, subject to the overall stop loss.
Of the uninsured claims, 17.6m are classified as current and 32.0m are classified as non-current based on past experience of uninsured claims paid out annually.
It is estimated that the majority of uninsured claims will be settled within the next six years.
Within other provisions, 2.0m relates to dilapidations of which 0.3m are classified as current, and 1.7m are classified as non-current.
Both provisions relate to the Bus division.
It is expected that the dilapidations will be incurred within the next two to three years.
The remaining other current provision of 0.9m relates to completion claims regarding the sale of our aviation business.
