Exchange differences arising on translation are taken directly to the profit and loss account to the extent that the Company is exposed to exchange differences arising on such assets and liabilities.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the result for the year at current rates of tax and takes into account deferred tax.
Full provision for deferred tax, without discounting, is made for all timing differences that have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
Consolidated accounts Separate consolidated accounts have been prepared and are presented on pages 79 to 134.
Subsidiary and associated undertakings Investments in subsidiary and associated undertakings are stated in the balance sheet of the Company at cost less any provisions for permanent diminution in value.
A list of principal subsidiaries is set out in note 34 on page 134.
Investment income Interest on deposits and interest-bearing investments is credited as it is earned.
