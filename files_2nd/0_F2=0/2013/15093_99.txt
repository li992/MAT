Within this amount, 340m was identified as intangible assets and goodwill, of which the directors believe that 187m should be deductible against taxable profits over the useful economic lives of the respective assets.
This gave rise to 52.4m of the exceptional deferred income tax credit booked in 2010.
Based on this the directors consider that the Groups future cash tax expense should be reduced by approximately 3.3m per annum using the corporation tax rate of 23%.
The Groups income tax expense on underlying profit of 13.4m represents an effective tax rate of 25.7% for the period ended 28 April 2013.
The Groups underlying effective tax rate of 25.7% is higher than the statutory rate of 23.92%, primarily due to depreciation of non-qualifying assets and non-allowable expenses.
The UK corporation tax rate reduction from 24% to 23%, with effect from 1 April 2013, is substantially enacted at the balance sheet date so the deferred income tax balances at 28 April 2013 have been remeasured resulting in an exceptional deferred tax charge of 1.5m.
In addition to the changes in rates of corporation tax disclosed above, further changes to the UK corporation tax rates were announced in the 2012 Autumn Statement and the March 2013 Budget.
These include further reductions to the main rate to reduce the rate to 21% from 1 April 2014 and to 20% from 1 April 2015.
These changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not included in these financial statements.
The reductions to the main rate of corporation tax were substantively enacted as part of the Finance Act 2013.
The overall effect of these further changes, if applied to the deferred income tax balance at the balance sheet date, would be to further reduce the deferred income tax asset by an additional 4.2m.
Discussions with HMRC in respect of the tax deductible goodwill arising on the March 2010 reorganisation are ongoing.
Written confirmation has been received from HMRC that they will not challenge the commercial nature of the transactions.
The related deferred income tax asset in respect of the goodwill therefore continues to be considered recoverable.
