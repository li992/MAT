118 Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
Operating Segments The Group has two reportable segments, Retail and Car Servicing, which are the Groups strategic business units.
Car Servicing became a reporting segment of the Group as a result of the acquisition of Nationwide Autocentres on 17 February 2010.
The strategic business units offer different products and services, and are managed separately because they require different operational, technological and marketing strategies.
The operations of the Retail reporting segment comprise the retailing of automotive, leisure and cycling products through retail stores.
The operations of the Car Servicing reporting segment comprise car servicing and repair performed from autocentres.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Executive Directors.
Internal management reports for each of the segments are reviewed by the Executive Directors on a monthly basis.
Key measures used to evaluate performance are Revenue and Operating Profit.
Management believes that these measures are the most relevant in evaluating the performance of the segment and for making resource allocation decisions.
The following summary describes the operations in each of the Groups reportable segments.
Performance is measured based on segment operating profit, as included in the management reports that are reviewed by the Executive Directors.
These internal reports are prepared in accordance with IFRS accounting policies consistent with these Group Financial Statements.
All material operations of the reportable segments are carried out in the UK and all material non-current assets are located in the UK.
The Groups revenue is driven by the consolidation of individual small value transactions and as a result Group revenue is not reliant on a major customer or group of customers.
All revenue is from external customers.

This expense related to the creation of a provision for the potential liabilities arising from lease guarantees provided by Halfords prior to July 1989.
The guarantees were provided to landlords of properties leased by Payless DIY now part of Focus DIY when both Halfords and Payless DIY were under ownership of the Ward White Group.
Focus DIY entered into administration in May 2011.
In the current year the continued settlement of the Groups guarantor obligations has resulted in a release of 1.0m 2012: 1.9m of the original amounts provided.
b A charge incurred in the period relating to stores where the present value of expected future cash flows is deemed to be insufficient to cover the lower of cost of exit or value in use.
c Impairment charge in respect of property, plant and equipment where the carrying amount of these assets has been deemed to exceed the recoverable amount.
d The tax charge of 0.1m represents a tax rate of 24% applied to non-recurring items after adjusting for the non-deductibility of the asset impairment charge and settlements to release Halfords from its guarantor obligations under the leases.
The prior period represents a tax charge at 26% on all current year non-recurring items plus a prior year tax charge of 0.4m arising from the non-deductibility of two payments made to landlords to release Halfords from its guarantor obligations under those leases.

This will reduce the Companys future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax asset at 29 March 2013 has been calculated based on the rate of 23% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The March 2013 Budget announced that the rate will further reduce to 20% by 2015 in addition to the planned reduction to 21% by 2014 previously announced in the December 2012 Autumn Statement.
It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further 3% rate reduction, although this will further reduce the Companys future current tax charge and reduce the Companys deferred tax asset accordingly.
In this financial period, the UK corporation tax standard rate was 24% 2012: 26%.
The effective tax rate of 25.7% 2012: 27.3% differs from the UK corporation tax rate principally due to the non-deductibility of depreciation charged on capital expenditure and other permanent differences arising in the period.
The tax charge of 18.3m 2012: 25.7m includes a charge of 0.1m 2012: 0.9m in respect of tax on non-recurring items, as detailed in note 5.
An Income tax charge of 0.7m 2012: 0.3m on other comprehensive income relates to the fair value of forward currency contracts outstanding at the year end.
No other items within other comprehensive income have a tax impact.
The Group engages openly and proactively with tax authorities both in the UK and internationally where the Group trades and sources products.
The Groups Tax Policy is reviewed annually by the Board and is shared with HM Revenue & Customs HMRC.
The Group is fully committed to complying with all of its tax payment and reporting obligations throughout the business.
In FY13 the contribution to the UK Exchequer from both taxes paid and collected exceeded 147.2m with the main taxes including corporation tax 16.9m, net VAT 61.8m, PAYE 16.3m, Employees National Insurance Contributions 7.9m, Employers National Insurance Contributions 10.1m and Business Rates 34.2m.

It will be paid on 2 August 2013 to shareholders who are on the register of members on 5 July 2013.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
The weighted average number of shares excludes shares held by an Employee Benefit Trust see note 20 and has been adjusted for the issue purchase of shares during the period.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the 52 weeks to 29 March 2013.
The Group has also chosen to present an alternative earnings per share measure, with profit adjusted for non-recurring items because it better reflects the Groups underlying performance.

Goodwill of 253.1m 2012: 253.1m arose on the acquisition of Halfords Holdings Limited by the Company on 31 August 2002 and is allocated to the Retail segment.
The goodwill relates to a portfolio of sites within the UK which management monitors on an overall basis as a group of cash-generating units.
Goodwill of 69.7m arose on the acquisition of Nationwide Autocentres on 17 February 2010 and is allocated to the Car Servicing segment.
The goodwill relates to a portfolio of centres within the UK which management monitors on an overall basis as a group of cash-generating units being Car Servicing.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Nationwide Autocentres is attributable to a future income to be generated from new retail, fleet customer contracts and related relationships, b the workforce, c the value of immaterial other intangible assets and d operating synergies.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined based on value-in-use calculations for each of the two groups of cash-generating units, being Retail and Car Servicing.
This is the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, which is not higher than the Groups operating segments as reported in note 1.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three-year period with growth no higher than past experience and after consideration of all available information, incorporating the strategies and risks of each segment.
The key assumptions, to which the group of cash-generating units recoverable amounts are most sensitive, used to determine value-in-use of goodwill held at 29 March 2013 and 30 March 2012 are as follows: Retail Car Servicing Notes 2013 2012 2013 2012 Discount rate 1 8.1% 10.5% 9.0% 10.8% Growth rate 2 0.0% 0.0% 1.0% 0.0% Notes: 1 Pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections.
2 Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three year budget period.
The Directors are confident that a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions, including a - 1.0% change in the discount rate, would not cause the carrying amounts to exceed the recoverable amounts.

Property related provisions consist of costs associated with vacant property, rent reviews and dilapidations.
Also included are prior period non-recurring costs note 5 relating to liabilities in respect of previous assignments of leases where the lessee has entered into administration subsequent to the period end.
Other trading provisions comprise a sales returns provision and a provision for the costs associated with the cessation of the stand-alone cycle concept, including closure of stores where necessary.
Restructuring provisions A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly.
Future operating losses are not provided for.
Key assumptions within the Central Europe exit provision were the timing of the exit from leases that were contracted into, the timing of redundancies and the extent of dilapidation costs.
The sensitivities to these assumptions were not considered material due to the time value of money being minimal over the period over which the costs would be incurred.
Property related provisions A provision for vacant properties is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract.
Before a provision is established, the Group recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.
The main uncertainty is the timing of the amounts payable, and the time value of money has been incorporated into the provision amount to take account of this sensitivity.
Provision is also made for loss-making stores and autocentres which management does not expect to become profitable.
A rent review provision is recognised when there are expected to be additional obligations as a result of the rent review, which forms part of the Groups unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the lease contracts.
The provision is based on managements best estimate of the rent payable after the review.
Key uncertainties are the estimate of the rent payable after the review has occurred.
Sensitivity to this uncertainty is not expected to be material to the provision in total.
A dilapidations provision is recognised when there is an expectation of future obligations relating to the maintenance of leasehold properties arising from events such as lease renewals or terminations.
Key uncertainties are the estimates of amounts due.

The Treasury Committee meets quarterly to monitor the performance of the Treasury function.
Policies for managing financial risks are governed by Board approved policies and procedures, which are reviewed on an annual basis.
The Groups debt management policy is to provide an appropriate level of funding to finance the Business Plan over the medium term at a competitive cost and ensure flexibility to meet the changing needs of the Group.
Details of the Groups current borrowing facilities are contained in note 15.
The key risks that the Group faces from a treasury perspective are as follows: Market Risk The Groups exposure to market risk predominantly relates to interest, currency and commodity risk.
These are discussed further below.
Commodity risk is due to the Groups products being manufactured from metals and other raw materials, subject to price fluctuation.
The Group mitigates this risk through negotiating fixed purchase costs or maintaining flexibility over the specification of finished products produced by its supply chain to meet fluctuations.
com Annual Report & Accounts 2013 131 Interest Rate Risk The Groups policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within the constraints of the Business Plan and its financial covenants.
The Groups borrowings are currently subject to floating rate interest rates and the Group will continue to monitor movements in the swap market.
If interest rates on floating rate borrowings i. e. cash and cash equivalents and bank borrowings which attract interest at floating rates were to change by or 1% the impact on the results in the Income Statement and equity would be a decrease increase of 1.0m 2012: 1.2m.
Interest rate movements on deposits, obligations under finance leases, trade payables, trade receivables, and other financial instruments do not present a material exposure to the Groups balance sheet.
Capital Risk Management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Between April 2011 and April 2012, the Group managed its capital structure partly through a share buy-back scheme.
The Group manages capital by operating within debt ratios.
These ratios are lease adjusted net debt to Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation EBITDA and fixed charge cover.
Lease adjusted net debt is calculated as being net debt and leases capitalised at eight times, as a multiple of EBITDA plus operating lease charges.
Fixed charge cover is calculated as being EBITDA plus operating lease charges as a multiple of interest and operating lease charges.
Fair Value Disclosures The fair values of each class of financial assets and liabilities is the carrying amount, based on the following assumptions: Trade receivables, trade payables and The fair value approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these finance lease obligations, short-term instruments, using an interest rate of 7.1% for long-term finance lease obligations.
deposits and borrowings Long-term borrowings The fair value of bank loans and other loans approximates to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet as the majority are floating rate where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
Forward currency contracts The fair value is determined using the market forward rates at the reporting date and the outright contract rate.
Fair Value Hierarchy Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels: Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All financial instruments carried at fair value have been measured by a Level 2 valuation method.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are as follows: 2013 2012 m m Cash and cash equivalents 7.9 13.4 Loans and receivables 22.3 14.9 Forward exchange contracts used for hedging assets 1.9 0.3 Total financial assets 32.1 28.6 Trade and other payables held at amortised cost 121.6 109.9 Borrowings at amortised cost 104.0 141.0 Finance leases 11.2 11.5 Total financial liabilities 236.8 262.4 Trade and other payables within the scope of IAS 39 include all trade payables, all other payables and 30.6m 2012: 23.6m of accruals and deferred income.
com Annual Report & Accounts 2013 132 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 19.
Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures continued Credit Risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was 32.1m 2012: 28.6m as detailed in the table above.
Foreign Currency Risk The Group has a significant transaction exposure with increasing, direct sourced purchases from its suppliers in the Far East, with most of the trade being in US dollars.
The Groups policy is to manage the foreign exchange transaction exposures of the business to ensure the actual costs do not exceed the budget costs by more than 10% excluding increases in the base cost of the product.
The Group does not hedge either economic exposure or the translation exposure arising from the profits, assets and liabilities of non-sterling businesses whilst they remain immaterial.
During the 52 weeks to 29 March 2013, the foreign exchange management policy was to hedge via forward contract purchase between 75% and 80% of the material foreign exchange transaction exposures on a rolling 12-month basis.
Hedging is performed through the use of foreign currency bank accounts and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The carrying amount of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date is as follows: 29 March 2013 30 March 2012 USD Other USD Other m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 0.4 4.8 1.0 Trade and other payables 15.9 0.5 15.4 0.3 15.9 0.1 10.6 0.7 The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange rates on its US dollar financial instruments, the major currency in which the Groups derivatives are denominated.
2013 2012 Increase Increase decrease decrease in equity in equity m m 10% appreciation of the US dollar 4.1 10.2 10% depreciation of the US dollar 3.3 8.5 A strengthening weakening of sterling, as indicated, against the USD at 29 March 2013 would have increased decreased equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown above.
This analysis is based on foreign currency exchange rate variances that the Group considered to be reasonably possible at the end of the reporting period.
The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
There are no material movements in the income statement.
The movements in equity relates to the fair value movements on the Groups forward contracts that are used to hedge future stock purchases.
Pension Liability Risk The Group has no association with any defined-benefit pension scheme and therefore carries no deferred, current or future liabilities in respect of such a scheme.
The Group operates a number of Group Personal Pension Plans for colleagues.
com Annual Report & Accounts 2013 133 Liquidity Risk The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash or loan facilities to meet all its commitments when they fall due by ensuring that there is sufficient cash or working capital facilities to meet the cash requirements of the Group for the current Business Plan.
The minimum liquidity level is currently set at 30m, such that under Treasury Policy the maximum drawings would be 270m of the 300m available facility.
The process to manage the risk is to ensure there are contracts in place for key suppliers, detailing the payment terms, and for providers of debt, the Group ensured that such counterparties used for credit transactions held at least an A credit rating at the time of refinancing November 2010.
Ancillary business, in the main, is directed to the five banks within the club banking group.
At the year-end four of the banks within this group maintained a credit rating of Aor above, in line with Treasury Policy.
The counterparty credit risk is reviewed in the Treasury report, which is forwarded to the Treasury Committee and the Treasurer reviews credit exposure on a daily basis.
The risk is measured through review of forecast liquidity each month by the Treasurer to determine whether there are sufficient credit facilities to meet forecast requirements, and through monitoring covenants on a regular basis to ensure there are no significant breaches, which would lead to an Event of Default.
Calculations are submitted bi-annually to the club bank agent.
There have been no breaches of covenants during the reported periods.
The contractual maturities of finance leases are disclosed in note 11.
All trade and other payables are due within one year.
The contractual maturity of bank borrowings, including estimated interest payments and excluding the impact of netting agreements is shown below: 29 March 2013 30 March 2012 Bank Bank borrowings borrowings m m Due less than one year 3.6 4.0 Expiring between 1 and 2 years 106.3 4.0 Expiring between 2 and 5 years 143.5 Expiring after 5 years Contractual cash flows 109.9 151.5 Carrying amount 103.3 138.6 The following table provides an analysis of the anticipated contractual cash flows for the Groups forward currency contracts.

Share Based Payments The Group has four share award plans, all of which are equity-settled schemes: 1.
Halfords Company Share Option Scheme The CSOS was introduced in June 2004 and the Company has made annual grants since.
Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under option at the date of grant.
The contractual life of an option is 10 years.
Options granted will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the achievement of a three year performance condition.
For grants up to 150% of basic salary the options can only be exercised if the increase in earnings per share EPS over the period is not less than the increase in the Retail Price Index RPI plus 3.5% per year.
In the case of grants in excess of 150% of basic salary, the excess can only be exercised in full if the increase is not less than RPI plus 10% per year.
Exercise of an option is subject to continued employment.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of a peer group of companies since the IPO in June 2004.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds.
Options were valued using the BlackScholes option-pricing models.
No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.
Halfords Sharesave Scheme The SAYE is open to all employees with eligible employment service.
Options may be exercised under the scheme if the option holder completes his saving contract for a period of three years and then not more than six months thereafter.
Special provisions allow early exercise in the case of death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or because the Company or business which employs the option holder is transferred out of the Group, or in the event of a change in control, reconstruction or winding up of the Company.
Performance Share Plan The introduction of a Performance Share Plan PSP was approved at the Annual General Meeting in August 2005 awarding the Executive Directors and certain senior management conditional rights to receive shares.
Annual schemes have been approved for each year from 2005.
The extent to which such rights vest will depend upon the Companys performance over the three year period following the award date.
The vesting of 50% of the awards will be determined by the Companys relative total shareholder return TSR performance and the vesting of the other 50% by the Companys absolute EPS performance against RPI.
The Companys TSR performance will be measured against the FTSE 350 general retailers as a comparator group.
No retesting will be permitted.
The TSR element of the options granted under the schemes has been valued using a model developed by Deloitte.
The Deloitte model uses the Groups share price volatility, the correlation between comparator companies and the vesting schedule attaching to the PSP tranche rather than generating a large number of simulations of share price and TSR performance to determine the fair value of the award using a Monte Carlo model.
For 2009 awards onwards, the Committee has recommended the reinvestment of dividends earned on award shares, such shares to invest in proportion to the vesting of the original award shares.
This is in line with best practice as contained in the ABI guidelines on Executive remuneration.
Following this recommendation the shares awarded in 2010 and 2011 under the Performance Share Plan earned final dividends of 14p per share and were reinvested in shares at a cost of 2.13 per share.
Shares awarded in 2010, 2011 and 2012 under the PSP earned interim dividends of 8p per share and were reinvested in shares at a cost of 3.54 per share.
Co-Investment Share Plan In 2012 the Company adopted the Halfords Group plc 2012 Co-Investment Plan.
This plan was adopted for the sole purpose of making a one-off award to the Groups new CEO.
No further awards either to the Groups CEO or other Executives will be made under this plan.
On 4 October 2012 the new CEO purchased 164,056 Halfords Group plc shares at a price of 302.22 pence per share and will be entitled to receive Matching Shares equivalent to a maximum of 3.5 times this investment.
Subject to continued employment these shares may vest up to a third in November 2015, up to two-thirds in November 2016 and in full in November 2017, depending on the following Threshold 30% vesting and Maximum 100% vesting share price performance by Halfords: November Threshold Maximum 2015 350p 400p 2016 385p 440p 2017 425p 485p Matching Shares have been granted in the form of nil cost options, with the participant having until the tenth anniversary of the date of grant to exercise the options, and will lapse on a pro rata basis if the required number of Investment Shares is not retained to the final vesting date.
At each relevant vesting date the participant can decide to exercise any portion of the award that has vested based on the performance at that time in which case any unvested shares in that tranche in respect of which the share price target has not been met will lapse or roll forward that tranche in full subject to performance testing at the next vesting date.
In the latter case the participant will forfeit the right to exercise any awards that had become capable of vesting at the earlier vesting date.
The Participant will be entitled to receive an amount equivalent to the dividends that would have been paid either in cash or on a reinvested basis in shares during the period from grant to exercise in respect of the number of Matching Shares that vest.
The Barrier BlackScholes Model is an adapted BlackScholes Model and is used to calculate the estimated fair values of the Co-Investment Plan Options to include the impact of the share price based performance conditions.
Using this method the fair value of the options granted has been estimated to be 1.35 per share.
The Group Income Statement charge recognised in respect of share-based payments for the current period is 0.1m 2012: 2.4m.
The following tables reconcile the number of share options outstanding and the weighted average exercise price WAEP for all share award plans except for the Co-Investment Plan, details of which are covered above.
