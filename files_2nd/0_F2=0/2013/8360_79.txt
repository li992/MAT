The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, cash flows, growth rates and margins during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The revenue growth rates are based on current Board approved budgets and forecasts and are extrapolated based on expectations of changes in the market.
The Group produces three-year plans and then projects a further year based on growth rates of 2.5%, followed by a terminal value based on a perpetuity calculated at a nominal 2.5% growth which does not exceed current market growth rates.
The rate used to discount the future cash flows is 8.5% 2012: 11.3% and is based on the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
As part of this annual review a sensitivity analysis was performed on the impairment test of each CGU, including an increase in the discount rate of up to 2.0%.
no impairment in the carrying value of the goodwill in Support Services, Equipment Services or Construction would occur as a result of adopting this sensitivity.
