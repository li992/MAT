23 i DSBP The DSBP is for senior employees whereby a percentage of any payment made under the Bonus Scheme is deferred to shares.
The percentage subject to deferral for Executive Directors was increased from 25 per cent in respect of the 2012 bonus to 50 per cent in respect of the 2013 bonus.
The scheme is detailed in the Remuneration Report on pages 75 to 91.
2013 2012 NUMBER NUMBER AT 1 JANUARY 572,459 270,246 Shares granted DSBP 146,843 317,231 Shares expired lapsed 15,018 AT 31 DECEMBER 719,302 572,459 The 2012 DSBP grant was made on 6 August 2013, based on a 5 August 2013 closing share price of 311.6p.
23 ii LTIP The LTIP is a discretionary employee share scheme.
Vesting of awards is subject to three or four-year performance conditions and is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The performance conditions of the LTIP are detailed in the Remuneration Report on pages 75 to 91.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Group, the award will lapse, unless the participant is deemed to be entitled to the award, in which case the award will be pro-rated on length of employment in relation to the award date.
In 2012, the LTIP performance period was extended from three to four years.
To avoid the position where there would be no potential vesting in 2015, transitionary arrangements were put in place: a Transitionary LTIP award based on three-year performance conditions was made in addition to the 2012 LTIP award which was based on a four-year performance period.
For both awards, the grant size was reduced by 25 per cent.
It is anticipated that subsequent awards will vest on four-year performance.
The same performance targets will apply to both awards.
The calculation of the award was based on a share price of 311.6p, the closing mid-market share price on 5 August 2013.
No consideration was paid for the grant of any award.

SHARE CAPITAL AND SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED The Black-Scholes model has been used to fair value the shares granted currently under award, apart from the 2013 TSR element of the award which uses the Monte Carlo model.
The assumptions used are as follows: DATE OF GRANT 28-APR-10 29-MAR-11 1 MAY-12 6 AUG-13 Market price used for award 314.7p 331.3p 221.1p 311.6p Risk-free interest rate 1.8% 1.8% 1.8% 1.1% Dividend yield 4.4% 4.5% 6.6% 4.7% Volatility 57.0% 54.0% 54.0% 26.0% Term of option 3 years 3 years 3 years 4 years 4 years Fair value per share 275.7p 289.0p 183.0p 171.0p 257.6p 23 iii --- SIP The SIP is an HMRC approved all-employee share plan.
UK employees, who have been employed by the Group since 1 October of the preceding year, may be awarded shares in relation to the Companys prior year performance and their salary.
In 2013, participating employees were awarded shares of seven per cent of their salary or 3,000, whichever was lower.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Group within three years from date of award the shares will be forfeited, unless the employee is entitled to the shares due to certain leaver circumstances, in which case the shares will be transferred out of the trust to the participant.
23 iv GSIP The GSIP was launched in 2008 as an all-employee share scheme for non-UK based employees.
It is not HMRC approved but the eligibility and performance conditions of the award are designed to replicate the SIP.
Employees are granted awards which are released by the Trustees at conclusion of a three-year holding period.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Group by the end of the three-year period then the award will lapse unless the participant is entitled to the award due to the terms of leaving.
Shares in respect of the GSIP are held in the SEGRO plc Employees Benefit Trust.

SHARE CAPITAL AND SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED 23 vi Sharesave The Group operates an HMRC approved all-employee savings related share option plan.
For 2013, a three-year period was offered to employees and if they remain in employment, employees can purchase shares in the Company at a price which is fixed at the start of the saving period.
The price is usually set at a 20 per cent discount to the market price.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Group, in certain circumstances the participant may be able to exercise their options within a fixed period from the date of leaving.
During 2013, the movements in Sharesave options were as follows: 2013 2012 WEIGHTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE AVERAGE NUMBER OF NUMBER OF EXERCISE EXERCISE OPTIONS PRICE OPTIONS PRICE AT 1 JANUARY 315,833 203.4p 405,930 205.6p Options granted 63,581 203.2p 220,577 188.2p Options exercised 22,683 240.7p 211,890 182.0p Options expired lapsed 41,321 209.8p 98,784 224.3p AT 31 DECEMBER 315,410 199.8p 315,833 203.4p The consideration received by the Company from options exercised during the year was 54,597 2012: 385,739.
