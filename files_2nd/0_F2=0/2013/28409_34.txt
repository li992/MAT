Strategic report Governance Remuneration Financial statements Shareholder information Provident Financial plc Financial statements Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 continued Notes to the financial statements 1 Segment reporting IFRS 8 requires segment reporting to be based on the internal financial information reported to the chief operating decision maker.
The groups chief operating decision maker is deemed to be the executive committee comprising both Peter Crook Chief Executive, and Andrew Fisher Finance Director whose primary responsibility it is to manage the groups day-to-day operations and analyse trading performance.
The groups segments comprise Vanquis Bank, CCD and Central which are those segments reported in the groups management accounts used by the executive committee as the primary means for analysing trading performance.
The executive committee assesses profit performance using profit before tax measured on a basis consistent with the disclosure in the group financial statements.

Revenue in CCD was in line with 2012 despite a 7.3% fall in average receivables due to the revenue yield strengthening to 96.0% from 89.0%.
This reflects the shift in mix of loans resulting primarily from the reduction in demand for longer duration loans which carry a lower yield than shorterterm products.
Central costs reflect the cost of the groups corporate office including legal, finance, treasury, tax, pensions, internal audit, community programme and media and corporate affairs costs.
The costs of 12.5m in 2013 were unchanged on 2012, reflecting higher share-based payment charges offset by a reduction in costs following the departure of Chris Gillespie during the year.
During the year, the group has mandatorily adopted the revised IAS 19, Employee Benefits see note 18.
The retrospective application of the revised standard has resulted in a restatement of the 2012 group and divisional profit loss before tax and exceptional items as follows: Previously reported Adjustment Restated Group m m m Vanquis Bank 68.0 68.0 CCD 125.1 2.2 122.9 Central 12.0 0.5 12.5 Total group profit before tax and exceptional items 181.1 2.7 178.4 An exceptional item of 13.7m has been incurred in 2013 relating to the cost of a business restructuring within CCD, including the redundancy costs of 12.6m associated with a headcount reduction of 520.
The exceptional cost is stated net of an exceptional curtailment credit of 1.6m associated with those employees made redundant who were part of the groups defined benefit pension scheme see note 18.
The exceptional credit in 2012 comprised: i a 17.7m curtailment credit in respect of the groups defined benefit pension scheme see note 18 : and ii a 2.1m charge relating to the impairment of goodwill in respect of Cheque Exchange Limited, a business originally acquired in 2001 and now subsumed within CCD see note 10.
All of the above activities relate to continuing operations.

The impact of this is an increase in the notional allocation of group borrowings to CCD of 28.8m 2012: 31.3m and an increase in the notional cash allocated to central activities of the same amount.
The intra-group elimination adjustment removes this notional allocation to state borrowings and cash on a consolidated group basis.
Vanquis Banks borrowings broadly equate to 80% of receivables in line with their regulatory capital requirement.
151 Financial statements Provident Financial plc continued Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Segment reporting continued The groups businesses operate principally in the UK and Republic of Ireland.
Vanquis Bank established a branch in Poland as part of a pilot credit card operation during the first half of 2012.
The revenue in respect of the branch in 2013 amounted to 2.2m 2012: 0.1m and the loss amounted to 7.6m 2012: 3.3m.
The net liabilities of the branch amounted to 9.5m at 31 December 2013 2012: 1.2m, comprising assets of 16.0m 2012: 2.8m and liabilities of 25.5m 2012: 4.0m.
These figures are included within the Vanquis Bank figures in the tables above.
The amortisation charge in 2012 excludes 2.1m of impairment of goodwill see note 10.
2 Revenue Revenue is recognised by applying the effective interest rate EIR to the carrying value of a loan.
The EIR is calculated at inception and represents the rate which exactly discounts the future contractual cash receipts from a loan to the amount of cash advanced under that loan, plus directly attributable issue costs e. g. aggregator broker fees.
In addition, in CCD the EIR takes account of customers repaying early.
Group 2013 2012 m m Interest income 962.0 888.2 Fee income 116.1 91.8 Total revenue 1,078.1 980.0 All fee income earned relates to Vanquis Bank.
Interest income relates to the interest charges on Vanquis Bank credit cards and the service charge on home credit loans.
Fee income wholly relates to Vanquis Bank and predominantly reflects default and overlimit fees as well as other ancillary income streams such as interchange income and Repayment Option Plan ROP fees.
Fee income in 2013 represented 30% 2012: 32% of Vanquis Bank revenue.

This primarily reflects the development of the retail deposits programme in Vanquis Bank during 2013.
Retail deposits represent approximately 34% of the groups funding at the end of 2013 compared with approximately 27% in 2012.
The all-in blended cost of taking retail deposits in 2013, after the cost of holding a liquid assets buffer and other liquid resources in adherence with the PRAs liquidity regime, was 3.8% 2012: 4.2%.
The group funding rate for 2014 is expected to be around 6.5%.
Interest cover continues to be one of the groups banking covenants.
It is calculated as profit before tax, interest and amortisation divided by finance costs, excluding net hedge ineffectiveness, and has a minimum requirement of 2.0 times.
Interest cover, prior to exceptional items, in 2013 was 3.7 times compared with 3.5 times in 2012.

During 2012, following a rigorous audit tender process, Deloitte LLP was appointed as auditor from 29 June 2012 and  LLP, who had been the groups auditor for a number of years, resigned.

The effective tax rate for 2013 prior to exceptional items is 22.7%, close to the UK statutory corporation tax rate which reduced from 24.0% to 23.0% on 1 April 2013.
Further changes to the UK statutory corporation tax rate were included in the Finance Act 2013 which reduce the rate from 23.0% to 21.0% from 1 April 2014 and from 21.0% to 20.0% from 1 April 2015.
The group is expected to benefit from the progressive rate reductions and the effective tax rates for future periods are expected to be similar to the UK statutory corporation tax rate.
As a result of the changes in the UK corporation tax rate, deferred tax balances have been re-measured at 20% 2012: 23% on the basis that the temporary differences on which the deferred tax balances have been calculated are expected to reverse after 1 April 2015 2012: 1 April 2013.
A tax charge of 0.7m in 2013 2012: 0.4m represents the income statement adjustment to deferred tax as a result of this change, which primarily arises as a result of revaluing the benefit of future tax deductions at the lower 20% tax rate.
An additional deferred tax credit of 0.3m in 2013 2012: charge of 0.1m has been taken directly to other comprehensive income, reflecting the change in UK corporation tax rates on items previously reflected directly in other comprehensive income.

This can be reconciled as follows: Group 2012 2013 restated m m Profit before taxation 182.4 194.0 Profit before taxation multiplied by the average standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 23.25% 2012: 24.50% 42.4 47.5 Effects of: benefit of lower tax rates overseas 0.7 1.0 impairment of goodwill not deductible for tax purposes 0.5 adjustment in respect of prior years 1.3 0.5 expenses not deductible for tax purposes, net of non-taxable income 0.3 0.1 impact of change in UK tax rate 0.7 0.4 Total tax charge 41.4 48.0 The profits of the home credit business in the Republic of Ireland have been taxed at the Republic of Ireland statutory corporation tax rate of 12.5% 2012: 12.5% rather than the UK tax rate of 23.25% 2012: 24.5%, giving rise to a beneficial impact on the group tax charge of 0.7m 2012: 1.0m.
The 1.3m credit 2012: 0.5m charge in respect of prior years arises primarily from securing tax deductions for employee share options and awards which are higher than those originally anticipated, together with the impact of agreeing prior year tax returns with tax authorities.
154 Strategic report Governance Remuneration Financial statements Shareholder information Provident Financial plc Financial statements Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 continued 6 Earnings per share The group presents basic and diluted earnings per share EPS data on its ordinary shares.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for treasury shares own shares held.
Diluted EPS calculates the effect on EPS assuming conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Dilutive potential ordinary shares are calculated as follows: i For share awards outstanding under performance-related share incentive schemes such as the Performance Share Plan PSP and the Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS, the number of dilutive potential ordinary shares is calculated based on the number of shares which would be issuable if: i the end of the reporting period is assumed to be the end of the schemes performance period: and ii the performance targets have been met as at that date.
ii For share options outstanding under non-performance related schemes such as the Save As You Earn scheme SAYE, a calculation is performed to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average annual market share price of the companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options.
The number of shares calculated is compared with the number of share options outstanding, with the difference being the dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The group also presents an adjusted EPS, excluding the impact of any exceptional items.
Reconciliations of basic and diluted earnings per share are set out below: 2013 2012 Weighted Weighted average average Per share number of Per share Earnings number of amount Earnings shares amount restated shares restated Group m m pence m m pence Earnings per share Shares in issue during the year 139.1 138.0 Own shares held 3.8 3.9 Basic earnings per share 141.0 135.3 104.2 146.0 134.1 108.9 Dilutive effect of share options and awards 2.7 2.0 2.5 2.0 Diluted earnings per share 141.0 138.0 102.2 146.0 136.6 106.9 Earnings in 2012 have been restated following the mandatory adoption and retrospective application of the amended IAS 19, Employee Benefits from 1 January 2013.
The directors have elected to show an adjusted earnings per share prior to exceptional items see note 1.
This is presented to show the earnings per share generated by the groups underlying operations.

This growth is higher than the 9.9% growth in profit before tax and exceptional items principally due to the fall in the corporation tax rate from 24% to 23% on 1 April 2013.

If approved by the shareholders at the annual general meeting on 8 May 2014, this dividend will be paid on 20 June 2014 to shareholders who are on the register of members at 23 May 2014.
This dividend is not reflected in the balance sheet as at 31 December 2013 as it is subject to shareholder approval.
As a result of adjusted EPS growth of 11.6% in 2013, the directors have proposed an increase in the final dividend of 11.6% which, together with the 7.6% increase in the interim dividend, makes a total full-year dividend increase of 10.1%.
Accordingly, dividend cover, prior to exceptional items, in 2013 was 1.32 times, compared with the minimum target of 1.25 times.
8 Directors remuneration The remuneration of the directors, who are the key management personnel of the group, is set out below in aggregate for each of the categories specified in IAS 24, Related party disclosures.
Further information in respect of directors remuneration, share options and awards, pension contributions and pension entitlements is set out in the directors remuneration report on pages 108 to 130.

It does not include the 9,000 self-employed agents within CCD.
The 4% reduction in CCD employee numbers reflects the business restructuring which took place during 2013.
Vanquis Bank employee numbers have increased by 25% during 2013 due to the growth of the business, including the continued expansion of the second contact centre in CCDs head office in Bradford.

The increase in the share-based payment charge from 6.4m in 2012 to 7.4m in 2013 primarily reflects the impact of prior year provision releases in 2012 following lower than expected vesting levels from the 2009 Long Term Incentive Scheme.

Revenue is recognised on the net value of the receivable after deduction for impairment and not on the gross receivable prior to impairment.
Revenue, impairment and receivables example for home credit The simple examples below illustrate the calculation of the receivables balance within the home credit business of CCD and its interaction with revenue and impairment.
Within the home credit business, loans are deemed impaired when two payments are missed within a 12-week cycle.
The following examples are based on a 100 loan with a total amount payable of 182 over 52 weeks which equates to a weekly payment of 3.50.
The effective interest rate EIR applied to the loan is 2.5597% per week.
In the first example, the customer pays in full in line with the loan agreement and in the second example the customer does not repay the full amount due.
Customer pays to contract for four weeks, misses two payments and then pays 2.00 per week 1.
Where the customer pays to contract, the revenue of 82.00 equals the service charge on the loan.
In the second example, the customer pays to contract for four weeks, misses two payments and then pays 2.00 per week for 50 weeks but then nothing thereafter.
Cash collected amounts to 114.00 compared with the contractual amount due of 182.00.
Revenue in this example is 59.03 and impairment is 45.03 which results in revenue less impairment of 14.00.
The above are simple examples produced to show the mechanics of how revenue and impairment within home credit works and are for illustrative purposes only.
They ignore the impact of early settlement rebates on the calculation of the EIR and are not based on actual impairment rates used by the home credit business.

CCD receivables comprise 738.2m in respect of the home credit business 2012: 869.6m, 1.8m in respect of Satsuma 2012: nil and nil in respect of the collect-out of the Real Personal Finance receivables book 2012: 0.9m.
Home credit receivables showed a 15.1% fall in 2013 reflecting the combination of weaker demand, tighter credit standards and lower customer recruitment.
162 Strategic report Governance Remuneration Financial statements Shareholder information Provident Financial plc Financial statements Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 continued 14 Amounts receivable from customers continued The average effective interest rate for the year ended 31 December 2013 was 32% for Vanquis Bank 2012: 33% and 110% for CCD 2012: 105%.
The average period to maturity of the amounts receivable from customers within CCD is 6.0 months 2012: 6.0 months.
Within Vanquis Bank, there is no fixed term for repayment of credit card loans other than a general requirement for customers to make a monthly minimum repayment towards their outstanding balance.
For the majority of customers, this is currently the greater of 1.5% of the amount owed plus any fees and interest charges in the month and 5.
The fair value of amounts receivable from customers is approximately 2.3 billion 2012: 2.1 billion.
Fair value has been derived by discounting expected future cash flows net of collection costs at the groups weighted average cost of capital at the balance sheet date.
There are no accounts loans within Vanquis Bank which are past due but not impaired.
In home credit, past due but not impaired balances relate to loans which are contractually overdue.
However, contractually overdue loans are not deemed to be impaired unless the customer has missed two or more cumulative weekly payments in the previous 12-week period since only at this point do the expected future cash flows from loans deteriorate materially.
The broadly unchanged arrears profile in Vanquis Bank reflects delinquency remaining stable at record lows for the business against the backdrop of an improving UK employment market.
The arrears profile in CCD has been relatively stable over a number of years.
The marginal improvement in 2013 reflects the benefit from the implementation of standardised arrears and collections processes combined with tighter credit standards in the fourth quarter of the year.
The following table sets out the ageing analysis of past due but not impaired balances within the home credit business of CCD based on contractual arrears since the inception of the loan: Group 2013 2012 Ageing analysis of past due but not impaired balances m m One week overdue 63.3 90.7 Two weeks overdue 19.2 20.6 Three weeks or more overdue 16.9 26.7 Past due but not impaired 99.4 138.0 Impairment in Vanquis Bank is deducted from the carrying value of amounts receivable from customers by the use of an allowance account.
The movement in the allowance account during the year is as follows: Group 2013 2012 Vanquis Bank allowance account m m At 1 January 91.4 62.4 Charge for the year 129.4 95.9 Amounts written off during the year 99.4 71.2 Amounts recovered during the year 7.4 4.3 At 31 December 128.8 91.4 163 Financial statements Provident Financial plc continued Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Notes to the financial statements continued 14 Amounts receivable from customers continued The core customer IT platform within the home credit business of CCD is cash based.
This reflects the fact that the business provides a product whereby all charges are fixed at the outset through the service charge and the focus of the business is on collecting cash.
As a result, the system records the total contractual outstanding amount due from a customer comprising the amount lent to the customer plus the service charge on the loan less cash repayments to date.
The system does not accrue interest revenue as is the case with Vanquis Bank and more mainstream lenders.
In order to translate the cash transactions from the core home credit customer IT platform into an IFRS receivables balance, a separate database is used.
IFRS permits revenue and impairment to be performed on a portfolio basis.
Accordingly, home credits loans are allocated into portfolios based on their product length.
Initial recognition within each portfolio is the cash amount advanced to customers.
Revenue is applied to each portfolio as a whole based on the effective interest rate of that product.
Weekly cash repayments are deducted from each portfolio as cash is collected to arrive at a carrying value.
On a weekly basis, an impairment review is conducted.
Accounts within individual portfolios are placed into arrears stages based on the number of weekly payments missed in the last 12 weeks.
The current carrying value of each arrears stage is then compared with the expected cash flows based on historic performance of each arrears stage discounted at the original effective interest rate the net carrying value.
The net carrying value is the carrying value to which revenue, cash repayments and impairment are applied in the future and the difference between the carrying value prior to impairment and the net carrying value is recorded as an impairment charge in the income statement.
As revenue and impairment is calculated on the net receivable, a separate gross receivable and allowance or provision account similar to Vanquis Bank and more mainstream banks is not maintained.
Vanquis Banks systems are interest bearing and allow revenue and impairment to be calculated on an account-by-account basis and, therefore, it discloses a gross receivable and an allowance account.
Whilst home credit and Vanquis Bank adopt different accounting approaches to recording receivables, the carrying value of receivables in the balance sheet and the income statement impact of revenue and impairment is not affected.
UK impairment in Vanquis Bank increased by 31.7% in 2013 compared with a 37.5% increase in UK average receivables.
This reflects the combination of a stable UK employment market and the application of consistently tight underwriting which have resulted in delinquency levels continuing to run at record lows for the business.
Impairment in CCD increased by 17.2% during 2013 and the ratio of annualised impairment to revenue increased from 33.0% in 2012 to 38.7%.
Approximately 3% of the increase is attributable to the uplift in the revenue yield with the remaining variance being due to the deterioration in the arrears profile that occurred during the first nine months of the year.
This resulted from weaker demand, as those existing customers not wishing to take further credit have less incentive to bring their accounts up to date and typically remained in mild arrears.
The impairment charge and impairment to revenue metric in CCD do not represent what is usually considered as bad debt.
Bad debt is often deemed to be the amount of principal that is not recovered on loans made.
Within the home credit business, the service charge on a loan is fixed regardless of the time taken by a customer to repay a loan.
There is no penalty interest or penalty charges.
Due to their personal circumstances and the variability of their income streams, home credit customers often take longer than the contracted period to repay their loans.
IFRS requires revenue to be recognised on the outstanding receivables at the original EIR set at the outset.
The EIR assumes that a customer pays in line with the contractual term of the loan.
Therefore, when a customer misses a payment, revenue continues to be recognised at the EIR as though penalty interest was being charged to the customer even though contractually it is not.
Because this revenue is never going to be charged to the customer, a corresponding impairment charge is made.
This gross up of revenue and impairment is illustrated in the following example.
The example is based on a 100 loan with a total amount payable of 182 over 52 weeks which equates to a weekly payment of 3.50.
The EIR applied to the loan is 2.5597% per week.
In this example, the customer pays to contract for four weeks, misses two payments and then pays 3.00 per week for the following 56 weeks.
The total amount payable of 182 is received in full but over a total period of 62 weeks instead of 52 weeks.
Revenue less impairment in this example is 82.00, consistent with a customer paying to contract.
However, because the customer took 10 more weeks to pay their loan, revenue increases to 94.34 and is offset by impairment of 12.34.
The gross up of revenue and impairment is therefore 12.34.
The above is a simple example produced to show the mechanics of how the gross up within the home credit business works and is for illustrative purposes only.
It ignores the impact of early settlement rebates on the calculation of the EIR and is not based on actual impairment rates used by the home credit business.
The income statement for the home credit business therefore includes a gross up of revenue and impairment representing the additional revenue and impairment on loans which take longer than contract to repay.
In practice, based on the total amount of cash collected against the amount lent to a customer plus the service charge on loans, bad debt in the home credit business is less than half of the 38.7% impairment to revenue metric.
164 Strategic report Governance Remuneration Financial statements Shareholder information Provident Financial plc Financial statements Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 continued 14 Amounts receivable from customers continued The impairment charge in respect of amounts receivable from customers reflected within operating costs can be analysed as follows: Group 2013 2012 Impairment charge on amounts receivable from customers m m Vanquis Bank 129.4 95.9 CCD 269.7 230.2 Total group 399.1 326.1 The impairment change in Vanquis Bank comprises 126.3m 2012: 95.9m in respect of the UK business and 3.1m 2012: nil in respect of the Polish pilot operation.
Interest income recognised on amounts receivable from customers which have been impaired can be analysed as follows: Group 2013 2012 Interest income recognised on impaired amounts receivable from customers m m Vanquis Bank 28.2 22.9 CCD 367.2 344.8 Total group 395.4 367.7 IFRS requires interest revenue to be recognised on the net carrying value of a receivable after deductions for impairment and not on the outstanding amount of the loan prior to impairment.
Using Vanquis Bank as an example, whilst interest revenue for customer statement balances is broadly calculated on the gross receivables balance of 995.4m subject to the normal suspension of interest where applicable and the timing of customer payments, interest revenue for IFRS purposes is calculated based on the net receivables balance of 866.6m, which is stated after the deduction of the impairment allowance account of 128.8m.
The non-standard customers served by the group are generally more likely to miss payments compared with more mainstream customers.
As the group recognises impairment events early after missing two weekly payments in the last 12 weeks in home credit and after missing one monthly payment in Vanquis Bank the groups level of revenue on impaired loans is comparatively high.
The currency profile of amounts receivable from customers is as follows: Group 2013 2012 Currency profile of amounts receivable from customers m m Sterling 1,545.1 1,451.0 Euro 56.2 61.0 Zloty 5.3 1.8 Total group 1,606.6 1,513.8 Euro receivables represent loans issued by the home credit business in the Republic of Ireland, and amount to 8% of CCDs receivables 2012: 7%.

a Hedging reserve movements The fair value of derivative financial instruments is required to be reflected in the balance sheet.
Generally, providing the derivative financial instruments meet certain accounting requirements, any movement in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments caused by fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates is deferred in the hedging reserve and does not impact the income statement.
The groups derivative financial instruments all currently meet these criteria.
If the interest rates payable on interest rate swaps are higher than the current interest rate at the balance sheet date, then a derivative liability is recognised.
Conversely, if the interest rates payable on interest rate swaps are lower than the current floating interest rate at the balance sheet date, then a derivative asset is recognised.
The groups US private placement borrowings denominated in US dollars are recognised in the balance sheet at the year-end exchange rate.
As these borrowings are subject to cross currency swaps which fix the translation rate of the borrowings, the difference between the borrowing based on the contracted rate of exchange and the borrowing based on the year-end rate of exchange is recorded in the hedging reserve.
The value of this adjustment at 31 December 2013 is 5.2m 2012: 5.8m.
The movement in the hedging reserve within equity as a result of the changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments can be summarised as follows: Group Company 2013 2012 2013 2012 m m m m Interest rate swaps 2.7 0.1 2.7 0.1 2004 cross-currency swaps 0.2 0.3 Foreign exchange contracts 0.2 0.4 Net credit charge to the hedging reserve 2.7 0.6 2.7 0.1 Under IFRS 7, Financial instruments: Disclosures, all derivative financial instruments are classed as Level 2 as they are not traded in an active market and the fair value is therefore determined through discounting future cash flows, using appropriate observable rates.

c Interest rate swaps The group and company use interest rate swaps in order to manage the interest rate risk on the groups borrowings.
The group has entered into various interest rate swaps which were designated and effective under IAS 39 as cash flow hedges at inception.
The movement in the fair value of effective interest rate swaps during the year was as follows: Group and company 2013 2012 m m Liability at 1 January 9.4 9.5 Credited to the hedging reserve 2.7 0.1 Liability at 31 December 6.7 9.4 The weighted average interest rate and period to maturity of the interest rate swaps held by the group and company were as follows: 2013 2012 Weighted Weighted Weighted Weighted average Range of average average Range of average interest interest period to interest interest period to rate rates maturity rate rates maturity Group and company % % years % % years Sterling 3.2 3.1-3.3 2.4 3.2 3.1-3.3 3.1 d Cross-currency swaps The group and company use cross-currency swaps in order to manage the interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk arising on the groups US private placement loan notes issued in 2003 and 2004.
2003 private placement loan notes The group and company put in place cross-currency swaps to swap the principal and fixed-rate interest of the 2003 US dollar private placement loan notes into fixed-rate sterling liabilities.
The maturity dates of the cross-currency swaps matched the underlying loan notes.
These swaps were designated as cash flow hedges and were effective under IAS 39.
The fair value movements in the swaps and the corresponding exchange rate movements on the underlying loan notes were deferred in the hedging reserve within equity.
The cross-currency swaps used to hedge the 2003 US dollar private placement loan notes also matured in 2013.
As at 31 December 2012, the cross currency swaps had an interest rate of 6.8% and a weighted average period to maturity of 0.3 years.
The movement in the fair value of the swaps can be analysed as follows: Group 2013 2012 m m Liability at 1 January 1.9 0.3 Exchange rate movement 1.9 2.2 Liability at 31 December 1.9 The difference between the translation of the 2003 US dollar private placement loan notes at the year-end exchange rate compared with the contracted exchange rate amounts to nil 2012: credit of 1.9m.
The exchange rate movement of 1.9m debit 2012: credit of 2.2m reflects the movement in the year of this difference in translation.
Corresponding entries are made within borrowings.

The maturity dates of the cross-currency swaps match the underlying loan notes.
The swaps comprise both cash flow hedges and fair value hedges.
The cash flow hedge portion of the swaps were designated as cash flow hedges and continue to be effective under IAS 39 in the year ended 31 December 2013.
The fair value movements in the swaps and the exchange movements in the underlying loan notes have been deferred in the hedging reserve within equity.
The fair value hedge portion of the swaps were designated and were effective under IAS 39 as fair value hedges during the year.
As a result, fair value movements in the swaps were charged to the income statement with a corresponding entry made to the underlying loan notes within borrowings for the effective portion of the swaps, leaving a net charge within the income statement reflecting the net fair value loss on the fair value hedge in the year.
The swaps have a range of interest rates of LIBOR 1.61% to LIBOR 1.63% 2012: LIBOR 1.61% to LIBOR 1.63% and a weighted average period to maturity of 0.6 years 2012: 1.6 years.
The movement in the fair value of the swaps can be analysed as follows: Group 2013 2012 m m Asset at 1 January 8.1 11.6 Exchange rate movement 2.5 3.2 Charged to the hedging reserve 0.2 0.3 Asset at 31 December 5.4 8.1 The difference between the translation of the 2004 US dollar private placement loan notes at the year-end exchange rate compared with the contracted exchange rate amounts to a debit of 5.2m 2012: debit of 7.7m.
The exchange rate movement of 2.5m credit 2012: credit of 3.2m reflects the movement in the year of this difference in translation.
The amount charged to the hedging reserve reflects the difference between the movement in the fair value of the cash flow hedge portion of the cross-currency swaps and the cash flow hedge portion of the exchange rate movements described above.
e Foreign exchange contracts The group uses foreign exchange contracts in order to manage the foreign exchange rate risk arising from CCDs euro operations in the Republic of Ireland and Vanquis Banks branch in Poland.
An asset of 0.1m is held in the group balance sheet as at 31 December 2013 in respect of foreign exchange contracts 2012: liability of 0.1m.
The groups foreign exchange contracts comprise forward foreign exchange contracts to buy sterling and sell euros for a total notional amount of 7.1m 2012: 6.1m and sell zloty for nil 2012: 1.4m.
These contracts have a range of maturity dates from 18 February 2014 to 16 December 2014 2012: 31 January 2013 to 15 October 2013.
These contracts were designated as cash flow hedges and were effective under IAS 39.
Accordingly, the movement in fair value of 0.2m has been credited to the hedging reserve within equity 2012: charge of 0.4m.

As at 31 December 2013, the fair value of the assets exceeded the obligation and hence a net pension asset has been recorded.
The groups defined benefit pension scheme has been substantially closed to new members since 1 January 2003.
The group operates a defined benefit scheme: the Provident Financial Staff Pension Scheme.
The scheme has been substantially closed to new members since 1 January 2003.
The scheme covers 29% of employees with company-provided pension arrangements and is of the funded, defined benefit type.
All future benefits in the scheme are now provided on a cash balance basis, with a defined amount being made available at retirement, based on a percentage of salary that is revalued up to retirement with reference to increases in price inflation.
This retirement account is then used to purchase an annuity on the open market.
The scheme also provides pension benefits that were accrued in the past on a final salary basis, but which are no longer linked to final salary.
The scheme also provides death benefits.
The scheme is a UK registered pension scheme under UK legislation and is not contracted-out of the Second State Pension.
The scheme is governed by a Trust Deed and Rules, with trustees responsible for the operation and the governance of the scheme.
The Trustees work closely with the group on funding and investment strategy decisions.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 1 June 2012 by a qualified independent actuary.
The valuation used for the purposes of IAS 19 Employee Benefits has been based on the results of the 2012 valuation, updated to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme as at the balance sheet date.
Scheme assets are stated at fair value as at the balance sheet date.
The group is entitled to a refund of any surplus, subject to tax, if the scheme winds up after all benefits have been paid.
The group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are as follows: Investment risk the liabilities for IAS 19 purposes are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields.
If the assets underperform this yield a deficit will arise.
The scheme has a long-term objective to reduce the level of investment risk by investing in assets that better match liabilities.
Change in bond yields a decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the liabilities, although this will be partly offset by an increase in matching assets.
Inflation risk part of the liabilities are linked to inflation.
If inflation increases then liabilities will increase, although this will be partly offset by an increase in assets.
As part of a long-term fide-risking strategy, the scheme will further increase its portfolio in inflation matched assets.
Life expectancies the schemes final salary benefits provide pensions for the rest of members lives and for their spouses lives.
If members live longer than assumed, then the liabilities in respect of final salary benefits increase.
172 Strategic report Governance Remuneration Financial statements Shareholder information Provident Financial plc Financial statements Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 continued 18 Retirement benefit asset continued From 1 January 2013, the group has mandatorily adopted and retrospectively applied the revised IAS 19, Employee Benefits.
The revision to the standard requires companies to change the assumed expected return on scheme assets used in the calculation of the pension charge from equities and bonds to a much more prudent expected rate of return based on highquality corporate bond rates relevant to the duration of the plan.
The retrospective application results in an increase in the pension charge and, therefore, a reduction in earnings with a corresponding adjustment to the actuarial movement on the retirement benefit asset taken through the statement of comprehensive income.
The associated deferred tax charges credits taken through the income statement and through the statement of comprehensive income have also been restated.
There is, therefore, no balance sheet impact.
The adoption of the revised IAS 19 has resulted in the groups prior year comparatives being restated as set out in the following table: 2012 Reported Adjustment Restated Group m m m Income statement statement of comprehensive income Retirement benefit charge before exceptional curtailment credit 4.2 2.7 6.9 Exceptional curtailment credit 17.7 17.7 Retirement benefit credit 13.5 2.7 10.8 Actuarial movements on retirement benefit asset 14.1 2.7 11.4 Balance sheet Retirement benefit asset 23.0 23.0 Deferred tax assets 6.1 6.1 In addition, the group has undertaken a full group review of retirement benefits within the company and its subsidiaries.
Historically, the retirement benefit asset and its cost were allocated to the company and its subsidiaries on a pro rata basis based upon the actual employer cash contributions made by each company.
However, as there is not a contractual agreement or stated policy for allocating the retirement benefit asset or its costs to each subsidiary within the group, it is considered more appropriate to recognise the full group retirement benefit asset in the financial statements of the company, as the sponsoring company, and to account for retirement benefits on a contribution basis in the subsidiaries.
The contributions made to the defined benefit pension plan by the subsidiaries are now therefore treated as a credit to the retirement benefit charge of the company.
The change in treatment, together with the adoption of the revised IAS 19, has resulted in the companys prior year comparatives being restated.
Where prior year comparatives are restated for material items, the group and the company are required to disclose a third balance sheet as at the beginning of the preceding period and an explanation of the impact of those material items on that period.
The impact of changes to IAS 19 are not material to the balance sheet of either the group or the company.
However, the impact of the change in treatment of the pension asset on the balance sheet of the company is material.
Accordingly, a third balance sheet as at 31 December 2011 has been included in addition to the current year balance sheet as at 31 December 2013 and the prior year balance sheet as at 31 December 2012.
Comparative figures in the statement of changes in shareholders equity, the retirement benefit asset note and the deferred tax note also include comparatives for both 2012 and 2011 as these are the only areas of the balance sheet affected by the change in treatment.
All other notes relating to the company include only comparatives relating to 2012 as they were not affected by the change in treatment.
The table below sets out the adjustments to the retirement benefit asset, deferred tax asset liability and retained earnings as at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011.

The weighted average duration of the scheme is approximately 20 years.
The principal actuarial assumptions used at the balance sheet date were as follows: Group and company 2013 2012 % % Price inflation RPI 3.40 3.00 Price inflation CPI 2.40 2.25 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.10 2.80 Inflationary increases to pensions in deferment 2.40 2.25 Discount rate 4.40 4.50 The pension increase assumption shown above applies to pensions increasing in payment each year in line with RPI up to 5%.
Pensions accrued prior to 2000 are substantially subject to fixed 5% increases each year.
In deferment increases prior to retirement are linked to CPI.
The mortality assumptions used in the valuation of the defined benefit pension scheme are based on the mortality experience of self-administered pension schemes and allow for future improvements in life expectancy.
In 2012, the group updated the mortality assumption following the 1 June 2012 actuarial valuation.
For IAS19, the group uses the S1PA standard tables as the basis for projecting mortality adjusted for the following factors: A 5% upwards adjustment to mortality rates for males and a 15% upwards adjustment for females is made in order to reflect lower life expectancies within the scheme compared to average pension schemes: and Future mortality improvements are in line with CMI 2013 projections with long-term trend improvements of 1.25% per annum.
In more simple terms, it is assumed that members who retire in the future at age 65 will live on average for a further 24 years if they are male 2012: 24 years and for a further 25 years if they are female 2012: 26 years.
The table below shows the sensitivity on the defined benefit obligation not including any impact on assets of changes in the key assumptions.
Depending on the scenario, there would also be compensating asset movements.

The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the group and company.
The pension charge in the consolidated income statement represents contributions paid by the group in respect of the plan and amounted to 4.3m for the year ended 31 December 2013 2012: 3.8m.
Contributions made by the company amounted to 0.4m 2012: 0.4m.
No contributions were payable to the fund at the yearend 2012: nil.
The group contributed nil to personal pension plans in the year 2012: 0.1m.
In December 2011, the Finance Act introduced the Reduced Annual Allowance, which limited the benefits that can be provided by the groups registered pension schemes on a tax-efficient basis to 50,000 in any year.
This limit is in addition to HMRCs Lifetime Allowance of 1.5m.
As a result of these limits, those affected have been provided with a number of alternative options by the group, principally: i participation in an Unfunded, Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme UURBS : ii a cash supplement payable in lieu of pension contributions payable: and iii contributions payable into a self-invested personal pension plan SIPP.
In 2013, the group has contributed 0.4m into the UURBS 2012: 0.6m, 0.1m into cash supplements 2012: 0.1m and nil into SIPPs 2012: 0.1m.
In 2013, the company has contributed 0.4m into the UURBS 2012: 0.5m and 0.1m into cash supplements 2012: 0.1m.
177 Financial statements Provident Financial plc continued Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Notes to the financial statements continued 19 Deferred tax Deferred tax is a future tax liability or asset, resulting from temporary differences or timing differences between the accounting value of assets and liabilities and their value for tax purposes.
Deferred tax arises primarily in respect of derivative financial instruments, the groups pension asset, deductions for employee share awards which are recognised differently for tax purposes and property, plant and equipment which are depreciated on a different basis for tax purposes.
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the balance sheet liability method.
As a result of the changes in the UK corporation tax rates, deferred tax balances have been re-measured at 20% 2012: 23% on the basis that the differences are expected to reverse after 1 April 2015 2012: 1 April 2013.
An additional deferred tax credit of 0.3m in 2013 2012: charge of 0.1m has been taken directly to other comprehensive income, reflecting the impact of the change in UK corporation tax rates on items previously reflected directly in other comprehensive income.

The PRA requires regulated entities to maintain a liquid assets buffer and other liquid resources to ensure they have available funds to help protect against unforeseen circumstances.
The amount of the liquid assets buffer is calculated using Individual Liquidity Guidance ILG set by the PRA based on the Individual Liquidity Adequacy Assessment ILAA prepared by Vanquis Bank.
In addition, further liquid resources must be maintained based upon daily stress tests linked to three key liquidity risks of Vanquis Bank, namely retail deposits maturities, undrawn credit card lines and operating cash flows.
This results in a dynamic liquid resources requirement, largely driven by retail deposits maturities in the following three months.
Vanquis Banks liquid assets buffer, including other liquid resources, amounts to 86.3m in 2013 2012: 52.3m and is held in a combination of UK government gilts and a designated money market fund with exposure to the UK government only.

c Interest rate and currency profile of bank and other borrowings Before taking account of the various interest rate swaps and cross-currency swap arrangements entered into by the group and company, the interest rate and foreign exchange rate exposure on borrowings is as follows: 2013 2012 Fixed Floating Total Fixed Floating Total Group m m m m m m Sterling 950.1 230.1 1,180.2 777.7 271.2 1,048.9 US dollar 41.5 41.5 90.7 90.7 Euro 56.3 56.3 61.8 61.8 Zloty 6.6 6.6 Total group 991.6 293.0 1,284.6 868.4 333.0 1,201.4 2013 2012 Fixed Floating Total Fixed Floating Total Company m m m m m m Sterling 513.0 223.7 736.7 448.3 269.2 717.5 Euro 56.3 56.3 61.8 61.8 Zloty 6.6 6.6 Total company 513.0 286.6 799.6 448.3 331.0 779.3 As detailed in note 16, the group and company have entered into various interest rate swaps and cross-currency swap arrangements to hedge the interest rate and foreign exchange rate exposures on borrowings.
After taking account of the aforementioned interest rate swaps, the groups fixed rate borrowings are 1,111.6m 2012: 988.4m and the companys fixed rate borrowings are 633.0m 2012: 568.3m.
After taking account of cross-currency swaps, the group and company have no foreign exchange rate exposure to borrowings denominated in US dollars 2012: nil.
d Senior public bonds On 23 October 2009, the company issued 250.0m of senior public bonds.
The bonds have an annual coupon of 8.0% and are repayable on 23 October 2019. e Private placement loan notes On 24 April 2003, the group issued loan notes as follows: i US$44m of 5.81% loan notes matured and repaid on 24 April 2010: and ii US$76m of 6.34% loan notes matured and repaid on 24 April 2013.

As set out in note 21 c, cross-currency swaps have been put in place to swap the proceeds and liabilities for principal and interest under the US dollar-denominated loan notes into sterling.
On 13 January 2011, the company entered into a committed 100.0m facility agreement with the Prudential M&G Investments UK Companies Financing Fund to provide a 10-year term loan which amortises between years five and 10.
The facility bears interest at rates linked to LIBOR.
The company subsequently entered into the following arrangements with third-party debt providers: 3 February 2011 10m facility agreement over a seven-year period at rates linked to EURIBOR: 4 March 2011 20m private placement loan notes over a seven-year period at rates linked to LIBOR: and 24 May 2011 14.5m private placement loan notes over a four-year period at rates linked to EURIBOR.

g Retail deposits Vanquis Bank is a PRA regulated bank and commenced taking retail deposits in July 2011.
As at 31 December 2013, 435.1m 2012: 327.4m of fixed-rate, fixed-term retail deposits of one, two, three, four and five years had been taken.
The deposits have been issued at rates of between 1.66% and 4.65%.
A reconciliation of the movement in retail deposits is set out below: Group 2013 2012 m m At 1 January 327.4 139.7 New funds received 187.7 202.4 Maturities 114.9 33.5 Retentions 31.8 16.4 Cancellations 3.2 1.1 Capitalised interest 6.3 3.5 At 31 December 435.1 327.4 h Subordinated loan notes On 15 June 2005, the company issued 100.0m of subordinated loan notes repayable on 15 June 2015.
94.0m of the liability was settled in 2009.
The rights of repayment to holders of the loan notes are subordinated to all other borrowings and liabilities of the company upon a winding up of the company and, in certain circumstances, upon its administration.
i Undrawn committed borrowing facilities The groups funding and liquidity policy is designed to ensure that the group is able to continue to fund the growth of the business.
The group therefore maintains headroom on its committed borrowing facilities to fund growth and contractual maturities for at least the following 12 months, after assuming that Vanquis Bank will fund 90% of its receivables book through retail deposits.
The undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 December were as follows: Group and company 2013 2012 m m Expiring within one year Expiring within one to two years 235.2 Expiring in more than two years 191.9 Total group and company 235.2 191.9 The table above excludes the additional capacity for Vanquis Bank to take retail deposits up to the permitted level of 90% of its receivables set by the PRA.
As a PRAregulated business, Vanquis Bank cannot lend funds to its parent as this would breach its large exposures rules.
As a result, the additional retail deposits capacity at 31 December 2013 is the lower of: i 90% of Vanquis Banks UK receivables of 861.3m less retail deposits of 435.1m after setting aside the necessary liquid assets buffer and other liquid resources in adherence with the PRAs liquidity regime of 25.5m this amounts to 314.6m: and ii the Vanquis Bank intercompany loan from Provident Financial plc of 292.1m as at 31 December 2013.
Accordingly, Vanquis Banks retail deposits capacity at 31 December 2013 amounts to 292.1m.
The groups total funding capacity at the end of 2013 therefore amounts to 527.3m, being the groups headroom on undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 235.2m plus the amount of Vanquis Banks intercompany loan of 292.1m.

Provident Financial plc sponsors the Provident Financial plc 2007 Employee Benefit Trust EBT which is a discretionary trust established for the benefit of the employees of the group.
The company has appointed Kleinwort Benson Jersey Trustees Limited to act as trustee of the EBT.
The trustee has waived the right to receive dividends on the shares it holds.
The shares have been acquired by the EBT to meet obligations under the Provident Financial Long Term Incentive Scheme 2006.
Provident Financial plc also sponsors the Performance Share Plan Trust which was established to operate in conjunction with the Performance Share Plan PSP.
As at 31 December 2013, awards under the PSP, held in the name of the individual subject to the award, were 994,627 2012: 695,009 ordinary shares with a cost of 0.2m 2012: 0.1m and a market value of 16.2m 2012: 9.4m.
185 Financial statements Provident Financial plc continued Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Notes to the financial statements continued 24 Share-based payments The group issues share options and awards to senior employees as part of its employee remuneration packages.
The group operates three share schemes: the Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS, employees savings-related share option schemes typically referred to as Save As You Earn schemes SAYE, and the Performance Share Plan PSP.
The group also previously operated senior executive share option schemes ESOS SESO, although no options have been granted under these schemes since 2006.
When a share option or award is granted, a fair value is calculated based on the current share price, probability of the option award vesting, the groups recent share price volatility, and the risk associated with the option award.
The fair value of all options is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the underlying option award.
The charge to the income statement in 2013 was 7.4m for the group 2012: 6.4m and 3.6m for the company 2012: 3.3m.
During 2013, awards options have been granted under the LTIS, PSP and SAYE schemes 2012: awards options granted under the LTIS, PSP and SAYE schemes.
The increase in the share-based payment charge from 6.4m in 2012 to 7.4m in 2013, principally reflects the impact of prior year provision releases in 2012 following lower than expected vesting levels from the 2009 Long Term Incentive Scheme.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK Government bonds.
