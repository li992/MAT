Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company risk management framework.
The Companys risk management policies have been established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company activities.
The Company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Company risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Company.
The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
a Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, or interest rates will affect the Company income or the value of its financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
Foreign currency risk The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk on transactions and balances that are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar.
Transactions in foreign currencies include the purchase of services, dividends and other items.
As a result, the Company has financial liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currency, and holds cash and cash equivalents in Mexican peso.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate compared to the Mexican peso, reflecting the impact on the Companys profit before tax with all other variables held constant.
It is assumed that the same percentage change in exchange rates is applied to all applicable periods.
There is no impact on the Companys equity other than the equivalent change in retained earnings.

The Companys earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on any floating element of the loans with related parties and interest earned on cash balances.
Interest-bearing loans are at a fixed rate, therefore the possibility of a change in interest rate only impacts its fair value, therefore, are excluded from the table below.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of all financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in interest rate applied to a full year from the balance sheet date.

The financial assets are trade and other receivables, intercompany loans, cash and cash equivalents and availablefor-sale financial assets.
The Companys policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of counterparties failure to honour their obligations.
Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Companys exposure to bad debts is not significant.
The Companys exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty.
The Companys financial assets are with counterparties with what the Company considers to have an appropriate credit rating.
As disclosed in note 15, the counterparties to a significant proportion of these financial assets are related parties.
At each balance sheet date, the Companys financial assets were neither impaired nor past due.
The Companys policies are aimed at minimising losses from the foreign currency hedging contracts.
The Companys foreign currency derivative contracts are entered into with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings.
The Companys surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo, S. A. fide C. V. which manages cash and cash equivalents investing in a number of financial institutions.
In order to minimise exposure to credit risk, the Company only deposits cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with a credit rating of P-1 Moodys and mxA-1 Standard and Poors and above, and only for periods of less than 30 days.
The maximum credit exposure at the reporting date of each category of financial asset above is the carrying value as detailed in the relevant notes.
See note 7 for the maximum credit exposure for available-for-sale investments, note 9 for cash and cash equivalents and note 15 for related party balances.

Management considers that the Company has adequate current assets and forecast cash from operations to manage liquidity risks arising from current liabilities and non-current liabilities.
Capital management The primary objective of the Companys capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios that support its business and maximise shareholder value.
Management considers capital to consist of equity and certain interest-bearing loans, as disclosed in the balance sheet, excluding net unrealised gains and losses on revaluation of cash flow hedges and available-for-sale financial assets.
In order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholders capital invested in the Company, management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable.
The Companys dividend policy is based on the profitability of the business and underlying growth in earnings of the Group, as well as its capital requirements and cash flows.
