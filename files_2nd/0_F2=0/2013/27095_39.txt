In accordance with FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, the above tables provide an analysis of these investments based on the fair value hierarchy described on page 36, which reflects the reliability and significance of the information used to measure their fair value.
The Monks Investment Trust PLC 35 Notes to the Financial Statements 9 Investments continued Fair Value Hierarchy The fair value hierarchy used to analyse the fair values of financial assets is described below.
The levels are determined by the lowest that is the least reliable or least independently observable level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement for the individual investment in its entirety as follows: Level 1 investments with quoted prices in an active market: Level 2 investments whose fair value is based directly on observable current market prices or is indirectly being derived from market prices: and Level 3 investments whose fair value is determined using a valuation technique based on assumptions that are not supported by observable current market prices or are not based on observable market data.
The purchases and sales proceeds figures above include transaction costs of 256,000 2012 502,000 and 303,000 2012 673,000 respectively.
Of the realised losses on sales of fixed and current asset investments during the year of 23,804,000 2012 losses of 21,074,000, a net gain of 21,488,000 2012 gain of 67,486,000 was included in investment holding gains losses at the previous year end.
36 Annual Report 2013 Notes to the Financial Statements 9 Investments continued The tables below show a reconciliation from the opening balances to the closing balances for fair value measurements in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The gains and losses shown in the tables have all been included in the Income Statement on page 28 within gains losses on investments.
The values of level 3 investments are calculated using valuation techniques based upon the latest dealing prices, stockbroker valuations, net asset values and other information as appropriate.
The Company believes that other reasonably possible alternative valuations for its Level 3 holdings would not be significantly different from those included in the financial statements.
