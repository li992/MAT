HSBC had US$13,412m 2012: US$11,770m of interests in associates listed in Hong Kong.
HSBCs interest in Industrial Bank Co. Limited Industrial Bank was equity accounted with effect from May 2004.
HSBCs significant influence was established as a result of representation on Industrial Banks Board of Directors.
In January 2013, Industrial Bank completed a private placement of additional share capital to a number of third parties which diluted HSBCs equity holding from 12.8% to 10.9%.
As a result of this and other factors, HSBC is no longer in a position to exercise significant influence over Industrial Bank and ceased to account for the interest as an associate from that date, giving rise to a gain of US$1.1bn recognised in other operating income.
Thereafter, the holding was recognised as an available-for-sale financial investment.
508 Bank of Communications Co. Limited BoCom HSBCs investment in BoCom was equity accounted with effect from August 2004.
HSBCs significant influence in BoCom was established as a result of representation on the Board of Directors and, in accordance with the Technical Cooperation and Exchange Programme, HSBC is assisting in the maintenance of financial and operating policies and a number of staff have been seconded to assist in this process.
Impairment testing As at 31 December 2013, the fair value of HSBCs investment in BoCom had been below the carrying amount for approximately 20 months, apart from a short period in 2013.
As a result, we performed an impairment test on the carrying amount of the investment in BoCom.
The test confirmed that there was no impairment as at 31 December 2013.
Basis of recoverable amount The impairment test was performed by comparing the recoverable amount of BoCom, determined by a value-in-use VIU calculation, with its carrying amount.
The VIU calculation used discounted cash flow projections based on managements estimates.
Cash flows beyond the short to medium-term were then extrapolated in perpetuity using a long-term growth rate.
Management judgement is required in estimating the future cash flows of BoCom.
The projected values are particularly sensitive to the following key assumptions.
Key assumptions in VIU calculation Long-term growth rate: the growth rate is 5% for periods after 2018 and does not exceed forecast GDP growth in China.
Discount rate: the discount rate of 13% is derived from a range of values obtained by applying a Capital Asset Pricing Model CAPM calculation for BoCom, using market data.
Management supplements this by comparing the rates derived from the CAPM with discount rates available from external sources, and HSBCs discount rate for evaluating investments in mainland China.
The discount rate used is within the range of 10.5% to 15% indicated by the CAPM and external sources.
Loan impairment charge as a percentage of customer advances: the ratio used increases from 0.64% to 1% in the short to medium term.
The long-term ratio is assumed to revert to a historical rate of 0.64%.
The rates are within the medium-term range forecast of 0.55% and 1.20% used by external analysts.
Managements judgement in estimating the VIU In 2013, the impairment testing model for BoCom was changed to reflect the expected regulatory impact on cash flow projections.
The changes reduced the projected available cash flows by including a regulatory cap on the loanto-deposit ratio and by retaining a proportion of cash flows to maintain capital ratio requirements above the expected regulatory minima.
If these changes had been made as at 31 December 2012, the VIU would still have been above the carrying amount as at that date.
VIU was US$14bn, or US$0.6bn headroom in excess of the carrying amount of the investment in BoCom of US$13.4bn as at 31 December 2013.
The carrying amount increased by US$1.6bn during 2013.
At the point where the carrying amount exceeds the value in use, the carrying amount would be reduced to equal value in use, with a corresponding reduction in income, unless the market value has increased to a level above the carrying amount.
Sensitivity analyses were performed on each key assumption to ascertain the impact of reasonably possible changes in assumptions.
For the year ended 31 December 2013, HSBC included the associates results on the basis of financial statements made up for the 12 months to 30 September 2013, taking into account changes in the subsequent period from 1 October 2013 to 31 December 2013 that would have materially affected the results.
BoComs results announcements for the nine months ended 30 September formed the bases for the 12 month financial statements which include adjustments made by HSBC when applying equity accounting.
