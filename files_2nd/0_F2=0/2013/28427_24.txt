Remuneration report Supplementary information Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 123 All-employee share plans It is important that all employees are offered the opportunity to own shares in Prudential, connecting them both to the success of the Company and to the interests of other shareholders.
Executive directors are invited to participate in these plans on the same basis as other staff in their location.
No directors or other employees are provided with loans to enable them to buy shares.
Save As You Earn SAYE schemes UK based executive directors are eligible to participate in the HM Revenue and Customs HMRC approved Prudential Savings-Related Share Option Scheme and Barry Stowe is invited to participate in the similar International Share Ownership Scheme.
These schemes allow all eligible employees to save towards the exercise of options over Prudential plc shares with the option price set at the beginning of the savings period at a discount of up to 20 per cent of the market price.
In 2013, participants could elect to enter into savings contracts of up to 250 per month for a period of three or five years.
At the end of this term, participants may exercise their options within six months and purchase shares.
If an option is not exercised within six months, participants are entitled to a refund of their cash savings plus interest, if applicable under the rules.
Shares are issued to satisfy those options which are exercised.
No options may be granted under the schemes if the grant would cause the number of shares which have been issued, or which remain issuable pursuant to options granted in the preceding 10 years under the scheme and any other option schemes operated by the Company, or which have been issued under any other share incentive scheme of the Company, to exceed 10 per cent of the Companys ordinary share capital at the proposed date of grant.
Details of executive directors rights under the SAYE scheme are set out in the Statement of directors shareholdings.
Share Incentive Plan SIP UK-based executive directors are also eligible to participate in the Companys HMRC approved Share Incentive Plan SIP.
In 2013, all UK based employees were able to purchase Prudential plc shares up to a value of 125 per month from their gross salary partnership shares through the SIP.
For every four partnership shares bought, an additional matching share is awarded which is purchased by Prudential on the open market.
Dividend shares accumulate while the employee participates in the plan.
If the employee withdraws from the plan, or leaves the Group, matching shares may be forfeited.
The table below provides information about shares purchased under the SIP together with Matching Shares awarded on a 1:4 basis and dividend shares.
Partnership Matching Dividend SIP awards shares shares shares SIP awards Year of held in trust accumulated accumulated accumulated held in trust initial grant at 1 Jan 2013 in 2013 in 2013 in 2013 at 31 Dec 2013 Number of Number of Number of Number of Number of shares shares shares shares shares Nic Nicandrou 2010 869 136 34 25 1,064 Jackie Hunt 2013 19 4 23 Dilution Releases from the Prudential Long Term Incentive Plan, GPSP and BUPP are satisfied using new issue shares, rather than by purchasing shares in the open market.
Shares relating to options granted under all-employee share plans are also satisfied by new issue shares.
The combined dilution from all outstanding shares and options at 31 December 2013 was 0.2 per cent of the total share capital at the time.
Deferred shares will continue to be satisfied by the purchase of shares in the open market.

85.0p The Group has adopted new accounting standards on consolidated financial statements and joint arrangements, and amendments to the employee benefits accounting standard, from 1 January 2013 as described in note A2.
Accordingly, the 2012 comparative results and related notes have been adjusted retrospectively from those previously published.
This measure is the formal profit before tax measure under IFRS but it is not the result attributable to shareholders.
This is principally because the corporate taxes of the Group include those on the income of consolidated with-profits and unit-linked funds that, through adjustments to benefits, are borne by policyholders.
These amounts are required to be included in the tax charge of the Company under IAS 12.
Consequently, the profit before all taxes measure which is determined after deducting the cost of policyholder benefits and movements in the liability for unallocated surplus of the PAC with-profits fund after adjusting for taxes borne by policyholders is not representative of pre-tax profits attributable to shareholders.

ii Other non-cash items consist of the adjustment of non-cash items to profit before tax together with other net items, net purchases of treasury shares and other net movements in equity.
iii The acquisition of Thanachart Life and the related distribution agreements in 2013 resulted in a net cash outflow of 396 million.
The acquisition of REALIC in 2012, resulted in a net cash outflow of 224 million and a further cash payment of 9 million in 2013.
See note D1 for further details.
The net cash inflow of 23 million for change in Groups holdings in 2012 was in respect of the dilution of M&Gs holdings in PPM South Africa resulting in a reclassification from a subsidiary to an associate.
iv Structural borrowings of shareholder-financed operations exclude borrowings to support short-term fixed income securities programmes, non-recourse borrowings of investment subsidiaries of shareholder-financed operations and other borrowings of shareholder-financed operations.
Cash flows in respect of these borrowings are included within cash flows from operating activities.
v Interest paid on structural borrowings of with-profits operations relate solely to the 100 million 8.5 per cent undated subordinated guaranteed bonds, which contribute to the solvency base of the Scottish Amicable Insurance Fund SAIF, a ring-fenced sub-fund of the PAC with-profits fund.
Cash flows in respect of other borrowings of with-profits funds, which principally relate to consolidated investment funds, are included within cash flows from operating activities.
134 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements A:  A1:  Background Prudential plc the Company together with its subsidiaries collectively, the Group or Prudential is an international financial services group with its principal operations in Asia, the US and the UK.

Basisofpreparation These statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and as endorsed by the European Union EU as required by EU law IAS Regulation EC1606 2032.
EU-endorsed IFRS may differ from IFRS issued by the IASB if, at any point in time, new or amended IFRS have not been endorsed by the EU.
At 31 December 2013, there were no unendorsed standards effective for the two years ended 31 December 2013 affecting the consolidated financial information of the Group and there were no differences between IFRS endorsed by the EU and IFRS issued by the IASB in terms of their application to the Group.
Except for the adoption of the new and amended accounting standards for Group IFRS reporting as described in note A2 below, the accounting policies applied by the Group in determining the IFRS basis results in this report are the same as those previously applied in the Groups consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012.

A3: Accountingpolicies A3.1  The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations issued and effective for the year ended 31 December 2013.
This note provides detailed accounting policies adopted by the Group to prepare the consolidated financial statements.
With the exception of the consequential impact of the adoption of IFRS 13 on fair value measurement, which is not required to be applied retrospectively before 1 January 2013 as explained in note A2, these accounting policies are applied consistently for all years presented and normally are not subject to changes unless new accounting standards, interpretations or amendments are introduced by the IASB.
a ,  Prudential believes that its critical accounting policies are limited to those references in the table below: Accounting  policyreference Classification of insurance and investment contracts A3.1 c Measurement of policyholder liabilities and unallocated surplus of with-profits fund A3.1 d Measurement and presentation of derivatives and debt securities of US insurance operations A3.1 j v Presentation of results before tax A3.1 k Segmental analysis of results and earnings distributable to shareholders A3.1 m The preparation of these financial statements requires Prudential to make estimates and judgements about future conditions.
Prudential evaluates its estimates, including those related to long-term business provisioning and the fair value of assets.
The table below sets out items that require the Group to make estimates and judgements in applying the relevant accounting policy: Accounting  policyreference Classification of insurance and investment contracts A3.1 c Measurement of policyholder liabilities A3.1 d Measurement of deferred acquisition costs A3.1 f Determination of fair value of financial investments A3.1 j ii Determining impairment relating to financial assets A3.1 j iii b Basisofconsolidation The Group consolidates those investees it is deemed to control.
The Group has control over an investee if all three of the following are met: 1 it has power over an investee: 2 it is exposed to, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee: 3 it has ability to use its power over the investee to affect its own returns.
i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those investees in which the Group controls.
The vast majority of Groups subsidiaries are corporate entities where the Group holds the majority of voting rights and are consolidated.
The consolidation of other vehicles held by the Group is discussed below: Financial statements A: Background and accounting policies Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 137 The Groups insurance operations invests in a number of limited partnerships, either directly or through unit trusts, through a mix of capital and loans.
These limited partnerships are managed by general partners, in which the Group hold equity.
Such interest in general partners and limited partnerships provide the Group with voting and similar rights to participate in the governance framework of the relevant activities in which limited partnerships are engaged in.
Accounting for the limited partnerships as subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates or other financial investments depends on the terms of each partnership agreement and the shareholdings in the general partners.
In the context of direct investment in limited partnerships, the following circumstances may indicate a relationship in which, in substance, the Group controls and consequently consolidates a limited partnership: The Group has existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the limited partnership, ie activities that significantly affect the generation of economic returns from the limited partnerships operation: The Group has the power to obtain the significant benefits of the activities of the limited partnerships.
Generally, it is presumed that the Group has significant benefits if its participation in the limited partnership is greater than 20 per cent: and The Groups current ability to join together with other partners to direct the activities of the partnership.
The Group performs a re-assessment of consolidation whenever there is a change in the substance of the relationship between the Group and a limited partnership.
Where the Group is deemed to control a limited partnership, it is treated as a subsidiary and its results, assets and liabilities are consolidated.
Where the Group holds a minority share in a limited partnership, with no control over their associated general partners, the investments are carried at fair value through profit and loss within financial investments in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The Group does not have a material percentage of non-controlling interests in its subsidiaries.
ii Joint ventures and associates Joint ventures are joint arrangements arising from a contractual agreement whereby the Group and other investors have joint control of the net assets of the arrangement.
In a number of these arrangements, the Groups share of the underlying net assets may be less than 50 per cent but the terms of the relevant agreement make it clear that control is jointly exercised between the Group and the third party.
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but it does not control.
Generally it is presumed that the Group has significant influence if it holds between 20 per cent and 50 per cent voting rights of the entity.
The Group adopted IFRS 11 for investments in joint ventures from 1 January 2013 and accordingly are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
In line with the transition provision requirements, the Group has recognised its investment in joint ventures at 1 January 2012, as the aggregate of the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities that were previously proportionately consolidated by the Group.
This determines the deemed cost of the Groups investment in joint ventures for applying equity accounting.
The effect of adoption of IFRS 11 is disclosed in note A2.
Investments in associates are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter for the change in Groups share of net assets of the associates.
The Groups share of profit or loss of its joint ventures and associates is recognised in the income statement and its share of movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income.
iii Structured entities Structured entities are those which have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.
In addition to the entities discussed above in A3.1b i and A3.1b ii, the Group as part of its business strategy invests in structured entities such as Open-Ended Investment Companies OEICs, Unit Trusts UTs, variable interest entities, investment vehicles within separate accounts offered through variable annuities, collateral debt obligations, mortgage-backed securities, and similar asset-backed securities.
Open-ended investment companies and unit trusts The Group invests in open-ended investment companies and unit trusts, which invest mainly in equities, bonds, cash and cash equivalents, and properties.
The Groups percentage ownership in these entities can fluctuate on a daily basis according to the participation of the Groups and other investors in them.
For these entities, the following circumstances may indicate, in substance, the Group has power over an entity: The entity is managed by the Groups asset manager and the Group holds a significant investment in the entity: and Where the entity is managed by asset managers outside the Group, Prudential has existing rights that give it the ability to direct the current activities of the entity.
In assessing the Groups ability to direct an entity, the Group considers its ability relative to other investors.
The Group has limited number of open-ended investment companies and unit trusts where it considers it has such ability.
For the entity managed by asset managers outside the Group with no current ability to direct its activities, the Group is deemed to have no power over such an entity.
For those entities managed by the Groups asset managers, it is generally presumed that the Group is exposed to, or has rights, to variable returns from an entity and has ability to use its power to affect its own returns where Groups holding is greater than 50 per cent and is deemed to have no significant influence over an entity for participation less than 20 per cent.
For holdings between 20 per cent and 50 per cent, the Group performs an assessment of power and associated control over an entity on a case by case basis.
For these entities, the following circumstances may indicate that the Group controls an entity: The Group has power over the relevant activities of the entity: and The exposure, or rights, to variable returns including administrative and performance fee earned by the Groups asset manager from the entity is higher than the Groups interest.
Where the Group is deemed to control these entities they are treated as a subsidiary and are consolidated, with the interests of investors other than the Group being classified as liabilities and appear as net asset value attributable to unit holders of consolidated unit trusts and similar funds.
138 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements A:  A3:  Where the Group does not control these entities as it is deemed to be acting as an agent and they do not meet the definition of associates, they are carried at fair value through profit and loss within financial investments in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Where the Groups asset manager set up the open-ended investment companies and unit trusts as part of asset management operations, the Groups interest is limited to the administration fees charged to manage the assets of such entities.
With no participation in these entities, the Group does not retain risks associated with open-ended investment companies and unit trusts and is deemed to be acting as an agent.
The Group generates returns and retains the ownership risks in investment vehicles commensurate to its participation and does not have any further exposure to the residual risks of the open-ended investment companies and unit trusts.
Jacksons separate account assets Jackson offers variable contracts that invest contract holders premiums, at the contract holders direction, in investment vehicles Separate Accounts that invest in equity, fixed income, bonds and money market mutual funds.
The contract holder retains the underlying returns and the ownership risks related to the separate accounts and its underlying investments.
The shareholders economic interest in separate accounts is limited to the administrative fees charged.
The separate accounts are set up as separate regulated entities governed by a Board of Companies or trustees for which the majority of the members are independent of Jackson or any affiliated entity.
The independent members represent contract holders interest and are responsible for any decision making that impacts contract holders interest and governs the operational activities of the entities advisors, including asset managers managing the investment vehicles.
Accordingly the Group has no control over these vehicles.
These investments are carried at fair value through profit and loss within financial investments in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Other structured entities The Group holds investments in mortgage-backed securities, collateral debt obligations and similar asset-backed securities that are actively traded in a liquid market.
The Group is not the sponsor of the vehicles in which it holds investments and has no administrative rights over the vehicles activities.
The Group generates returns and retains the ownership risks commensurate to its holding and its exposure to the investments.
Accordingly the Group does not have power over the relevant activities of such vehicles and all are carried at fair value through profit and loss within financial investments in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The table below provides aggregate carrying amounts of the investments in unconsolidated structured entities reported in the Groups statement of financial position: 2013 m Separate Other account structured OEICs UTs assets entities  Equity securities and portfolio holdings in unit trusts 78,856 65,681 Debt securities 13,190 Total 78,856 65,681 13,190 The Group generates returns and retains the ownership risks in these investments commensurate to its participation and does not have any further exposure to the residual risks or losses of the investments or the vehicles in which it holds investments.
As at 31 December 2013, the Group does not have an agreement, contractual or otherwise, or intention to provide financial support to structured entities that could expose the Group to a loss.
c  IFRS 4 requires contracts written by insurers to be classified as either insurance contracts or investment contracts depending on the level of insurance risk transferred.
Insurance risk is a pre-existing risk, other than financial risk, transferred from the contract holder to the contract issuer.
If significant insurance risk is transferred to the Group then it is classified as an insurance contract.
Contracts that transfer financial risk to the Group but not significant insurance risk are termed investment contracts.
Furthermore, some contracts, both insurance and investment, contain discretionary participating features representing the contractual right to receive additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits: a That are likely to be a significant portion of the total contract benefits: b Whose amount or timing is contractually at the discretion of the insurer: and c That are contractually based on asset or fund performance, as discussed in IFRS 4.
Financial statements A: Background and accounting policies Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 139   Businessunits   Asia With-profits contracts Minor amounts for a number of small Non-participating term contracts categories of business Whole life contracts Unit-linked policies Accident and health policies US Variable annuity contracts Guaranteed investment contracts GICs Fixed annuity contracts Minor amounts of annuity certain contracts Life insurance contracts UK With-profits contracts Certain unit-linked savings and similar Bulk and individual annuity business contracts Non-participating term contracts d  The measurement basis of policyholder liabilities is dependent upon the classification of the contracts under IFRS 4 described in note A3.1 c above.
IFRS 4 permits the continued usage of previously applied GAAP for insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participating features.
Accordingly, except for UK regulated with-profits funds as discussed below, the modified statutory basis MSB of reporting as set in the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP issued by Association of British Insurers ABI has been adopted by the Group on first time application of IFRS in 2005.
For investment contracts that do not contain discretionary participating features, IAS 39 and, where the contract includes an investment management element, IAS 18, Revenue, apply measurement principles to assets and liabilities attaching to the contract.
For with-profits funds, as the shareholders participation in the cost of bonuses arises only on distribution, the Group has elected to account for the unallocated surplus of UK regulated with-profits funds as a liability with no allocation to equity.
The policy of measuring contract liabilities at business unit level is noted below.
Additional details are discussed in note C4.2.
i Insurance contracts Asia insurance operations The policyholder liabilities for businesses in Asia are determined in accordance with methods prescribed by local GAAP adjusted to comply, where necessary, with the MSB.
Refinements to the local reserving methodology are generally treated as change in estimates, dependent on the nature of the change.
For the operations in India, Japan, Taiwan and, until 2012, Vietnam, the local GAAP is not appropriate as a starting point in the context of the MSB, and, instead, the accounting for insurance contracts is based on US GAAP.
For these operations the business written is primarily non-participating linked and participating business.
The future policyholder benefit provisions for non-participating linked business are determined using the net level premium method, with an allowance for surrenders, maintenance and claim expenses.
Rates of interest used in establishing the policyholder benefit provisions vary by operation depending on the circumstances attaching to each block of business.
Where appropriate, liabilities for participating business for these operations include provisions for the policyholders interest in investment gains and other surpluses that have yet to be declared as bonuses.
Whilst the basis of valuation of liabilities in these businesses is in accordance with the requirements of the ABI SORP, it may differ from that determined on MSB for UK operations with the same features.
US insurance operations In accordance with the MSB, the policyholder liabilities for Jacksons conventional protection-type policies are determined under US GAAP principles with locked in assumptions for mortality, interest, policy lapses and expenses along with provisions for adverse deviations.
For non-conventional protection-type policies, the policyholder liabilities includes the policyholder account balance.
Acquisition costs are accounted for as explained in section f below.
As permitted by IFRS 4, Jackson uses shadow accounting to make adjustments to the liabilities or related deferred acquisition costs which are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Jackson accounts for the majority of its investment portfolio on an available-for-sale basis whereby unrealised gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income.
To the extent that recognition of unrealised gains or losses on available-for-sale securities causes adjustments to the carrying value and amortisation patterns of deferred acquisition costs and deferred income, these adjustments are recognised in other comprehensive income to be consistent with the treatment of the gains or losses on the securities.
More precisely, shadow deferred acquisition costs adjustments reflect the change in deferred acquisition costs that would have arisen if the assets held in the statement of financial position had been sold, crystallising unrealised gains or losses, and the proceeds reinvested at the yields currently available in the market.
140 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements A:  A3:  UK insurance operations The UK regulated with-profits funds are accounted for by the voluntary application of the UK accounting standard FRS 27, Life Assurance that requires liabilities to be calculated as the realistic basis liabilities.
The realistic basis liabilities are measured by reference to the PRAs Peak 2 basis of reporting.
This Peak 2 basis requires the value of liabilities to be calculated as: A with-profits benefits reserve, plus Future policy related liabilities, plus The realistic current liabilities of the fund.
The with-profits benefits reserve is primarily based on the retrospective calculation of accumulated asset shares but is adjusted to reflect future policyholder benefits and other outgoings.
Asset shares broadly reflect the policyholders share of the with-profits fund assets attributable to their policies.
The future policy related liabilities must include a market-consistent valuation of costs of guarantees, options and smoothing, less any related charges, and this amount is determined using either a stochastic approach, hedging costs or a series of deterministic projections with attributed probabilities.
The Peak 2 basis realistic liabilities for with-profits business included in the PRA regulatory returns include the element for the shareholders share of the future cost of bonuses consistent with the contract asset shares.
For accounting purposes under FRS 27, this latter item is not shown as part of contract liabilities.
This is because, consistent with the current basis of financial reporting, shareholder transfers are recognised only on declaration.
Instead the shareholders share of future costs of bonuses is included within the liabilities for unallocated surplus.
Other UK insurance contracts that contain significant insurance risk include unit-linked, annuity and other non-profit business.
For the purposes of local regulations, segregated accounts are established for linked business for which policyholder benefits are wholly or partly determined by reference to specific investments or to an investment-related index.
The interest rates used in establishing policyholder benefit provisions for pension annuities in the course of payment are adjusted each year.
Mortality rates used in establishing policyholder benefits are based on published mortality tables adjusted to reflect actual experience.
ii Investment contracts with discretionary participation features For investment contracts with discretionary participation features, the accounting basis is consistent with the accounting for similar with-profits insurance contracts.
Other investment contracts are accounted for on a basis that reflects the hybrid nature of the arrangements whereby part is accounted for as a financial instrument under IAS 39 and the investment management service component is accounted for under IAS 18.
For those investment contracts in the US with fixed and guaranteed terms, the Group uses the amortised cost model to measure the liability.
Those investment contracts without fixed and guaranteed terms are designated at fair value through profit and loss because the resulting liabilities are managed and their performance is evaluated on a fair value basis.
Where the contract includes a surrender option, its carrying value is subject to a minimum carrying value equal to its surrender value.
iii Investment contracts without discretionary participation features The measurement of investment contracts without discretionary participation features is carried out in accordance with IAS 39 to reflect the deposit nature of the arrangement, with premiums and claims reflected as deposits and withdrawals and taken directly to the statement of financial position as movements in the financial liability balance.
Under IFRS, investment contracts excluding those with discretionary participation features accounted for as financial liabilities in accordance with IAS 39 which also offer investment management services, require the application of IAS 18 for the revenue attached to these services.
Incremental, directly attributable acquisition costs relating to the investment management element of these contracts are capitalised and amortised in line with the related revenue.
If the contracts involve up-front charges, this income is also deferred and amortised through the income statement in line with contractual service provision.
iv Unallocated surplus of with-profits funds Unallocated surplus represents the excess of assets over policyholder liabilities for the Groups with-profits funds that have yet to be appropriated between policyholders and shareholders.
As allowed under IFRS 4, the Group has opted to continue to record unallocated surplus of with-profits funds wholly as a liability with no allocation to equity.
The annual excess shortfall of income over expenditure of the with-profits funds, after declaration and attribution of the cost of bonuses to policyholders and shareholders, is transferred to from the unallocated surplus each year through a charge credit to the income statement.
The balance retained in the unallocated surplus represents cumulative income arising on the with-profits business that has not been allocated to policyholders or shareholders.
The balance of the unallocated surplus is determined after full provision for deferred tax on unrealised appreciation on investments.
e Reinsurance The measurement of reinsurance assets is consistent with the measurement of the underlying direct insurance contracts.
The treatment of any gains or losses arising on the purchase of reinsurance contracts is dependent on the underlying accounting basis of the entity concerned amongst other things.
Financial statements A: Background and accounting policies Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 141 f  Except for acquisition costs of with-profits contracts of the UK regulated with-profits funds, which are accounted for under the realistic PRA regime, costs of acquiring new insurance business are accounted for in a way that is consistent with the principles of the ABI SORP with deferral and amortisation against margins in future revenues on the related insurance policies.
Costs of acquiring new insurance business, principally commissions, marketing and advertising and certain other costs associated with policy insurance and underwriting that are not reimbursed by policy charges, are specifically identified and capitalised as part of deferred acquisition costs.
In general, this deferral is presentationally shown by an explicit carrying value for in the balance sheet.
However, in some Asia operations the deferral is implicit through the reserving methodology.
The recoverability of the explicitly and implicitly deferred acquisition costs is measured and is deemed impaired if the projected margins are less than the carrying value.
To the extent that the future margins differ from those anticipated, then an adjustment to the carrying value will be necessary.
The deferral and amortisation of acquisition costs is of most relevance to the Groups results for Asia and US insurance operations.
The deferred acquisition costs for US and some Asia operations is determined with reference to US GAAP principles.
Asia insurance operations For those territories applying US GAAP to insurance assets and liabilities, as permitted by the ABI SORP, principles similar to those set out in the US insurance operations paragraph below are applied to the deferral and amortisation of acquisition costs.
For other territories in Asia, the general principles of the ABI SORP are applied with, as described above, deferral of acquisition costs being either explicit or implicit through the reserving basis.
US insurance operations Under IFRS 4, the Group applies grandfathered US GAAP for measuring the insurance assets and liabilities of US insurance operations.
The Group adopted FAS ASU 2010-26 on Accounting for Costs Associated with Acquiring or Renewing Insurance Contracts from 1 January 2012 and capitalises only those incremental costs directly relating to successfully acquiring a contract.
For interest-sensitive business, the key assumption is the long-term spread between the earned rate on investments and the rate credited to policyholders, which is based on an annual spread analysis.
In addition, expected gross profits depend on mortality assumptions, assumed unit costs and terminations other than deaths including the related charges, all of which are based on a combination of Jacksons actual industry experience and future expectations.
A detailed analysis of actual mortality, lapse and expenses experience is performed using internally developed experience studies.
For US variable annuity business a key assumption is the investment return from the separate accounts, which is determined using a mean reversion methodology.
Under the mean reversion methodology, projected returns over the next five years are flexed subject to capping so that, combined with the actual rates of return for the current and the previous two years is maintained.
The projected rates of return are capped at no more than 15 per cent for each of the next five years.
These returns affect the level of future expected profits through their effects on the fee income with consequential impact on the amortisation of deferred acquisition costs.
The level of acquisition costs carried in the statement of financial position is also sensitive to unrealised valuation movements on debt securities held to back the liabilities and solvency capital.
Further details are discussed in note C5.1 b. UK insurance operations For UK regulated with-profits funds where the realistic FSA regime is applied, the basis of setting liabilities is such that it would be inappropriate for acquisition costs to be deferred: therefore these costs are expensed as incurred.
The majority of the UK shareholder-backed business is individual and group annuity business where the incidence of acquisition costs is negligible.
g  The Group performs adequacy testing on its insurance liabilities to ensure that the carrying amounts net of related deferred acquisition costs and, where relevant, present value of acquired in-force business is sufficient to cover current estimates of future cash flows.
Any deficiency is immediately charged to the income statement.
h Earnedpremiums,  Premium and annuity considerations for conventional with-profits policies and other protection type insurance policies are recognised as revenue when due.
Premiums and annuity considerations for linked policies, unitised with-profits and other investment type policies are recognised as revenue when received or, in the case of unitised or unit-linked policies, when units are issued.
These amounts exclude premium taxes and similar duties where Prudential collects and settles taxes borne by the customer.
Policy fees charged on linked and unitised with-profits policies for mortality, asset management and policy administration are recognised as revenue when related services are provided.
Claims paid include maturities, annuities, surrenders and deaths.
Maturity claims are recorded as charges on the policy maturity date.
Annuity claims are recorded when each annuity instalment becomes due for payment.
Surrenders are charged to the income statement when paid and death claims are recorded when notified.
142 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements A:  A3:  i Investmentreturn Investment return included in the income statement principally comprises interest income, dividends, investment appreciation depreciation realised and unrealised gains and losses on investments designated as fair value through profit and loss, and realised gains and losses including impairment losses on Jacksons debt securities designated as available-for-sale.
Movements in unrealised appreciation depreciation of Jacksons debt securities designated as available-for-sale are recorded in other comprehensive income.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues, taking into account the effective yield on investments.
Dividends on equity securities are recognised on the ex-dividend date and rental income is recognised on an accrual basis.
j  i Investment classification The Group holds financial investments in accordance with IAS 39 whereby, subject to specific criteria, financial instruments are required to be accounted for under one of the following categories: Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss this comprises assets and liabilities designated by management as fair value through profit and loss on inception and derivatives that are held for trading.
These investments are measured at fair value with all changes thereon being recognised in investment return in the income statement: Financial investments on an available-for-sale basis this comprises assets that are designated by management and or do not fall into any of the other categories.
These assets are initially recognised at fair value plus attributable transaction costs.
For available-for-sale debt securities, the difference between their cost and par value is amortised to the income statement using the effective interest rate.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset: Available-for-sale assets are subsequently measured at fair value.
Interest income is recognised on an effective interest basis in the income statement.
Except for foreign exchange gains and losses on debt securities, not in functional currency, which are included in the income statement, unrealised gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Upon disposal or impairment, accumulated unrealised gains and losses are transferred from other comprehensive income to the income statement as realised gains or losses: and Loans and receivables except for those designated as at fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale, these instruments comprise non-quoted investments that have fixed or determinable payments.
These instruments include loans collateralised by mortgages, deposits, loans to policyholders and other unsecured loans and receivables.
These investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs.
Subsequently, these instruments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The Group uses the trade date method to account for regular purchases and sales of financial assets.
ii Use of fair value The Group uses current bid prices to value its investments with quoted prices.
Actively traded investments without quoted prices are valued using prices provided by third parties.
If there is no active established market for an investment, the Group applies an appropriate valuation technique such as a discounted cash flow technique.
Determining the fair value of financial investments when the markets are not active The Group holds certain financial investments for which the markets are not active.
These can include financial investments which are not quoted on active markets and financial investments for which markets are no longer active as a result of market conditions eg market illiquidity.
When the markets are not active, there is generally no or limited observable market data to account for financial investments at fair value.
The determination of whether an active market exists for a financial investment requires managements judgement.
If the market for a financial investment of the Group is not active, the fair value is determined by using valuation techniques.
The Group establishes fair value for these financial investments by using quotations from independent third parties, such as brokers or pricing services or by using internally developed pricing models.
Priority is given to publicly available prices from independent sources when available, but overall the source of pricing and or the valuation technique is chosen with the objective of arriving at a fair value measurement which reflects the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants on the measurement date.
The valuation techniques include the use of recent arms length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, option adjusted spread models and, if applicable, enterprise valuation and may include a number of assumptions relating to variables such as credit risk and interest rates.
Changes in assumptions relating to these variables could positively or negatively impact the reported fair value of these financial investments.
The financial investments measured at fair value are classified into the following three level hierarchy on the basis of the lowest level of inputs that is significant to the fair value measurement of the financial investment concerned: Level 1: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly ie derived from prices.
Level 3: Significant inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
Financial statements A: Background and accounting policies Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 143 iii Determining impairments relation to financial assets Available-for-sale securities The majority of Jacksons debt securities portfolio is accounted for on an available-for-sale basis.
The consideration of evidence of impairment requires managements judgement.
In making this determination the factors considered include, for example: Determiningfactors  Whether the decline of the A substantial decline in fair value might be indicative of a credit loss event that would lead to a financial investments fair value measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows.
is substantial The impact of the duration of The duration of a security to maturity helps to inform whether assessments of estimated future the security on the calculation cash flows that are higher than market value are reasonable.
of the revised estimated cash flows The duration and extent to This factor provides an indication of how the contractual cash flows and effective interest rate of which the amortised cost a financial asset compares with the implicit market estimate of cash flows and the risk attaching to exceeds fair value a fair value measurement.
The length of time for which that level of difference has been in place may also provide further evidence as to whether the market assessment implies an impairment loss has arisen.
The financial condition and These factors and other observable conditions may indicate that an investment is impaired.
prospects of the issuer If a loss event that will have a detrimental effect on cash flows is identified, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
The loss recognised is determined as the difference between the book cost and the fair value of the relevant impaired securities.
This loss comprises the effect of the expected loss of contractual cash flows and any additional market-price-driven temporary reductions in values.
For Jacksons residential mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, all of which are classified as available-for-sale, the model used to analyse cash flows begins with the current delinquency experience of the underlying collateral pool for the structure, by applying assumptions about how much of the currently delinquent loans will eventually default, and multiplying this by an assumed loss severity.
Additional factors are applied to anticipate ageing effects.
After applying a cash flow simulation an indication is obtained as to whether or not the security has suffered, or is anticipated to suffer, contractual principal or interest payment shortfalls.
If a shortfall applies an impairment charge is recorded.
The difference between the fair value and book cost for unimpaired securities designated as available-for-sale is accounted for as unrealised gains or losses, with the movements in the accounting period being included in other comprehensive income.
The Groups review of fair value involves several criteria, including economic conditions, credit loss experience, other issuer-specific developments and future cash flows.
These assessments are based on the best available information at the time.
Factors such as market liquidity, the widening of bid ask spreads and a change in cash flow assumptions can contribute to future price volatility.
If actual experience differs negatively from the assumptions and other considerations used in the consolidated financial statements, unrealised losses currently in equity may be recognised in the income statement in future periods.
Additional details on the impairments of the available-for-sale securities of Jackson are described in notes C3.5 d. Assets held at amortised cost Except for certain loans of the UK insurance operations and Jackson National Life, which are accounted for on a fair value through profit and loss basis, and as described below, financial assets classified as loans and receivables under IAS 39 are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The loans and receivables include loans collateralised by mortgages, deposits and loans to policyholders.
In estimating future cash flows, the Group looks at the expected cash flows of the assets and applies historical loss experience of assets with similar credit risks that has been adjusted for conditions in the historical loss experience which no longer exist or for conditions that are expected to arise.
The estimated future cash flows are discounted using the financial assets original or variable effective interest rate and exclude credit losses that have not yet been incurred.
The risks inherent in reviewing the impairment of any investment include: the risk that market results may differ from expectations, facts and circumstances may change in the future and differ from estimates and assumptions, or the Group may later decide to sell the asset as a result of changed circumstances.
Certain mortgage loans of the UK insurance operations and, consequent upon the purchase of REALIC in 2012 by Jackson, policy loans held to back funds withheld under reinsurance arrangements have been designated at fair value through profit and loss as these loan portfolios are managed and evaluated on a fair value basis.
Assets carried at cost or amortised cost are subject to impairment testing where appropriate under IFRS requirements.
Reversal of impairment loss If, in subsequent periods, an impaired debt security held on an available-for-sale basis or an impaired loan or receivable recovers in value in part or in full, and this recovery can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment, then the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the income statement in part or in full.
144 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements A:  A3:  iv Derivatives and hedge accounting Derivative financial instruments are used to reduce or manage investment, interest rate and currency exposures, to facilitate efficient portfolio management and for investment purposes.
The Group may designate certain derivatives as hedges.
For hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the effective portion of any change in fair value of derivatives or other financial instruments designated as net investment hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recorded in the income statement.
The gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in other comprehensive income while the foreign operation is held.
For fair value hedges, movements in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in the income statement.
The Group does not regularly seek to apply fair value or cash flow hedging treatment under IAS 39.
The exceptions, where hedge accounting has been applied in 2013 and 2012, are summarised in note C3.5 b.
All derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are carried at fair value with movements in fair value being recorded in the income statement.
The primary areas of the Groups continuing operations where derivative instruments are held are the UK with-profits funds and annuity business, and Jackson.
For UK with-profits funds the derivative programme derivatives are used for the purposes of efficient portfolio management or reduction in investment risk.
For shareholder-backed UK annuity business the derivatives are held to contribute to the matching, as far as practical, of asset returns and duration with those of liabilities to policyholders.
The carrying value of these liabilities is sensitive to the return on the matching financial assets including derivatives held.
For Jackson an extensive derivative programme is maintained.
Value movements on the derivatives held can be very significant in their effect on shareholder results.
Further details on this aspect of the Groups financial reporting are described in note B1.2.
v Measurement and presentation of derivatives and debt securities of US insurance operations The policies for these items are significant factors in contributing to the volatility of the income statement result and shareholders equity.
Under IAS 39, derivatives are required to be carried at fair value.
Unless net investment hedge accounting is applied, value movements on derivatives are recognised in the income statement.
For derivative instruments of Jackson that are entered into to mitigate economic exposures, the Group has considered whether it is appropriate to undertake the necessary operational changes to qualify for hedge accounting so as to achieve matching of value movements in hedging instruments and hedged items in the performance statements.
In reaching the decision, a number of factors were particularly relevant.
These were: IAS 39 hedging criteria have been designed primarily in the context of hedging and hedging instruments that are assessable as financial instruments that are either stand-alone or separable from host contracts, rather than, for example, duration characteristics of insurance contracts: The high hurdle levels under IAS 39 of ensuring hedge effectiveness at the level of individual hedge transactions: The difficulties in applying the macro hedge provisions under IAS 39 which are more suited to banking arrangements to Jacksons derivative book: The complexity of asset and liability matching of US life insurers such as those with Jacksons product range: and finally Whether it is possible or desirable, without an unacceptable level of costs and constraint on commercial activity, to achieve the accounting hedge effectiveness required under IAS 39.
Taking account of these considerations the Group has decided that, except for occasional circumstances, it is not appropriate to seek to achieve hedge accounting under IAS 39.
As a result of this decision the total income statement results are more volatile as the movements in the value of Jacksons derivatives are reflected within it.
This volatility is reflected in the level of short-term fluctuations in investment returns, as shown in notes B1.1 and B1.2.
Under IAS 39, unless carried at amortised cost subject to impairment provisions where appropriate under the held-to-maturity category, debt securities are also carried at fair value.
The Group has chosen not to classify any financial assets as held-to-maturity.
Debt securities of Jackson are designated as available-for-sale with value movements, unless impaired, being recorded as movements within other comprehensive income.
Impairments are recorded in the income statement.
vi Embedded derivatives Embedded derivatives are present in host contracts issued by various Group companies, in particular Jackson.
They are embedded within other non-derivative host financial instruments and insurance contracts to create hybrid instruments.
Embedded derivatives meeting the definition of an insurance contract are accounted for under IFRS 4.
Where economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivatives are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host instrument, and where the hybrid instrument is not measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognised in the income statement, the embedded derivative is bifurcated and carried at fair value as a derivative in accordance with IAS 39.
For Jacksons not for life Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit and Fixed Index Annuity reserves the determination of fair value requires assumptions regarding future mix of Separate Account assets, equity volatility levels, and policyholder behaviour.
In addition, the Group applies the option under IFRS 4 to not separate and fair value surrender options embedded in host contracts and with-profits investment contracts whose strike price is either a fixed amount or a fixed amount plus interest.
Further details on the valuation basis for embedded derivatives attaching to Jacksons life assurance contracts are provided in note C4.2.
Financial statements A: Background and accounting policies Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 145 vii Securities lending including repurchase agreements The Group is party to various securities lending agreements under which securities are loaned to third parties on a short-term basis.
The loaned securities are not derecognised: rather, they continue to be recognised within the appropriate investment classification.
The Groups policy is that collateral in excess of 100 per cent of the fair value of securities loaned is required from all securities borrowers and typically consists of cash, debt securities, equity securities or letters of credit.
In cases where the Group takes possession of the collateral under its securities lending programme, the collateral, and corresponding obligation to return such collateral, are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position.
viii Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities The Groups policy is to derecognise financial assets when it is deemed that substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities only when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or has expired.
ix Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit and loss Consistent with the Groups risk management and investment strategy and the nature of the products concerned, the Group has designated under IAS 39 classification certain financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss as these instruments are managed and their performance evaluated on a fair value basis.
These instruments include liabilities related to consolidated collateralised debt obligations and net assets attributable to unit holders of consolidated unit trusts and similar funds.
k  The total tax charge for the Group reflects tax that in addition to relating to shareholders profits is also attributable to policyholders and unallocated surplus of with-profits funds and unit-linked policies.
This is explained in more detail in note B5.
Reported profit before the total tax charge is not representative of pre-tax profits attributable to shareholders.
Accordingly, in order to provide a measure of pre-tax profits attributable to shareholders the Group has chosen to adopt an income statement presentation of the tax charge and pre-tax results that distinguishes between policyholder and shareholder components.
l Segments Under IFRS 8, Operating Segments, the Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is internally provided to the Group Executive Committee which is the Groups chief operating decision maker.
The operating segments identified by the Group reflect the Groups organisational structure, which is by both geography Asia, US and UK and by product line insurance operations and asset management.
The products of the insurance operations contain both significant and insignificant levels of insurance risk.
The products are managed together and there is no distinction between these two categories other than for accounting purposes.
This segment also includes the commission earned on general insurance business and investment subsidiaries held to support the Groups insurance operations.
Asset management comprises both internal and third-party asset management services, inclusive of portfolio and mutual fund management, where the Group acts as an advisor, and broker-dealer activities.
The nature of the products and the managing of the business differ from the risks inherent in the insurance operations segments, and the regulatory environment of the asset management industry differs from that of the insurance operations segments.
Further information on the Groups operating segments is provided in note B1.3.
m  The Group uses operating profit based on longer-term investment returns as the segmental measure of its results.
The basis of calculation is disclosed in note B1.3.
For shareholder-backed business, with the exception of debt securities held by Jackson and assets classified as loans and receivables at amortised cost, all financial investments and investment property are designated as assets at fair value through profit and loss.
The short-term fluctuations affect the result for the year and the Group provides additional analysis of results before and after short-term fluctuations in investment returns, together with other items that are of a short-term, volatile or one-off nature.
Short-term fluctuations in investment returns on such assets held by with-profits funds do not affect directly reported shareholder results.
This is because i the unallocated surplus of with-profits funds is accounted for as a liability and ii excess or deficits of income and expenditure of the funds over the required surplus for distribution are transferred to or from unallocated surplus.
n Borrowings Although initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs, borrowings, excluding liabilities of consolidated collateralised debt obligations, are subsequently accounted for on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method.
Under the effective interest method, the difference between the redemption value of the borrowing and the initial proceeds net of related issue costs is amortised through the income statement to the date of maturity or, for hybrid debt, over the expected life of the instrument.
o Investmentproperties Investments in leasehold and freehold properties not for occupation by the Group, including properties under development for future use as investment properties, are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in the income statement.
Properties are valued annually either by the Groups qualified surveyors or by taking into consideration the advice of professional external valuers using the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors valuation standards.
Each property is externally valued at least once every three years.
Leases of investment property where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases leasehold property.
Finance leases are capitalised at the leases inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
146 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements A:  A3:  p Pensionschemes For the Groups defined benefit schemes, if the present value of the defined benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of the scheme assets, then a liability is recorded in the Groups statement of financial position.
By contrast, if the fair value of the assets exceeds the present value of the defined benefit obligation then the surplus will only be recognised if the nature of the arrangements under the trust deed, and funding arrangements between the Trustee and the Company, support the availability of refunds or recoverability through agreed reductions in future contributions.
In addition, if there is a constructive obligation for the Company to pay deficit funding, this is also recognised such that the financial position recorded for the scheme reflects the higher of any underlying IAS 19 deficit and the obligation for deficit funding.
The Group utilises the projected unit credit method to calculate the defined benefit obligation.
This method sees each period of service as giving rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and measures each unit separately to build up the final obligation.
Estimated future cash flows are then discounted at a high-quality corporate bond rate, adjusted to allow for the difference in duration between the bond index and the pension liabilities where appropriate, to determine its present value.
These calculations are performed by independent actuaries.
The plan assets of the Groups pension schemes exclude several insurance contracts that have been issued by the Group.
These assets are excluded from plan assets in determining the pension obligation recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The aggregate of the actuarially determined service costs of the currently employed personnel and the net interest on the net defined benefit liability asset at the start of the period is charged to the income statement.
Actuarial and other gains and losses as a result of changes in assumptions or experience variances are recognised as other comprehensive income.
Contributions to the Groups defined contribution schemes are expensed when due.
q  The Group offers share award and option plans for certain key employees and a Save As You Earn plan for all UK and certain overseas employees.
Shares held in trust relating to these plans are conditionally gifted to employees.
The compensation expense charged to the income statement is primarily based upon the fair value of the options granted, the vesting period and the vesting conditions.
The Company has established trusts to facilitate the delivery of Prudential plc shares under employee incentive plans and savings-related share option schemes.
The cost to the Company of acquiring these treasury shares held in trusts is shown as a deduction from shareholders equity.
r Tax Current tax expense is charged or credited based upon amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable amounts for the current year.
To the extent that losses of an individual UK company are not offset in any one year, they can be carried back for one year or carried forward indefinitely to be offset against profits arising from the same company.
Deferred taxes are provided under the liability method for all relevant temporary differences.
IAS 12, Income Taxes does not require all temporary differences to be provided for, in particular, the Group does not provide for deferred tax on undistributed earnings of subsidiaries where the Group is able to control the timing of the distribution and the temporary difference created is not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised when it is more likely than not that future taxable profits will be available against which these losses can be utilised.
The tax charge for long-term business includes tax expense attributable to both policyholders and shareholders.
In the UK, life insurance companies are taxed on both their shareholders profits and on their policyholders insurance and investment returns on certain insurance and investment products.
Tax on shareholders profits is calculated at the standard corporation tax rate, and tax on policyholders investment returns is calculated at the basic rate of income tax.
Although both types of tax are included in the total tax charge in the Groups consolidated income statement, they are presented separately in the income statement to provide the most relevant information about tax that the Group pays on its profits.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or are substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
s  Business acquisitions are accounted for by applying the purchase method of accounting, which adjusts the net assets of the acquired company to fair value at the date of purchase.
The excess of the acquisition consideration over the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity is recorded as goodwill.
Expenses related to acquiring new subsidiaries are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
Income and expenses of acquired entities are included in the income statement from the date of acquisition.
Income and expenses of entities sold during the period are included in the income statement up to the date of disposal.
The gain or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between sale proceeds net of selling costs, less the net assets of the entity at the date of disposal adjusted for foreign exchange movements attaching to the sold entity that are required to be recycled to the income statement under IAS 21.
Financial statements A: Background and accounting policies Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 147 t Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses is capitalised and carried on the Group statement of financial position as an intangible asset at initial value less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill impairment testing is conducted annually and when there is an indication of impairment.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units.
u Intangibleassets Intangible assets acquired on the purchase of a subsidiary or portfolio of contracts are fair valued at acquisition.
Deferred acquisition costs are accounted for as described in policy notes d and f above.
Other intangible assets, such as distribution rights and software, are valued initially at the price paid to acquire them and are subsequently carried at cost less amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Distribution rights relate to fees paid under bancassurance partnership arrangements for bank distribution of products for the term of the contract.
Amounts for distribution rights are amortised on a basis to reflect the pattern in which the future economic benefits are expected to be consumed by reference to new business levels.
The same principles apply to determining the amortisation method for other intangible assets unless the pattern cannot be determined reliably, in which case a straight line method is applied.
v  Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank and in hand, deposits held at call with banks, treasury bills and other short-term highly liquid investments with less than 90 days maturity from the date of acquisition.
w  Interim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are paid.
Final dividends are recorded in the period in which they are approved by shareholders.
x Sharecapital Where there is no obligation to transfer assets, shares are classified as equity.
The difference between the proceeds received on issue of the shares, net of share issue costs, and the nominal value of the shares issued, is credited to share premium.
Where the Company purchases shares for the purposes of employee incentive plans, the consideration paid, net of issue costs, is deducted from retained earnings.
Upon issue or sale any consideration received is credited to retained earnings net of related costs.
y Foreignexchange The Groups consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, the Groups presentation currency.
Accordingly, the results and financial position of foreign subsidiaries must be translated into the presentation currency of the Group from their functional currencies, ie the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.
All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are converted at year end exchange rates whilst all income and expenses are converted at average exchange rates where this is a reasonable approximation of the rates prevailing on transaction dates.
The impact of these currency translations is recorded as a separate component in the statement of comprehensive income.
Foreign currency borrowings that are used to provide a hedge against Group equity investments in overseas subsidiaries are translated at year end exchange rates and movements recognised in other comprehensive income.
Other foreign currency monetary items are translated at year end exchange rates with changes recognised in the income statement.
Foreign currency transactions are translated at the spot rate prevailing at the time.
z Earningspershare Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held in employee share trusts and consolidated unit trusts and Open Ended Investment Companies OEICs, which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Groups only class of potentially dilutive ordinary shares are those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
No adjustment is made if the impact is anti-dilutive overall.
148 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements A:  A3.2  The following standards, interpretations and amendments have been issued but are not yet effective in 2013, including those which have not yet been adopted in the EU.
This is not intended to be a complete list as only those standards, interpretations and amendments that could have an impact upon the Groups financial statements are discussed.
 This amendment, effective on or after 1 January 2014, clarifies the offsetting criteria of financial assets and liabilities.
In particular the amendment clarifies that in order to meet criteria to offset a financial asset and a financial liability, a right to set-off must be currently available rather than being contingent on a future event.
Further, the right to set-off must be exercisable by any of the counterparties, both in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency and bankruptcy.
The Group is assessing the impact of this amendment but it is not expected to have a significant effect on the Groups financial statements.
 These improvements include minor changes to ten IFRS standards, and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014.
The Group is assessing the impact of these amendments but they are not expected to have a significant effect on the Groups financial statements.
IFRIC21, Levies IFRIC 21, Levies, issued in May 2013, is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
It has not yet been endorsed for use in the EU.
This interpretation clarifies that an entity recognises a liability for a levy imposed by a government that is not income tax when the activity that triggers payment, as identified by the relevant legislation, occurs.
The Group is assessing the impact of this interpretation but it is not expected to have a material effect on the Groups financial statements.
IFRS9, Financialinstruments: This standard when effective will automatically replace IAS 39, Financial Instruments Recognition and measurement.
Under the current version of IFRS 9 the classification and hence measurement of financial assets would be on two bases, either amortised cost or fair value through profit or loss, rather than the existing four bases of classification.
These requirements maintain the existing amortised cost measurement for most liabilities but will require changes in fair value due to changes in the entitys own credit risk to be recognised in the other comprehensive income section of the comprehensive income statement, rather than within profit or loss for liabilities measured at fair value.
Notwithstanding these prospective requirements, under the current version of IFRS 9, on 28 November 2012, the IASB released an exposure draft proposing amendments.
The proposed changes would introduce a fair value through other comprehensive income category which would include certain financial assets that contain contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest and are held in a business model in which assets are managed both in order to collect contractual cash flows and for sale.
The Group is assessing the impact of this standard and will consider the remaining phases of IFRS 9 when finalised by the IASB.
IFRS 9 has not yet been endorsed for use in the EU and there is currently no mandatory effective date pending the finalisation of its remaining phases.

c Derivatives other than equity-related : negative fluctuation of 531 million 2012: positive fluctuation of 135 million net of related amortisation of deferred acquisition costs.
These losses and gains are in respect of interest rate swaps and swaptions and for the Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit GMIB reinsurance.
The swaps and swaptions are undertaken to manage interest rate exposures and durations within the general account and the variable annuity and fixed index annuity guarantees as described in note d below.
The GMIB reinsurance is in place so as to insulate Jackson from the GMIB exposure.
The amounts principally reflect the fair value movement on these instruments, net of related amortisation of deferred acquisition costs.
Under the Groups IFRS reporting of Jacksons derivatives other than equity-related programme significant accounting mismatches arise.
This is because: The derivatives are required to be fair valued with the value movements booked in the income statement: As noted above, part of the derivative value movements arises in respect of interest rate exposures within Jacksons guarantee liabilities for variable annuity and fixed index annuity business which are only partially fair valued under IFRS see below : and The GMIB liability is valued under the US GAAP insurance measurement basis applied for IFRS in a way that substantially does not recognise the effect of market movements.
However, notwithstanding that the liability is reinsured, as the reinsurance asset is net settled it is deemed a derivative under IAS 39 which requires fair valuation.
In 2013, the negative fluctuation of 531 million reflects principally the adverse mark-to-market impact of the 1.3 per cent increase in swap rates on the valuation of the interest rate swaps, swaptions, and the GMIB reinsurance asset.
d Net equity hedge result: negative fluctuation of 255 million 2012: negative fluctuation 302 million.
These amounts are in respect of the equity-based derivatives and associated guarantee liabilities of Jacksons variable and fixed index annuity business.
The equity based derivatives are undertaken to manage the equity risk exposure of the guarantee liabilities.
The economic exposure of these guarantee liabilities also includes the effects of changes in interest rates which are managed through the swaps and swaptions programmes described in note c above.
The amounts reflect the net effect of: Fair value movements on free-standing equity derivatives: The accounting value movements on the variable annuity and fixed index annuity guarantee liabilities: Fee assessments and claim payments in respect of guarantee liabilities: and Related DAC amortisation.
Under the Groups IFRS reporting of Jacksons equity-based derivatives and associated guarantee liabilities significant accounting mismatches arise.
This is because: The free-standing derivatives and Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit GMWB not for life embedded derivative liabilities are required to be fair valued.
These fair value movements include the effects of changes to levels of equity markets, implied volatility and interest rates.
The interest rate exposure is managed through the derivative programme explained above in note c : The Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit GMDB and GMWB for life guarantees are valued under the US GAAP insurance measurement basis applied for IFRS in a way that substantially does not recognise the effect of equity market and interest rate changes.
In 2013, the negative fluctuation of 255 million reflects the net effect of mark-to-market reductions on the free-standing derivatives being offset by reductions in the carrying amounts of those guarantees that are fair valued embedded derivatives.
Both aspects reflect increased equity markets the S&P 500 increased by 30 per cent with the value movement on the embedded derivatives also being affected by decreases in average implied volatility levels and the 1.3 per cent increase in Treasury bond interest rates.
iv UK insurance operations The negative short-term fluctuations in investment returns for UK insurance operations of 254 million 2012: positive 136 million reflect mainly net investment movements arising in the period on fixed income assets backing the capital of the annuity business following the rise in bond yields during the year.
In addition, the amount for 2013 includes the effect of a partial hedge of future shareholder transfers expected to emerge from the UKs with-profits sub-fund taken out during the year.
This hedge reduces the risk arising from equity market declines.
v Economic hedge value movement This item represents the cost on short-dated hedge contracts taken out in first half of 2012 to provide downside protection against severe equity market falls through a period of particular uncertainty with respect to the Eurozone.
The hedge contracts were terminated in the second half of 2012. vi Other Short-term fluctuations in investment returns of other operations, were negative 27 million 2012: positive 119 million representing principally unrealised value movements on investments and foreign exchange items.
152 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements B:  B1:  B1.3  Operatingsegments The Groups operating segments, determined in accordance with IFRS 8, Operating Segments, are as follows: Insurance operations Asia US Jackson UK Asset management operations M&G including Prudential Capital Eastspring Investments US broker-dealer and asset management including Curian The Groups operating segments are also its reportable segments for the purposes of internal management reporting with the exception of Prudential Capital PruCap which has been incorporated into the M&G operating segment for the purposes of segment reporting.
Performancemeasure The performance measure of operating segments utilised by the Company is IFRS operating profit attributable to shareholders based on longer-term investment returns, as described below.
This measurement basis distinguishes operating profit based on long-term investment returns from other constituents of the total profit as follows: Short-term fluctuations in investment returns: Amortisation of acquisition accounting adjustments arising on the purchase of business.
This comprises principally the charge for the adjustments arising on the purchase of REALIC in 2012: For 2012, gain on dilution of the Groups holdings in PPM South Africa: Loss profit attaching to the held for sale Japan life business.
See note D1 for further details: and For 2013, the costs associated with the domestication of the Hong Kong branch.
Segment results that are reported to the Group Executive Committee include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Unallocated items are mainly in relation to the Group Head Office and the Asia Regional Head Office.
Except in the case of assets backing the UK annuity, unit-linked and US variable annuity separate account liabilities, operating profit based on longer-term investment returns for shareholder-financed business is determined on the basis of expected longer-term investment returns.
In the case of assets backing the UK annuity business, unit-linked and US variable annuity separate account liabilities, the basis of determining operating profit based on longer-term investment returns is as follows: UK annuity business liabilities: For this business, policyholder liabilities are determined by reference to current interest rates.
The value movements of the assets covering liabilities are closely correlated with the related change in liabilities.
Accordingly, asset value movements are recorded within the operating results based on longer-term investment returns.
Policyholder liabilities include a margin for credit risk.
Variations between actual and best estimate expected impairments are recorded as a component of short-term fluctuations in investment returns: and Unit-linked and US variable annuity business separate account liabilities: For such business, the policyholder unit liabilities are directly reflective of the asset value movements.
Accordingly, the operating results based on longer-term investment returns reflect the current period value movements in unit liabilities and the backing assets.
In the case of other shareholder-financed business, the measurement of operating profit based on longer-term investment returns reflects the particular features of long-term insurance business where assets and liabilities are held for the long-term and for which the accounting basis for insurance liabilities under current IFRS is not generally conducive to demonstrating trends in underlying performance of life businesses exclusive of the effects of short-term fluctuations in market conditions.
In determining the profit on this basis, the following key elements are applied to the results of the Groups shareholder-financed operations.
a Debt, equity-type securities and loans Longer-term investment returns comprise actual income receivable for the period interest dividend income and for both debt and equity-type securities longer-term capital returns.
In principle, for debt securities and loans, the longer-term capital returns comprise two elements: Risk margin reserve based charge for the expected level of defaults for the period, which is determined by reference to the credit quality of the portfolio.
The difference between impairment losses in the reporting period and the risk margin reserve charge to the operating result is reflected in short-term fluctuations in investment returns: and The amortisation of interest-related realised gains and losses to operating results based on longer-term investment returns to the date when sold bonds would have otherwise matured.
Financial statements B: Earnings performance Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 153 Jackson is the shareholder-backed operation for which the distinction between impairment losses and interest-related realised gains and losses is in practice relevant to a significant extent.
Jackson has used the ratings by Nationally Recognised Statistical Ratings Organisations NRSRO or ratings resulting from the regulatory ratings detail issued by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC developed by external third parties such as PIMCO or BlackRock Solutions to determine the average annual risk margin reserve to apply to debt securities held to back general account business.
Debt securities held to back separate account and reinsurance funds withheld are not subject to risk margin reserve charge.
Further details of the risk margin reserve charge, as well as the amortisation of interest-related realised gains and losses, for Jackson are shown in note B1.2.
For debt securities backing non-linked shareholder-financed business of the UK insurance operations other than the annuity business and of the Asia insurance operations, the realised gains and losses are principally interest related.
Accordingly, all realised gains and losses to date for these operations are being amortised over the period to the date those securities would otherwise have matured, with no explicit risk margin reserve charge.
At 31 December 2013, the level of unamortised interest-related realised gains and losses related to previously sold bonds for the Group was a net gain of 461 million 2012: net gain of 495 million.
For equity-type securities, the longer-term rates of return are estimates of the long-term trend investment return for income and capital having regard to past performance, current trends and future expectations.
Equity-type securities held for shareholder-financed operations other than the UK annuity business, unit-linked and US variable annuity are of significance for the US and Asia insurance operations.
Different rates apply to different categories of equity-type securities.
As at 31 December 2013, the equity-type securities for US insurance non-separate account operations amounted to 1,118 million 2012: 1,004 million.
For these operations, the longer-term rates of return for income and capital applied in 2013 and 2012, which reflect the combination of risk free rates and appropriate risk premiums, are as follows: 2013 2012 Equity-type securities such as common and preferred stock and portfolio holdings in mutual funds 5.7% to 6.8% 5.5% to 6.2% Other equity-type securities such as investments in limited partnerships and private equity funds 7.7% to 9.0% 7.5% to 8.2% For Asia insurance operations, excluding assets of the Japan life held for sale business, investments in equity securities held for non-linked shareholder-financed operations amounted to 571 million as at 31 December 2013 2012: 474 million.
The rates of return applied in the years 2013 and 2012 ranged from 3.42 per cent to 13.75 per cent with the rates applied varying by territory.
The longer-term rates of return discussed above for equity-type securities are determined after consideration by the Groups in-house economists of long-term expected real government bond returns, equity risk premium and long-term inflation.
These rates are broadly stable from period to period but may be different between countries reflecting, for example, differing expectations of inflation in each territory.
The assumptions are for returns expected to apply in equilibrium conditions.
The assumed rates of return do not reflect any cyclical variability in economic performance and are not set by reference to prevailing asset valuations.
The longer-term investment returns for the Asia insurance joint ventures accounted for on the equity method are determined on a similar basis as the other Asia insurance operations described above.
b US variable and fixed index annuity business The following value movements for Jacksons variable and fixed index annuity business are excluded from operating profit based on longer-term investment returns: Fair value movements for equity-based derivatives: Fair value movements for embedded derivatives for Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit not for life and fixed index annuity business, and Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit reinsurance see note : Movements in accounts carrying value of Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit and Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit for life liabilities, for which, under the grandfathered US GAAP applied under IFRS for Jacksons insurance assets and liabilities, the measurement basis gives rise to a muted impact of current period market movements: Fee assessments and claim payments, in respect of guarantee liabilities: and Related amortisation of deferred acquisition costs for each of the above items.
Note: US operations Embedded derivatives for variable annuity guarantee features The Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit liability, which is fully reinsured, subject to a deductible and annual claim limits, is accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Subtopic 944-80 Financial Services Insurance Separate Accounts formerly SOP 03-1 under IFRS using grandfathered US GAAP.
As the corresponding reinsurance asset is net settled, it is considered to be a derivative under IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, and the asset is therefore recognised at fair value.
As the Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit is economically reinsured the mark to market element of the reinsurance asset is included as a component of short-term fluctuations in investment returns.
154 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements B:  B1:  c Other derivative value movements Generally, derivative value movements are excluded from operating results based on longer-term investment returns unless those derivative value movements broadly offset changes in the accounting value of other assets and liabilities included in operating profit.
The principal example of non-equity based derivatives for example interest rate swaps and swaptions whose value movements are excluded from operating profit arises in Jackson.
Non-equity based derivatives are primarily held by Jackson as part of a broadly-based hedging programme for features of Jacksons bond portfolio for which value movements are booked in the statement of comprehensive income rather than the income statement, product liabilities for which US GAAP accounting as grandfathered under IFRS 4 does not fully reflect the economic features being hedged, and the interest rate exposure attaching to equity-based embedded derivatives.
d Other liabilities to policyholders and embedded derivatives for product guarantees Under IFRS, the degree to which the carrying values of liabilities to policyholders are sensitive to current market conditions varies between territories depending upon the nature of the grandfathered measurement basis.
In general, in those instances where the liabilities are particularly sensitive to routine changes in market conditions, the accounting basis is such that the impact of market movements on the assets and liabilities is broadly equivalent in the income statement, and operating profit based on longer-term investments returns is not distorted.
In these circumstances, there is no need for the movement in the liability to be bifurcated between the elements that relate to longer-term market conditions and short-term effects.
However, some types of business movements in liabilities do require bifurcation to ensure that at the net level ie after allocated investment return and change for policyholder benefits the operating result reflects longer-term market returns.
Examples where such bifurcation is necessary are: Asia Hong Kong For certain non-participating business, the economic features are more akin to asset management products with policyholder liabilities reflecting asset shares over the contract term.
For these products, the charge for policyholder benefits in the operating results should reflect the asset share feature rather than volatile movements that would otherwise be reflected if the local regulatory basis also applied for IFRS basis was used.
For other Hong Kong non-participating business, longer-term interest rates are used to determine the movement in policyholder liabilities for determining operating results.
Similar principles apply for other Asia operations.
UK shareholder-backed annuity business The operating result based on longer-term investment returns reflects the impact of value movements on policyholder liabilities for annuity business in PRIL and the PAC non-profit sub-fund after adjustments to allocate the following elements of the movement to the category of short-term fluctuations in investment returns: The impact on credit risk provisioning of actual upgrades and downgrades during the period: Credit experience compared to assumptions: and Short-term value movements on assets backing the capital of the business.
Credit experience reflects the impact of defaults and other similar experience, such as asset exchanges arising from debt restructuring by issuers that include effectively an element of permanent impairment of the security held.
Negative experience compared to assumptions is included within short-term fluctuations in investment returns without further adjustment.
This is to be contrasted with positive experience where surpluses are retained in short-term allowances for credit risk for IFRS reporting purposes.
The effects of other changes to credit risk provisioning are included in the operating result, as is the net effect of changes to the valuation rate of interest due to portfolio rebalancing to align more closely with management benchmark.
e Fund management and other non-insurance businesses For these businesses, the particular features applicable for life assurance noted above do not apply.
For these businesses it is inappropriate to include returns in the operating result on the basis described above.
Instead, it is appropriate to generally include realised gains and losses including impairments in the operating result with unrealised gains and losses being included in short-term fluctuations.
For this purpose impairments are calculated as the credit loss determined by comparing the projected cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate to the carrying value.
In some instances it may also be appropriate to amortise realised gains and losses on derivatives and other financial instruments to operating results over a time period that reflects the underlying economic substance of the arrangements.

c  The fair value amounts estimated on the date of grant relating to all options including conditional nil cost options and awards, were determined using the Black-Scholes and the Monte Carlo option-pricing models using the following assumptions: 2013 2012 Prudential LTIP GPSP SAYE Other SAYE Other TSR options awards GPSP options awards Dividend yield % 2.73 3.63 Expected volatility % 23.64 24.27 33.03 34.33 Risk-free interest rate % 0.73 1.06 0.31 0.39 Expected option life years 3.46 3.24 Weighted average exercise price 9.01 6.29 Weighted average share price 11.80 11.85 6.78 8.26 Weighted average fair value 7.38 3.00 11.06 3.91 2.28 6.72 Financial statements B: Earnings performance Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 163 Compensation costs for all share-based compensation plans are determined using the Black-Scholes model, Monte Carlo model or other market consistent valuation methods.
The compensation costs for all awards and options are recognised in net income over the plans respective vesting periods.
The Group uses the Black-Scholes model to value all options and awards other than the Prudential LTIP TSR, GPSP and UK BUPP, for which the Group uses a Monte Carlo model in order to allow for the impact of the TSR performance conditions.
These models are used to calculate fair values for share options and awards at the grant date based on the quoted market price of the stock at the measurement date, the amount, if any, that the employees are required to pay, the dividend yield, expected volatility, risk-free interest rates and exercise prices.
For all options and awards, the expected volatility is based on the market implied volatilities for Prudential shares as quoted on Bloomberg.
The Prudential specific at-the-money implied volatilities are adjusted to allow for the different terms and discounted exercise price on SAYE options by using information on the volatility surface of the FTSE 100.
Risk-free interest rates are UK gilt rates with projections for three-year and five-year terms to match corresponding vesting periods.
Dividend yield is determined as the average yield over a period of 12 months up to and including the date of grant.
For the Prudential LTIP TSR and GPSP TSR volatility and correlation between Prudential and a basket of 18 competitor companies is required.
For grants in 2013, an average index volatility and correlation of 26 per cent and 60 per cent respectively, were used.
Market implied volatilities are used for both Prudential and the components of the index.
Changes to the subjective input assumptions could materially affect the fair value estimate.

In 2012, the basis of determining the valuation rate of interest was altered to align with a permitted practice of the Hong Kong authorities for regulatory reporting.
The main change is to apply a valuation rate of interest that incorporates a reinvestment yield that is weighted by reference to current and the historical three-year average rather than the year end rate.
The change reduced the carrying value of policyholder liabilities at 31 December 2012 by 95 million.
This benefit is included within the short-term fluctuations in investment returns in the Groups supplementary analysis of profit.
The 2012 operating profit also included the 51 million gain on sale of stake in China Life of Taiwan.
b   Jackson applies a mean reversion technique for amortisation of deferred acquisition costs on variable annuity business which dampens the effects of short-term market movements on expected gross profits against which deferred acquisition costs are amortised.
To the extent that the mean reversion methodology does not fully dampen the effects of market returns, there is a charge or credit for accelerated or decelerated amortisation.
For 2013, reflecting the positive market returns in the year, there was a credit for decelerated amortisation of 82 million 2012: 56 million to the operating profit based on longer-term investment returns.
See note C5.1 b for further details.
Other In 2013, Jackson revised its projected long-term separate account return from 8.4 per cent to 7.4 per cent net of external fund management fees.
The effect of this change together with other assumption changes and recalibration of modelling of accounting values of guarantees gave rise to a net benefit of 6 million to profit before tax.
c  Annuitybusiness: For IFRS reporting, the results for UK shareholder-backed annuity business are particularly sensitive to the allowances made for credit risk.
The allowance is reflected in the deduction from the valuation rate of interest for discounting projected future annuity payments to policyholders that would have otherwise applied.
Credit risk allowance comprises i an amount for long-term best estimate defaults, and ii additional provisions for credit risk premium, downgrade resilience and short-term defaults.
Prudential Retirement Income Limited PRIL is the principal company which writes the UKs shareholder backed business.

ii Long-term expected defaults are derived by applying Moodys data from 1970 to 2009 and the definition of the credit rating used is the second highest credit rating published by Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch.
iii Additional provisions comprise credit risk premium, which is derived from Moodys data from 1970 to 2009, an allowance for a one-notch downgrade of the portfolio subject to credit risk and an additional allowance for short-term defaults.
The prudent Pillar 1 regulatory basis reflects the overriding objective of maintaining sufficient provisions and capital to ensure payments to policyholders can be made.
The approach for IFRS aims to establish liabilities that are closer to best estimate.
Financial statements B: Earnings performance Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 165 Movement in the credit risk allowance The movement during 2013 of the average basis points allowance for PRIL on Pillar 1 regulatory and IFRS bases are as follows: Pillar1 Regulatory basis IFRS bps bps Total Total Total allowance for credit risk at 31 December 2012 65 42 Credit rating changes 2 1 Asset trading 3 2 New business and other 2 2 Total allowance for credit risk at 31 December 2013 62 43 The methodology applied is to retain favourable credit experience in short-term allowances for credit risk on the IFRS basis but such surplus experience is not retained in the Pillar 1 credit provisions.
Overall the movement has led to the credit allowance for Pillar 1 purposes to be 47 per cent 2012: 40 per cent of the bond spread over swap rates.
For IFRS purposes it represents 32 per cent 2012: 26 per cent of the bond spread over swap rates.

The current tax charge of 399 million includes 18 million 2012: 17 million in respect of the tax charge for the Hong Kong operation.
The Hong Kong current tax charge is calculated as 16.5 per cent for all periods on either i 5 per cent of the net insurance premium or ii the estimated assessable profits, depending on the nature of the business written.
Until the end of 2012 for the Groups UK life insurance companies, shareholders profits were calculated using regulatory surplus as a starting point, with appropriate deferred tax adjustments for IFRS.
Beginning in 2013, under new UK life tax rules, shareholders profits are calculated using accounting profit or loss as a starting point.
The total tax charge comprises tax attributable to policyholders and unallocated surplus of with-profits funds, unit-linked policies and shareholders as shown below.

The principal reason for the increase in the tax charge attributable to policyholders returns is an increase in deferred tax on net unrealised gains on investments in UK insurance operations.
The credit of 69 million on unrealised gains and losses on investments shown in the table below reflects a credit on unrealised losses on investments in US insurance operations which exceeds the charge on UK insurance operations.
The total deferred tax charge arises as follows: 2013 m 2012 m Unrealised gains and losses on investments 69 89 Balances relating to investment and insurance contracts 44 467 Short-term timing differences 314 206 Capital allowances 7 Unused tax losses 41 328 Deferred tax charge 337 156 The 2012 comparative results have been adjusted from those previously published for the retrospective application of the new and amended accounting standards described in note A2.

Financial statements B: Earnings performance Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 167 b  For the purposes of explaining the relationship between tax expense and accounting profit, it is appropriate to consider the sources of profit and tax by reference to those that are attributable to shareholders and policyholders.

For the column entitled Attributable to policyholders, the profit loss before tax represents income, before tax attributable to policyholders and unallocated surplus of with-profits funds and unit-linked policies.
This income has been determined after deduction of charges for policyholder benefits and movements on unallocated surplus which are determined net of tax.
Hence, the pre-tax results attributable to policyholders is the inverse of the tax charge attributable to policyholders.

For the purposes of this table and subsequent explanation, references to the WPSF also include, for convenience, the amounts attaching to the Defined Charges Participating Sub-fund which comprises 3.6 per cent of the total assets of the WPSF and includes the with-profits annuity business transferred to Prudential from the Equitable Life Assurance Society on 1 December 2007 with assets of approximately 1.7 billion.
Profits to shareholders on this with-profits annuity business emerge on a charges less expenses basis and policyholders are entitled to 100 per cent of the investment earnings.
ii The Hong Kong branch balance is reported within the unallocated surplus of the PAC with-profits sub-fund and excludes policyholder liabilities of the Hong Kong branch of PAC.
iii The fund is solely for the benefit of policyholders of SAIF.
Shareholders have no interest in the profits of this fund although they are entitled to asset management fees on this business.
SAIF is a separate sub-fund within the PAC long-term business fund.

Notes i Assets carried at cost or amortised cost are subject to impairment testing where appropriate under IFRS requirements.
This category also includes assets which are valued by reference to specific IFRS standards such as reinsurers share of insurance contract liabilities, deferred tax assets and investments accounted for under the equity method.
ii Realised gains and losses on the Groups investments for 2013 recognised in the income statement amounted to a net gain of 2.5 billion 2012: 6.8 billion.
iii The carrying value of investment contracts with discretionary participation features is on IFRS 4 basis.
It is impractical to determine the fair value of these contracts due to the lack of a reliable basis to measure participation features.
iv Loans and receivables are reported net of allowance for loan losses of 62 million 2012: 83 million.
v As at 31 December 2013 495 million 2012: 525 million of convertible bonds were included in debt securities and 1,078 million 2012: 673 million were included in borrowings.

188 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements C:  C3:  C3.2  The section provides detail of the designation and valuation of the Groups financial assets and liabilities shown under the following categories: a  The fair values of the assets and liabilities of the Group have been determined on the following bases.
The fair values of the financial instruments for which fair valuation is required under IFRS are determined by the use of current market bid prices for exchange-quoted investments, or by using quotations from independent third-parties, such as brokers and pricing services or by using appropriate valuation techniques.
The estimated fair value of derivative financial instruments reflects the estimated amount the Group would receive or pay in an arms length transaction.
This amount is determined using quoted prices if exchange listed, quotations from independent third parties or valued internally using standard market practices.
The loans and receivables have been shown net of provisions for impairment.
The fair value of loans has been estimated from discounted cash flows expected to be received.
The rate of discount used was the market rate of interest where applicable.
The fair value of investment properties is based on market values as assessed by professionally qualified external valuers or by the Groups qualified surveyors.
The fair value of the subordinated and senior debt issued by the parent company is determined using the quoted prices from independent third parties.
The fair value of financial liabilities other than derivative financial instruments is determined using discounted cash flows of the amounts expected to be paid.
b  Assets and liabilities carried at fair value on the statement of financial position The table below shows the assets and liabilities carried at fair value analysed by level of the IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement defined fair value hierarchy.
This hierarchy is based on the inputs to the fair value measurement and reflects the lowest level input that is significant to that measurement.

Where appropriate, the observable market interest rate has been used and the assets and liabilities are classified within level 2.
Otherwise, they are included as level 3 assets or liabilities.
The fair value included for the subordinated and senior debt issued by the parent company is determined using the quoted prices from independent third parties.
192 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements C:  C3:  c  A significant proportion of the Groups level 2 assets are corporate bonds, structured securities and other non-national government debt securities.
These assets, in line with market practice, are generally valued using independent pricing services or third-party broker quotes.
These valuations are determined using independent external quotations from multiple sources and are subject to a number of monitoring controls, such as monthly price variances, stale price reviews and variance analysis on prices achieved on subsequent trades.
Pricing services, where available, are used to obtain the third-party broker quotes.
Where pricing services providers are used, a single valuation is obtained and applied.
When prices are not available from pricing services, quotes are sourced directly from brokers.
Prudential seeks to obtain a number of quotes from different brokers so as to obtain the most comprehensive information available on their executability.
Where quotes are sourced directly from brokers, the price used in the valuation is normally selected from one of the quotes based on a number of factors, including the timeliness and regularity of the quotes and the accuracy of the quotes considering the spreads provided.
The selected quote is the one which best represents an executable quote for the security at the measurement date.
Generally, no adjustment is made to the prices obtained from independent third parties.
Adjustment is made in only limited circumstances, where it is determined that the third-party valuations obtained do not reflect fair value eg either because the value is stale and or the values are extremely diverse in range.
These are usually securities which are distressed or that could be subject to a debt restructure or where reliable market prices are no longer available due to an inactive market or market dislocation.
In these instances, prices are derived using internal valuation techniques including those as described above in this note with the objective of arriving at a fair value measurement which reflects the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants on the measurement date.
The techniques used require a number of assumptions relating to variables such as credit risk and interest rates.
Examples of such variables include an average credit spread based on the corporate bond universe and the relevant duration of the asset being valued.
Prudential determines the input assumptions based on the best available information at the measurement dates.
Securities valued in such manner are classified as level 3 where these significant inputs are not based on observable market data.
Of the total level 2 debt securities of 100,687 million at 31 December 2013 2012: 105,105 million, 8,556 million are valued internally 2012: 8,248 million.
The majority of such securities are valued using matrix pricing, which is based on assessing the credit quality of the underlying borrower to derive a suitable discount rate relative to government securities of a comparable duration.
Under matrix pricing, the debt securities are priced taking the credit spreads on comparable quoted public debt securities and applying these to the equivalent debt instruments factoring in a specified liquidity premium.
The majority of the parameters used in this valuation technique are readily observable in the market and, therefore, are not subject to interpretation.
d  Reconciliation of movements in level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value The following table reconciles the value of level 3 fair valued assets and liabilities at 1 January 2013 to that presented at 31 December 2013.

The valuation techniques used include comparison to recent arms length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, option adjusted spread models and, if applicable, enterprise valuation.
These techniques may include a number of assumptions relating to variables such as credit risk and interest rates.
Changes in assumptions relating to these variables could positively or negatively impact the reported fair value of these instruments.
When determining the inputs into the valuation techniques used priority is given to publicly available prices from independent sources when available, but overall the source of pricing is chosen with the objective of arriving at a fair value measurement which reflects the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants on the measurement date.
The fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based upon available market information and judgments about the financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amount of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of counterparties.
Such estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Groups entire holdings of a particular financial instrument, nor do they consider the tax impact of the realisation of unrealised gains or losses from selling the financial instrument being fair valued.
In some cases the disclosed value cannot be realised in immediate settlement of the financial instrument.
In accordance with the Groups risk management framework, the estimated fair value of derivative financial instruments valued internally using standard market practices are subject to assessment against external counterparties valuations.
At 31 December 2013 the Group held 3,385 million 2012: 3,034 million, 2 per cent of the total fair valued financial assets net of fair valued financial liabilities 2012: 1 per cent, within level 3.
Included within these amounts were loans of 1,887 million at 31 December 2013 2012: 1,842 million, measured at the loan outstanding balance, attached to REALIC acquired in 2012 and held to back the liabilities for funds withheld under reinsurance arrangements.
The funds withheld liability of 2,051 million at 31 December 2013 2012: 2,021 million was also classified within level 3, accounted for on a fair value basis being equivalent to the carrying value of the underlying assets.
Excluding the loans and funds withheld liability under REALICs reinsurance arrangements as described above, which amounted to a net liability of 164 million 2012: 179 million, the level 3 fair valued financial assets net of financial liabilities were 3,549 million 2012: 3,213 million.
Of this amount, a net liability of 304 million 2012: net liability of 213 million were internally valued, representing 0.1 per cent of the total fair valued financial assets net of financial liabilities 2012: 0.1 per cent.
Internal valuations are inherently more subjective than external valuations.
Included within these internally valued net liabilities were: a Debt securities of 118 million 2012: 75 million, which were either valued on a discounted cash flow method with an internally developed discount rate or on external prices adjusted to reflect the specific known conditions relating to these securities eg distressed securities or securities which were being restructured.
b Private equity and venture investments of 878 million 2012: 904 million which were valued internally based on management information available for these investments.
These investments were principally held by consolidated investment funds which are managed on behalf of third parties.
c L iabilities of 1,301 million 2012: 1,199 million for the net asset value attributable to external unit holders respect of the consolidated investment funds, which are non-recourse to the Group.
These liabilities are valued by reference to the underlying assets.
d Other sundry individual financial investments of 1 million 2012: 7 million.
Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 195 Of the internally valued net liability referred to above of 304 million 2012: net liability of 213 million : e A net liability of 380 million 2012: net liability of 240 million was held by the Groups participating funds and therefore shareholders profit and equity are not impacted by movements in the valuation of these financial instruments.
f A net asset of nil 2012: 3 million was held by the Groups unit-linked funds for which the investment return is wholly attributable to policyholders.
g A net asset of 76 million 2012: 24 million was held to support non-linked shareholder-backed business.
If the value of all the level 3 instruments held to support non-linked shareholder-backed business valued internally was varied downwards by 10 per cent, the change in valuation would be 8 million 2012: 2 million, which would reduce shareholders equity by this amount before tax.
Of this amount, a decrease of 6 million 2012: an increase of 1 million would pass through the income statement substantially as part of short-term fluctuations in investment returns outside of operating profit and a 2 million decrease 2012: a 3 million decrease would be included as part of other comprehensive income, being unrealised movements on assets classified as available-for-sale.
Other assets at fair value Investment properties The investment properties of the Group are principally held by the UK insurance operations which are externally valued by professionally qualified external valuers using the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS valuation standards.
An income capitalisation technique is predominantly applied for these properties.
This technique calculates the value through the yield and rental value depending on factors such as the lease length, building quality, covenant and location.
The variables used are compared to recent transactions with similar features to those of the Groups investment properties.
As the comparisons are not with properties which are virtually identical to Groups investment properties, adjustments are made by the valuers where appropriate to the variables used.
Changes in assumptions relating to these variables could positively or negatively impact the reported fair value of the properties.
e  The Groups policy is to recognise transfers into and transfers out of levels as of the end of each half year reporting period except for material transfers which are recognised as of the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
During 2013, the transfers between levels within the Groups portfolio were primarily transfers from level 1 to 2 of 471 million and transfers from level 2 to level 1 of 260 million.
These transfers which relate to equity securities and debt securities arose to reflect the change in the observability of the inputs used in valuing these securities.
In addition, the transfers into and out of level 3 in 2013 were 228 million and 51 million, respectively.
These transfers were between levels 3 and 2 and primarily for equity securities and debt securities.
f  The Groups valuation policies, procedures and analyses for instruments categorised as level 3 are overseen by Business Unit committees as part of the Groups wider financial reporting governance processes.
The procedures undertaken include approval of valuation methodologies, verification processes, and resolution of significant or complex valuation issues.
In undertaking these activities the Group makes use of the extensive expertise of its asset management functions.

Where available, quoted market prices are used.
However, where securities do not have an externally quoted price based on regular trades or where markets for the securities are no longer active as a result of market conditions, IAS 39 requires that valuation techniques be applied.
IFRS 13 requires classification of the fair values applied by the Group into a three level hierarchy.
At 31 December 2013, 0.1 per cent of Jacksons debt securities were classified as level 3 31 December 2012: 0.1 per cent comprising of fair values where there are significant inputs which are not based on observable market data.
Except for certain assets covering liabilities that are measured at fair value, the debt securities of the US insurance operations are classified as available-for-sale.
Unless impaired, fair value movements are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Realised gains and losses, including impairments, recorded in the income statement are as shown in note B1.2 of this report.
Movements in unrealised gains and losses There was a movement in the statement of financial position value for debt securities classified as available-for-sale from a net unrealised gain of 2,807 million to a net unrealised gain of 781 million as analysed in the table below.
This decrease reflects the effects of rising long-term interest rates.

The policy loans are valued at 1,887 million at 31 December 2013 2012: 1,842 million.
All other policy loans are accounted for at amortised cost, less any impairment.
The US insurance operations commercial mortgage loan portfolio does not include any single-family residential mortgage loans and is therefore not exposed to the risk of defaults associated with residential sub-prime mortgage loans.
The average loan size is 6.5 million 2012: 6.3 million.
The portfolio has a current estimated average loan to value of 61 per cent 2012: 65 per cent.

The majority of derivative assets and liabilities have been included at fair value within the one year or less column, representing the basis on which they are managed ie to manage principally asset or liability value exposures.
The Group has no cash flow hedges and in general, contractual maturities are not considered essential for an understanding of the timing of the cash flows for these instruments.
The only exception is certain identified interest rate swaps which are fully expected to be held until maturity solely for the purposes of matching cash flows on separately held assets and liabilities.
For these instruments the undiscounted cash flows including contractual interest amounts due to be paid under the swap contract assuming conditions are consistent with those at year end are included in the column relating to the contractual maturity of the derivative.
The table below shows the maturity profile for investment contracts on an undiscounted basis to the nearest billion.
This maturity profile has been based on the cash flow projections of expected benefit payments as part of the determination of the value of in-force business when preparing EEV basis results.
bn Total After1 After5 After10 After15 undisTotal 1year yearto yearsto yearsto yearsto Over counted carrying orless 5years 10years 15years 20years 20years value value 2013 5 18 17 13 10 9 72 56 2012 4 16 15 11 8 10 64 52 Most investment contracts have options to surrender early, often subject to surrender or other penalties.
Therefore, most contracts can be said to have a contractual maturity of less than one year, but in reality the additional charges and term of the contracts means these are unlikely to be exercised in practice and the more useful information is to present information on expected payment.
The maturity profile above excludes certain corporate unit-linked business with gross policyholder liabilities of 13 billion 2012: 12 billion which have no stated maturity but which are repayable on demand.
This table has been prepared on an undiscounted basis and accordingly the amounts shown for life assurance investment contracts differ from those disclosed on the statement of financial position.
Durations of long-term business contracts, covering insurance and investment contracts, on a discounted basis are included in section C4.
The vast majority of the Groups financial assets are held to back the Groups policyholder liabilities.
Although asset liability matching is an important component of managing policyholder liabilities both those classified as insurance and those classified as investments, this profile is mainly relevant for managing market risk rather than liquidity risk.
Within each business unit this asset liability matching is performed on a  basis.
In terms of liquidity risk a large proportion of the policyholder liabilities contain discretionary surrender values or surrender charges, meaning that many of the Groups liabilities are expected to be held for the long term.
Much of the Groups investment portfolios are in marketable securities, which can therefore be converted quickly to liquid assets.
For the reasons above an analysis of the Groups assets by contractual maturity is not considered appropriate to evaluate the nature and extent of the Groups liquidity risk.
ii Market and other financial risks The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk of financial instruments before any allowance for collateral or allocation of losses to policyholders is represented by the carrying value of financial instruments on the balance sheet that have exposures to credit risk comprising cash and cash equivalents, deposits, debt securities, loans and derivative assets, and other debtors, the carrying value of which are disclosed at the start of this note and note b below for derivative assets.
The collateral in place in relation to derivatives is described in note c below.
Notes C3.4, describe the security for these loans held by the Group, as disclosed at the start of this note.
Of the total loans and receivables held, 14 million 2012: 25 million are past their due date but have not been impaired.
Of the total past due but not impaired, 9 million is less than one year past their due date 2012: 18 million.
The Group expects full recovery of these loans and receivables.
No further analysis has been provided of the element of loans and receivables that was neither past due nor impaired for the total portfolio on the grounds of immateriality of the difference between the neither past due nor impaired elements and the total portfolio.
Financial assets that would have been past due or impaired had the terms not been renegotiated amounted to 59 million 2012: 86 million.
208 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements C:  C3:  In addition, during the year the Group took possession of nil 2012: 16 million of other collateral held as security, which mainly consists of assets that could be readily converted into cash.
Further details of collateral and pledges are provided in note c below.
iii Foreign exchange risk As at 31 December 2013, the Group held 20 per cent 2012: 19 per cent and 7 per cent 2012: 7 per cent of its financial assets and financial liabilities respectively, in currencies, mainly US dollar and Euro, other than the functional currency of the relevant business unit.
Of these financial assets, 58 per cent 2012: 56 per cent are held by the PAC with-profits fund, allowing the fund to obtain exposure to foreign equity markets.
Of these financial liabilities, 28 per cent 2012: 28 per cent are held by the PAC with-profits fund, mainly relating to foreign currency borrowings.
The exchange risks inherent in these exposures are mitigated through the use of derivatives, mainly forward currency contracts note b below.
The amount of exchange loss recognised in the income statement in 2013, except for those arising on financial instruments measured at fair value through profit and loss, is 284 million 2012: 213 million loss.
This constitutes 1 million gain 2012: 1 million loss on Medium Term Notes liabilities and 285 million of net loss 2012: 212 million net loss, mainly arising on investments of the PAC with-profits fund.
The gains losses on Medium Term Notes liabilities are fully offset by value movements on cross-currency swaps, which are measured at fair value through profit and loss.
b  Derivatives The Group enters into a variety of exchange traded and over-the-counter derivative financial instruments, including futures, options, forward currency contracts and swaps such as interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, swaptions and credit default swaps.
All over-the-counter derivative transactions, with the exception of some Asia transactions, are conducted under standardised ISDA International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc master agreements and the Group has collateral agreements between the individual Group entities and relevant counterparties in place under each of these market master agreements.
The total fair value balances of derivative assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2013 were as follows: 2013 m Asia US UK insurance insurance insurance Asset Unallocated Group operations operations operations m anagement toasegment total Derivative assets 41 766 1,472 47 3 2,329 Derivative liabilities 58 515 804 112 200 1,689 17 251 668 65 197 640 2012 m Asia US UK insurance insurance insurance Asset Unallocated Group operations operations operations m anagement toasegment total Derivative assets 927 1,546 1,349 38 2 3,862 Derivative liabilities 837 645 1,010 150 190 2,832 90 901 339 112 188 1,030 The 2012 comparative results have been adjusted from those previously published for the retrospective application of the new and amended accounting standards described in note A2.
The above derivative assets are included in other investments in the statement of financial position and are used for efficient portfolio management to obtain cost effective and efficient management of exposure to various markets in accordance with the Groups investment strategies and to manage exposure to interest rate, currency, credit and other business risks.
The Group also uses interest rate derivatives to reduce exposure to interest rate volatility.
In particular: UK with-profits funds use derivatives for efficient portfolio management or reduction in investment risks.
For UK annuity business derivatives are used to assist with asset and liability cash flow matching: US operations and some of the UK operations hold large amounts of interest-rate sensitive investments that contain credit risks on which a certain level of defaults is expected.
These businesses have purchased some swaptions to manage the default risk on certain underlying assets and hence reduce the amount of regulatory capital held to support the assets: and Some products, especially in the US, have guarantee features linked to equity indexes.
A mismatch between guaranteed product liabilities and the performance of the underlying assets, exposes the Group to equity index risk.
In order to mitigate this risk, the relevant business units purchase swaptions, equity options and futures to better match asset performance with liabilities under equity-indexed products.
Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 209 Hedging The Group has formally assessed and documented the effectiveness of the following hedges under IAS 39.
Fair value hedges The Group had previously designated as a fair value hedge certain fixed to floating rate swaps which hedge the fair value exposure to interest rate movements of certain of the Groups operational borrowings.
All of these hedges were terminated by January 2013.
The fair value of the derivatives designated as fair value hedges above at 31 December 2012 was an asset of less than 1 million.
Movements in the fair value of the hedging instruments of a net gain of 0.3 million 2012: net loss of 3 million and the hedged items of a net loss of 0.3 million 2012: net gain of 3 million are recorded in the income statement in respect of these fair value hedges.
Net investment hedges The Group has designated perpetual subordinated capital securities totalling US$3.55 billion 2012: US$2.85 billion as a net investment hedge to hedge the currency risks related to the net investment in Jackson.
The carrying value of the subordinated capital securities was 2,133 million as at 31 December 2013 2012: 1,746 million.
The foreign exchange gain of 46 million 2012: loss of 81 million on translation of the borrowings to pounds sterling at the statement of financial position date is recognised in the translation reserve in shareholders equity.
This net investment hedge was 100 per cent effective.
The Group has no cash flow hedges in place.
c Derecognition,  Securities lending and reverse repurchase agreements The Group has entered into securities lending including repurchase agreements whereby blocks of securities are loaned to third parties, primarily major brokerage firms.
The amounts above the fair value of the loaned securities required to be received as collateral by the agreements depend on the quality of the collateral, calculated on a daily basis.
The loaned securities are not removed from the Groups consolidated statement of financial position, rather they are retained within the appropriate investment classification.
Collateral typically consists of cash, debt securities, equity securities and letters of credit.
At 31 December 2013, the Group had lent 3,791 million 2012: 3,015 million of securities of which 2,910 million 2012: 2,047 million was lent by the PAC with-profits fund and held collateral under such agreements of 3,930 million 2012: 3,137 million of which 3,012 million 2012: 2,138 million was held by the PAC with-profits fund.
At 31 December 2013, the Group had entered into reverse repurchase transactions under which it purchased securities and had taken on the obligation to resell the securities.
The fair value of the collateral held in respect of these transactions was 9,931 million 2012: 8,454 million.
In addition, at 31 December 2013, the Group had entered into repurchase transactions for which the fair value of the collateral pledged was cash of 17 million and securities of 524 million 2012: securities pledged of 100 million.
Collateral and pledges under derivative transactions At 31 December 2013, the Group had pledged 780 million 2012: 754 million for liabilities and held collateral of 1,432 million 2012: 1,964 million in respect of over-the-counter derivative transactions.
These transactions are conducted under terms that are usual and customary to collateralised transactions including, where relevant, standard securities lending and repurchase agreements.
210 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements C:  C3:  Offsetting assets and liabilities The Groups derivative instruments, repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements are subject to master netting arrangements and collateral arrangements.
A master netting arrangement with a counterparty creates a right of offset for amounts due to and due from that same counterparty that is enforceable in the event of a default or bankruptcy.
The Group recognises amounts subject to master netting arrangements on a gross basis within the consolidated balance sheets.
The following tables present the gross and net information about the Groups financial instruments subject to master netting arrangements: 31Dec2013 m Grossamount  presentedinthe  consolidated financial Financial Cash Securities Net position instruments collateral collateral amount note i note ii note iii Financial assets: Derivative assets 2,136 832 555 631 118 Reverse repurchase agreements 9,931 9,931 12,067 832 555 10,562 118 Financial liabilities: Derivative liabilities 1,479 832 222 333 92 Securities lending 1,242 1,242 Repurchase agreements 541 17 524 Total financial liabilities 3,262 832 1,481 857 92 31Dec2012 m Grossamount  presentedinthe  consolidated financial Financial Cash Securities Net position instruments collateral collateral amount note i note ii note iii Financial assets: Derivative assets 3,683 1,868 536 989 290 Reverse repurchase agreements 8,454 8,454 12,137 1,868 536 9,443 290 Financial liabilities: Derivative liabilities 2,552 1,868 205 70 409 Securities lending 2,017 2,017 Repurchase agreements 100 100 Total financial liabilities 4,669 1,868 2,222 170 409 Notes i The Group has not offset any of the amounts presented in the consolidated statement of financial position.
ii Represents the amount that could be offset under master netting or similar arrangements where Group does not satisfy the full criteria to offset on the consolidated statement of financial position.
iii Excludes initial margin amounts for exchange-traded derivatives.
In the tables above, the amounts of assets or liabilities presented in the consolidated statement of financial position are offset first by financial instruments that have the right of offset under master netting or similar arrangements with any remaining amount reduced by the amount of cash and securities collateral.
The actual amount of collateral may be greater than amounts presented in the tables.
Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 211 d  In accordance with the Groups accounting policy set out in note A3 j, impairment reviews were performed for available-for-sale securities and loans and receivables.
In addition, impairment reviews were undertaken for the reinsurers share of insurance contract liabilities.
During the year ended 31 December 2013, net impairment reversals of 17 million 2012: losses of 50 million were recognised for available-for-sale securities and loans and receivables analysed as shown in the attached table.
2013 m 2012 m Available-for-sale debt securities held by Jackson 8 37 Loans and receivables 25 13 Net credit charge for impairment net of reversals 17 50 Relates to loans held by the UK with-profits fund and mortgage loans held by Jackson: Impairment recognised on available-for-sale securities amounted to 8 million 2012: 37 million arising from: 2013 m 2012 m Residential mortgage-backed securities 3 8 Public fixed income 2 Other 5 27 8 37 The impairment recorded on the residential mortgage-backed securities was primarily due to reduced cash flow expectations on such securities that are collateralised by diversified pools of primarily below investment grade securities.
Of the impaired losses of 8 million 2012: 37 million, the top five individual corporate issuers made up 57 per cent 2012: 74 per cent, reflecting a deteriorating business outlook of the companies concerned.
The impairment losses have been recorded in investment return in the income statement.
Jacksons portfolio of debt securities is managed proactively with credit analysts closely monitoring and reporting on the credit quality of its holdings.
Jackson continues to review its investments on a case-by-case basis to determine whether any decline in fair value represents an impairment.
In addition, investments in structured securities are subject to a rigorous review of their future estimated cash flows including expected and stress case scenarios to identify potential shortfalls in contractual payments both interest and principal.
Impairment charges are recorded on structured securities when the Company forecasts a contractual payment shortfall.
Situations where such a shortfall would not lead to a recognition of a loss are rare.
However, some structured securities do not have a single determined set of future cash flows and instead, there can be a reasonable range of estimates that could potentially emerge.
With this variability, there could be instances where the projected cash flow shortfall under managements base case set of assumptions is so minor that relatively small and justifiable changes to the base case assumptions would eliminate the need for an impairment loss to be recognised.
The impairment loss reflects the difference between the fair value and book value.
In 2013, the Group realised gross losses on sales of available-for-sale securities of 22 million 2012: 44 million with 72 per cent 2012: 64 per cent of these losses related to the disposal of fixed maturity securities of the top 10 individual issuers, which were disposed of as part of risk reduction programmes intended to limit future credit loss exposure.
Of the 22 million 2012: 44 million, 5 million 2012: 23 million relates to losses on sales of impaired and deteriorating securities.
The effect of those reasonably likely changes in the key assumptions that underpin the assessment of whether impairment has taken place depends on the factors described in note A3 j.
A key indicator of whether such impairment may arise in future, and the potential amounts at risk, is the profile of gross unrealised losses for fixed maturity securities accounted for on an available-for-sale basis by reference to the time periods by which the securities have been held continuously in an unrealised loss position and by reference to the maturity date of the securities concerned.
For 2013, the amount of gross unrealised losses for fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale under IFRS in an unrealised loss position was 849 million 2012: 178 million.
Notes B1.2 and C3.3 provide further details on the impairment charges and unrealised losses of Jacksons available-for-sale securities.

The comparatives include the Japan life business.
If Japan life business had been excluded from the 2012 amount, the average policyholder liability balance for 2012 would have been 31,616 million for Asia.
Averages have been based on opening and closing balances and adjusted for acquisitions and disposals in the year and exclude unallocated surplus of with-profits funds and adjusted for corporate transactions in the year.

The Group cedes certain business to other insurance companies.
Although the ceding of insurance does not relieve the Group from its liability to its policyholders, the Group participates in such agreements for the purpose of managing its loss exposure.
The Group evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentration of credit risk from similar geographic regions, activities or economic characteristics of the reinsurers to minimise its exposure from reinsurer insolvencies.
Of the reinsurers share of insurance contract liabilities balance of 6,838 million at 31 December 2013 2012: 6,854 million, 96 per cent 2012: 97 per cent were ceded by the Groups UK and US operations, of which 93 per cent 2012: 92 per cent of the balance were from reinsurers with Standard & Poors rating Aand above.
The reinsurance asset for Jackson as shown in the table above primarily relates to certain fully collateralised former REALIC business retained by Swiss Re through 100 per cent reinsurance agreements.
Jackson acquired the REALIC business in 2012 see note D1 b.
Apart from the reinsurance acquired through the purchase of REALIC, the principal reinsurance ceded by Jackson outside the Group is on term life insurance, direct and assumed accident and health business and GMIB variable annuity guarantees.
Net commissions received on ceded business and claims incurred ceded to external reinsurers totalled 37 million and 278 million respectively during 2013 2012: 24 million and 123 million respectively.
There were no deferred gains or losses on reinsurance contracts in either 2013 or 2012.
The Groups Asia and UK businesses do not cede significant amounts of business outside the Group.
During 2013, the Groups UK insurance business wrote a longevity swap on certain aspects of the UKs annuity back-book liabilities.
This resulted in a one-off benefit of 27 million to IFRS profit before tax.
The gains and losses recognised in profit and loss for the other reinsurance contracts written in the year were immaterial.

Notes a Net outflows increased from 4,454 million in 2012 to 5,325 million in 2013, driven primarily by lower sales of with-profits bonds in the year as a result from the implementation of the recommendations of the Retail Distribution Review and lower bulk annuity sales in 2013 compared to 2012.
This increase is partly offset by a decrease in the outflow of the unit-linked business.
The levels of inflows outflows for unit-linked business is driven by corporate pension schemes with transfers in or out from only one or two schemes influencing the level of flows in the year.
Excluding these transactions, the net flow in the unit-linked business for 2013 is broadly consistent to 2012. b Investment-related items and other movements of 7,812 million reflects the strong growth in the UK equity markets in 2013, partly offset by the impact on liabilities of rising long-term bond yields.
Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 219 ii Duration of liabilities With the exception of most unitised with-profits bonds and other whole of life contracts the majority of the contracts of the UK insurance operations have a contract term.
In effect, the maturity term of the other contracts reflects the earlier of death, maturity, or lapsation.
In addition, as described in note A3.1, with-profits contract liabilities include projected future bonuses based on current investment values.
The actual amounts payable will vary with future investment performance of SAIF and the WPSF.
The tables above show the carrying value of the policyholder liabilities.

220 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements C:  C4:  C4.2  a Asia Features of products and guarantees The life insurance products offered by the Groups Asia operations include a range of with-profits and non-participating term, whole life, endowment and unit-linked policies.
The Asia operations also offer health, disability, critical illness and accident coverage to supplement its core life products.
The terms and conditions of the contracts written by the Asia operations and in particular the products options and guarantees, vary from territory to territory depending upon local market circumstances.
In general terms, the Asia participating products provide savings and protection where the basic sum assured can be enhanced by a profit share or bonus from the underlying fund as determined at the discretion of the insurers.
The Asia operations non-participating term, whole life and endowment products offer savings and or protection where the benefits are guaranteed, or determined by a set of defined market-related parameters.
Unit-linked products combine savings with protection, the cash value of the policy depends on the value of the underlying unitised funds.
Health and Protection H&P policies provide mortality or morbidity benefits and include health, disability, critical illness and accident coverage.
H&P products are commonly offered as supplements to main life policies but can be sold separately.
Product guarantees in Asia can be broadly classified into four main categories, namely premium rate, cash value or interest rate guarantees, policy renewability, and convertibility options.
Subject to local market circumstances and regulatory requirements, the guarantee features described in note C4.2 c in respect of UK business broadly apply to similar types of participating contracts written in the Hong Kong branch, Singapore and Malaysia.
Participating products have both guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements.
Non-participating long-term products are the only ones where the Group is contractually obliged to provide guarantees on all benefits.
Unit-linked products have the lowest level of guarantee.
The risks on death coverage through premium rate guarantees are low due to the diversified nature of the business as well as rigorous product pricing.
Cash value and interest rate guarantees are of three types: Maturity values Maturity values are guaranteed for non-participating products and on the guaranteed portion of participating products.
Declared annual bonuses are also guaranteed once vested.
Future bonus rates and cash dividends are not guaranteed on participating products.
Surrender values Surrender values are guaranteed for non-participating products and on the guaranteed portion of participating products.
The surrender value of declared reversionary bonuses are also guaranteed once vested.
Market value adjustments and surrender penalties are used for certain products and where the law permits such adjustments in cash values.
Interest rate guarantees It is common in Asia for regulations or market-driven demand and competition to provide some form of capital value protection and minimum crediting interest rate guarantees.
This would be reflected within the guaranteed maturity and surrender values.
The guarantees are borne by shareholders for non-participating and investment-linked non-investment guarantees only products.
Participating product guarantees are predominantly supported by the segregated life funds and their estates.
Whole of life contracts with floor levels of policyholder benefits that accrue at rates set at inception and do not vary subsequently with market conditions are written in the Korean life operations though this is not to a significant extent as Korea has a much higher proportion of linked and health business.
The Korean business has non-linked liabilities and linked liabilities at 31 December 2013 of 547 million and 1,905 million respectively 2012: 505 million and 1,628 million respectively.
Determining contract liabilities For the with-profits business, the total value of the with-profits funds is driven by the underlying asset valuation with movements reflected principally in the accounting value of policyholder liabilities and unallocated surplus.
Similarly, for the unit-linked business, the attaching liabilities reflect the unit value obligation driven by the value of the investments of the unit fund.
For the shareholder-backed non-linked business, the future policyholder benefit provisions for Asia businesses in the Groups IFRS accounts, are determined in accordance with methods prescribed by local GAAP adjusted to comply, where necessary, with the modified statutory basis or where local GAAP is not well established and in which the business written is primarily non-participating and linked business, US GAAP principles are used as the most appropriate reporting basis.
For the countries which apply local GAAP adjusted to comply, where necessary, with modified statutory basis, the approach to determining the contract liabilities is driven by the local solvency basis.
A gross premium valuation method is used in those countries where a Risk-Based Capital framework is adopted for local solvency.
Under the gross premium valuation method, all cash flows are valued explicitly using best estimate assumptions.
A Risk-Based Capital framework applying the gross premium valuation method is adopted by Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and from 2013, Indonesia.
In applying this approach, an overlay constraint to the method is applied such that no negative reserves are derived at an individual policyholder level.
In Vietnam, the Company improved its estimation basis for liabilities in 2012 from one determined substantially by reference to US GAAP requirements.
After making this change, the estimation basis for Vietnam was aligned substantially to that used by the countries applying the gross premium valuation method.
Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 221 For India, Japan, Taiwan, and until 2012, Vietnam, US GAAP is applied for measuring insurance assets and liabilities.
For these countries, the future policyholder benefit provisions for non-linked business are determined using the net level premium method, with an allowance for surrenders, maintenance and claims expenses.
The other Asia operations principally adopt a net premium valuation method to determine the future policyholder benefit provisions.
The effect of changes in assumptions used to measure insurance assets and liabilities for Asia insurance operations is as disclosed in note B4 a. b US Features of products and guarantees Jackson provides long-term savings and retirement products to retail and institutional customers throughout the US.
Jackson offers fixed annuities fixed interest rate annuities, fixed index annuities and immediate annuities, variable annuities, life insurance and institutional products.
Jackson discontinued offering life insurance products in August 2012. i Fixed annuities Fixed interest rate annuities At 31 December 2013, fixed interest rate annuities accounted for 10 per cent 2012: 13 per cent of policy and contract liabilities of Jackson.
Fixed interest rate annuities are primarily deferred annuity products that are used for asset accumulation in retirement planning and for providing income in retirement.
They permit tax-deferred accumulation of funds and flexible payout options.
The policyholder of fixed interest rate annuity pays Jackson a premium, which is credited to the policyholders account.
Periodically, interest is credited to the policyholders account and in some cases administrative charges are deducted from the policyholders account.
Jackson makes benefit payments at a future date as specified in the policy based on the value of the policyholders account at that date.
The policy provides that at Jacksons discretion it may reset the interest rate, subject to a guaranteed minimum.
At 31 December 2013, Jackson had fixed interest rate annuities totalling 11.2 billion US$18.5 billion 2012: 11.7 billion US$19.0 billion in account value with minimum guaranteed rates ranging from 1.0 per cent to 5.5 per cent and a 3.05 per cent average guaranteed rate 2012: 1.0 per cent to 5.5 per cent and a 3.09 per cent average guaranteed rate.
Approximately 50 per cent 2012: 50 per cent of the fixed interest rate annuities Jackson wrote in 2013 provide for a market value adjustment MVA that could be positive or negative, on surrenders in the surrender period of the policy.
This formula-based adjustment approximates the change in value that assets supporting the product would realise as interest rates move up or down.
The minimum guaranteed rate is not affected by this adjustment.
While the MVA feature minimises the surrender risk associated with certain fixed annuities, Jackson still bears a portion of the surrender risk on policies without this feature, and the investment risk on all fixed interest rate annuities.
In certain cases, additional provisions are held to reflect the existence of guarantees offered in the past that are no longer supported by earnings on the existing asset portfolio.
Fixed index annuities Fixed index annuities accounted for 7 per cent 2012: 8 per cent of Jacksons policy and contract liabilities at 31 December 2013.
Fixed index annuities vary in structure, but generally are deferred annuities that enable policyholders to obtain a portion of an equity-linked return based on participation rates and caps but provide a guaranteed minimum return.
These guaranteed minimum rates are generally set at 1.0 per cent to 3.0 per cent.
Jackson had fixed index annuities allocated to indexed funds totalling 6.1 billion US$10.2 billion 2012: 5.6 billion US$9.2 billion in account value with minimum guaranteed rates on index accounts ranging from 1.0 per cent to 3.0 per cent and a 1.85 per cent average guaranteed rate 2012: 1.0 per cent to 3.0 per cent and a 1.82 per cent average guarantee rate.
Jackson also offers fixed interest accounts on some fixed index annuity products.
Fixed interest accounts of fixed index annuities totalled 1.5 billion US$2.5 billion 2012: 1.5 billion US$2.3 billion in account value with minimum guaranteed rates ranging from 1.0 per cent to 3.0 per cent and a 2.56 per cent average guaranteed rate 2012: 1.0 per cent to 3.0 per cent and a 2.53 per cent average guaranteed rate.
Jackson hedges the equity return risk on fixed index products using futures and options linked to the relevant index as well as through offsetting equity exposure in the variable annuities product.
The cost of these hedges is taken into account in setting the index participation rates or caps.
Jackson bears the investment risk and a portion of surrender risk on these products.
Immediate annuities At 31 December 2013, immediate annuities accounted for 1 per cent 2012: 1 per cent of Jacksons policy and contract liabilities.
Immediate annuities guarantee a series of payments beginning within a year of purchase and continuing over either a fixed period of years and or the life of the policyholder.
If the term is for the life of the policyholder, then Jacksons primary risk are mortality and reinvestment risks.
The implicit interest rate on these products is based on the market conditions that exist at the time the policy is issued and is guaranteed for the term of the annuity.
ii Variable annuities At 31 December 2013, variable annuities accounted for 65 per cent 2012: 60 per cent of Jacksons policy and contract liabilities.
Variable annuities are deferred annuities that have the same tax advantages and payout options as interest-sensitive and fixed index annuities.
They are also used for asset accumulation in retirement planning and to provide income in retirement.
The primary differences between variable annuities and interest-sensitive or fixed index annuities are investment risk and return.
If a policyholder chooses a variable annuity, the rate of return depends upon the performance of the selected fund portfolio.
Policyholders may allocate their investment to either the fixed account or a selection of variable accounts.
Investment risk on the variable account is borne by the policyholder, while investment risk on the fixed is borne by Jackson through guaranteed minimum fixed rates of return.
At 31 December 2013, 6 per cent 2012: 8 per cent of variable annuity funds were in fixed accounts.
Jackson had accounts in variable annuities totalling 4.2 billion US$7.0 billion 2012: 4.3 billion US$7.0 billion in account value with minimum guaranteed rates ranging from 1.0 per cent to 3.0 per cent and a 1.85 per cent average guaranteed rate 2012: 1.0 per cent to 3.0 per cent and a 1.89 per cent average guaranteed rate.
222 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements C:  C4:  Jackson issues variable annuity contracts where it contractually guarantees to the contractholder either a return of no less than total deposits made to the contract adjusted for any partial withdrawals, b total deposits made to the contract adjusted for any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return, or c the highest contract value on a specified anniversary date adjusted for any withdrawals following the contract anniversary.
These guarantees include benefits that are payable in the event of death guaranteed minimum death benefit GMDB, annuitisation guaranteed minimum income benefit GMIB, or at specified dates during the accumulation period guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit GMWB and guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit GMAB.
Jackson hedges these risks using equity options and futures contracts as described in note C7.3.
The GMAB and GMIB are no longer offered, with the existing GMIB coverage being substantially reinsured.
Jackson launched Elite Access in March 2012.
Elite Access is a variable annuity which has no guaranteed benefits and provides tax efficient access to alternative investments.
Single premium sales in 2013 were 2,585 million 2012: 849 million.
iii Aggregate distribution of account values The table below shows the distribution of account values for fixed annuities fixed interest rate and fixed index and the fixed account portion of variable annuities within the range of minimum guaranteed interest rates as described in notes i to ii above as at 31 December 2013 and 2012: Accountvalue  2013 m 2012 m 1.0% 3,012 2,534 1.0% to 2.0% 8,349 8,374 2.0% to 3.0% 8,867 9,174 3.0% to 4.0% 1,163 1,236 4.0% to 5.0% 1,460 1,518 5.0% 197 209 Total 23,048 23,045 iv Life insurance Life insurance products accounted for 14 per cent 2012: 15 per cent of Jacksons policy and contract liabilities at 31 December 2013.
Jackson discontinued new sales of life insurance products effective 1 August 2012 but increased its life insurance products book when it acquired REALIC in September 2012.
Life products include term life and interest-sensitive life universal life and variable universal life.
Term life provides protection for a defined period and a benefit that is payable to a designated beneficiary upon death of the insured.
Universal life provides permanent individual life insurance for the life of the insured and includes a savings element.
Variable universal life is a type of life insurance policy that combines death benefit protection with the ability for the policyholder account to be invested in separate account funds.
For certain fixed universal life plans, additional provisions are held to reflect the existence of guarantees offered in the past that are no longer supported by earnings on the existing asset portfolio.
At 31 December 2013, Jackson had interest sensitive life business in force with total account value of 5.7 billion US$9.5 billion 2012: 6.0 billion US$9.7 billion, with minimum guaranteed interest rates ranging from 2.5 per cent to 6.0 per cent with a 4.65 per cent average guaranteed rate 2012: 2.5 per cent to 6.0 per cent with a 4.67 per cent average guaranteed rate.
The table below shows the distribution of the interest-sensitive life business account values within this range of minimum guaranteed interest rates as at 31 December 2013 and 2012: Accountvalue  2013 m 2012 m 2.0% 2.0% to 3.0% 182 183 3.0% to 4.0% 2,182 2,141 4.0% to 5.0% 1,908 2,097 5.0% 1,456 1,550 Total 5,728 5,971 Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 223 v Institutional products Jacksons institutional products consist of guaranteed investment contracts GICs, funding agreements including agreements issued in conjunction with Jacksons participation in the US Federal Home Loan Bank programme and medium-term note funding agreements.
At 31 December 2013, institutional products accounted for 3 per cent of policy and contract liabilities 2012: 3 per cent.
Under a traditional GIC, the policyholder makes a lump sum deposit.
The interest rate paid is fixed and established when the contract is issued.
If deposited funds are withdrawn earlier than the specified term of the contract, an adjustment is made that approximates a market value adjustment.
Under a funding agreement, the policyholder either makes a lump sum deposit or makes specified periodic deposits.
Jackson agrees to pay a rate of interest, which may be fixed but is usually a floating short-term interest rate linked to an external index.
The average term of the funding agreements is one to two years.
In 2013 and 2012, there were no funding agreements terminable by the policyholder with less than 90 days notice.
Determining contract liabilities Under the modified statutory basis of reporting applied under IFRS 4 for insurance contracts, providing the requirements of the Companies Act, UK GAAP standards and the ABI SORP are met, it is permissible to reflect the previously applied UK GAAP basis.
Accordingly, and consistent with the basis explained in note A3.1, in the case of Jackson the carrying values of insurance assets and liabilities are consolidated into the Group accounts based on US GAAP.
An overview of the deferral and amortisation of acquisition costs for Jackson is provided in note C5.1 b.
Under US GAAP, investment contracts as defined for US GAAP purposes are accounted for by applying in the first instance a retrospective deposit method to determine the liability for policyholder benefits.
This is then augmented by potentially three additional amounts.
These amounts are for: Any amounts that have been assessed to compensate the insurer for services to be performed over future periods ie deferred income : Any amounts previously assessed against policyholders that are refundable on termination of the contract: and Any probable future loss on the contract ie premium deficiency.
Capitalised acquisition costs and deferred income for these contracts are amortised over the life of the book of contracts.
The present value of the estimated gross profits is generally computed using the rate of interest that accrues to policyholder balances sometimes referred to as the contract rate.
Estimated gross profits include estimates of the following elements, each of which will be determined based on the best estimate of amounts of the following individual elements over the life of the book of contracts without provision for adverse deviation for: Amounts expected to be assessed for mortality less benefit claims in excess of related policyholder balances: Amounts expected to be assessed for contract administration less costs incurred for contract administration: Amounts expected to be earned from the investment of policyholder balances less interest credited to policyholder balances: Amounts expected to be assessed against policyholder balances upon termination of contracts sometimes referred to as surrender charges : and Other expected assessments and credits.
Variable annuity contracts written by Jackson may, as described above, provide for Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit, Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit, Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit and Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit features.
In general terms, liabilities for these benefits are accounted for under US GAAP by using estimates of future benefits and fees under best estimate persistency assumptions.
In accordance with US GAAP, the grandfathered basis for IFRS, which specifies how certain guarantee features should be accounted for, the Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit and the for life portion of Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit liabilities are determined each period end by estimating the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance and recognising the excess ratably over the life of the contract based on total expected assessments.
At 31 December 2013, these liabilities were valued using a series of deterministic investment performance scenarios, a mean investment return of 7.4 per cent 2012: 8.4 per cent net of external fund management fees, and assumptions for lapse, mortality and expense that are the same as those used in amortising the capitalised acquisition costs.
The direct Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit liability is determined by estimating the expected value of the annuitisation benefits in excess of the projected account balance at the date of annuitisation and recognising the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments.
Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit benefits are essentially fully reinsured, subject to a modest deductible and annual claim limits.
As this reinsurance benefit is net settled, it is considered to be a derivative under IAS 39, and is therefore recognised at fair value with the change in fair value included as a component of short-term fluctuations.
The direct GMIB liability is not considered a derivative instrument under IAS 39 and, as such, an accounting differences arises from this one-sided mark to market.
The assumptions used for calculating the direct Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit liability at 31 December 2013 and 2012 are consistent with those used for calculating the Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit and for life Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit liabilities.
Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit not for life features are considered to be embedded derivatives under IAS 39.
Therefore, provisions for these benefits are recognised at fair value.
The change in these guaranteed benefit reserves, along with claim payments and associated fees included in reserves are included along with the hedge results in short-term fluctuations, resulting in removal of the market impact from the operating profit based on longer-term investment returns.
224 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements C:  C4:  Jackson regularly evaluates estimates used and adjusts the additional Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit, Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit and Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit for life liability balances, with a related charge or credit to benefit expense if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised.
For Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit and Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit reinsurance embedded derivatives that are fair valued under IAS 39, Jackson bases its volatility assumptions on implied market volatility for periods ranging from 5 to 10 years where sufficient market liquidity is assumed to exist, followed by grading to long-term historical volatility levels beyond that point, and explicitly incorporates Jacksons own credit risk in determining discount rates.
Non-performance risk is incorporated into the calculation through the use of discount interest rates sourced from a AA corporate credit curve.
Other risk margins, particularly for policyholder behaviour are also incorporated into the model through the use of explicitly conservative assumptions.
On a periodic basis, Jackson validates the resulting fair values based on comparisons to other models and market movements.
With the exception of the Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit, Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit, Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit and Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefit features of variable annuity contracts, the financial guarantee features of Jacksons contracts are in most circumstances not explicitly valued, but the impact of any interest guarantees would be reflected as they are earned in the current account value ie the US GAAP liability.
For traditional life insurance contracts, provisions for future policy benefits are determined under US GAAP using the net level premium method and assumptions as of the issue date as to mortality, interest, policy lapses and expenses plus provisions for adverse deviation.
Institutional products are accounted for as investment contracts under IFRS with the liability classified as being in respect of financial instruments rather than insurance contracts, as defined by IFRS 4.
In practice there is no material difference between the IFRS and US GAAP basis of recognition and measurement for these contracts.
Certain institutional products representing obligations issued in currencies other than US dollars have been hedged for changes in exchange rates using cross-currency swaps.
The fair value of derivatives embedded in funding agreements, as well as foreign currency transaction gains and losses, are included in the carrying value of the trust instruments supported by funding agreements recorded in other non-insurance liabilities.
The effect of non-recurrent changes of assumptions used to measure insurance assets and liabilities of Jackson is shown in note B4 b. c UK Features of products and guarantees Prudentials long-term products in the UK consist of life insurance, pension products and pension annuities.
These products are written primarily in: One of three separate sub-funds of the PAC long-term fund, namely the with-profits sub-fund WPSF, SAIF, and the non-profit sub-fund: Prudential Annuities Limited PAL, which is owned by the PAC with-profits sub-fund: Prudential Retirement Income Limited PRIL, a shareholder-owned subsidiary: or Other shareholder-backed subsidiaries writing mainly non-profit unit-linked business.
i With-profits products and PAC with-profits sub-fund The WPSF mainly contains with-profits business but it also contains some non-profit business unit-linked, term assurances and annuities.
The WPSF held a provision of 36 million at 31 December 2013 2012: 47 million to honour guarantees on a small amount of guaranteed annuity products.
SAIFs exposure to guaranteed annuities is described below.
With-profits products provide returns to policyholders through bonuses that are smoothed.
There are two types of bonuses: annual and final.
Annual bonuses are declared once a year, and once credited, are guaranteed in accordance with the terms of the particular product.
Unlike annual bonuses, final bonuses are guaranteed only until the next bonus declaration.
The main factors that influence the determination of bonus rates are the return on the investments of the with-profits fund, inflation, taxation, the expenses of the fund chargeable to policyholders and the degree to which investment returns are smoothed.
The overall rate of return earned on investments and the expectation of future investment returns are the most important influences on bonus rates.
A high proportion of the assets backing the with-profits business are invested in equities and real estate.
If the financial strength of the with-profits business is affected, then a higher proportion of fixed interest or similar assets might be held by the fund.
Further details on the determination of the two types of the bonuses, regular and final are provided below: Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 225 Regular bonus rates For regular bonuses, the bonus rates are determined for each type of policy primarily by targeting the bonus level at a prudent proportion of the long-term expected future investment return on underlying assets.
The expected future investment return is reduced as appropriate for each type of policy to allow for items such as expenses, charges, tax and shareholders transfers.
However, the rates declared may differ by product type, or by the date of payment of the premium, or date of issue of the policy, or if the accumulated annual bonuses are particularly high or low, relative to a prudent proportion of the achieved investment return.
When target bonus levels change, the PAC board of directors PAC Board has regard to the overall strength of the long-term fund when determining the length of time over which it will seek to achieve the amended prudent target bonus level.
In normal investment conditions, PAC expects changes in regular bonus rates to be gradual over time.
However, PAC retains the discretion whether or not to declare a regular bonus each year, and there is no limit on the amount by which regular bonus rates can change.
Final bonus rates A final bonus which is normally declared yearly, may be added when a claim is paid or when units of a unitised product are realised.
The rates of final bonus usually vary by type of policy and by reference to the period, usually a year, in which the policy commences or each premium is paid.
These rates are determined by reference to the asset shares for the sample policies but subject to the smoothing approach as explained below.
In general, the same final bonus scale applies to maturity, death and surrender claims except that: The total surrender value may be impacted by the application of a Market Value Reduction for accumulating with-profits policies and by the surrender bases for conventional with-profits business: and For the SAIF and Scottish Amicable, the final bonus rates applicable on surrender may be adjusted to reflect expected future bonus rates.
Application of significant judgement The application of the above method for determining bonuses requires the PAC Board to apply significant judgement in many respects, including in particular the following: Determining what constitutes fair treatment of customers: Prudential is required by UK law and regulation to consider the fair treatment of its customers in setting bonus levels.
The concept of determining what constitutes fair treatment, while established by statute, is not defined: Smoothing of investment returns: This is an important feature of with-profits products.
Determining when particular circumstances, such as a significant rise or fall in market values, warrant variations in the standard bonus smoothing limits that apply in normal circumstances requires the PAC Board to exercise significant judgement: and Determining at what level to set bonuses to ensure that they are competitive: The overall return to policyholders is an important competitive measure for attracting new business.
Key assumptions As noted above, the overall rate of return on investments and the expectation of future investment returns are the most important influences in bonus rates, subject to the smoothing described below.
Prudential determines the assumptions to apply in respect of these factors, including the effects of reasonably likely changes in key assumptions, in the context of the overarching discretionary and smoothing framework that applies to its with-profits business as described above.
As such, it is not possible to specifically quantify the effects of each of these assumptions, or of reasonably likely changes in these assumptions.
Prudentials approach, in applying significant judgement and discretion in relation to determining bonus rates, is consistent conceptually with the approach adopted by other firms that manage a with-profits business.
It is also consistent with the requirements of UK law, which require all UK firms that carry out a with-profits business to define, and make publicly available, the Principles and Practices of Financial Management PPFM that are applied in the management of their with-profits funds.
Accordingly, Prudentials PPFM contains an explanation of how it determines regular and final bonus rates within the discretionary framework that applies to all with-profits policies, subject to the general legislative requirements applicable.
The purpose of Prudentials PPFM is therefore to: Explain the nature and extent of the discretion available: Show how competing or conflicting interests or expectations of different groups and generations of policyholders, and policyholders and shareholders are managed so that all policyholders and shareholders are treated fairly: and Provide a knowledgeable observer eg a financial adviser with an understanding of the material risks and rewards from starting and continuing to invest in a with-profits policy with Prudential.
Furthermore, in accordance with industry-wide regulatory requirements, the PAC Board has appointed: An Actuarial Function Holder who provides the PAC Board with all actuarial advice: A With-Profits Actuary whose specific duty is to advise the PAC Board on the reasonableness and proportionality of the manner in which its discretion has been exercised in applying the PPFM and the manner in which any conflicting interests have been addressed: and A With-Profits Committee of independent individuals, which assesses the degree of compliance with the PPFM and the manner in which conflicting rights have been addressed.
226 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements C:  C4:  Smoothing of investment return In determining bonus rates for the UK with-profits policies, smoothing is applied to the allocation of the overall earnings of the UK with-profits fund of which the investment return is a significant element.
The smoothing approach differs between accumulating and conventional with-profits policies to reflect the different contract features.
In normal circumstances, Prudential does not expect most payout values on policies of the same duration to change by more than 10 per cent up or down from one year to the next, although some larger changes may occur to balance payout values between different policies.
Greater flexibility may be required in certain circumstances, for example following a significant rise or fall in market values, and in such situations the PAC Board may decide to vary the standard bonus smoothing limits in order to protect the overall interests of policyholders.
The degree of smoothing is illustrated numerically by comparing in the following table the relatively smoothed level of policyholder bonuses declared as part of the surplus for distribution, with the more volatile movement in investment return and other items of income and expenditure of the UK component of the PAC with-profits fund for each year presented.
2013 m 2012 m Net income of the fund: Investment return 5,757 8,390 Claims incurred 6,681 6,857 Movement in policyholder liabilities 197 3,989 Add back policyholder bonuses for the year as shown below 1,749 1,865 Claims incurred and movement in policyholder liabilities including charge for provision for asset shares and excluding policyholder bonuses 5,129 8,981 Earned premiums, net of reinsurance 3,801 4,558 Other income 52 39 Acquisition costs and other expenditure 1,025 907 Share of profits from investment joint ventures 88 27 Tax charge 308 286 Net income of the fund before movement in unallocated surplus 3,236 2,840 Movement in unallocated surplus 1,294 769 Surplus for distribution 1,942 2,071 Surplus for distribution allocated as follows: 90% policyholders bonus as shown above 1,749 1,865 10% shareholders transfers 193 206 1,942 2,071 The 2012 comparative results have been adjusted from those previously published for the retrospective application of the new and amended accounting standards described in note A2.
ii Annuity business Prudentials conventional annuities include level, fixed-increase and inflation-linked annuities, the link being to the Retail Price Index RPI in the majority of cases.
They are mainly written within the subsidiaries PAL, PRIL, the PAC non-profit sub-fund and the PAC with-profits sub-fund, but there are some annuity liabilities in Prudential Pensions Limited and SAIF.
Prudentials fixed-increase annuities incorporate automatic increases in annuity payments by fixed amounts over the policyholders life.
The RPI annuities that Prudential offers provide for a regular annuity payment to which an additional amount is added periodically based on the increase in the UK RPI.
Prudentials with-profits annuities, which are written in the WPSF, combine the income features of annuity products with the investment smoothing features of with-profits products and enable policyholders to obtain exposure to investment return on the WPSFs equity shares, property and other investment categories over time.
Policyholders select a required smoothed return bonus from the specific range Prudential offers for the particular product.
The amount of the annuity payment each year depends upon the relationship between the required smoothed return bonus rate selected by the policyholder when the product is purchased and the smoothed return bonus rates Prudential subsequently declares each year during the term of the product.
If the total bonus rates fall below the anticipated rate, then the annuity income falls.
iii SAIF SAIF is a ring-fenced sub-fund of the PAC long-term fund formed following the acquisition of the mutually owned Scottish Amicable Life Assurance Society in 1997.
No new business may be written in SAIF, although regular premiums are still being paid on policies in force at the time of the acquisition and incremental premiums are permitted on these policies.
The fund is solely for the benefit of policyholders of SAIF.
The process for determining policyholder bonuses of SAIF with-profits policies, which constitute the vast majority of obligations of the funds, is similar to that for the with-profits policies of the WPSF.
However, in addition, the surplus assets in SAIF are allocated to policies in an orderly and equitable distribution over time as enhancements to policyholder benefits ie in excess of those based on asset share.
Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 227 Provision is made for the risks attaching to some SAIF unitised with-profits policies that have Market Value Reduction MVR-free dates and for those SAIF products which have a guaranteed minimum benefit on death or maturity of premiums accumulated at 4 per cent per annum.
The Groups main exposure to guaranteed annuities in the UK is through SAIF and a provision of 328 million was held in SAIF at 31 December 2013 2012: 371 million to honour the guarantees.
As SAIF is a separate sub-fund solely for the benefit of policyholders of SAIF, this provision has no impact on the financial position of the Groups shareholders equity.
iv Unit-linked non-annuity and other non-profit business Prudential UK insurance operations also have an extensive book of unit-linked policies of varying types and provide a range of other non-profit business such as credit life and protection contracts.
These contracts do not contain significant financial guarantees.
There are no guaranteed maturity values or guaranteed annuity options on unit-linked policies except for minor amounts for certain policies linked to cash units within SAIF.
Determining contract liabilities i Overview The calculation of the contract liabilities involves the setting of assumptions for future experience.
This is done following detailed review of the relevant experience including in particular mortality, expenses, tax, economic assumptions and, where applicable, persistency.
For with-profits business written in the WPSF or SAIF, a market consistent valuation is performed as described in section ii below.
Additional assumptions required are for persistency and the management actions under which the fund is managed.
Assumptions used for a market-consistent valuation typically do not contain margins, whereas those used for the valuation of other classes of business do.
Mortality assumptions are set based on the results of the most recent experience analysis looking at the experience over recent years of the relevant business.
For non-profit business, a margin for adverse deviation is added.
Different assumptions are applied for different product groups.
For annuitant mortality, assumptions for current mortality rates are based on recent experience investigations and expected future improvements in mortality.
The expected future improvements are based on recent experience and projections of the business and industry experience generally.
Maintenance and, for some classes of business, termination expense assumptions are expressed as per policy amounts.
They are set based on the expenses incurred during the year, including an allowance for ongoing investment expenditure and allocated between entities and product groups in accordance with the operations internal cost allocation model.
For non-profit business a margin for adverse deviation is added to this amount.
Expense inflation assumptions are set consistent with the economic basis and based on the difference between yields on nominal gilts and index-linked gilts.
The actual renewal expenses incurred on behalf of SAIF by other Group companies are recharged in full to SAIF.
The assumptions for asset management expenses are based on the charges specified in agreements with the Groups asset management operations, plus a margin for adverse deviation for non-profit business.
Tax assumptions are set equal to current rates of taxation.
For non-profit business excluding unit-linked business, the valuation interest rates used to discount the liabilities are based on the yields as at the valuation date on the assets backing the technical provisions.
For fixed interest securities the gross redemption yield is used except for the PAL including the business recaptured by PAC WPSF in 2011 and PRIL annuity business where the internal rate of return of the assets backing the liabilities is used.
Properties are valued using the rental yield, and for equities it is the greater of the dividend yield and the average of the dividend yield and the earnings yield.
An adjustment is made to the yield on non-risk-free fixed interest securities and property to reflect credit risk.
To calculate the non-unit reserves for linked business, assumptions have been set for the gross unit growth rate and the rate of inflation of maintenance expenses, as well as for the valuation interest rate as described above.
ii WPSF and SAIF The policyholder liabilities reported for the WPSF are primarily for two broad types of business.
These are accumulating and conventional with-profits contracts.
The policyholder liabilities of the WPSF are accounted for under FRS 27.
The provisions have been determined on a basis consistent with the detailed methodology included in regulations contained in the PRAs rules for the determination of reserves on the PRAs realistic Peak 2 basis.
In aggregate, the regime has the effect of placing a value on the liabilities of UK with-profits contracts, which reflects the amounts expected to be paid based on the current value of investments held by the with-profits funds and current circumstances.
These contracts are a combination of insurance and investment contracts with discretionary participation features, as defined by IFRS 4.
The PRAs Peak 2 calculation under the realistic regime requirement is explained further in note A3.1 d under the UK regulated with-profits section.
The contract liabilities for with-profits business also require assumptions for persistency.
These are set based on the results of recent experience analysis.
The process of determining policyholder liabilities of SAIF is similar to that for the with-profits policies of the WPSF.
228 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements C:  C4:  iii Annuity business Credit risk provisions For IFRS reporting, the results for UK shareholder-backed annuity business are particularly sensitive to the allowances made for credit risk.
Further details on credit risk allowance are provided in note B4 c. Mortality The mortality assumptions are set in light of recent population and internal experience.
The assumptions used are percentages of standard actuarial mortality tables with an allowance for future mortality improvements.
Where annuities have been sold on an enhanced basis to impaired lives an additional age adjustment is made.
The percentages of the standard table used are selected according to the source of business.
Since 2009, new mortality projection models have been released annually by the Continuous Mortality Investigation CMI.

For these contracts the attaching liability reflects the unit value obligation and provision for expenses and mortality risk.
The latter component is determined by applying mortality assumptions on a basis that is appropriate for the policyholder profile.
For unit-linked business, the assets covering unit liabilities are exposed to market risk, but the residual risk when considering the unit-linked liabilities and assets together is limited to the effect on fund-based charges.
For those contracts where the level of insurance risk is insignificant, the assets and liabilities arising under the contracts are distinguished between those that relate to the financial instrument liability and acquisition costs and deferred income that relate to the component of the contract that relates to investment management.
Acquisition costs and deferred income are recognised consistent with the level of service provision in line with the requirements of IAS 18. v Effect of changes in assumptions used to measure insurance assets and liabilities Credit risk There has been no change of approach in the setting of assumption levels of credit risk in 2013 and 2012.
However, changes in the portfolio have given rise to altered levels of credit risk allowance as set out in note B4 c. Other operating assumption changes The effect of other operating assumption changes for the shareholder-backed business is set out in note B4 c. For the with-profits sub-fund, the aggregate effect of assumption changes in 2013 was a net credit to unallocated surplus of 200 million 2012: net charge of 90 million, relating to changes in mortality assumptions, offsetting releases of margins, and altered expense, persistency and economic assumptions, where appropriate in the two periods.

As discussed in note D1 there was no goodwill attached to the purchase of REALIC or Thanachart Life.
Other goodwill amounts by acquired operations are not individually material.
The aggregate goodwill impairment of 120 million at 31 December 2013 and 2012 relates to the goodwill held in relation to the Japan life business which was impaired in 2005.
The Group signed an agreement to sell the Japan life business in July 2013.
The completion of the transaction is dependent on regulatory approval.
Impairment testing Goodwill does not generate cash flows independently of other groups of assets and thus is assigned to cash-generating units for the purposes of impairment testing.
These cash-generating units are based upon how management monitors the business and represent the lowest level to which goodwill can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Assessment of whether goodwill may be impaired Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the cash-generating units carrying amount, including any goodwill, with its recoverable amount.
With the exception of M&G, the goodwill attributable to shareholders mainly relates to acquired life businesses.
The Company routinely compares the aggregate of net asset value and acquired goodwill on an IFRS basis of acquired life business with the value of the business as determined using the EEV methodology, as described in note 15.
Any excess of IFRS over EEV carrying value is then compared with EEV basis value of current and projected future new business to determine whether there is any indication that the goodwill in the IFRS statement of financial position may be impaired.
The assumptions underpinning the Groups EEV basis of reporting are included in the EEV basis supplementary information in this Annual Report.
M&G The recoverable amount for the M&G cash-generating units has been determined by calculating its value in use.
This has been calculated by aggregating the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from the M&G operating segment based upon management projections.
The discounted cash flow valuation has been based on a three-year plan prepared by M&G, and approved by management, and cash flow projections for later years.
The value in use is particularly sensitive to a number of key assumptions as follows: i The set of economic, market and business assumptions used to derive the three-year plan.
The direct and secondary effects of recent developments, eg changes in global equity markets, are considered by management in arriving at the expectations for the financial projections for the plan.
ii The assumed growth rate on forecast cash flows beyond the terminal year of the plan.
A growth rate of 2.5 per cent 2012: 2.5 per cent has been used to extrapolate beyond the plan period representing managements best estimate view of the long-term growth rate of the business after considering the future and past growth rates and external sources of data.
iii The risk discount rate.
Differing discount rates have been applied in accordance with the nature of the individual component businesses.
For retail and institutional business, a risk discount rate of 12 per cent 2012: 12 per cent has been applied to post-tax cash flows.
The pre-tax risk discount rate was 18 per cent 2012: 15 per cent.
Management have determined the risk discount rate by reference to an average implied discount rate for comparable UK listed asset managers calculated by reference to risk-free rates, equity risk premiums of 5 per cent and an average beta factor for relative market risk of comparable UK listed asset managers.
A similar approach has been applied for the other component businesses of M&G.
iv That asset management contracts continue on similar terms.
Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 231 Management believes that any reasonable change in the key assumptions would not cause the recoverable amount of M&G to fall below its carrying amount.

PVIF and other intangibles includes software rights of 56 million 2012: 60 million with additions of 26 million, amortisation of 27 million, disposals and other movements of 1 million and exchange losses of 2 million.
The additions of 297 million for PVIF and other intangibles in 2013 include the amount advanced to secure the exclusive 15-year bancassurance partnership agreement entered into with Thanachart Bank in Thailand.
Further, the addition of 21 million for acquisition of subsidiaries is for the acquisition of Thanachart Life.
The amount of 5 million for 2012 was for the acquisition of REALIC.
 Summary balances The DAC amount in respect of US insurance operations comprises amounts in respect of: 2013 m 2012 m Variable annuity business 3,716 3,330 Other business 868 821 Cumulative shadow DAC for unrealised gains losses booked in other comprehensive income 463 952 Total DAC for US operations 4,121 3,199 Consequent upon the negative unrealised valuation movement in 2013 of 2,089 million 2012: positive unrealised valuation movement of 862 million, there is a credit of 498 million 2012: a debit of 270 million for altered shadow DAC amortisation booked within other comprehensive income.
These adjustments reflect movement from period to period, in the changes to the pattern of reported gross profits that would have happened if the assets reflected in the statement of financial position had been sold, crystallising the unrealised gains and losses, and the proceeds reinvested at the yields currently available in the market.
At 31 December 2013, the cumulative shadow DAC balance as shown in the table above was negative 463 million 2012: negative 952 million.
232 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements C:  C5:  Overview of the deferral and amortisation of acquisition costs for Jackson Under IFRS 4, the Group applies grandfathered US GAAP for measuring the insurance assets and liabilities of Jackson.
In the case of Jackson term business, acquisition costs are deferred and amortised in line with expected profits.
For annuity and interest-sensitive life business, acquisition costs are deferred and amortised in line with a combination of historical and future expected gross profits on the relevant contracts.
For fixed and index annuity and interest-sensitive life business, the key assumption is the long-term spread between the earned rate on investments and the rate credited to policyholders, which is based on an annual spread analysis.
Expected gross profits also depend on mortality assumptions, assumed unit costs and terminations other than deaths including the related charges, all of which are based on a combination of actual experience of Jackson, industry experience and future expectations.
A detailed analysis of actual mortality, lapse and expense experience is performed using internally developed experience studies.
As with fixed and index annuity and interest-sensitive life business, acquisition costs for Jacksons variable annuity products are amortised in line with the emergence of profits.
The measurement of the amortisation in part reflects current period fees including those for guaranteed minimum death, income, or withdrawal benefits earned on assets covering liabilities to policyholders, and the historical and expected level of future gross profits which depends on the assumed level of future fees, as well as components related to mortality, lapse, and expense.
Mean reversion technique For variable annuity products, under US GAAP as grandfathered under IFRS 4 the projected gross profits, against which acquisition costs are amortised, reflect an assumed long-term level of returns on separate account investments which, as referenced in note A2, for Jackson, is 7.4 per cent 2012: 8.4 per cent after deduction of net external fund management fees.
This is applied to the period end level of separate account assets after application of a mean reversion technique that removes a portion of the effect of levels of short-term variability in current market returns.
Under the mean reversion technique applied by Jackson, the projected level of return for each of the next five years is adjusted from period to period so that in combination with the actual rates of return for the preceding two years and the current period, the 7.4 per cent 2012: 8.4 per cent annual return is realised on average over the entire eight-year period.
Projected returns after the mean reversion period revert back to the 7.4 per cent 2012: 8.4 per cent assumption.
However, to ensure that the methodology does not over anticipate a reversion to trend following adverse markets, the mean reversion technique has a cap and floor feature whereby the projected returns in each of the next five years can be no more than 15 per cent per annum and no less than 0 per cent per annum both gross of asset management fees in each year.
Sensitivity of amortisation charge The amortisation charge to the income statement is reflected in both operating profit and short-term fluctuations in investment returns.
The amortisation charge to the operating profit in a reporting period comprises: i a core amount that reflects a relatively stable proportion of underlying premiums or profit: and ii an element of acceleration or deceleration arising from market movements differing from expectations.
In periods where the cap and floor feature of the mean reversion technique are not relevant, the technique operates to dampen the second element above.
Nevertheless, extreme market movements can cause material acceleration or deceleration of amortisation in spite of this dampening effect.
Furthermore, in those periods where the cap or floor is relevant, the mean reversion technique provides no further dampening and additional volatility may result.
In 2013, the DAC amortisation charge for operating profit was determined after including a credit for decelerated amortisation of 82 million 2012: 56 million.
The 2013 amount primarily reflects the separate account performance of 20 per cent, which is higher than the assumed level for the year.
As noted above, the application of the mean reversion formula has the effect of dampening the impact of equity market movements on DAC amortisation while the mean reversion assumption lies within the corridor.
It would take a significant movement in equity markets in 2014 outside the range of negative 37 per cent to positive 27 per cent for the mean reversion assumption to move outside the corridor.

Notes i All of the PVIF balances relate to insurance contracts and are accounted for under UK GAAP as permitted by IFRS 4.
The PVIF attaching to investment contracts have been fully amortised.
Amortisation is charged to the acquisition costs and other operating expenditure line in the income statement over the period of provision of asset management services as those profits emerge.
ii Other intangibles comprise distribution and software rights.
Distribution rights relate to facilitation fees paid in respect of the bancassurance partnership arrangements in Asia for the bank distribution of Prudentials insurance products for a fixed period of time.
The distribution rights amounts are amortised over the term of the distribution contracts.
Software is amortised over its useful economic life, which generally represents the licence period of the software acquired.
Amortisation is charged to the acquisition costs and other expenditure line in the income statement.

The venture fund investments consolidated by the Group relates to investments of the PAC with-profits fund which are managed by M&G for which the goodwill is shown in the table above.
Goodwill is tested for impairment of these investments by comparing the investments carrying value including goodwill with its recoverable amount fair value less costs to sell.
The fair value is determined by using a discounted cash flow valuation based on cash flow projections to 2016 prepared by management after considering the historical experience and future growth rates of the business.
The key assumption applied in the calculations is the risk discount rate which were from 10 to 14 per cent.
The discount rates were derived by reference to risk-free rates and an equity premium risk.
In 2013 and 2012, none of the goodwill was impaired.

Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 237 C7:  C7.1 Groupoverview The Groups risk framework and the management of the risk including those attached to the Groups financial statements including financial assets, financial liabilities and insurance liabilities, together with the inter-relationship with the management of capital have been included in the audited sections of Group chief risk officers report on the risks facing our business and our capital strength within the Strategic Report.
As part of the risk management framework, the Group regularly monitors concentration of risk using a variety of risk monitoring tools, including scenario testing and sensitivity analysis of the Groups capital and profitability metrics involving IGD, Group economic capital, EEV and IFRS, to help identify concentrations of risks by risk types, products and business units, as well as the benefits of diversification of risks as described further below.
Business units are also required to disclose to the Group risk function all material risks, along with information on their severity and likelihood, and mitigating actions taken or planned.
Credit risk remains one of the largest risk exposures.
This reflects the relative size of exposure in Jackson and the UK shareholder annuities business.
The Group manages concentration of credit risks by setting limits on the maximum exposure to each counterparty based on their credit ratings.
The financial and insurance assets and liabilities attaching to the Groups life assurance business are, to varying degrees, subject to market and insurance risk and other changes of experience assumptions that may have a material effect on IFRS basis profit or loss and shareholders equity.
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument or, in the case of liabilities of insurance contracts, their carrying value will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises three types of risk, namely: Foreign exchange risk: due to changes in foreign exchange rates: Interest rate risk: due to changes in market interest rates: and Other price risk: due to fluctuations in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or foreign exchange risk.
Policyholder liabilities relating to the Groups life assurance businesses are also sensitive to the effects of other changes in experience, or expected future experience, such as for mortality, other insurance risk and lapse risk.
Three key points are to be noted, namely: The Groups with-profits and unit-linked funds absorb most market risk attaching to the funds investments.
Except for second order effects, for example on asset management fees and shareholders share of cost of bonuses for with-profits business, shareholder results are not directly affected by market value movements on the assets of these funds: The Groups shareholder results are most sensitive to market risks for assets of the shareholder-backed business: and The main exposures of the Groups IFRS basis results to market risk for its life assurance operations on investments of the shareholder-backed business are for debt securities.
The most significant items for which the IFRS shareholders profit or loss and shareholders equity for the Groups life assurance business is sensitive to these variables are shown in the following tables.
The distinction between direct and indirect exposure is not intended to indicate the relative size of the sensitivity.

The sensitivity analyses provided show the effect on profit or loss and shareholders equity to changes in the relevant risk variables, all of which are reasonably possible at the relevant balance sheet date.
 The Group enjoys significant diversification benefits achieved through the geographical spread of the Groups operations and, within those operations through a broad mix of products types.
This arises because not all risk scenarios are likely to happen at the same time and across all geographic regions.
Relevant correlation factors include: Correlation across geographic regions: Financial risk factors: and Non-financial risk factors.
Correlation across risk factors: Longevity risk: Expenses: Persistency: and Other risks.
The effect of Group diversification across the Groups life businesses is to significantly reduce the aggregate standalone volatility risk to IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns.
The effect is almost wholly explained by the correlations across risk types, in particular longevity risk.
C7.2   The Asia operations sell with-profits and unit-linked policies and, although the with-profits business generally has a lower terminal bonus element than in the UK, the investment portfolio still contains a proportion of equities.
Non-participating business is largely backed by debt securities or deposits.
The Groups exposure to market risk arising from its Asia operations is therefore at modest levels.
This reflects the fact that the Asia operations have a balanced portfolio of with-profits, unit-linked and other types of business.
In Asia, adverse persistency experience can impact the IFRS profitability of certain types of business written in the region.
This risk is managed at a business unit level through regular monitoring of experience and the implementation of management actions as necessary.
These actions could include product enhancements, increased management focus on premium collection as well as other customer retention efforts.
The potential financial impact of lapses is often mitigated through the specific features of the products, eg surrender charges, or through the availability of premium holiday or partial withdrawal policy features.
In summary, for Asia operations, the operating profit based on longer-term investment returns is mainly affected by the impact of market levels on unit-linked persistency, and other insurance risks.
At the total IFRS profit level the Asia result is affected by short-term value movements on the asset portfolio for non-linked shareholder-backed business.
240 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements C:  C7:  i Sensitivity to risks other than foreign exchange risk With-profits business Similar principles to those explained for UK with-profits business in C7.4 apply to profit emergence for the Asia with-profits business.
Correspondingly, the profit emergence reflects bonus declaration and is relatively insensitive to period by period fluctuations in insurance risk or interest rate movements.
Unit-linked business As for the UK insurance operations, for unit-linked business, the main factor affecting the profit and shareholders equity of the Asia operations is investment performance through asset management fees.
The sensitivity of profits and shareholders equity to changes in insurance risk interest rate risk and credit risk are not material.
Other business Interest rate risk Excluding its with-profit and unit-linked business, the results of the Asia business are sensitive to the vagaries of routine movements in interest rates.
For the purposes of analysing sensitivity to variations in interest rates, reference has been made to the movements in the 10-year government bond rates of the territories.
At 31 December 2013, 10-year government bond rates vary from territory to territory and range from 1.7 per cent to 9.0 per cent 2012: 0.6 per cent to 9.5 per cent.
For the sensitivity analysis as shown in the table below, the reasonably possible interest rate movement used is one per cent for all territories but subject to a floor of zero where the bond rates are currently below 1 per cent.
The estimated sensitivity to the decrease and increase in interest rates at 31 December 2013 and 2012 is as follows: 2013 m 2012 m Decrease Increase Decrease Increase of1% of1% of1% of1% Pre-tax profit 311 215 205 259 Related deferred tax where applicable 34 40 45 43 Net effect on profit and shareholders equity 277 175 160 216 The 2012 comparative results have been adjusted from those previously published for the retrospective application of the new and amended accounting standards described in note A2.
The pre-tax impacts, if they arose, would mostly be recorded within the category short-term fluctuations in investments returns in the Groups segmental analysis of profit before tax.
The degree of sensitivity of the results of the non-linked shareholder-backed business of the Asia operations to movements in interest rates depends upon the degree to which the liabilities under the grandfathered IFRS 4 measurement basis reflects market interest rates from period to period.
For example for those countries, such as those applying US GAAP, the results can be more sensitive as the effect of interest rate movements on the backing investments may not be offset by liability movements.
Equity price risk The non-linked shareholder business has limited exposure to equity and property investment 571 million at 31 December 2013.
Generally changes in equity and property investment values are not directly offset by movements in policyholder liabilities.
The estimated sensitivity to a 10 per cent and 20 per cent change in equity and property prices for shareholder-backed Asia other business, which would be reflected in the short-term fluctuation component of the Groups segmental analysis of profit before tax, at 31 December 2013 and 2012 would be as follows: 2013 m 2012 m Decrease Decrease Decrease Decrease of20% of10% of20% of10% Pre-tax profit 114 57 129 65 Related deferred tax where applicable 24 12 26 13 Net effect on profit and shareholders equity 90 45 103 52 The 2012 comparative results have been adjusted from those previously published for the retrospective application of the new and amended accounting standards described in note A2.
Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 241 A 10 or 20 per cent increase in their value would have an approximately equal and opposite effect on profit and shareholders equity to the sensitivities shown above.
The market risk sensitivities shown above reflect the impact of temporary market movements and, therefore, the primary effect of such movements would, in the Groups segmental analysis of profits, be included within the short-term fluctuations in investment returns.
In the equity risk sensitivity analysis shown above, the Group has considered the impact of an instantaneous 20 per cent fall in equity markets.
If equity markets were to fall by more than 20 per cent, the Group believes that this would not be an instantaneous fall but rather this would be expected to occur over a period of time during which the Group would be able to put in place mitigating management actions.
Insurance risk Many of the territories in Asia are exposed to mortality morbidity risk and provision is made within policyholder liabilities on a prudent regulatory basis to cover the potential exposure.
If these prudent assumptions were strengthened by 5 per cent then it is estimated that post tax profit would be decreased by approximately 38 million 2012: 30 million.
Mortality and morbidity has a symmetrical effect on the portfolio and any weakening of these assumptions would have a similar equal and opposite impact.
ii Sensitivity to foreign exchange risk Consistent with the Groups accounting policies, the profits of the Asia insurance operations are translated at average exchange rates and shareholders equity at the closing rate for the reporting period.
For 2013, the rates for the most significant operations are given in note A1.
A 10 per cent increase or decrease in these rates would have reduced or increased profit before tax attributable to shareholders, profit for the year and shareholders equity, excluding goodwill, attributable to Asia operations respectively as follows: A10%increaseinlocal A10%decreaseinlocal   2013 m 2012 m 2013 m 2012 m note Profit before tax attributable to shareholders 63 90 77 110 Profit for the year 49 75 60 92 Shareholders equity, excluding goodwill, attributable to Asia operations 246 243 300 297 Note Sensitivity on profit loss before tax ie aggregate of the operating profit based on longer-term investment returns and short-term fluctuations in investment returns.
C7.3   At the level of operating profit based on longer-term investment returns, Jacksons results are sensitive to market conditions to the extent of income earned on spread-based products and second order equity-based exposure in respect of variable annuity asset management fees.
Jacksons main exposures are to market risk through its exposure to interest rate risk and equity risk.
Approximately 94 per cent 2012: 94 per cent of its general account investments support fixed interest rate and fixed index annuities, life business and surplus and 6 per cent 2012: 6 per cent support institutional business.
All of these types of business contain considerable interest rate guarantee features and, consequently, require that the assets that support them are primarily fixed income or fixed maturity.
Jackson is exposed primarily to the following risks: Risks Riskofloss Equity risk Related to the incidence of benefits related to guarantees issued in connection with its VA contracts: and Related to meeting contractual accumulation requirements in FIA contracts.
Interest rate risk Related to meeting guaranteed rates of accumulation on fixed annuity products following a sharp and sustained fall in interest rates: Related to the guarantee features attaching to the companys products and to policyholder withdrawals following a sharp and sustained increase in interest rates: and The risk of mismatch between the expected duration of certain annuity liabilities and repayment risk and extension risk inherent in mortgage-backed securities.
Jacksons derivative programme is used to manage interest rate risk associated with a broad range of products and equity market risk attaching to its equity-based products.
Movements in equity markets, interest rates and credit spreads materially affect the carrying value of derivatives which are used to manage the liabilities to policyholders and backing investment assets.
Combined with the use of US GAAP measurement as grandfathered under IFRS 4 for the insurance contracts assets and liabilities which is largely insensitive to current period market movements, the Jackson total profit ie including short-term fluctuations in investment returns is very sensitive to market movements.
In addition to these effects the Jackson shareholders equity is sensitive to the impact of interest rate and credit spread movements on the value of fixed income securities.
Movements in unrealised appreciation on these securities are included as movement in shareholders equity ie outside the income statement.
242 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements C:  C7:  Jackson enters into financial derivative transactions, including those noted below to reduce and manage business risks.
These transactions manage the risk of a change in the value, yield, price, cash flows or quantity of, or a degree of exposure with respect to assets, liabilities or future cash flows, which Jackson has acquired or incurred.
Jackson uses free-standing derivative instruments for hedging purposes.
Additionally, certain liabilities, primarily trust instruments supported by funding agreements, fixed index annuities, certain GMWB variable annuity features and reinsured GMIB variable annuity features contain embedded derivatives as defined by IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Jackson does not account for such derivatives as either fair value or cash flow hedges as might be permitted if the specific hedge documentation requirements of IAS 39 were followed.
Financial derivatives, including derivatives embedded in certain host liabilities that have been separated for accounting and financial reporting purposes are carried at fair value.
Value movements on the derivatives are reported within the income statement.
In preparing Jacksons segment profit as shown in note B1.1, value movements on Jacksons derivative contracts are included within short-term fluctuations in investment returns and excluded from operating results based on longer-term investment returns.
The principal types of derivatives used by Jackson and their purpose are as follows: Derivative Purpose Interest rate swaps These generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating payments over the period for which Jackson holds the instrument without an exchange of the underlying principal amount.
These agreements are used for hedging purposes.
Put-swaption contracts These contracts provide the purchaser with the right, but not the obligation, to require the writer to pay the present value of a long-duration interest rate swap at future exercise dates.
Jackson purchases and writes put-swaptions with maturities up to 10 years.
Put-swaptions hedge against significant movements in interest rates.
Equity index futures contracts These derivatives including various call, put options and put spreads are used to hedge Jacksons and equity index options obligations associated with its issuance of fixed index immediate and deferred annuities and certain VA guarantees.
Some of these annuities and guarantees contain embedded options which are fair valued for financial reporting purposes.
Total return swaps Total return swaps in which Jackson receives equity returns or returns based on reference pools of assets in exchange for short-term floating rate payments based on notional amounts, are held for both hedging and investment purposes.
Cross-currency swaps Cross-currency swaps, which embody spot and forward currency swaps and additionally, in some cases, interest rate swaps and equity index swaps, are entered into for the purpose of hedging Jacksons foreign currency denominated funding agreements supporting trust instrument obligations.
Credit default swaps These swaps represent agreements under which Jackson has purchased default protection on certain underlying corporate bonds held in its portfolio.
These contracts allow Jackson to sell the protected bonds at par value to the counterparty if a default event occurs in exchange for periodic payments made by Jackson for the life of the agreement.
Jackson does not write default protection using credit derivatives.
The estimated sensitivity of Jacksons profit and shareholders equity to equity and interest rate risks provided below is net of the related changes in amortisation of DAC.
The effect on the related changes in amortisation of DAC provided is based on the current grandfathered US GAAP DAC basis but does not include any effect from an acceleration or deceleration of amortisation of DAC.
Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 243 i Sensitivity to equity risk At 31 December 2013 and 2012, Jackson had variable annuity contracts with guarantees, for which the net amount at risk NAR is defined as the amount of guaranteed benefit in excess of current account value, as follows: Period Net Weighted until Minimum Account amount average expected return value atrisk attainedage annuitisation 31December2013 m m Return of net deposits plus a minimum return GMDB 0-6% 52,985 1,248 64.7 years GMWB Premium only 0% 2,260 36 GMWB 0-5% 5,632 46 GMAB Premium only 0% 57 Highest specified anniversary account value minus withdrawals post-anniversary GMDB 5,522 134 64.6 years GMWB Highest anniversary only 2,039 93 GMWB 717 62 Combination net deposits plus minimum return, highest specified anniversary account value minus withdrawals post-anniversary GMDB 0-6% 3,522 217 66.9 years GMIB 0-6% 1,642 317 2.4 years GMWB 0-8% 40,906 1,059 Period Net Weighted until Minimum Account amount average expected return value atrisk attainedage annuitisation 31December2012 m m Return of net deposits plus a minimum return GMDB 0-6% 40,964 1,839 64.4 years GMWB Premium only 0% 2,213 91 GMWB 0-5% 3,359 88 GMAB Premium only 0% 53 Highest specified anniversary account value minus withdrawals post-anniversary GMDB 4,554 324 64.0 years GMWB Highest anniversary only 1,880 245 GMWB 697 137 Combination net deposits plus minimum return, highest specified anniversary account value minus withdrawals post-anniversary GMDB 0-6% 2,705 348 66.4 years GMIB 0-6% 1,588 469 3.3 years GMWB 0-8% 31,167 1,918 Amounts shown for Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit comprise sums for the not for life portion where the guaranteed withdrawal base less the account value equals to the net amount at risk NAR, and a for life portion where the NAR has been estimated as the present value of future expected benefit payment remaining after the amount of the not for life guaranteed benefits is zero.
Ranges shown based on simple interest.
The upper limits of 5 per cent, or 8 per cent simple interest are approximately equal to 4.1 per cent and 6 per cent respectively, on a compound interest basis over a typical ten year bonus period.
For example 1 10 x 0.05 is similar to 1.041 growing at a compound rate of 4.01 per cent for a further nine years.
The GMIB reinsurance guarantees are fully reinsured.
244 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements C:  C7:  Account balances of contracts with guarantees were invested in variable separate accounts as follows: 2013 m 2012 m Mutual fund type: Equity 40,529 28,706 Bond 10,043 10,433 Balanced 10,797 8,379 Money market 703 729 Total 62,072 48,247 As noted above, Jackson is exposed to equity risk through the options embedded in the fixed index liabilities and Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit and Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit guarantees included in certain variable annuity benefits as illustrated above.
This risk is managed using an equity hedging programme to minimise the risk of a significant economic impact as a result of increases or decreases in equity market levels while taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures in Jacksons operations.
Jackson purchases external futures and options that hedge the risks inherent in these products, while also considering the impact of rising and falling separate account fees.
As a result of this hedging programme, if the equity markets were to increase further in the future, the net effect of Jacksons free-standing derivatives would decrease in value.
However, over time, this movement would be broadly offset by increased separate account fees and reserve decreases, net of the related changes to amortisation of deferred acquisition costs.
Due to the nature of the free-standing and embedded derivatives, this hedge, while highly effective on an economic basis, may not completely mute in the financial reporting of the immediate impact of equity market movements as the free-standing derivatives reset immediately while the hedged liabilities reset more slowly and fees are recognised prospectively.
The opposite impact would be observed if the equity markets were to decrease.
In addition to the exposure explained above, Jackson is also exposed to equity risk from its holding of equity securities, partnerships in investment pools and other financial derivatives, including that relating to the reinsurance of Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit guarantees.
At 31 December 2013, the estimated sensitivity of Jacksons profit, and shareholders equity to immediate increases and decreases in equity markets is shown below.
The sensitivities are shown net of related changes in DAC amortisation.

In addition, the sensitivity movements shown include those relating to the fixed index annuity and the reinsurance of GMIB guarantees.
The above table provides sensitivity movements as at a point in time while the actual impact on financial results would vary contingent upon the volume of new product sales and lapses, changes to the derivative portfolio, correlation of market returns and various other factors including volatility, interest rates and elapsed time.
The directional movements in the sensitivities reflect the hedging programme in place at 31 December 2013.
Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 245 ii Sensitivity to interest rate risk Notwithstanding the market risk exposure previously described, except in the circumstances of interest rate scenarios where the guarantee rates included in contract terms are higher than crediting rates that can be supported from assets held to cover liabilities, the accounting measurement of fixed annuity liabilities of Jackson products is not generally sensitive to interest rate risk.
This position derives from the nature of the products and the US GAAP basis of measurement.
The GMWB features attaching to variable annuity business other than for-life are accounted for as embedded derivatives which are fair valued and so will be sensitive to changes in interest rate.
Debt securities and related derivatives are marked to fair value.
Value movements on derivatives, again net of related changes to amortisation of DAC and deferred tax, are recorded within the income statement.
Fair value movements on debt securities, net of related changes to amortisation of DAC and deferred tax, are recorded within other comprehensive income.
The estimated sensitivity of these items and policyholder liabilities to a 1 per cent and 2 per cent decrease subject to a floor of zero and increase in interest rates at 31 December 2013 and 2012 is as follows: 2013 m 2012 m Decrease Decrease Increase Increase Decrease Decrease Increase Increase of2% of1% of1% of2% of2% of1% of1% of2% Profit and loss: Pre-tax profit effect net of related changes in amortisation of DAC 128 66 52 161 187 54 186 Related effect on charge for deferred tax 45 23 18 56 65 19 65 Net profit effect 83 43 34 105 122 35 121 Other comprehensive income: Direct effect on carrying value of debt securities net of related changes in amortisation of DAC 2,624 1,477 1,477 2,624 2,541 1,427 1,427 2,541 Related effect on movement in deferred tax 918 517 517 918 889 499 499 889 Net effect 1,706 960 960 1,706 1,652 928 928 1,652 Total net effect on shareholders equity 1,623 917 994 1,811 1,530 928 963 1,773 These sensitivities are shown only for interest rates in isolation and do not include other movements in credit risk that may affect credit spreads and valuations of debt securities.
iii Sensitivity to foreign exchange risk Consistent with the Groups accounting policies, the profits of the Groups US operations are translated at average exchange rates and shareholders equity at the closing rate for the reporting period.
A 10 per cent increase or decrease in these rates would reduce or increase profit before tax attributable to shareholders, profit for the year and shareholders equity attributable to US insurance operations respectively as follows: A10%increasein A10%decreasein US$:exchangerates US$:exchangerates 2013 m 2012 m 2013 m 2012 m note Profit before tax attributable to shareholders 50 78 61 95 Profit for the year 41 56 50 69 Shareholders equity attributable to US insurance operations 313 395 383 483 Note Sensitivity on profit before tax ie aggregate of the operating profit based on longer-term investment returns and short-term fluctuations in investment returns.
246 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements C:  C7:  iv Other sensitivities Total profit of Jackson is very sensitive to market risk on the assets covering liabilities other than variable annuity business segregated in the separate accounts.
As with other shareholder-backed business the profit or loss for Jackson is presented by distinguishing the result for the year between an operating result based on longer-term investment returns and short-term fluctuations in investment returns.
In this way the most significant direct effect of market changes that have taken place to the Jackson result are separately identified.
The principal determinants of variations in operating profit based on longer-term returns are: Growth in the size of assets under management covering the liabilities for the contracts in force: Variations in fees and other income, offset by variations in market value adjustment payments and, where necessary, strengthening of liabilities: Spread returns for the difference between investment returns and rates credited to policyholders: and Amortisation of deferred acquisition costs.
For term business, acquisition costs are deferred and amortised in line with expected premiums.
For annuity and interest sensitive life business, acquisition costs are deferred and amortised in line with expected gross profits on the relevant contracts.
For interest-sensitive business, the key assumption is the expected long-term spread between the earned rate and the rate credited to policyholders, which is based on an annual spread analysis.
In addition, expected gross profits depend on mortality assumptions, assumed unit costs and terminations other than deaths including the related charges all of which are based on a combination of actual experience of Jackson, industry experience and future expectations.
A detailed analysis of actual experience is measured by internally developed expense, mortality and persistency studies.
Except to the extent of mortality experience, which primarily affects profits through variations in claim payments and GMDB reserves, the profits of Jackson are relatively insensitive to changes in insurance risk.
Jackson is sensitive to lapse risk.
However, Jackson uses derivatives to ameliorate the effect of a sharp rise in interest rates, which would be the most likely cause of a sudden change in policyholder behaviour.
For variable annuity business, the key assumption is the expected long-term level of separate account returns, which for 2013 was 7.4 per cent 2012: 8.4 per cent.
The impact of using this return is reflected in two principal ways, namely: Through the projected expected gross profits which are used to determine the amortisation of deferred acquisition costs.
This is applied through the use of a mean reversion technique which is described in more detail in note C5.1 b above: and The required level of provision for guaranteed minimum death benefit claims.
C7.4   The IFRS basis results of the UK insurance operations are most sensitive to asset liability matching, mortality and default rate experience and longevity assumptions and the difference between the return on corporate bond and risk-free rate for shareholder-backed annuity business of PRIL and the PAC non-profit sub-fund.
Further details are described below.
The IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns for UK insurance operations is sensitive to changes in longevity assumptions affecting the carrying value of liabilities to policyholders for UK shareholder-backed annuity business.
At the total IFRS profit level, the result is particularly sensitive to temporary value movements on assets backing the capital of the shareholder-backed annuity business.
With-profits business SAIF Shareholders have no interest in the profits of the ring-fenced fund of SAIF but are entitled to the asset management fees paid on the assets of the fund.
With-profits sub-fund business The shareholder results of the UK with-profits business including non-participating annuity business of the WPSF and of Prudential Annuities Limited PAL, which is owned by the WPSF are only sensitive to market risk through the indirect effect of investment performance on declared policyholder bonuses.
The investment assets of PAC with-profits funds are subject to market risk.
Changes in their carrying value, net of related changes to asset-share liabilities of with-profit contracts, affect the level of unallocated surplus of the fund.
Therefore, the level of unallocated surplus is particularly sensitive to the level of investment returns on the portion of the assets that represents surplus.
However, as unallocated surplus is accounted for as a liability under IFRS, movements in its value do not affect shareholders profit and equity.
The shareholder results of the UK with-profits fund correspond to the shareholders share of the cost of bonuses declared on the with-profits business which is currently one-ninth of the cost of bonuses declared.
Investment performance is a key driver of bonuses, and hence the shareholders share of the cost of bonuses.
Due to the smoothed basis of bonus declaration, the sensitivity to investment performance in a single year is low relative to movements in the period to period performance.
However, over multiple periods, it is important.
Mortality and other insurance risk are relatively minor factors in the determination of the bonus rates.
Adverse persistency experience can affect the level of profitability from with-profits but in any given one year, the shareholders share of cost of bonus may only be marginally affected.
However, altered persistency trends may affect future expected shareholder transfers.
Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 247 Shareholder-backed annuity business The principal items affecting the IFRS results of the UK shareholder-backed annuity business are mortality experience and assumptions, and credit risk.
The assets covering the liabilities are principally debt securities and other investments that are held to match the expected duration and payment characteristics of the policyholder liabilities.
These liabilities are valued for IFRS reporting purposes by applying discount rates that reflect the market rates of return attaching to the covering assets.
Except to the extent of any asset liability duration mismatch which is reviewed regularly, and exposure to credit risk, the sensitivity of the Groups results to market risk for movements in the carrying value of the liabilities and covering assets is broadly neutral on a net basis.
The main market risk sensitivity for the UK shareholder-backed annuity business arises from interest rate risk on the debt securities which substantially represent shareholders equity.
This shareholders equity comprises the net assets held within the long-term fund of the company that cover regulatory basis liabilities that are not recognised for IFRS reporting purposes, for example contingency reserves, and shareholder capital held outside the long-term fund.
In summary, profits from shareholder-backed annuity business are most sensitive to: The extent to which the duration of the assets held closely matches the expected duration of the liabilities under the contracts: Actual versus expected default rates on assets held: The difference between long-term rates of return on corporate bonds and risk-free rates: The variance between actual and expected mortality experience: The extent to which changes to the assumed rate of improvements in mortality give rise to changes in the measurement of liabilities: and Changes in renewal expense levels.
A decrease in assumed mortality rates of 1 per cent would decrease gross profits by approximately 71 million 2012: 74 million.
A decrease in credit default assumptions of five basis points would increase gross profits by 151 million 2012: 157 million.
A decrease in renewal expenses excluding asset management expenses of 5 per cent would increase gross profits by 27 million 2012: 25 million.
The effect on profits would be approximately symmetrical for changes in assumptions that are directionally opposite to those explained above.
Unit-linked and other business Unit-linked and other business represents a comparatively small proportion of the in-force business of the UK insurance operations.
Due to the matching of policyholder liabilities to attaching asset value movements the UK unit-linked business is not directly affected by market or credit risk.
The liabilities of the other business are also broadly insensitive to market risk.
Profits from unit-linked and similar contracts primarily arise from the excess of charges to policyholders for management of assets under the Companys stewardship, over expenses incurred.
The former is most sensitive to the net accretion of funds under management as a function of new business and lapse and timing of death.
The accounting impact of the latter is dependent upon the amortisation of acquisition costs in line with the emergence of margins for insurance contracts and amortisation in line with service provision for the investment management component of investment contracts.
By virtue of the design features of most of the contracts which provide low levels of mortality cover, the profits are relatively insensitive to changes in mortality experience.
i Sensitivity to interest rate risk and other market risk By virtue of the fund structure, product features and basis of accounting, the policyholder liabilities of the UK insurance operations are, except annuity business, not generally exposed to interest rate risk.
At 31 December 2013 annuity liabilities accounted for 98 per cent 2012: 98 per cent of UK shareholder-backed business liabilities.
For annuity business, liabilities are exposed to interest rate risk.
However, the net exposure to the PAC WPSF for PAL and shareholders for annuity liabilities of PRIL and the non-profit sub-fund is very substantially ameliorated by virtue of the close matching of assets with appropriate duration.
The level of matching from period to period can vary depending on management actions and economic factors so it is possible for a degree of mis-matching profits or losses to arise.
The close matching by the Group of assets of appropriate duration to annuity liabilities is based on maintaining economic and regulatory capital.
The measurement of liabilities under capital reporting requirements and IFRS is not the same with contingency reserves and some other margins for prudence within the assumptions required under the regulatory solvency basis not included for IFRS reporting purposes.
As a result IFRS equity is higher than regulatory capital and therefore more sensitive to interest rate and credit risk.
The estimated sensitivity of the UK non-linked shareholder-backed business principally annuities business to a movement in interest rates is as follows.

Excluding any second order effects on the measurement of the liabilities for future cash flows to the policyholder, a fall in their value would have given rise to the following effects on pre-tax profit, profit after tax and shareholders equity.

The market risk sensitivities shown above reflect the impact of temporary market movements, and, therefore the primary effect of such movements would, in the Groups segmental analysis of profits, be included within the short-term fluctuations in investment returns.
C7.5  a Assetmanagement i Sensitivities to foreign exchange risk Consistent with the Groups accounting policies, the profits of Eastspring Investments and US asset management operations are translated at average exchange rates and shareholders equity at the closing rate for the reporting period.
The rates for the functional currencies of most significant operations are shown in note A1.
A 10 per cent increase in the relevant exchange rates would have reduced reported profit before tax attributable to shareholders and shareholders equity, excluding goodwill attributable to Eastspring Investments and US asset management operations, by 21 million 2012: 10 million and 44 million 2012: 29 million respectively.
ii Sensitivities to other financial risks for asset management operations The principal sensitivities to other financial risk of asset management operations are credit risk on the bridging loan portfolio of the Prudential Capital operation and the indirect effect of changes to market values of funds under management.
Due to the nature of the asset management operations there is limited direct sensitivity to movements in interest rates.
Total debt securities held at 31 December 2013 by asset management operations were 2,045 million 2012: 1,839 million, the majority of which are held by the Prudential Capital operation.
Debt securities held by M&G and Prudential Capital are in general variable rate bonds and so market value is limited in sensitivity to interest rate movements and consequently any change in interest rates would not have a material impact on profit or shareholders equity.
The Groups asset management operations do not hold significant investments in property or equities.
b Otheroperations The Group holds certain derivatives that are used to manage foreign currency movements and macroeconomic exposures.
The fair value of these derivatives is sensitive to the combined effect of movements in exchange rates, interest rates and inflation rates.
The possible permutations cover a wide range of scenarios.
For indicative purposes, a reasonably possible range of fair value movements could be plus or minus 75 million.
Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 249 C8:  C8.1 Deferredtax The statement of financial position contains the following deferred tax assets and liabilities in relation to: Deferredtaxassets  2013 m 2012 m 2013 m 2012 m Unrealised losses or gains on investments 315 100 1,450 1,812 Balances relating to investment and insurance contracts 8 1 451 428 Short-term timing differences 2,050 2,092 1,861 1,715 Capital allowances 10 15 16 9 Unused deferred tax losses 29 98 Total 2,412 2,306 3,778 3,964 The 2012 comparative results have been adjusted from those previously published for the retrospective application of the new and amended accounting standards described in note A2.
The deferred tax asset at 31 December 2013 and 2012 arises in the following parts of the Group: 2013 m 2012 m UK insurance operations: SAIF 1 1 PAC with-profits fund including PAL 82 113 Other 59 69 US insurance operations 2,042 1,889 Asia insurance operations 55 76 Other operations 173 158 Total 2,412 2,306 The 2012 comparative results have been adjusted from those previously published for the retrospective application of the new and amended accounting standards described in note A2.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable, that is to the extent that, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
The taxation regimes applicable across the Group often apply separate rules to trading and capital profits and losses.
The distinction between temporary differences that arise from items of either a trading or capital nature may affect the recognition of deferred tax assets.
Accordingly, for the 2013 results and financial position at 31 December 2013 the possible tax benefit of approximately 127 million 2012: 158 million, which may arise from capital losses valued at approximately 0.6 billion 2012: 0.8 billion, is sufficiently uncertain that it has not been recognised.
In addition, a potential deferred tax asset of 61 million 2012: 122 million, which may arise from trading tax losses and other potential temporary differences totalling 0.4 billion 2012: 0.5 billion is sufficiently uncertain that it has not been recognised.
Of these, losses of 54 million will expire within the next seven years.
Of the remaining losses 0.5 million will expire within 20 years and the rest have no expiry date.
The table that follows provides a breakdown of the recognised deferred tax assets set out in the table above for both the short-term timing differences and unused tax losses split by business unit.
The table also shows the period of estimated recoverability for each respective business unit.
For these and each category of deferred tax asset recognised their recoverability against forecast taxable profits is not significantly impacted by any current proposed changes to future accounting standards.

250 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements C:  C8:  The reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 21 per cent from 1 April 2014 and a further reduction to 20 per cent from 1 April 2015 was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013 which has had the effect of reducing the UK with-profits and shareholder-backed business element of the deferred tax balances as at 31 December 2013 by 51 million.
As the 2013 Finance Act has been enacted at the balance sheet date, the effects of these changes are reflected in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013.
C8.2  Of the 244 million 2012: 248 million current tax recoverable, the majority is expected to be recovered in one year or less.
The current tax liability decreased to 395 million 2012: 443 million reflecting the settlement of prior year balances in the UK and Asia following the agreement with taxation authorities.

The Groups businesses operate a number of pension schemes.
The specific features of these plans vary in accordance with the regulations of the country in which the employees are located, although they are, in general, funded by the Group and based either on a cash balance formula or on years of service and salary earned in the last year or years of employment.
The largest defined benefit scheme is the principal UK scheme, namely the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS.
PSPS accounts for 84 per cent 2012: 86 per cent of the underlying scheme liabilities of the Groups defined benefit schemes.
The Group also operates two smaller UK defined benefit schemes in respect of Scottish Amicable and M&G.
In addition, there are two small defined benefit schemes in Taiwan which have negligible deficits.
 Defined benefit schemes in the UK are generally required to be subject to full actuarial valuations every three years in order to assess the appropriate level of funding for schemes in relation to their commitments.
These valuations include assessments of the likely rate of return on the assets held within the separate trustee administered funds.
The last completed actuarial valuation of PSPS was as at 5 April 2011, finalised in 2012 by CG Singer, Fellow of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, of Towers Watson Limited.
This valuation demonstrated the scheme to be 111 per cent funded by reference to the Scheme Solvency Target that forms the basis of the schemes funding objective.
Based on this valuation, future contributions into the scheme were reduced to the minimum level of contributions required under the scheme rules effective from July 2012.
Excluding expenses, the contributions are now payable at approximately 6 million per annum for ongoing service of active members of the scheme.
No deficit or other funding is required.
Deficit funding for PSPS, where applicable, as applied prior to 2012, is apportioned in the ratio of 70 30 between the PAC with-profits fund and shareholder-backed operations following detailed consideration in 2005 of the sourcing of previous contributions.
Employer contributions for ongoing service of current employees are apportioned in the ratio relevant to current activity.
Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 251 The market value of PSPS scheme assets as at the 5 April 2011 valuation was 5,255 million.
The actuarial assumptions used in determining benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs for the purposes of the 2011 valuation were as follows.
Rate of increase in salaries Nil Rate of inflation: Retail Prices Index RPI 3.7 Consumer Prices Index CPI 3.0 Rate of increase of pensions in payment for inflation: Guaranteed maximum 5% 3.0 Guaranteed maximum 2.5% 2.5 Discretionary Nil Expected returns on plan assets 4.2 Mortalityassumptions: The tables used for PSPS pensions in payment at 5 April 2011 were: Base post retirement mortality For current male female pensioners 113% 108% of the mortality rates of the 2000 series mortality tables PNMA00 PNFA00, published by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau CMI.
For male female non-pensioners 107% 92% of the 2000 series rates PNMA00 PNFA00.
Allowance for future improvements to post retirement mortality For males females 100% 75% of Medium Cohort subject to a minimum rate of improvement of 2.00% 1.25% up to the age of 90, decreasing linearly to zero by age of 120 with a long-term rate of 1.75% pa 1.5% pa but adjusted as follows: Period improvements are blended between ages 60 to 80 to the long-term improvement rate over a 15 year period compared with a 20 year period in the core CMI model : and Cohort improvements are assumed to dissipate over a 30 year period, or by age 90 if earlier compared with a 40 year period, or by age 100 if earlier, in the core CMI model.
The last completed actuarial valuation of the Scottish Amicable Staff Pension Scheme SASPS was as at 31 March 2011, finalised in 2012 by Jonathan Seed, Fellow of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, of Xafinity Consulting.
This valuation demonstrated the scheme to be 85 per cent funded.
Based on this valuation, it was agreed with the Trustees that the existing level of deficit funding of 13.1 million per annum continues to be paid into the scheme until 31 December 2018, to eliminate the actuarial deficit.
The deficit funding will be reviewed every three years at subsequent valuations.
The last completed actuarial valuation of the M&G Group Pension Scheme M&GGPS was as at 31 December 2011, finalised in 2012 by Paul Belok, Fellow of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, of Aon Hewitt Limited.
This valuation demonstrated the scheme to be 83 per cent funded.
Based on this valuation, deficit funding amounts designed to eliminate the actuarial deficit over a three year period are being made from January 2013 of 18.6 million per annum for the first two years and 9.3 million in the third year.
 Under the IAS 19 Employee Benefits valuation basis, the Group applies IFRIC 14, IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
Under IFRIC 14, a surplus is only recognised to the extent that the Company is able to access the surplus either through an unconditional right of refund to the surplus or through reduced future contributions relating to ongoing service, which have been substantively enacted or contractually agreed.
Further, the IFRS financial position recorded, reflects the higher of any underlying IAS 19 deficit and any obligation for committed deficit funding where applicable.
For PSPS, the Group does not have an unconditional right of refund to any surplus of the scheme.
The underlying IAS 19 surplus for PSPS at 31 December 2013 was 726 million 31 December 2012: 1,174 million of which reflecting the arrangements under the scheme rules, only a portion of the surplus, being 124 million 2012: 164 million is recognised as recoverable.
The 124 million 2012: 164 million represents the present value of the economic benefit to the Company from the difference between future ongoing contributions to the scheme and estimated accrued cost of service.
Of this amount, 87 million has been allocated to the PAC with-profits fund and 37 million was allocated to the shareholders fund 2012: 115 million and 49 million, respectively.
The IAS 19 deficit of the SASPS at 31 December 2013 was a deficit of 115 million 2012: deficit of 74 million and has been allocated approximately 50 per cent to the PAC with-profits fund and 50 per cent to the shareholders fund.
The IAS 19 surplus of the M&GGPS on an economic basis at 31 December 2013 was a surplus of 36 million 2012: surplus of 38 million and is wholly attributable to shareholders.
The underlying position on an economic basis reflects the assets including investments in Prudential insurance policies that are offset against liabilities to policyholders on the Group consolidation and the liabilities of the schemes.
As at 31 December 2013, the M&GGPS has invested 114 million in Prudential insurance policies 2012: 169 million.
After excluding these investments that are offset against liabilities to policyholders, the IAS 19 basis position of the M&GGPS is a deficit of 78 million 2012: deficit of 131 million.
252 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements C:  C9:   Responsibility of making good of any deficit that may arise in the schemes lies with the employers of the schemes, which are subsidiaries of the Group.
Accordingly, the pension schemes expose the Group to a number of risks and the most significant of which are detailed below: Interest rate and investment risk this risk arises because the schemes are not invested wholly in assets that most closely match the expected future cash flows.
Therefore, falling equity markets and bond yields may lead to higher deficits in the schemes.
Details of the investment portfolio of the schemes are provided in note 3: Inflation risk the majority of the benefit obligations of all three schemes are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities: and Mortality risk increases in life expectancy of the members would mean that benefits are paid for longer and will result in an increase in the schemes liabilities.
Corporategovernance The Groups UK pension schemes are regulated by The Pension Regulator in accordance with the Pension Act 1995.
Trustees have been appointed for each pension scheme and they have the ultimate responsibility to ensure that the scheme is managed in accordance with the Trust Deed & Rules.
The Trustees are required by the Pension Regulator to be well conversant with the Trust Deed & Rules and to act in accordance with these Rules.
The Rules of the Groups largest pension arrangement, the defined benefit section of PSPS, a final salary scheme, specify that, in exercising its investment powers, the Trustees objective is to achieve the best overall investment return consistent with the security of the assets of the scheme.
In doing this, consideration is given to the nature and duration of the schemes liabilities.
The Trustee sets the benchmark for the asset mix, following analysis of the liabilities by the Schemes Actuary and, having taken advice from the Investment Managers, then selects benchmark indices for each asset type in order to measure investment performance against a benchmark return.
The Trustee reviews strategy, the asset mix benchmark and the Investment Managers objectives every three years, to coincide with the Actuarial Valuation, or earlier if the Scheme Actuary recommends.
Interim reviews are conducted annually based on changing economic circumstances and financial market levels.
The Trustee sets the general investment policy and specifies any restrictions on types of investment and the degrees of divergence permitted from the benchmark, but delegates the responsibility for selection and realisation of specific investments to the Investment Managers.
In carrying out this responsibility, the Investment Managers are required by the Pensions Act 1995 to have regard to the need for diversification and suitability of investments.
Subject to a number of restrictions contained within the relevant asset management agreements, the Investment Managers are authorised to invest in any class of investment asset.
However, the Investment Managers will not invest in any new class of investment asset without prior consultation with the Trustee.
The Trustee consults the Principal Employer, the Prudential Assurance Company, on the investment principles, but the ultimate responsibility for the investment of the assets of the scheme lies with the Trustee.
The investment policies and strategies for the other two UK defined benefit schemes the SASPS and M&GGPS, which are both final salary schemes, follow similar principles, but have different target allocations reflecting the particular requirements of the schemes.
All of the three UK schemes are closed to new entrants.
The majority of the scheme liabilities are linked to inflation.
The assets that would most closely match the liabilities are a combination of index-linked government bonds or investment grade derivatives to match these inflation-linked liabilities and fixed interest gilts to match the fixed liabilities of the schemes.
These matching assets generally are expected to generate lower future returns than asset classes such as equities.
The risk that must be traded off against investing in higher expected returns assets is increased volatility of the schemes return and higher risk of default.
The Trustee of each of the schemes manages the investment strategy of the scheme to achieve an acceptable balance between investing in the assets that most closely match the expected benefit payments and assets that are expected to achieve a greater return in the hope of reducing the contributions required or providing additional benefits to members.
When determining the investment strategy, the Trustee considers the risk that falls in asset values may not be matched by similar falls in the value of the schemes liabilities.
It also consults the Principal Employer, in order to understand the Principal Employers appetite for bearing this risk and considers the Employers ability to make good any shortfall that may arise.
The PSPS scheme has entered into a derivatives based strategy to match the duration and inflation profile of its liabilities.
This involved a reallocation from other investments to other assets with an interest and inflation swap overlay.
In broad terms, the scheme is committed to making a series of payments related to LIBOR on a nominal amount and in return, the scheme receives a series of fixed and inflation-linked payments which match a proportion of its liabilities.
As at 31 December 2013, the nominal value of the interest and inflation-linked swaps amounted to 0.8 billion 2012: 0.9 billion and 2.7 billion 2012: 2.0 billion respectively.
The SASPS and M&GGPS use very limited or no derivatives to hedge their risks.
The risks arising from these schemes are managed through well diversified investments with a portion of the scheme assets invested in inflation-indexed bonds to provide a partial hedge against inflation.
The M&G pension scheme also invests in leveraged gilts as part of its asset liability management.
Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 253 b Assumptions The actuarial assumptions used in determining benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs for the years ended 31 December were as follows: 2013 % 2012 % Discount rate 4.4 4.4 Rate of increase in salaries 3.3 2.7 Rate of inflation : Retail prices index RPI 3.3 2.7 Consumer prices index CPI 2.3 2.0 Rate of increase of pensions in payment for inflation: PSPS: Guaranteed maximum 5% 2.5 2.5 Guaranteed maximum 2.5% 2.5 2.5 Discretionary 2.5 2.5 Other schemes 3.3 2.7 The discount rate has been determined by reference to an AA corporate bond index, adjusted where applicable, to allow for the difference in duration between the index and the pension liabilities.
The rate of inflation reflects the long-term assumption for the UK RPI or CPI depending on the tranche of the schemes.
The calculations are based on current actuarially calculated mortality estimates with a specific allowance made for future improvements in mortality.
The specific allowance made is in line with a custom calibration and has been updated in 2013 to reflect the 2011 mortality model from the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries CMI.
The tables used for PSPS immediate annuities in payment at 31 December 2013 were: Male: 112.0 per cent PNMA00 with improvements in line with a custom calibration of the CMIs 2011 mortality model, with a long-term mortality improvement rate of 1.75 per cent per annum: and Female: 108.5 per cent PNFA00 with improvements in line with a custom calibration of the CMIs 2011 mortality model, with a long-term mortality improvement rate of 1.25 per cent per annum.
The tables used for PSPS immediate annuities in payment at 31 December 2012 were: Male: 108.6 per cent PNMA00 with improvements in line with a custom calibration of the CMIs 2009 mortality model, with a long-term mortality improvement rate of 1.75 per cent per annum: and Female: 103.4 per cent PNFA00 with improvements in line with a custom calibration of the CMIs 2009 mortality model, with a long-term mortality improvement rate of 1.00 per cent per annum.
The assumed life expectancies on retirement at age 60, based on the mortality table used was: 2013 years 2012 years Male Female Male Female Retiring today 27.9 29.5 28.0 29.1 Retiring in 20 years time 31.5 32.8 30.6 31.2 The mean term of the current PSPS liabilities is around 17 years.
Using external actuarial advice provided by the scheme actuaries being Towers Watson for the valuation of PSPS, Xafinity Consulting for SASPS and Aon Hewitt Limited for the M&GGPS, the most recent full valuations have been updated to 31 December 2013, applying the principles prescribed by IAS 19. c  This section illustrates the financial position of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes on an economic basis and the IAS 19 basis.
The underlying pension position on an economic basis reflects the assets including investments in Prudential policies that are offset against liabilities to policyholders on the Group consolidation and the liabilities of the schemes.
The IAS 19 basis excludes the investments in Prudential policies.
At 31 December 2013, the investments in Prudential insurance policies comprise 143 million 2012: 123 million for PSPS and 114 million 2012: 169 million for the M&GGPS.
In principle, on consolidation, the investments are eliminated against policyholder liabilities of UK insurance operations so that the formal IAS 19 position for the schemes in isolation excludes these items.
This treatment applies to the M&GGPS investments.
However, as a substantial portion of the Companys interest in the underlying surplus of PSPS is not recognised, the adjustment is not necessary for the PSPS investments.

None of the scheme assets included shares in Prudential plc or property occupied by the Prudential Group.
ii Maturity profile of the benefit obligations The weighted average duration of the benefit obligations of the schemes is 18.2 years 2012: 18.1 years The following table provides an expected maturity analysis of the benefit obligations as at 31 December 2013: 2013 m After1year After5years After10years After15years 1yearorless to5years to10years to15years to20years Over20years Total All schemes 223 972 1,459 1,672 1,747 10,198 16,271 The expected maturity analysis of the benefit obligations as at 31 December 2012 is similar to those of 2013 above.
iii The adjustments for investments in Prudential insurance policies are consolidation adjustments for intragroup assets and liabilities with no impact to operating results.
iv Total employer contributions expected to be paid into the Group defined benefit schemes for the year ending 31 December 2014 amounts to 56 million 2013: 56 million.

Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 257 d  The total underlying Group pension scheme liabilities of 6,298 million 2012: 6,059 million comprise 5,316 million 2012: 5,226 million for PSPS and 982 million 2012: 833 million for the other schemes.
The table below shows the sensitivity of the underlying PSPS and the other scheme liabilities at 31 December 2013 and 2012 to changes in discount rate, inflation rates and mortality rates.
The sensitivity information below is based on the core scheme liabilities and assumptions at the balance sheet date.
The sensitivity is calculated based on a change in one assumption, with all other assumptions being held constant.
As such, interdependencies between the assumptions are excluded.
The sensitivity of the underlying pension scheme liabilities to changes in discount, inflation and mortality rates as shown above does not directly equate to the impact on the profit or loss attributable to shareholders or shareholders equity, due to the effect of the application of IFRIC 14 on PSPS and the allocation of a share of the interest in financial position of the PSPS and Scottish Amicable schemes to the PAC with-profits fund as described above.
The sensitivity to the changes in the key variables as shown in the table above has no significant impact on the pension costs included in the Groups operating results.
This is due to the pension costs charged in each of the periods presented, being derived largely from market conditions at the beginning of the period.
After applying IFRIC 14 and to the extent attributable to shareholders, any residual impact from the changes to these variables is reflected as actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit pension schemes within the supplementary analysis of profits.

Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 261 d Basisofpreparation,  Each of the Groups long-term business operations is capitalised to a sufficiently strong level for its individual circumstances.
Details by the Groups major operations are shown below.
i Asia insurance operations The available capital shown above of 1,802 million 2012: 1,621 million represents the excess of local regulatory basis assets over liabilities before deduction of required capital of 699 million 2012: 661 million.
The businesses in Asia are subject to local capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate.
The Hong Kong business branch of PAC and its capital requirements are subsumed within those of the PAC long-term fund.
The Hong Kong business branch of PAC was transferred to separate subsidiaries established in Hong Kong on 1 January 2014 see note D2.
For the other material Asian operations, the details of the basis of determining regulatory capital and regulatory capital requirements are as follows: Indonesia Solvency capital is determined using a risk-based capital approach.
Insurance companies in Indonesia are expected to maintain the level of net assets above 120 per cent of solvency capital.
In 2013, the local regulatory basis in Indonesia was replaced with the Indonesian authoritys risk-based capital framework.
In accordance with the framework, policy reserves for traditional business are determined on a gross premium reserve basis using prudent best estimate assumptions.
For linked business, the value of the units are maintained with a non-unit reserve which is calculated in accordance with standard actuarial methodology.
Korea Policy reserves for traditional business are determined on net premium reserve basis using standard mortality and prescribed standard interest rates.
For linked business, the value of the units are held together with the non-unit reserves and calculated in accordance with the local regulators standard actuarial methodology.
A risk-based capital framework is applied in Korea.
For local solvency, the regulatory minimum is 100 per cent of the risk-based capital.
Further, in accordance with the local risk-based capital framework, insurers are expected to maintain a level of free surplus in excess of the capital requirements.
The general target level for the solvency margin is greater than 150 per cent of the risk-based capital as required by the regulators.
Malaysia A risk-based capital framework applies in Malaysia.
For participating business, a gross premium reserve on the guaranteed and non-guaranteed benefits determined using best estimate assumptions is held.
The amount held is subject to a minimum of a gross premium reserve on the guaranteed benefits, determined using best estimate assumptions along with provisions of risk margin for adverse deviations discounted at the risk-free rate.
For non-participating business, gross premium reserves determined using best estimate assumptions along with provisions of risk margin for adverse deviations discounted at the risk-free rate are held.
For linked business the value of units is held together with a non-unit reserve calculated in accordance with standard actuarial methodology.
Participating fund surplus is not allowed to be used to support a deficit if any and the capital requirement of the non-participating business.
The capital requirement is calculated based on a prescribed series of risk charges.
The local regulator has set a Supervisory Target Capital Level of 130 per cent below which supervisory actions of increasing intensity will be taken.
Each insurer is also required to set its own Individual Target Capital Level to reflect its own risk profile and this is expected to be higher than the Supervisory Target Capital Level.
Singapore A risk-based regulatory framework applies in Singapore.
For participating business, a gross premium reserve, determined using prudent best estimate assumptions and which makes allowance for future bonus, is held.
The amount held is subject to a minimum of the higher of the assets attributed to participating business and a gross premium reserve calculated on specified assumptions, but without allowance for future bonus, that include prescribed provisions for adverse deviations PADs.
For non-participating business, gross premium reserves are held.
262 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements C:  C11:  Thailand A new risk-based capital framework was adopted from 1 January 2012 to replace the previous framework that used a net premium approach.
For non-participating business, the gross premium reserves are determined using best estimate assumptions along with provisions of risk margin for adverse deviations discounted at the risk-free rate.
The risk free rate is derived from the greater of the current yield curve of Thai government bonds or a weighted-average yield curve of the prior seven quarters Thai government bonds, as prescribed by the local regulator.
Vietnam For traditional business, mathematical reserves are calculated using a modified net premium approach, set using assumptions agreed with the regulator.
For linked business, the value of units is held together with the non-unit reserves calculated in accordance with the local regulators standard actuarial methodology.
The capital requirement is determined as 4 per cent of reserves plus a specified percentage of 0.1 per cent of sums at risk for policies with original term less than or equal to five years or 0.3 per cent of sums at risk for policies with original term of more than five years.
An additional capital requirement of Vietnamese Dong 200 billion is also required for companies transacting unit-linked business.
ii US insurance operations The regulatory framework for Jackson is governed by the requirements of the US NAIC approved risk-based capital standards.
Under these requirements life insurance companies report using a formula-based capital standard that they calculate by applying factors to various asset, premium and reserve items and separate model based calculations of risk associated primarily with variable annuity products.
The risk-based capital formula takes into account the risk characteristics of a company, including asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk, market risk and business risk.
The available capital of Jackson shown above of 2,903 million 2012: 2,899 million reflects US regulatory basis assets less liabilities as adjusted for asset valuation reserves.
The asset valuation reserve, which is reflected as available capital, is designed to provide for future credit-related losses on debt securities and losses on equity investments.
Available capital includes a reduction for the effect of the interest maintenance reserve, which is designed by state regulators to defer recognition of non-credit related realised capital gains and losses and to recognise them ratably in the future.
Jacksons risk-based capital ratio is significantly in excess of regulatory requirements.
At 31 December 2013, Jackson had a permitted practice in effect as granted by the local regulator allowing Jackson to carry certain interest rate swaps at book value, as if statutory hedge accounting were in place, instead of at fair value as would have been otherwise required.
Jackson was also required to demonstrate the effectiveness of its interest rate swap programme pursuant to the Michigan Insurance Code.
The total effect of this permitted practice net of tax was to increase statutory surplus by 0.8 million at 31 December 2013.
Michigan insurance law specifically allows value of business acquired as an admitted asset as long as certain criteria are met.
US NAIC standards limit the admitted amount of goodwill value of business acquired generally to 10 per cent of capital and surplus.
At 31 December 2013, Jackson reported 257 million of statutory basis value of business acquired as a result of the REALIC acquisition, which is fully admissible under Michigan insurance law.
iii UK insurance operations In the UK, the insurers, regulated by PRA, must hold capital resources equal at least to the Minimum Capital Requirement MCR.
In addition the rules require insurers to perform Individual Capital Assessments.
Under these rules insurers must assess for themselves the amount of capital needed to back their business.
If the PRA views the results of this assessment as insufficient, it may draw up its own Individual Capital Guidance for a firm, which can be superimposed as a requirement.
PAC with-profits sub-fund and Scottish Amicable Insurance Fund Under PRA rules, insurers with with-profits liabilities of more than 500 million must hold capital equal to the higher of the MCR and the Enhanced Capital Requirement ECR.
The ECR is intended to provide a more risk responsive and realistic measure of a with-profit insurers capital requirements, whereas the MCR is broadly speaking equivalent to the previous required minimum margin under the Interim Prudential Sourcebook and satisfies the minimum EU Standards.
Determination of the ECR involves the comparison of two separate measurements of the firms resources requirement, which the PRA refers to as the twin peaks approach.
The two separate peaks are: i The requirement comprised by the mathematical reserves plus the Long-Term Insurance Capital Requirement LTICR, together known as the regulatory peak: and ii A calculation of the realistic present value of the insurers expected future contractual liabilities together with projected fair discretionary bonuses to policyholders, plus a risk capital margin, together known as the realistic peak.
Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 263 Available capital of the with-profits sub-fund and Scottish Amicable Insurance Fund of 8.0 billion 2012: 7.0 billion represents the excess of assets over liabilities on the PRA realistic basis.
Unlike the previously discussed FRS 27 basis, realistic liabilities on the regulatory basis include the shareholders share of future bonuses.
These amounts are shown before deduction of the risk capital margin which is estimated to be 0.9 billion at 31 December 2013 2012: 1.5 billion.
The PRAs basis of setting the risk capital margin is to target a level broadly equivalent to a Standard & Poors credit rating of BBB and to judge this by ensuring there are sufficient assets to absorb a one in 200 year event.
The risk capital margin calculation achieves this by setting rules for the determination of margins to cover defined stress changes in asset values and yields for market risk, credit risk and termination risk for with-profits policies.
PAC has discretion in its management actions in the case of adverse investment conditions.
Management actions encompass, but are not confined to, investment allocation decisions, levels of reversionary bonuses, crediting rates and total claim values.
Other UK life assurance subsidiaries and funds The available capital of 2,708 million 2012: 2,370 million reflects the excess of regulatory basis assets over liabilities of the subsidiaries and funds, before deduction of the capital resources requirement of 1,364 million 2012: 1,376 million.
The capital resources requirement for these companies broadly reflects a formula which, for active funds, equates to a percentage of regulatory reserves plus a percentage of death strains.
Death strains represent the payments made to policyholders upon death in excess of amounts explicitly allocated to fund the provisions for policyholders claims and maturities.
iv Group capital requirements In addition to the requirements at individual company level, PRA requirements under the IGD apply additional prudential requirements for the Group as a whole.
Discussion of the Groups estimated IGD position at 31 December 2013, together with market risk sensitivity disclosure provided to key management, is provided in the Strategic Report section of the Groups 2013 Annual Report.
e  For PAC and all other UK long-term insurers, long-term business assets and liabilities must, by law, be maintained in funds separate from those for the assets and liabilities attributable to non-life insurance business or to shareholders.
Only the established surplus, the excess of assets over liabilities in the long-term fund determined through a formal valuation, may be transferred so as to be available for other purposes.
Distributions from the with-profits sub-fund to shareholders reflect the shareholders one-ninth share of the cost of declared policyholders bonuses.
Accordingly, the excess of assets over liabilities of the PAC long-term fund is retained within that company.
The retention of the capital enables it to support with-profits and other business of the fund by, for example, providing the benefits associated with smoothing and guarantees.
It also provides investment flexibility for the funds assets by meeting the regulatory capital requirements that demonstrate solvency and by absorbing the costs of significant events or fundamental changes in its long-term business without affecting the bonus and investment policies.
For other UK long-term business subsidiaries, the amounts retained within the companies are at levels which provide an appropriate level of capital strength in excess of the regulatory minimum.
For Jackson, capital retention is maintained at a level consistent with an appropriate rating by Standard & Poors.
Currently Jackson is rated AA.
Jackson can pay dividends on its capital stock only out of earned surplus unless prior regulatory approval is obtained.
Furthermore, dividends which exceed the greater of statutory net gain from operations for the prior year or 10 per cent of Jacksons prior year-end statutory surplus require prior regulatory approval.
For Asian subsidiaries, the amounts retained within the companies are at levels that provide an appropriate level of capital strength in excess of the local regulatory minimum.
For ring-fenced with-profits funds, the excess of assets over liabilities is retained with distribution tied to the shareholders share of bonuses through declaration of actuarially determined surplus.
The Singapore and Malaysian businesses may, in general, remit dividends to the UK, provided the statutory insurance fund meets the capital adequacy standard required under local statutory regulations.
Available capital of the non-insurance business units is transferable to the life assurance businesses after taking account of an appropriate level of operating capital, based on local regulatory solvency targets, over and above basis liabilities.
264 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements C:  C11:  f  Prudential manages its assets, liabilities and capital locally, in accordance with local regulatory requirements and reflecting the different types of liabilities Prudential has in each business.
As a result of the diversity of products offered by Prudential and the different regulatory requirements in which it operates, Prudential employs differing methods of asset liability and capital management, depending on the business concerned.
Stochastic modelling of assets and liabilities is undertaken in the UK, Jackson and Asia to assess the economic capital requirements.
A stochastic approach models the inter-relationship between asset and liability movements, taking into account asset correlation, management actions and policyholder behaviour under a large number of alternative economic scenarios.
In addition, reserve adequacy testing under a range of scenarios and dynamic solvency testing is carried out, including under certain scenarios mandated by the UK, US and Asian regulators.
The sensitivity of liabilities and other components of total capital vary depending upon the type of business concerned and this conditions the approach to asset liability management.
For example, for businesses that are most sensitive to interest rate changes, such as immediate annuity business, Prudential uses cash flow analysis to create a portfolio of debt securities whose value changes in line with the value of liabilities when interest rates change.
This type of analysis helps protect profits from changing interest rates.
This type of analysis is used in the UK for annuity business and by Jackson for its interest-sensitive and fixed index annuities and institutional products.
For businesses that are most sensitive to equity price changes, Prudential uses stochastic modelling and scenario testing to look at the future returns on its investments under different scenarios which best reflect the large diversity in returns that equities can produce.
This allows Prudential to devise an investment and with-profits policyholder bonus strategy that, based on the model assumptions, allows it to optimise returns to its policyholders and shareholders over time while maintaining appropriate financial strength.
Prudential uses this methodology extensively in connection with its UK with-profits business.
g  Should the assets of the Scottish Amicable Insurance Fund be inadequate to meet the guaranteed benefit obligations of the policyholders of the Scottish Amicable Insurance Fund, the PAC long-term fund would be liable to cover any such deficiency in the first instance.

Notes i Total legal provisions at 31 December 2013 of 14 million related to Jackson.
Jackson has been named in civil proceedings, which appear to be substantially similar to other class action litigation brought against many life insurers in the US, alleging misconduct in the sale of insurance products.
Of the 14 million legal provision as at 31 December 2013, 11 million has been established to cover this potential litigation and is expected to be utilised over the next five years.
ii Restructuring provisions primarily relate to restructuring activities of UK insurance operations.
The provisions pertain to property liabilities resulting from the closure of regional sales centres and branches and staff terminations and other transformation costs to enable streamlining of operations.
iii Other provisions comprise staff benefits provisions of 332 million, provisions for onerous contracts of 41 million and regulatory and other provisions of 41 million.
Staff benefits are generally expected to be paid out within the next three years.
The provision balance is expected to be paid out within the next five years.

268 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements D: Othernotes D1:  a  ThanachartBank On 3 May 2013, the agreement Prudential plc, through its subsidiary Prudential Life Assurance Thailand Public Company Limited Prudential Thailand, entered into in November 2012 to establish an exclusive 15-year partnership with Thanachart Bank Public Company Limited Thanachart Bank to develop jointly their bancassurance business in Thailand was launched.
At the same time, Prudential Thailand completed the acquisition of 100 per cent of the voting interest in Thanachart Life Assurance Company Limited Thanachart Life, a wholly-owned life insurance subsidiary of Thanachart Bank.
This transaction builds on Prudentials strategy of focusing on the highly attractive markets of South-east Asia and is in line with the Groups multichannel distribution strategy.
The consideration for the transaction is THB 18.981 billion 412 million, of which THB 17.500 billion 380 million was settled in cash on completion in May 2013 with a further payment of THB 0.946 billion 20 million, for adjustments to reflect the net asset value as at completion date, paid in July 2013.
In addition a deferred payment of THB 0.535 billion 12 million is payable 12 months after completion.
Included in the total consideration of THB 18.981 billion 412 million was the cost of the distribution rights associated with the exclusive 15-year bancassurance partnership agreement with Thanachart Bank.
The purchase consideration paid was equivalent to the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed.
No goodwill has been recognised.
In addition to the purchase consideration, the Group incurred 4 million of acquisition related costs, of which 3 million was recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement in the second half of 2012 and the remaining 1 million recognised in 2013.
 The fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities are shown in the table below: Fairvalue recognisedat acquisition date m Assets Acquired value of in-force business 21 Investments principally debt securities 642 Cash and cash equivalents 4 Other assets including distribution rights 293 Totalassets 960 Liabilities Insurance contract liabilities 487 Other non-insurance liabilities 61 Totalliabilities 548  412   412 Insurance contract liabilities were valued consistent with Prudentials existing IFRS valuation basis for the Thailand Life business, determined in accordance with methods prescribed by local GAAP adjusted to comply, where necessary, with UK GAAP.
In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, an acquired value of in-force business has been recognised.
Included within the identifiable assets as shown above are loans and other debtors acquired with fair values of 6 million.
These values represent the gross contractual amounts all of which are expected to be collected.
The consolidated statement of cashflows contains a 396 million net cash outflow in respect of the acquisition of Thanachart Life and the cost of the distribution rights representing cash consideration paid of 400 million less cash and cash equivalents acquired of 4 million.

In determining these amounts, it has been assumed that the fair value adjustments which arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same as if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2013.
These amounts have been determined using actual results for the four month period to 2 May 2013 and the post-acquisition results from 3 May to 31 December 2013. ii The amortisation of acquisition accounting adjustments represents the amortisation of the acquired value of in-force business.
b  On 4 September 2012, the Group through its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Jackson completed the acquisition of 100 per cent issued share capital of SRLC America Holding Corp. and its primary operating subsidiary, Reassure America Life Insurance Company REALIC.
REALIC is a US-based insurance company whose business model was to acquire, through purchase or reinsurance, closed blocks of insurance business, primarily life assurance risks.
REALIC did not and does not write new business.
At 31 December 2012, the purchase consideration was subject to final agreement under the terms of the transaction with Swiss Re.
No goodwill was recognised under IFRS on the date of the completion of the acquisition as the purchase consideration paid was equivalent to the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed.
In the course of 2013, following the conclusion of an independent arbitration process over outstanding matters, the purchase consideration for REALIC was revised to 381 million in line with the re-measured value of the individual acquired assets and liabilities.
This compares to the provisional estimates of 370 million for consideration and net assets reported in the 2012 consolidated IFRS financial statements.
The consolidated statement of cash flows in 2012 contained a 224 million net cash outflow in respect of this acquisition representing cash consideration of 371 million less cash and cash equivalents acquired of 147 million.
In 2013 an additional cash outflow of 9 million was recorded reflecting the revised consideration.
c  On 16 July 2013, the Group reached an agreement to sell the Groups closed book life insurance business in Japan, PCA Life Insurance Company Limited to SBI Holdings Inc. for US$85 million 51 million at 31 December 2013 closing exchange rate.
Completion of the transaction is dependent on regulatory approval.
The Japan life business has been classified as held for sale in these consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS 5, Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations.
Consistent with its classification as held for sale, the IFRS carrying value of the Japan life business has been set to 48 million at 31 December 2013, representing the proceeds, net of related expenses.
This has resulted in a charge as for Remeasurement of Japan life business classified as held for sale of 120 million in the income statement.
In order to facilitate comparisons of the Groups retained businesses, the supplementary analysis of profit of the Group as shown in note B1.1 has been adjusted to show separately the results for the Japan life business.
Accordingly, the comparative results for 2012 have been retrospectively adjusted.
For 2013 the result for the year, including short-term fluctuations in investment returns, together with the adjustment to the carrying value have given rise to an aggregate loss of 102 million 2012: 17 million profit.
This comprises: 2013 m 2012 m Remeasurement of carrying value on classification as held for sale 120 Amounts that would otherwise be classified within: Operating profit based on longer-term investment returns 3 2 Short-term fluctuations in investment returns 15 19 Loss profit attaching to held for sale Japan life business 102 17 Related tax charge 270 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements D: Othernotescontinued D1:  The assets and liabilities of the Japan life business classified as held for sale on the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2013 are as follows: 2013 m Assets Investments 956 Other assets 80 1,036 Adjustment for remeasurement of the carrying value to fair value less costs to sell 120 Assetsheldforsale 916 Liabilities Policyholder liabilities 814 Other liabilities 54  868 Netassets 48 d  In December 2013, the PAC with-profits fund, via its venture fund holdings and as part of its investment portfolio, acquired a 100 per cent interest of Falbygdens Energi AB, a Swedish utility company.
The main business operations comprise the production and distribution of district heating and the distribution of electricity primarily within the municipality of Falkping.
The company also operates a broadband business in the municipality.
The consideration paid of 71 million was equivalent to the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities assumed.
As these transactions are within the with-profits fund, they have no impact on shareholders profit or equity for the year ended 31 December 2013.
The impact on the Groups consolidated revenue, including investment returns, is not material.
Had the acquisitions been effected at 1 January 2013, the revenue and profit of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2013 would not have been materially different.
D2:  On 1 January 2014, following consultation with policyholders of PAC and regulators and court approval, the Hong Kong branch of PAC was transferred to separate subsidiaries established in Hong Kong.
On an IFRS basis, approximately 12.6 billion of assets, 12.3 billion of liabilities including policyholder liabilities of 10.2 billion and 1.7 billion of unallocated surplus and 0.3 billion of shareholders funds for the excess assets of the transferred non-participating business have been transferred.
The costs of enabling the domestication in 2013 were 35 million.
Within the Groups supplementary analysis of profit, these costs have been presented as a separate category of items excluded from operating profit based on longer-term investment returns as shown in note B1.1.
D3:  In addition to the legal proceedings relating to Jackson mentioned under the legal provisions section in note C12, the Group is involved in other litigation and regulatory issues.
Whilst the outcome of such litigation and regulatory issues cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that their ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
 The pensions review by the UK insurance regulator of past sales of personal pension policies required all UK life insurance companies to review their cases of potential mis-selling and record a provision for the estimated costs.
The Group met the requirement of the UK insurance regulator to issue offers to all cases by 30 June 2002.
At 31 December 2013 the pension mis-selling provision was 286 million 31 December 2012: 306 million.
The pension mis-selling provision is included within the liabilities in respect of investment contracts with discretionary participation features under IFRS 4 and is stochastically determined on a discounted basis.
The average discount rate implied in the movement in the year is 3.4 per cent 2012: 2.3 per cent.
The directors believe that, based on current information, the provision, together with future investment return on the assets backing the provision, will be adequate to cover the costs of pension mis-selling including administration costs.
Such provision represents the best estimate of probable costs and expenses.
However, there can be no assurance that the current provision level will not need to be increased.
The costs associated with the pension mis-selling review have been met from the inherited estate see below and, accordingly have not been charged to the asset shares used in the determination of policyholder bonus rates.
Hence policyholders pay-out values have been unaffected by pension mis-selling.
Financial statements D: Other notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 271 In 1998, Prudential stated that deducting mis-selling costs from the inherited estate would not impact its bonus or investment policy and it gave an assurance that if this unlikely event were to occur, it would make available support to the fund from shareholder resources for as long as the situation continued, so as to ensure that policyholders were not disadvantaged.
This review was completed on 30 June 2002 with the assurance continuing to apply to any policy in force at 31 December 2003, both for premiums paid before 1 January 2004, and for subsequent regular premiums including future fixed, retail price index or salary related increases and Department of Work and Pensions rebate business.
The assurance has not applied to new business since 1 January 2004.
Guaranteedannuities PAC used to sell guaranteed annuity products in the UK and at 31 December 2013 held a provision of 36 million 2012: 47 million within the main with-profits fund within policyholder liabilities to honour guarantees on these products.
The Groups main exposure to guaranteed annuities in the UK is through SAIF and at 31 December 2013 a provision of 328 million 2012: 371 million was held in SAIF to honour the guarantees.
As SAIF is a separate sub-fund of the PAC long-term business fund, attributable to the policyholders, the movement in this provision has no impact on shareholders.
Othermatters  The assets of the with-profits sub-fund WPSF within the long-term insurance fund of PAC comprise the amounts that it expects to pay out to meet its obligations to existing policyholders and an additional amount used as working capital.
The amount payable over time to policyholders from the WPSF is equal to the policyholders accumulated asset shares plus any additional payments that may be required by way of smoothing or to meet guarantees.
The balance of the assets of the WPSF is called the inherited estate and has accumulated over many years from various sources.
This estate enables PAC to support with-profits business by providing the benefits associated with smoothing and guarantees, by providing investment flexibility for the funds assets, by meeting the regulatory capital requirements that demonstrate solvency and by absorbing the costs of certain significant events or fundamental changes in its long-term business without affecting the bonus and investment policies.
The size of the inherited estate fluctuates from year to year depending on the investment return and the extent of its utilisation.
 As a proprietary insurance company, PAC is liable to meet its obligations to policyholders even if the assets of the long-term funds are insufficient to do so.
The assets, represented by the unallocated surplus of with-profits funds, in excess of amounts expected to be paid for future terminal bonuses and related shareholder transfers the excess assets in the long-term funds could be materially depleted over time by, for example, a significant or sustained equity market downturn, costs of significant fundamental strategic change or a material increase in the pension mis-selling provision.
In the unlikely circumstance that the depletion of the excess assets within the long-term fund was such that the Groups ability to satisfy policyholders reasonable expectations was adversely affected, it might become necessary to restrict the annual distribution to shareholders or to contribute shareholders funds to the long-term funds to provide financial support.
In 1997, the business of Scottish Amicable Life Assurance Society SALAS, a mutual society, was transferred to PAC with the creation of, a separate sub-fund, Scottish Amicable Insurance Fund SAIF within PACs long-term business fund containing all the with-profits business and all other pension business that was transferred.
No new business has been or will be written in the sub-fund and it is managed to ensure that all the invested assets are distributed to SAIF policyholders over the lifetime of SAIF policies.
With the exception of certain amounts in respect of the unitised with-profits life business, all future earnings arising in SAIF are retained for SAIF policyholders.
Any excess deficiency of revenue over expense within SAIF during a period is attributable to the policyholders of the fund.
Shareholders have no interest in the profits of SAIF but are entitled to the asset management fees paid on this business.
SAIF with-profits policies contain minimum levels of guaranteed benefit to policyholders.
In addition, as mentioned earlier in this note, certain pensions products have guaranteed annuity rates at retirement.
Should the assets of SAIF be inadequate to meet the guaranteed benefit obligations of the policyholders of SAIF, the PAC long-term fund would be liable to cover any such deficiency in the first instance.
 Jackson has received regulatory enquiries on a developing industry-wide matter regarding claims settlement practices and compliance with unclaimed property laws.
Concurrently, some regulators and state legislatures have required and others are considering proposals that would require life insurance companies to take additional steps to identify unreported deceased policy and contract holders.
Additionally, numerous states are contracting with independent firms to perform specific unclaimed property audits or targeted market conduct examinations covering claims settlement practices and procedures for escheating unclaimed property.
One such firm has contracted with the treasury departments of 27 states to perform an examination of Jacksons practices for handling unclaimed property.
Any regulatory audits, related examination activity and internal reviews may result in additional payments to beneficiaries, escheatment of funds ie, reversion of funds to the state deemed abandoned under state laws, administrative penalties and changes in Jacksons procedures for the identification of unreported claims and handling of escheatable property.
At 31 December 2013, Jackson has accrued 12 million to cover any such liability.
 Guarantee funds in both the UK and the US provide for payments to be made to policyholders on behalf of insolvent life insurance companies and are financed by payments assessed on solvent insurance companies based on location, volume and types of business.
The Group estimated its reserve for future guarantee fund assessments for Jackson, included within other liabilities to be 13 million at 31 December 2013 2012: 31 million.
Similar assessments for the UK businesses were not significant.
The directors believe that the reserve is adequate for all anticipated payments for known insolvencies.
272 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to Primary statements D: Othernotescontinued D3:  At 31 December 2013, Jackson has unfunded commitments of 298 million 2012: 325 million related to its investments in limited partnerships and of 132 million 2012: 86 million related to commercial mortgage loans.
These commitments were entered into in the normal course of business and the directors do not expect a material adverse impact on the operations to arise from them.
The Group has provided other guarantees and commitments to third parties entered into in the normal course of business but the Company does not consider that the amounts involved are significant.
 Prudential and PAC have put in place intra-group arrangements to formalise circumstances in which capital support would be made available by Prudential including in the scenarios referred to in pension mis-selling review above.
While Prudential considers it unlikely that such support will be required, the arrangements are intended to provide additional comfort to PAC and its policyholders.
In addition, Prudential has put in place intra-group arrangements to formalise undertakings by Prudential to the regulators of the Hong Kong subsidiaries, which from 1 January 2014, contain the domesticated branch business from PAC as noted in note D2 regarding their solvency levels.
In addition, the scheme of transfer of the Hong Kong branch includes short-term support arrangements between Prudential and PAC to underpin similar arrangements between PAC and the newly domesticated business.
It is considered unlikely that support will need to be provided under these arrangements.

Details of all Prudential subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates will be annexed to the next Annual Returns of Prudential plc filed with the UK Registrar of Companies.
b  Certain Group subsidiaries and joint ventures are subject to restrictions on the amount of funds they may transfer in the form of cash dividends or otherwise to the parent company.
Under UK company law, dividends can only be paid if a UK company has distributable reserves sufficient to cover dividend.
Further, UK insurance companies are required to maintain solvency margins in accordance with the Prudential Regulation Authority rules.
The Group UK asset management company, M&G is also required to consider its capital requirements before making any distribution to the parent company.
Jackson is subject to state laws that limit the dividends payable to its parent company based on statutory capital and surplus and prior year earnings.
Dividends in excess of these limitations require prior regulatory approval.
The Groups subsidiaries and joint ventures in Asia may remit dividends to the Group, in general, provided the statutory insurance fund meets the capital adequacy standard required under local statutory regulations and has sufficient distributable reserves.
The Group capital position statement for life assurance businesses is set out in note C11.1, showing the available capital reflecting the excess of regulatory basis over liabilities for each fund or group of companies determined by reference to the local regulation of the subsidiaries.
In addition, disclosure is also provided in note C11.1 of the local capital requirement of each of the funds, or group of companies.
Financial statements D: Other notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 279 D7:  Joint ventures represent arrangements where the parties who control the arrangement through contractual or other agreement have the rights to the net assets of the arrangements.
The Group has shareholder-backed joint venture insurance and asset management business in China with CITIC Group, and in India with ICICI Bank.
In addition, there is an asset management joint venture in Hong Kong with BOCI and a Takaful general and life insurance joint venture in Malaysia.
The Group has various joint ventures relating to property investments held by the PAC with-profits fund.
The results of these joint ventures are reflected in the movement in the unallocated surplus of the PAC with-profits funds and therefore do not affect shareholders results.
As a consequence of adoption of IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements from 1 January 2013, the Groups joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
For these operations the net of tax results are reflected in the Groups profit before tax.
The investments in these joint ventures have the same accounting year end as the Group, except for joint ventures in India.
Although these entities have reporting periods ending 31 March, 12 months of financial information up to 31 December is recorded.
Accordingly, the information covers the same period as that of the Group.
The Group has two associates: PruHealth and PPM South Africa that are also accounted for under the equity method.
In addition, the Group has investments in Open-Ended Investment Companies OEICs, unit trusts, funds holding collateralised debt obligations, property unit trusts and venture capital investments of the PAC with-profits funds where the Group has significant influence.
As allowed under IAS 28, these investments are accounted for as investments in associates and are carried at fair value through profit and loss.
The aggregate fair value of associates carried at fair value through profit and loss where there are published price quotations is approximately 0.5 billion at 31 December 2013 2012: 0.8 billion.
The Groups share of the profits, net of related tax, and carrying amount of interest in joint ventures and associates, which are equity accounted as shown in the consolidated income statement comprises the following: Jointventures Associates 2013 m 2012 m 2013 m 2012 m Shareholder-backed business 52 98 7 10 PAC with-profits fund prior to offsetting effect in movement in unallocated surplus 88 27 Total 140 125 7 10 There is no other comprehensive income in the joint ventures and associates.
There have been no unrecognised share of losses of a joint venture or associate that the Group has stopped recognising in the total income.
The joint ventures have no significant contingent liabilities or capital commitments to which the Group is exposed nor does the Group have any significant contingent liabilities or capital commitments in relation to its interest in the joint ventures.
D8:  Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries are eliminated on consolidation.
In addition, the Company has transactions and outstanding balances with certain unit trusts, Open-Ended Investment Companies OEICs, collateralised debt obligations and similar entities which are not consolidated and where a Group company acts as manager which are regarded as related parties for the purposes of IAS 24.
The balances are included in the Groups statement of financial position sheet at fair value or amortised cost in accordance with their IAS 39 classifications.
The transactions are included in the income statement and include amounts paid on issue of shares or units, amounts received on cancellation of shares or units and paid in respect of the periodic charge and administration fee.
Further, following the adoption of IFRS 11 in 2013 as described in note A2, the Groups investments in joint ventures are now accounted for on an equity method basis.
Previously, the assets and liabilities of these joint ventures were proportionally consolidated by the Group with any of their intra-group transactions eliminated on consolidation.
There are no material transactions between these joint ventures and other Group companies.
Executive officers and directors of the Company may from time to time purchase insurance, asset management or annuity products marketed by Group companies in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons.
In 2013 and 2012, other transactions with directors were not deemed to be significant both by virtue of their size and in the context of the directors financial positions.
All of these transactions are on terms broadly equivalent to those that prevail in arms length transactions.
Apart from these transactions with directors, no director had interests in shares, transactions or arrangements that require disclosure, other than those given in the directors remuneration report.
Key management remuneration is disclosed in note B3.3.

Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

Paul Manduca Tidjane Thiam Nic Nicandrou Chairman Group Chief Executive Chief Financial Officer 282 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes on the parent company financial statements Notes on the parent company financial statements 1 Nature of operations Prudential plc the Company is a parent holding company.
The Company together with its subsidiaries collectively, the Group is an international financial services group with its principal operations in Asia, the US and the UK.
In the US, the Groups principal subsidiary is Jackson National Life Insurance Company.
In the UK, the Group operates through its subsidiaries, primarily The Prudential Assurance Company Limited, Prudential Annuities Limited, Prudential Retirement Income Limited and M&G Investment Management Limited.
The Company is responsible for the financing of each of its subsidiaries.
2 Basis of preparation The financial statements of the Company, which comprise the balance sheet and related notes, are prepared in accordance with Part 15 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 from presenting its own profit and loss account.
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP, including Financial Reporting Standards FRS and Statements of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP.
The Company has not prepared a cash flow statement on the basis that its cash flow is included within the cash flow statement in the consolidated financial statements.
The Company has also taken advantage of the exemption within FRS 29, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, from the requirements of this standard on the basis that the Companys results are included in the publicly available consolidated financial statements of the Group that include disclosures that comply with IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, which is equivalent to FRS 29.
3 Significant accounting policies Shares in subsidiary undertakings Shares in subsidiary undertakings are shown at the lower of cost and estimated realisable value.
Loans to subsidiary undertakings Loans to subsidiary undertakings are shown at cost, less provisions.
Derivatives Derivative financial instruments are held to manage certain macro-economic exposures.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in the profit and loss account.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs, and subsequently accounted for on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method.
Under the effective interest method, the difference between the redemption value of the borrowing and the initial proceeds, net of transaction costs, is amortised through the profit and loss account to the date of maturity, or, for hybrid debt, over the expected life of the instrument.
Dividends Interim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are paid.
Share premium The difference between the proceeds received on issue of shares and the nominal value of the shares issued is credited to the share premium account.
Foreign currency translation Foreign currency borrowings that have been used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in overseas subsidiaries are translated at year end exchange rates.
The impact of these currency translations is recorded within the profit and loss account for the year.
Other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are also converted at year end exchange rates with the related foreign currency exchange gains or losses reflected in the profit and loss account for the year.
Financial statements Parent company Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 283 Tax Current tax expense is charged or credited to operations based upon amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable operations for the current year.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in accordance with the provisions of FRS 19, Deferred tax.
The Company has chosen not to apply the option available of recognising such assets and liabilities on a discounted basis to reflect the time value of money.
Except as set out in FRS 19, deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
The Groups UK subsidiaries each file separate tax returns.
In accordance with UK tax legislation, where one domestic UK company is a 75 per cent owned subsidiary of another UK company or both are 75 per cent owned subsidiaries of a common parent, the companies are considered to be within the same UK tax group.
For companies within the same tax group, trading profits and losses arising in the same accounting period may be offset for the purposes of determining current and deferred taxes.
Pensions The Company assumes a portion of the pension surplus or deficit of the Groups main pension scheme, the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS and applied the requirements of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits as amended in December 2006 to its interest in the PSPS surplus or deficit.
Further details are disclosed in note 9.
A pension surplus or deficit is recorded as the difference between the present value of the scheme liabilities and the fair value of the scheme assets.
The Companys share of pension surplus is recognised to the extent that the Company is able to recover a surplus either through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the scheme.
The assets and liabilities of the defined benefit pension schemes of the Prudential Group are subject to a full triennial actuarial valuation using the projected unit method.
Estimated future cash flows are then discounted at a high quality corporate bond rate, adjusted to allow for the difference in duration between the bond index and the pension liabilities where appropriate, to determine its present value.
The aggregate of the actuarially determined service costs of the currently employed personnel and the unwind of the discount on liabilities at the start of the period, gains and losses on settlements and curtailments, less the expected investment return on the scheme assets at the start of the period, is recognised in the profit and loss account.
To the extent that part or all of the Companys interest in the pension surplus is not recognised as an asset, the unrecognised surplus is initially applied to extinguish any past service costs, losses on settlements or curtailments that would otherwise be included in the profit and loss account.
Next, the expected investment return on the schemes assets is restricted so that it does not exceed the total of the current service cost, interest cost and any increase in the recoverable surplus.
Any further adjustment for the unrecognised surplus is treated as an actuarial gain or loss.
Actuarial gains and losses as a result of the changes in assumptions, the difference between actual and expected investment return on scheme assets and experience variances are recorded in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Actuarial gains and losses also include adjustment for unrecognised pension surplus as described above.
Share-based payments The Group offers share award and option plans for certain key employees and a Save As You Earn SAYE plan for all UK and certain overseas employees.
The share-based payment plans operated by the Group are mainly equity-settled plans with a few cash-settled plans.
Under FRS 20 Share-based payment, where the Company, as the parent company, has the obligation to settle the options or awards of its equity instruments to employees of its subsidiary undertakings, and such share-based payments are accounted for as equity-settled in the Group financial statements, the Company records an increase in the investment in subsidiary undertakings for the value of the share options and awards granted with a corresponding credit entry recognised directly in equity.
The value of the share options and awards granted is based upon the fair value of the options and awards at the grant date, the vesting period and the vesting conditions.

For the purpose of this reconciliation, no adjustment is made to the Company in respect of any valuation adjustments to shares in subsidiary undertakings which would be eliminated on consolidation.
The Group has adopted new accounting standards on consolidated financial statements and joint arrangements, and amendments to the employee benefits accounting standard, from 1 January 2013 as described in note A2 of the Group financial statements.
Accordingly, the 2012 figures for profit after tax of the Group have been adjusted retrospectively from those previously published.

This ratio was applied to the base deficit position at 1 January 2006 and for the purpose of determining the allocation of the movements in that position up to 31 December 2013.
The FRS 17 service charge and ongoing employer contributions are allocated by reference to the cost allocation for current activity.
The last completed triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme was as at 5 April 2011.
Further details on the results of this valuation and the total employer contributions to the Scheme for the year are provided in note C9, together with the key assumptions adopted, including mortality assumptions.
Using external actuarial advice provided by the professionally qualified actuaries, Towers Watson, for the valuation of the Scheme, the most recent full valuations have been updated to 31 December 2013 applying the principles prescribed by FRS 17.

The actuarial gains losses attributable to the Company are net of the apportionment to the PAC with-profits fund and are related to the surplus recognised in the balance sheet of the Company.
In 2013, the actuarial losses attributable to the Company included an amount credited of 127 million 2012: 124 million for the adjustment to the unrecognised portion of surplus which has not been deducted from the pension charge.
The actuarial gains before tax of 8 million 2012: 35 million attributable to the Company are recorded in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.

11 Profit of the Company and reconciliation of the movement in shareholders funds The profit after tax of the Company for the year was 1,579 million 2012: loss of 216 million.
After dividends of 781 million 2012: 655 million, actuarial gains net of tax in respect of the pension scheme of 6 million 2012: 27 million and share-based payment credits of 6 million 2012: 6 million, retained profit at 31 December 2013 amounted to 5,329 million 2012: 4,519 million.
Retained profit includes 2,683 million relating to gains made by intermediate holding companies following the transfer at fair value of certain subsidiaries to other parts of the Group as part of internal restructuring exercises.
Because the gains relate to intra-group transactions, the amount of 2,683 million is not able to be regarded as part of the distributable reserves of the parent company.
Under English company law, Prudential may pay dividends only if sufficient distributable reserves of the Company are available for the purpose and if the amount of its net assets is greater than the aggregate of its called up share capital and undistributable reserves such as for example the share premium account and the payment of the dividend does not reduce the amount of its net assets to less than that aggregate.
At 31 December 2013, the UK GAAP retained earnings of the holding company from which distributable reserves may be derived were 5,329 million.

By contrast, embedded value is a way of reporting the value of the life insurance business.
The European Embedded Value principles were published by the CFO Forum of major European insurers in October 2005.
The principles provide consistent definitions, a framework for setting actuarial assumptions and an approach to the underlying methodology and disclosures.
Results prepared under the EEV principles capture the discounted value of future profits expected to arise from the current book of long-term business.
The results are prepared by projecting cash flows, by product, using best estimate assumptions for all relevant factors.
Furthermore, in determining these expected profits full allowance is made for the risks attached to their emergence and the associated cost of capital, and takes into account recent experience in assessing likely future persistency, mortality and expenses.
Further details are explained in note 15.

This has resulted in a reallocation of 8 million in 2013 2012: 6 million from the tax charge on operating profit based on longer-term investment returns to the pre-tax result for Eastspring investments, with no effect on the net of tax EEV basis results.
In addition, the Group agreed in July 2013 to sell, dependent on regulatory approval, its closed book life insurance business in Japan.
Accordingly, the presentation of the 2012 comparative EEV basis results and related notes have been adjusted from those previously published for the retrospective application of this standard and for the reclassification of the result attributable to the held for sale Japan life business, as described in note 18.
This approach has been adopted consistently throughout this supplementary information.
Notes i The value of profits or losses from asset management and service companies that support the Groups covered insurance businesses as defined in note 15 a are included in the profits for new business and the in-force value of the Groups long-term business.
The results of the Groups asset management operations include the profits from the management of internal and external funds.
For EEV basis reporting, Group shareholders other income is adjusted to deduct the unwind of the expected profit margin for the year arising from the management of the assets of the covered business by the Groups asset management businesses.
The deduction is on a basis consistent with that used for projecting the results for covered insurance business.
Group operating profit accordingly includes the variance between actual and expected profit in respect of management of the covered business assets.
ii The comparative results have been prepared using previously reported average exchange rates for the year.

Notes a The increase in unwind of discount and other expected returns of 251 million from 595 million in 2012 to 846 million in 2013 reflects a 140 million effect of higher risk discount rates, driven by the increase in long-term interest rates, together with an effect of 111 million arising from the growth in the opening in-force value adjusted for assumption changes on which the discount rates are applied, partially offset by a 21 million reduction due to unfavourable exchange rate movements, particularly in Indonesia, and a 21 million increase in the return on net worth.
b In 2013 the credit of 35 million for mortality and morbidity assumption changes mainly reflects a beneficial effect arising from the renegotiation of a reinsurance agreement in Indonesia.
The 2012 credit of 79 million primarily reflected mortality improvements in Hong Kong and Singapore and revised assumptions for critical illness business in Singapore.
c The charge for persistency and withdrawals assumption changes reflects a number of offsetting items including for 2013, the effect of strengthening lapse and premium holiday assumptions in Korea.
d In 2012 the charge of 45 million for expense assumption changes principally arose in Malaysia and reflected changes to the pension entitlements of agents.
e The favourable effect of mortality and morbidity experience in 2013 of 42 million 2012: 57 million reflects continued better than expected experience, principally arising in Hong Kong, Indonesia and Singapore.
f The persistency and withdrawals experience variance in 2013 of 44 million 2012: 52 million principally reflects favourable experience in Hong Kong and Indonesia.
g The negative expense experience variance of 26 million in 2013 2012: 30 million principally reflects expense overruns for operations which are currently sub-scale China, Malaysia Takaful and Taiwan and in India where the business model is being adapted in response to the regulatory changes introduced in recent years.

b The effect of changes in persistency assumptions of 72 million in 2013 2012: 45 million primarily relates to a reduction in lapse rates following the end of the surrender charge period, principally for variable annuity business.
c The effect of the change of assumption for variable annuity fees represents the capitalised value of the change in the projected policyholder advisory fees, which vary according to the size and the mix of variable annuity funds.
d The spread assumption for Jackson is determined on a longer-term basis, net of provision for defaults see note 16 ii b.
The spread experience variance in 2013 of 274 million 2012: 205 million includes the positive effect of transactions undertaken to more closely match the overall asset and liability duration.
e The amortisation of interest-related gains and losses reflects the fact that when bonds that are neither impaired nor deteriorating are sold and reinvested there will be a consequent change in the investment yield.
The realised gain or loss is amortised into the result over the period when the bonds would have otherwise matured to better reflect the long-term returns included in operating profits.
f The credit of 48 million for other changes in experience variances and other items mainly reflects the positive persistency experience variance of 62 million 2012: 21 million across all products.
g The result includes a full year contribution from the REALIC book of business of 61 million 2012: four months of 19 million.

b For 2013, the beneficial effect of the change in UK corporate tax rates of 122 million 2012: 87 million reflects the combined effect of the reductions in corporate rates from 23 per cent to 21 per cent from April 2014 and 21 per cent to 20 per cent from April 2015 2012: from 25 per cent to 23 per cent which were both enacted in July 2013.
Consistent with the Groups approach of grossing up the movement in the post-tax value of in-force business for shareholder tax, the 122 million 2012: 87 million benefit is presented gross.
c Other items of 67 million for 2013 includes the positive effects of rebalancing the investment portfolio backing annuity business.
In 2012 the negative effect of 16 million included a charge of 52 million for the strengthening of mortality assumptions, net of reserve releases and the effects of portfolio rebalancing for annuity business.
European Embedded Value Financial statements EEV basis results Notes on the EEV basis results Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 303 4 Business acquisitions and disposals a Acquisition of Thanachart Life Assurance Company Limited and bancassurance partnership agreement with Thanachart Bank On 3 May 2013, the agreement Prudential plc, through its subsidiary Prudential Life Assurance Thailand Public Company Limited Prudential Thailand, entered into in November 2012 to establish an exclusive 15-year partnership with Thanachart Bank Public Company limited Thanachart Bank to develop jointly their bancassurance business in Thailand was launched.
At the same time Prudential Thailand completed the acquisition of 100 per cent of the voting interest in Thanachart Life Assurance Company Limited Thanachart Life, a wholly-owned life insurance subsidiary of Thanachart Bank.
The acquired assets are comprised of: m Acquired assets: Net worth including acquisition of distribution rights 386 Value of in force acquired 26 Transaction consideration 412 The purchase consideration paid was equivalent to the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed.
b Acquisition of Reassure America Life Insurance Company in 2012 On 4 September 2012, the Group through its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Jackson completed the acquisition of 100 per cent issued share capital of SRLC America Holding Corp. and its primary operating subsidiary, Reassure America Life Insurance Company REALIC.
The gain of 453 million reflects the fair value of the acquired business as determined by applying the same methodology as applied for Jacksons non-variable annuity business.
A risk discount rate of 4.3 per cent at the date of acquisition on 4 September 2012 was used.
c Agreement to sell Japan life business On 16 July 2013, the Group reached an agreement to sell, subject to regulatory approval, the life insurance business in Japan, PCA Life Insurance Company Limited, which was closed to new business in 2010, to SBI Holdings Inc. for US$85 million 51 million at 31 December 2013 closing exchange rate with related expenses of 3 million.
Consistent with the held for sale classification of the business for IFRS reporting, the EEV carrying value has been set to 48 million at 31 December 2013.
For 2013 the result for the year, together with the adjustment to the carrying value have given rise to an aggregate loss of 35 million which has been included in non-operating profit.
Consistent with this treatment, the presentation of the comparative results has been adjusted retrospectively from those previously published.
5 Short-term fluctuations in investment returns Short-term fluctuations in investment returns, net of the related change in the time value of cost of options and guarantees, arise as follows: i Group Summary 2013 m 2012 m Insurance operations: note ii Asia 405 362 note iii US 422 254 note iv UK 35 315 792 423 Other operations: note v Other 27 119 note vi Economic hedge value movement 32 Total 819 510 The 2012 comparative results have been adjusted retrospectively from those previously published for the adoption of revised IAS 19 and for the reclassification of the results attributable to the held for sale Japan life business see note 18.
304 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes on the EEV basis results Notes on the EEV basis results continued 5 Short-term fluctuations in investment returns continued ii Asia operations For 2013, the negative short-term fluctuations in investment returns of 405 million principally arise in Hong Kong of 223 million and in Singapore of 96 million, due to unrealised value reductions on bonds, arising from the increase in long-term interest rates, and in Indonesia of 52 million for a decrease in future expected fee income for unit-linked business, driven by falls in equity markets.
For 2012, the positive short-term fluctuations in investment returns of 362 million in Asia operations were driven by unrealised gains on bonds and higher equity markets which principally arose in Hong Kong of 139 million mainly relating to positive returns on bonds backing participating business, Singapore of 114 million primarily relating to increasing future expected fee income for unit-linked business and unrealised gains on bonds, Taiwan of 56 million for unrealised gains on bonds and CDOs and India of 30 million.
iii US operations The short-term fluctuations in investment returns for US operations comprise the following items: 2013 m 2012 m note a Investment return related experience on fixed income securities 21 99 Investment return related impact due to changed expectation of profits on in-force variable annuity business in future periods based on current period separate account return, net of related note b hedging activity 580 183 note c Other items including actual less long-term return on equity based investments 137 28 Total US operations 422 254 Notes a The credit charge relating to fixed income securities comprises the following elements: 1 the excess of actual realised gains losses over the amortisation of interest related realised gains and losses recorded in the profit and loss account: 2 credit loss experience versus the longer-term assumption : and 3 the impact of fide-risking activities within the portfolio.
b This item reflects the net impact of variances in projected future fees and future benefit costs arising from the effect of market fluctuations on the growth in separate account asset values in the current reporting period and related hedging activity arising from realised and unrealised gains and losses on equity related hedges and interest rate options.
c Other items of 137 million in 2013 primarily reflects a beneficial impact of the excess of actual over assumed return from investments in limited partnerships.
iv UK insurance operations The short-term fluctuations in investment returns for UK insurance operations arise from the following types of business: 2013 m 2012 m note a Shareholder-backed annuity 72 3 note b With-profits, unit-linked and other 107 318 Total UK insurance operations 35 315 Notes a Short-term fluctuations in investment returns for shareholder-backed annuity business comprise: 1 gains losses on surplus assets compared to the expected long-term rate of return reflecting reductions increases in corporate bond and gilt yields: 2 the difference between actual and expected default experience: and 3 the effect of mismatching for assets and liabilities of different durations and other short-term fluctuations in investment returns.
b The short-term fluctuations in investment returns for with-profits, unit-linked and other business primarily arise from the excess of actual over expected returns for with-profits business.
The total return on the fund including unallocated surplus in 2013 was 8 per cent compared to an assumed rate of return of 6 per cent 2012: 10 per cent total return compared to assumed rate of 5 per cent.
This hedge reduces the risks arising from equity market declines.
v Other items Short-term fluctuations in investment returns of other operations were negative 27 million 2012: positive 119 million representing principally unrealised value movements on investments and foreign exchange items.
vi Economic hedge value movements This item represents the cost of short-dated hedge contracts taken out in the first half of 2012 to provide downside protection against severe equity market falls through a period of particular uncertainty with respect to the Eurozone.
The hedge contracts were terminated in the second half of 2012.
European Embedded Value Financial statements EEV basis results Notes on the EEV basis results Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 305 6 Effect of changes in economic assumptions The effects of changes in economic assumptions for in-force business, net of the related change in the time value of cost of options and guarantees, included within profit before tax including actual investment returns arise as follows: i Group summary 2013 m 2012 m note ii Asia operations 283 135 note iii US operations 372 85 note iv UK insurance operations 166 48 Total 821 2 The 2012 comparative results have been adjusted retrospectively from those previously published for the reclassification of the result attributable to the held for sale Japan life business see note 18. ii Asia operations The effect of changes in economic assumptions for Asia operations in 2013 of 283 million primarily reflects the overall impact of the increase in long-term interest rates in the year, principally arising in Hong Kong of 361 million, Singapore of 107 million and Taiwan of 99 million mainly due to the increase in fund earned rates for participating business.
There are partial offsets arising in Indonesia of 237 million and in Malaysia of 77 million, mainly reflecting the negative impact of calculating health and protection future profits at a higher discount rate.
The charge of 135 million in 2012 for the effect of changes in economic assumptions principally arose in Hong Kong of 320 million, primarily reflecting the effect on projected cash flows of fide-risking the asset portfolio and the reduction in fund earned rates on participating business, driven by the very low interest rate environment, and in Vietnam of 47 million, following the fall in bond yields.
There were partial offsets totalling 232 million, principally arising in Malaysia and Indonesia, mainly reflecting the positive impact of calculating projected health and protection profits at a lower rate, driven by the decrease in risk discount rates.
iii US operations The effect of changes in economic assumptions for US operations reflects the following: 2013 m 2012 m Effect of changes in 10-year treasury rates and beta: note a Fixed annuity and other general account business 375 20 note b Variable annuity business 587 83 note c Decrease in additional allowance for credit risk 160 148 note d Total US operations 372 85 Notes a For fixed annuity and other general account business the charge of 375 million in 2013 principally arises from the effect of a higher discount rate on the opening value of the in-force book, driven by the 130 basis points increase in the risk-free rate.
The projected cash flows for this business principally reflect projected spread, with secondary effects on the cash flows also resulting from changes to assumed future yields and resulting policyholder behaviour.
The credit of 20 million in 2012 reflected a 10 basis point decrease in the risk-free rate, partially offset by the effect for the acquired REALIC book reflecting a 20 basis point increase in the risk-free rate from the 4 September acquisition date to 31 December 2012. b For variable annuity business, the credit of 587 million principally reflects an increase in projected fee income and a decrease in projected benefit costs, arising from the increase in the rate of assumed future return on the underlying separate account assets, driven by the 130 basis points increase in the risk-free rate.
There is a partial offset arising from the increase in the discount rate applied to those cash flows.
The charge of 83 million in 2012 reflected a decrease in the risk-free rate of 10 basis points.
c For 2013 the 160 million 2012: 148 million effect of the decrease in the additional allowance for credit risk within the risk discount rate reflected the reduction in credit spreads and represented a 50 basis points decrease for spread business and a 10 basis points decrease for variable annuity business, representing the proportion of business invested in the general account as described in note 15 b iii.
d The total effect of changes in economic assumptions for US operations of a credit of 372 million for 2013 includes a pre-tax charge of 20 million for the effect of the change in required capital from 235 per cent to 250 per cent of risk-based capital see note 15 b ii.

b For with-profits and other business the total credit in 2013 of 236 million 2012: charge of 46 million includes the net effect of the changes in fund earned rates and risk discount rate as shown in note 16 iii, driven by the 120 basis points increase 2012: a reduction of 20 basis points in the 15-year government bond rate.
c In 2012, the effect of the change in tax regime of 46 million reflected the change in pattern of taxable profits for shareholder-backed annuity business arising from the acceleration of tax payments due to the altered timing of relief on regulatory basis provisions.

As new business is written, the carrying value of this purchase cost is amortised against the new business contribution line of this reconciliation.
vi The increase in required capital in US operations of 58 million reflects the effect of the change from 235 per cent to 250 per cent of risk-based capital.
vii The decrease in the cost of time value of guarantees for US operations from 650 million at 2012 to 146 million at 2013 primarily relates to variable annuity business, mainly arising from the increase in the expected long-term separate account rate of return of 1.3 per cent driven by the increase in the US 10-year treasury bond rate and strong equity performance, partly offset by the impact from new business written in the year.
viii Effects of domestication of Hong Kong branch in 2014 The analysis of shareholders equity at 31 December 2013 does not incorporate the impact of the domestication of the Hong Kong branch which took effect on 1 January 2014.
In order to align the corporate structure of the branch business in Hong Kong more closely with Prudentials other Asia operations, the Board of PAC initiated a proposal to transfer the branch business to two Hong Kong-incorporated companies Prudential Hong Kong Limited and Prudential General Insurance Hong Kong Limited with one providing life insurance and the other providing general insurance.
Following consultation with policyholders of PAC and court approval, the assets and liabilities of the Hong Kong branch business of PAC transferred to separate subsidiaries on 1 January 2014.
As a consequence of this restructuring, adjustments in respect of required capital, and the cost of that capital, will be necessary.
This arises from the transfer of capital that was previously held within the UK business in respect of the Hong Kong branch operations and additional capital requirements that arise from the newly established subsidiaries.

The adjustments for Asia operations reflect this transfer and the effects of additional capital requirements of the Hong Kong regulator under the arrangements for the newly domesticated business.
The net effect reflects the higher required capital levels attributable to the stand-alone Hong Kong shareholder-backed long-term insurance business.
European Embedded Value Financial statements EEV basis results Notes on the EEV basis results Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 313 13 Expected transfer of value of in-force business to free surplus The discounted value of in-force business and required capital can be reconciled to the 2013 and 2012 totals in the tables below for the emergence of free surplus as follows: 2013 m 2012 m note 12 Required capital 3,954 3,898 note 12 Value of in-force VIF 17,439 15,411 note 12 Add back: deduction for cost of time value of guarantees 196 683 Expected cash flow from sale of Japan life business 25 note Other items 1,157 1,401 Total 20,407 18,591 Note Other items represent amounts incorporated into VIF where there is no definitive timeframe for when the payments will be made or receipts received.
In particular, other items includes the deduction of the value of the shareholders interest in the estate, the value of which is derived by increasing final bonus rates so as to exhaust the estate over the lifetime of the in-force with-profits business.
This is an assumption to give an appropriate valuation.
To be conservative, this item is excluded from the expected free surplus generation profile below.
Cash flows are projected on a deterministic basis and are discounted at the appropriate risk discount rate.
The modelled cash flows use the same methodology underpinning the Groups embedded value reporting and so are subject to the same assumptions and sensitivities.

These are for the effect of economic assumption changes and, to the extent that asset value changes are included in the sensitivities, within short-term fluctuations in investment returns.
In addition to the sensitivity effects shown above, the other components of the profit for the following year would be calculated by reference to the altered assumptions, for example new business contribution and unwind of discount, together with the effect of other changes such as altered corporate bond spreads.
In addition for Jackson, the fair value movements on assets backing surplus and required capital which are taken directly to shareholders equity would also be affected by changes in interest rates.

Covered business represents the Groups long-term insurance business for which the value of new and in-force contracts is attributable to shareholders.
The results for covered business, including the Groups investments in joint venture insurance operations, are presented on a pre-tax basis, with tax reported separately.
The EEV basis results for the Groups covered business are then combined with the IFRS basis results of the Groups other operations.
Under the EEV Principles, the results for covered business incorporate the projected margins of attaching internal asset management.
The definition of long-term business operations is consistent with previous practice and comprises those contracts falling under the definition for regulatory purposes together with, for US operations, contracts that are in substance the same as guaranteed investment contracts GICs but do not fall within the technical definition.
Covered business comprises the Groups long-term business operations, with two exceptions: The closed Scottish Amicable Insurance Fund SAIF which is excluded from covered business.
SAIF is a ring-fenced sub-fund of the Prudential Assurance Company PAC long-term fund, established by a Court approved Scheme of Arrangement in October 1997.
SAIF is closed to new business and the assets and liabilities of the fund are wholly attributable to the policyholders of the fund.
The presentational treatment of the Groups principal defined benefit pension scheme, the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS.
The partial recognition of the surplus for PSPS is recognised in Other operations, as described in note 15 c vi.
A small amount of UK group pensions business is also not modelled for EEV reporting purposes.
b Methodology i Embeddedvalue Overview The embedded value is the present value of the shareholders interest in the earnings distributable from assets allocated to covered business after sufficient allowance has been made for the aggregate risks in that business.
The shareholders interest in the Groups long-term business comprises: Present value of future shareholder cash flows from in-force covered business value of in-force business, less deductions for: the cost of locked-in required capital: the time value of cost of options and guarantees: Locked-in required capital: and Shareholders net worth in excess of required capital free surplus.
The value of future new business is excluded from the embedded value.
Notwithstanding the basis of presentation of results as explained in note 15 c iv no smoothing of market or account balance values, unrealised gains or investment return is applied in determining the embedded value or profit before tax.
Separately, the analysis of profit is delineated between operating profit based on longer-term investment returns and other constituent items as explained in note 15 c i. Valuation of in-force and new business The embedded value results are prepared incorporating best estimate assumptions about all relevant factors including levels of future investment returns, expenses, persistency and mortality.
These assumptions are used to project future cash flows.
The present value of the future cash flows is then calculated using a discount rate which reflects both the time value of money and the non-diversifiable risks associated with the cash flows that are not otherwise allowed for.
Best estimate assumptions Best estimate assumptions are used for the cash flow projections, where best estimate is defined as the mean of the distribution of future possible outcomes.
The assumptions are reviewed actively and changes are made when evidence exists that material changes in future experience are reasonably certain.
Assumptions required in the calculation of the value of options and guarantees, for example relating to volatilities and correlations, or dynamic algorithms linking liabilities to assets, have been set equal to the best estimates and, wherever material and practical, reflect any dynamic relationships between the assumptions and the stochastic variables.
Demographic assumptions Persistency, mortality and morbidity assumptions are based on an analysis of recent experience but also reflect expected future experience.
Where relevant, when calculating the time value of financial options and guarantees, policyholder withdrawal rates vary in line with the emerging investment conditions according to managements expectations.
Expense assumptions Expense levels, including those of service companies that support the Groups long-term business operations, are based on internal expense analysis investigations and are appropriately allocated to acquisition of new business and renewal of in-force business.
Exceptional expenses are identified and reported separately.
For mature business, it is Prudentials policy not to take credit for future cost reduction programmes until the savings have been delivered.
For businesses which are currently sub-scale China, Malaysia Takaful and Taiwan and India where the business model is being adapted in response to the regulatory changes introduced in recent years, expense overruns are permitted where these are expected to be short-lived.
European Embedded Value Financial statements EEV basis results Notes on the EEV basis results Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 317 For Asia operations, the expenses comprise costs borne directly and recharged costs from the Asia regional head office, that are attributable to covered business.
The assumed future expenses for these operations also include projections of these future recharges.
Development expenses are charged as incurred.
Corporate expenditure comprises: Expenditure for Group head office, to the extent not allocated to the PAC with-profits funds, together with Solvency II implementation and restructuring costs, which are charged to the EEV basis results as incurred: and Expenditure of the Asia regional head office that is not allocated to the covered business or asset management operations which is charged as incurred.
These costs are primarily for corporate related activities and are included within corporate expenditure.
Principal economic assumptions The EEV basis results for the Groups operations have been determined using economic assumptions where the long-term expected rates of return on investments and risk discount rates are set by reference to year end rates of return on government bonds.
Expected returns on equity and property asset classes and corporate bonds are derived by adding a risk premium, based on the Groups long-term view, to the risk-free rate.
The total profit that emerges over the lifetime of an individual contract as calculated using the embedded value basis is the same as that calculated under the IFRS basis.
Since the embedded value basis reflects discounted future cash flows, under this methodology the profit emergence is advanced, thus more closely aligning the timing of the recognition of profits with the efforts and risks of current management actions, particularly with regard to business sold during the year.
New business In determining the EEV basis value of new business, premiums are included in projected cash flows on the same basis of distinguishing annual and single premium business as set out for statutory basis reporting.
New business premiums reflect those premiums attaching to covered business, including premiums for contracts classified as investment products for IFRS basis reporting.
New business premiums for regular premium products are shown on an annualised basis.
Internal vesting business is classified as new business where the contracts include an open market option.
The contribution from new business represents profits determined by applying operating assumptions as at the end of the year.
For UK immediate annuity business and single premium Universal Life products in Asia, primarily Singapore, the new business contribution is determined by applying economic assumptions reflecting point of sale market conditions.
This is consistent with how the business is priced as crediting rates are linked to yields on specific assets and the yield is locked-in when the assets are purchased at the point-of-sale of the policy.
For other business within the Group, end of period economic assumptions are used.
New business profitability is a key metric for the Groups management of the development of the business.
In addition, new business margins are shown by reference to annual premium equivalents APE and the present value of new business premiums PVNBP.
These margins are calculated as the percentage of the value of new business profit to APE and PVNBP.
APE is calculated as the aggregate of regular new business amounts and one-tenth of single new business amounts.
PVNBP is calculated as equalling single premiums plus the present value of expected premiums of new regular premium business, allowing for lapses and other assumptions made in determining the EEV new business contribution.
Valuation movements on investments With the exception of debt securities held by Jackson, investment gains and losses during the year to the extent that changes in capital values do not directly match changes in liabilities are included directly in the profit for the year and shareholders equity as they arise.
The results for any covered business conceptually reflect the aggregate of the IFRS results and the movements on the additional shareholders interest recognised on the EEV basis.
Thus the start point for the calculation of the EEV results for Jackson, as for other businesses, reflects the market value movements recognised on the IFRS basis.
However, in determining the movements on the additional shareholders interest, the basis for calculating the Jackson EEV result acknowledges that, for debt securities backing liabilities, the aggregate EEV results reflect the fact that the value of in-force business instead incorporates the discounted value of future spread earnings.
This value is not affected generally by short-term market movements on securities that broadly speaking, are held for the longer-term.
Fixed income securities backing the free surplus and required capital for Jackson are accounted for at fair value.
However, consistent with the treatment applied under IFRS for Jackson securities classified as available-for-sale, movements in unrealised appreciation on these securities are accounted for in equity rather than in the income statement, as shown in the movement in shareholders equity.
Cost of capital A charge is deducted from the embedded value for the cost of capital supporting the Groups long-term business.
This capital is referred to as required capital.
The cost is the difference between the nominal value of the capital and the discounted value of the projected releases of this capital allowing for investment earnings posttax on the capital.
The annual result is affected by the movement in this cost from year-to-year which comprises a charge against new business profit and generally a release in respect of the reduction in capital requirements for business in force as this runs off.
Where required capital is held within a with-profits long-term fund, the value placed on surplus assets in the fund is already discounted to reflect its release over time and no further adjustment is necessary in respect of required capital.
318 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes on the EEV basis results Notes on the EEV basis results continued 15  Financial options and guarantees Nature of financial options and guarantees in Prudentials long-term business Asia operations Subject to local market circumstances and regulatory requirements, the guarantee features described below in respect of UK business broadly apply to similar types of participating contracts principally written in the PAC Hong Kong branch, Singapore and Malaysia.
There are also various non-participating long-term products with guarantees.
The principal guarantees are those for whole of life contracts with floor levels of policyholder benefits that accrue at rates set at inception and do not vary subsequently with market conditions.
US operations Jackson The principal financial options and guarantees in Jackson are associated with the fixed annuity and variable annuity VA lines of business.
Fixed annuities provide that, at Jacksons discretion, it may reset the interest rate credited to policyholders accounts, subject to a guaranteed minimum.
The guaranteed minimum return varies from 1.0 per cent to 5.5 per cent for 2013 and 2012, depending on the particular product, jurisdiction where issued, and date of issue.
For 2013 and 2012, 86 per cent of the account values on fixed annuities are for policies with guarantees of 3 per cent or less.
The average guarantee rate is 2.8 per cent for 2013 and 2012.
Fixed annuities also present a risk that policyholders will exercise their option to surrender their contracts in periods of rapidly rising interest rates, possibly requiring Jackson to liquidate assets at an inopportune time.
Jackson issues VA contracts where it contractually guarantees to the contract holder either: a return of no less than total deposits made to the contract adjusted for any partial withdrawals: b total deposits made to the contract adjusted for any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return: or c the highest contract value on a specified anniversary date adjusted for any withdrawals following the specified contract anniversary.
These guarantees include benefits that are payable at specified dates during the accumulation period Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit GMWB, as death benefits Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits GMDB or as income benefits Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefits GMIB.
These guarantees generally protect the policyholders value in the event of poor equity market performance.
Jackson hedges the GMDB and GMWB guarantees through the use of equity options and futures contracts, and fully reinsures the GMIB guarantees.
Jackson also issues fixed index annuities that enable policyholders to obtain a portion of an equity-linked return while providing a guaranteed minimum return.
The guaranteed minimum returns would be of a similar nature to those described above for fixed annuities.
UK insurance operations For covered business the only significant financial options and guarantees in the UK insurance operations arise in the with-profits fund.
There are two types of bonuses annual and final.
Annual bonuses are declared once a year and, once credited, are guaranteed in accordance with the terms of the particular product.
The with-profits fund also held a provision on the Pillar I Peak 2 basis of 36 million at 31 December 2013 31 December 2012: 47 million to honour guarantees on a small number of guaranteed annuity option products.
The only material guaranteed surrender values relate to investments in the PruFund range of with-profits funds.
For these products the policyholder can choose to pay an additional management charge.
In return, at the selected guarantee date, the fund will be increased if necessary to a guaranteed minimum value based on the initial investment adjusted for any prior withdrawals.
The with-profits fund held a reserve of 36 million at 31 December 2013 31 December 2012: 52 million in respect of this guarantee.
The Groups main exposure to guaranteed annuity options in the UK is through the non-covered business of SAIF.
A provision on the Pillar I Peak 2 basis of 328 million was held in SAIF at 31 December 2013 31 December 2012: 371 million to honour the guarantees.
As described in note 15 a above, the assets and liabilities are wholly attributable to the policyholders of the fund.
Therefore the movement in the provision has no direct impact on shareholders.
Time value The value of financial options and guarantees comprises two parts.
One is given by a deterministic valuation on best estimate assumptions the intrinsic value.
The other part arises from the variability of economic outcomes in the future the time value.
Where appropriate, a full stochastic valuation has been undertaken to determine the time value of the financial options and guarantees.
The economic assumptions used for the stochastic calculations are consistent with those used for the deterministic calculations.
Assumptions specific to the stochastic calculations reflect local market conditions and are based on a combination of actual market data, historic market data and an assessment of long-term economic conditions.
Common principles have been adopted across the Group for the stochastic asset models, for example, separate modelling of individual asset classes but with an allowance for correlation between the various asset classes.
Details of the key characteristics of each model are given in notes 16 iv, v and vi.
In deriving the time value of financial options and guarantees, management actions in response to emerging investment and fund solvency conditions have been modelled.
Management actions encompass, but are not confined to investment allocation decisions, levels of reversionary and terminal bonuses and credited rates.
Bonus rates are projected from current levels and varied in accordance with assumed management actions applying in the emerging investment and fund solvency conditions.
In all instances, the modelled actions are in accordance with approved local practice and therefore reflect the options actually available to management.
For the PAC with-profits fund, the actions assumed are consistent with those set out in the Principles and Practices of Financial Management which explains how regular and final bonus rates within the discretionary framework are determined, subject to the general legislative requirements applicable.
European Embedded Value Financial statements EEV basis results Notes on the EEV basis results Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 319 ii  In adopting the EEV Principles, Prudential has based required capital on its internal targets subject to it being at least the local statutory minimum requirements.
For with-profits business written in a segregated life fund, as is the case in Asia and the UK, the capital available in the fund is sufficient to meet the required capital requirements.
For shareholder-backed business the following capital requirements apply: Asia operations: the level of required capital has been set to an amount at least equal to the higher of local statutory requirements and the internal target: US operations: the level of required capital has been set at 250 per cent 2012: 235 per cent of the risk-based capital required by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC at the Company Action Level CAL : and UK insurance operations: the capital requirements are set to an amount at least equal to the higher of Pillar I and Pillar II requirements for shareholder-backed business of UK insurance operations as a whole.
iii  Overview Under the EEV Principles, discount rates used to determine the present value of future cash flows are set by reference to risk-free rates plus a risk margin.
The risk margin should reflect any non-diversifiable risk associated with the emergence of distributable earnings that is not allowed for elsewhere in the valuation.
Prudential has selected a granular approach to better reflect differences in market risk inherent in each product group.
The risk discount rate so derived does not reflect an overall Group market beta but instead reflects the expected volatility associated with the cash flows for each product category in the embedded value model.
Since financial options and guarantees are explicitly valued under the EEV methodology, discount rates under EEV are set excluding the effect of these product features.
The risk margin represents the aggregate of the allowance for market risk, additional allowance for credit risk where appropriate, and allowance for non-diversifiable non-market risk.
No allowance is required for non-market risks where these are assumed to be fully diversifiable.
Market risk allowance The allowance for market risk represents the beta multiplied by an equity risk premium.
Except for UK shareholder-backed annuity business as explained below such an approach has been used for all of the Groups businesses.
The beta of a portfolio or product measures its relative market risk.
The risk discount rates reflect the market risk inherent in each product group and hence the volatility of product cash flows.
These are determined by considering how the profits from each product are affected by changes in expected returns on various asset classes.
By converting this into a relative rate of return it is possible to derive a product specific beta.
Product level betas reflect the most recent product mix to produce appropriate betas and risk discount rates for each major product grouping.
Additional credit risk allowance The Groups methodology is to allow appropriately for credit risk.
The allowance for total credit risk is to cover: Expected long-term defaults: Credit risk premium to reflect the volatility in downgrade and default levels : and Short-term downgrades and defaults.
These allowances are initially reflected in determining best estimate returns and through the market risk allowance described above.
However, for those businesses which are largely backed by holdings of debt securities these allowances in the projected returns and market risk allowances may not be sufficient and an additional allowance may be appropriate.
The practical application of the allowance for credit risk varies depending upon the type of business as described below.
Asia operations For Asia operations, the allowance for credit risk incorporated in the projected rates of return and the market risk allowance are sufficient.
Accordingly no additional allowance for credit risk is required.
The projected rates of return for holdings of corporate bonds comprise the risk-free rate plus an assessment of long-term spread over the risk-free rate.
320 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes on the EEV basis results Notes on the EEV basis results continued 15  US operations Jackson For Jackson business, the allowance for long-term defaults is reflected in the risk margin reserve RMR charge which is deducted in determining the projected spread margin between the earned rate on the investments and the policyholder crediting rate.
The risk discount rate incorporates an additional allowance for credit risk premium and short-term downgrades and defaults as shown in note 16 ii.
In determining this allowance a number of factors have been considered.
These factors, in particular, include: How much of the credit spread on debt securities represents an increased credit risk not reflected in the RMR long-term default assumptions, and how much is liquidity premium which is the premium required by investors to compensate for the risk of longerterm investments which cannot be easily converted into cash, and converted at the fair market value.
In assessing this effect, consideration has been given to a number of approaches to estimating the liquidity premium by considering recent statistical data: and Policyholder benefits for Jackson fixed annuity business are not fixed.
It is possible in adverse economic scenarios to pass on a component of credit losses to policyholders subject to guarantee features through lower investment return rates credited to policyholders.
Consequently, it is only necessary to allow for the balance of the credit risk in the risk discount rate.
The level of the additional allowance is assessed at each reporting period to take account of prevailing credit conditions and as the business in force alters over time.
The additional allowance for variable annuity business has been set at one-fifth of the non-variable annuity business to reflect the proportion of the allocated holdings of general account debt securities.
The level of allowance differs from that for UK annuity business for investment portfolio differences and to take account of the management actions available in adverse economic scenarios to reduce crediting rates to policyholders, subject to guarantee features of the products.
UK operations 1  For Prudentials UK shareholder-backed annuity business, Prudential has used a market consistent embedded value MCEV approach to derive an implied risk discount rate which is then applied to the projected best estimate cash flows.
In the annuity MCEV calculations as the assets are generally held to maturity to match long duration liabilities, the future cash flows are discounted using the swap yield curve plus an allowance for liquidity premium based on Prudentials assessment of the expected return on the assets backing the annuity liabilities after allowing for: Expected long-term defaults derived as a percentage of historical default experience based on Moodys data for the period 1970 to 2009 and the definition of the credit rating assigned to each asset held is the second highest credit rating published by Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch: A credit risk premium, which is derived as the excess over the expected long-term defaults, of the 95th percentile of historical cumulative defaults based on Moodys data for the period 1970 to 2009, and subject to a minimum margin over expected long-term defaults of 50 per cent: An allowance for a 1 notch downgrade of the asset portfolio subject to credit risk: and An allowance for short-term downgrades and defaults.
For the purposes of presentation in the EEV results, the results on this basis are reconfigured.
Under this approach the projected earned rate of return on the debt securities held is determined after allowing for expected long-term defaults and, where necessary, an additional allowance for an element of short-term downgrades and defaults to bring the allowance in the earned rate up to best estimate levels.
The allowances for credit risk premium, 1 notch downgrade and the remaining element of short-term downgrade and default allowances are incorporated into the risk margin included in the discount rate, as shown in note 16 iii b.
2  For UK non-profit annuity business including that written by Prudential Annuities Limited PAL the basis for determining the aggregate allowance for credit risk is consistent with that applied for UK shareholder-backed annuity business as described above.
The allowance for credit risk in PAL is taken into account in determining the projected cash flows to the with-profits fund, which are in turn discounted at the risk discount rate applicable to all of the projected cash flows of the fund.
3  The UK with-profits fund holds debt securities as part of its investment portfolio backing policyholder liabilities and unallocated surplus.
The assumed earned rate for with-profit holdings of corporate bonds is defined as the risk-free rate plus an assessment of the long-term spread over gilts, net of expected long-term defaults.
This approach is similar to that applied for equities and properties for which the projected earned rate is defined as the risk-free rate plus a long-term risk premium.
European Embedded Value Financial statements EEV basis results Notes on the EEV basis results Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 321 Allowance for non-diversifiable non-market risks The majority of non-market and non-credit risks are considered to be diversifiable.
Finance theory cannot be used to determine the appropriate component of beta for non-diversifiable non-market risks since there is no observable risk premium associated with it that is akin to the equity risk premium.
Recognising this, a pragmatic approach has been applied.
A base level allowance of 50 basis points is applied to cover the non-diversifiable non-market risks associated with the Groups businesses.
For the Groups US business and UK business other than shareholder-backed annuity, no additional allowance is necessary.
For UK shareholder-backed annuity business a further allowance of 50 basis points is used to reflect the longevity risk which is of particular relevance.
For the Groups Asia operations in China, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam, additional allowances are applied for emerging market risk ranging from 100 to 250 basis points.
iv  The proportion of surplus allocated to shareholders from the PAC with-profits fund has been based on the present level of 10 per cent.
The value attributed to the shareholders interest in the estate is derived by increasing final bonus rates and related shareholder transfers so as to exhaust the estate over the lifetime of the in-force with-profits business.
In any scenarios where the total assets of the life fund are insufficient to meet policyholder claims in full, the excess cost is fully attributed to shareholders.
Similar principles apply, where appropriate, for other with-profits funds of the Groups Asia operations.
v Debtcapital Core structural debt liabilities are carried at market value.
As the liabilities are generally held to maturity or for the long-term, no deferred tax asset or liability has been established on the difference, compared to the IFRS carrying value.
Accordingly, no deferred tax credit or charge is recorded in the results for the reporting period in respect of the mark to market value adjustment.
vi  Foreign currency profits and losses have been translated at average exchange rates for the year.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities have been translated at year end rates of exchange.
The principal exchange rates are shown in note A1 of the IFRS statements.
c  i  To the extent applicable, the presentation of the EEV profit for the year is consistent with the basis that the Group applies for analysis of IFRS basis profits before shareholder taxes between operating and non-operating results.
Operating results reflect the underlying results including longer-term investment returns which are determined as described in note 15 c ii below and incorporate the following: New business contribution, as defined in note 15 b i : Unwind of discount on the value of in-force business and other expected returns, as described in note 15 c iv below: The impact of routine changes of estimates relating to non-economic assumptions, as described in note 15 c iii below: and Non-economic experience variances, as described in note 15 c v below.
Non-operating results comprise the recurrent items of short-term fluctuations in investment returns, the mark to market value movements on core borrowings and the effect of changes in economic assumptions.
In addition, the 2013 operating profit excludes the loss attaching to the held for sale Japan life business and the costs associated with the domestication of the Hong Kong branch.
The 2012 operating profit excluded the gain arising on the acquisition of REALIC, the profit attaching to the Japan life business and the dilution of the Groups holding in PPM South Africa.
The amounts for these items are included in total EEV profit attributable to shareholders.
The Company believes that operating profit, as adjusted for these items, better reflects underlying performance.
Profit before tax and basic earnings per share include these items, together with actual investment returns.
Post-tax results The Group intends to alter its basis of presentation of EEV results for 2014 and subsequent reporting periods to a post-tax basis, in line with the approach adopted by a number of international insurance groups.
An analysis of the Groups profit and loss account and key accompanying notes on a pre-tax and post-tax basis for the most recent reporting periods are shown in the additional unaudited financial information section in note III c. ii Operatingprofit For the investment element of the assets covering the net worth of long-term insurance business, investment returns are recognised in operating results at the expected long-term rate of return.
These expected returns are calculated by reference to the asset mix of the portfolio.
For the purpose of calculating the longer-term investment return to be included in the operating result of the PAC with-profits fund of UK operations, where assets backing the liabilities and unallocated surplus are subject to market volatility, asset values at the beginning of the reporting period are adjusted to remove the effects of short-term market movements as explained in note 15 c iv below.
For the purpose of determining the long-term returns for debt securities of US operations for fixed annuity and other general account business, a risk margin charge is included which reflects the expected long-term rate of default based on the credit quality of the portfolio.
For Jackson, interest-related realised gains and losses are amortised to the operating results over the maturity period of the sold bonds and for equity-related investments, a long-term rate of return is assumed, which reflects the aggregation of end of year risk-free rates and equity risk premium.
For US variable annuity separate account business, operating profit includes the unwind of discount on the opening value of in-force adjusted to reflect end of year projected rates of return with the excess or deficit of the actual return recognised within non-operating profit, together with the related hedging activity.
322 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes on the EEV basis results Notes on the EEV basis results continued 15  For UK annuity business, rebalancing of the asset portfolio backing the liabilities to policyholders may, from time to time, take place to align it more closely with the internal benchmark of credit quality that management applies.
Such rebalancing will result in a change in the projected yield on the asset portfolio and the allowance for default risk.
The net effect of these changes is included in the result for the year.
iii  Operating profit includes the effect of changes to operating assumptions on the value of in-force at the end of the period.
For presentational purposes, the effect of change is delineated to show the effect on the opening value of in-force with the experience variance being determined by reference to the end of period assumptions.
iv  The unwind of discount and other expected returns is determined by reference to: The value of in-force business at the beginning of the period adjusted for the effect of current period economic and operating assumption changes : and Required capital and surplus assets.
In applying this general approach, the unwind of discount included in operating profit for the with-profits business of UK insurance operations is determined by reference to the opening value of in-force, as adjusted for the effects of short-term investment volatility due to market movements ie smoothed.
In the summary statement of financial position and for total profit reporting, asset values and investment returns are not smoothed.
At 31 December 2013 the shareholders interest in the smoothed surplus assets used for this purpose only were 136 million lower 31 December 2012: 121 million lower than the surplus assets carried in the statement of financial position.
v  Operating profits include the effect of experience variances on non-economic assumptions, which are calculated with reference to the embedded value assumptions at the end of the reporting year, such as persistency, mortality and morbidity, expenses and other factors.
vi Pensioncosts Profit before tax Movements on the shareholders share of surpluses to the extent not restricted by IFRIC 14 and deficits of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes adjusted for contributions paid in the year are recorded within Other Comprehensive Income.
Consistent with the basis of distribution of bonuses and the treatment of the estate described in notes 15 b i and iv, the shareholders share incorporates 10 per cent of the proportion of the financial position attributable to the PAC with-profits fund.
The financial position is determined by applying the requirements of IAS 19 as booked for IFRS reporting.
vii  Movements in the value of in-force business at the beginning of the period caused by changes in economic assumptions, net of the related change in the time value of cost of option and guarantees, are recorded in non-operating results.
viii Taxation The profit for the year for covered business is in most cases calculated initially at the post-tax level.
For 2013 and 2012 the post-tax profit for covered business is then grossed up for presentation purposes at the rates of tax applicable to the countries and periods concerned.
The overall tax rate includes the impact of tax effects determined on a local regulatory basis.
Tax payments and receipts included in the projected cash flows to determine the value of in-force business are calculated using rates that have been substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Current taxation and other legislation have been assumed to continue unaltered except where changes have been announced and substantively enacted in the year.
Additional detail of pre and post-tax EEV basis results are shown in the additional financial information.
ix  The EEV results for covered business incorporate annuities established in the PAC non-profit sub-fund from vesting pension polices in SAIF which is not covered business.
The EEV results also incorporate the effect of the reinsurance arrangement of non-profit immediate pension annuity liabilities of SAIF to PRIL.
In addition, the free surplus and value of in-force business are calculated after taking account of the impact of contingent loan arrangements between Group companies movements in the contingent loan liability are reflected via the projected cash flows in the value of in-force and the related funding is reflected in free surplus.
European Embedded Value Financial statements EEV basis results Notes on the EEV basis results Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 323 16 Assumptions  The tables below summarise the principal financial assumptions: Assumed investment returns reflect the expected future returns on the assets held and allocated to the covered business at the valuation date.
The changes in the risk discount rates for individual Asia territories reflect the movements in government bond yields, together with the effects of movements in the allowance for market risk and changes in product mix.
b For Hong Kong, the assumptions shown are for US dollar denominated business.
For other territories, the assumptions are for local currency denominated business.
c The mean equity return assumptions for the most significant equity holdings in the Asia operations were: 31Dec2013 % 31Dec2012 % Hong Kong 7.1 5.8 Malaysia 10.1 9.5 Singapore 8.6 7.4 d Equity risk premiums in Asia excluding those for the held for sale Japan life business range from 3.5 per cent to 8.7 per cent for 2013 2012: 3.5 per cent to 8.8 per cent.

Notes a The assumed new business spread margins represent the difference between the earned rate on investments, after allowance for long-term defaults, and the policy holder crediting rate.
The spread margins shown above are the rates at inception.
For fixed annuity business including the proportion of variable annuity business invested in the general account and fixed index annuity business, the assumed spread margin grades up linearly by 25 basis points to a long-term assumption over five years.
b The allowance for long-term defaults included in projected spread is shown as at the valuation date applied in the cash flow projections of the value of the in-force business.
The risk discount rates include an additional allowance for credit risk premium and short-term downgrades and defaults.
See note 15 b iii for further details.
c The weighted average risk discount rates reflect the mix of business between variable annuity and non-variable annuity business.
The increase in the weighted average risk discount rates from 2012 to 2013 primarily reflects the increase in the US 10-year Treasury bond rate of 130 basis points, partly offset by the effect of the decrease in additional allowance for credit risk.

b Credit spread treatment For Prudential Retirement Income Limited, which has approximately 90 per cent of UK shareholder-backed annuity business the credit assumptions used in the underlying MCEV calculation see note 15 b iii and the residual liquidity premium element of the bond spread over swap rates is as follows: Newbusiness bps In-forcebusiness bps 31Dec2013 31Dec2012 31Dec2013 31Dec2012 Bond spread over swap rates 127 150 133 161 Total credit risk allowance 36 35 62 65 Liquidity premium 91 115 71 96 The new business liquidity premium is based on the weighted average of the point of sale liquidity premia.
The overall allowance for credit risk is prudent by comparison with historic rates of default and would be sufficient to withstand a wide range of extreme credit events over the expected lifetime of the annuity business.
326 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes on the EEV basis results Notes on the EEV basis results continued 16 Assumptionscontinued  The economic assumptions used for the stochastic calculations are consistent with those used for the deterministic calculations described above.
Assumptions specific to the stochastic calculations, such as the volatilities of asset returns, reflect local market conditions and are based on a combination of actual market data, historic market data and an assessment of longer-term economic conditions.
Common principles have been adopted across the Group for the stochastic asset models, for example, separate modelling of individual asset classes but with allowance for correlation between the various asset classes.
Details are given below of the key characteristics and calibrations of each model.
iv Asiaoperations The same asset return models as described for UK insurance operations below, appropriately calibrated, have been used for Asia operations.
The principal asset classes are government and corporate bonds.
Equity holdings are much lower than in the UK whilst property holdings do not represent a significant investment asset: The stochastic cost of guarantees is primarily only of significance for the Hong Kong, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan operations: and The mean stochastic returns are consistent with the mean deterministic returns for each country.
The expected volatility of equity returns ranges from 18 per cent to 35 per cent in both years, and the volatility of government bond yields ranges from 0.9 per cent to 2.3 per cent in both years.
v USoperations Jackson Interest rates are projected using a log-normal generator calibrated to historical US Treasury yield curves: Corporate bond returns are based on Treasury securities plus a spread that has been calibrated to current market conditions and varies by credit quality: and Variable annuity equity returns and bond interest rates have been stochastically generated using a log-normal model with parameters determined by reference to historical data.
The volatility of equity fund returns ranges from 19 per cent to 32 per cent for both 2013 and 2012, depending on the risk class and the class of equity, and the standard deviation of interest rates ranges from 2.2 per cent to 2.5 per cent for both years.
vi  Interest rates are projected using a two-factor model calibrated to the initial market yield curve: The risk premium on equity assets is assumed to follow a log-normal distribution: The corporate bond return is calculated as the return on a zero-coupon bond plus a spread.
The spread process is a mean reverting stochastic process: and Property returns are modelled in a similar fashion to corporate bonds, namely as the return on a risk-free bond, plus a risk premium, plus a process representative of the change in residual values and the change in value of the call option on rents.
Mean returns have been derived as the annualised arithmetic average return across all simulations and durations.
For each projection year, standard deviations have been calculated by taking the square root of the annualised variance of the returns over all the simulations.
These have been averaged over all durations in the projection.
For equity and property, the standard deviations relate to the total return on these assets.
The amounts shown are not, and not intended to be, reflective of premium income recorded in the IFRS income statement.
ii New business in China is included at Prudentials 50 per cent interest in the China Life operation.
iii New business in India is included at Prudentials 26 per cent interest in the India Life operation.
328 Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes on the EEV basis results Notes on the EEV basis results continued 18   In July 2013 the Group agreed to sell, dependent on regulatory approval, its life insurance business in Japan which we closed to new business in 2010.
Also, in 2013 the Group has adopted new accounting standards on Joint arrangements IFRS 11 and amendments to Employee benefits IAS 19, from 1 January 2013.
Accordingly, the 2012 comparative EEV basis results have been retrospectively adjusted from those previously published for the application of the IFRS standards and for the reclassification of the result attributable to the held for sale Japan life business.
