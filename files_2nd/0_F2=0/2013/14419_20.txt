SOCO International plc 77 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 01 General information SOCO International plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act.
The address of the registered of ce is given on the inside back cover.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in Note 6 and in the Review of Operations and Financial Review on pages 18 to 23 and 24 to 26, respectively.
02 Signi cant accounting policies a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with, and comply with, International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have also been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting for the reasons set out in the Annual Report of the Directors on page 46 and in the Financial Review on page 26.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost basis, except for the valuation of hydrocarbon inventory and the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The financial statements are presented in US dollars as it is the functional currency of each of the Companys subsidiary undertakings and is generally accepted practice in the oil and gas sector.
The functional currency of the Company remains GB pounds although its financial statements are presented in US dollars to be consistent with the Group.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
b Adoption of new and revised accounting standards At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following IFRS, International Accounting Standards IAS, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the European Union : IFRS 1, 2, 3, 8, 13 as a result of the Annual Improvements 20102012 and 20112013 Cycles IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities IAS 16, 24, 38, 40 as a result of the Annual Improvements 20102012 and 20112013 Cycles IAS 19 amended Employee Bene ts fide ned Bene t Plans: Employee contributions IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures IAS 32 amended Financial Instruments Presentation: Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities IAS 36 amended Impairment of Assets Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets IAS 39 amended Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement: Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods, except potentially as follows: IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments IFRS 12 will impact the disclosure of interests the Group has in other entities.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review has been completed.
c Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the accounts of SOCO International plc and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to the balance sheet date.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain bene ts from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control passed.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method whereby the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired and the consideration given are recognised in the Group accounts at their fair values as at the date of the acquisition.
d Investments Except as stated below, non-current investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Liquid investments comprise short term liquid investments of between three to six months maturity.
SOCO International plc 78 A An nn nu ua al R l Re ep po or rt a t an nd A d Ac cc co ou un nt ts 2 s 20 01 13 3 St rategic Report Go vernance Financi al Statements Additional Information e Interests in joint ventures Jointly controlled entities are those entities for which the Group exercises joint control over the operating and financial policies.
These investments are dealt with by proportionate consolidation whereby the consolidated financial statements include the appropriate share of these companies assets, liabilities, income and expenses on a line by line basis.
Where a consolidated member of the Group participates in unincorporated joint ventures, that member accounts directly for its share of the jointly controlled assets, liabilities and related income and expenses which are then similarly included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
f Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets classi ed as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and no depreciation is charged from the point of reclassi cation.
Liabilities associated with such assets are also classi ed separately, within current liabilities.
g Revenue Revenue represents the fair value of the Groups share of oil and gas sold during the year on an entitlement basis.
To the extent revenue arises from test production during an evaluation programme, an amount is charged from evaluation costs to cost of sales so as to re ect a zero net margin.
Investment revenue is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
h Tangible and intangible non-current assets Oil and gas exploration, evaluation and development expenditure The Group uses a full cost based method of accounting for exploration, evaluation and development expenditure, whereby all expenditures incurred in connection with the acquisition, exploration, evaluation and development of oil and gas assets, including directly attributable overheads, interest payable and certain exchange differences if directly related to nancing development projects, are capitalised in separate geographical cost pools.
Cost pools are established on the basis of geographical area having regard to the operational and financial organisation of the Group.
Intangible acquisition, exploration and evaluation costs incurred in a geographical area where the Group has no established cost pool are initially capitalised as intangible non-current assets except where they fall outside the scope of IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources whereby they are expensed as incurred subject to other guidance under IFRS.
Tangible non-current assets used in acquisition, exploration and evaluation are classi ed with tangible non-current assets as property, plant and equipment.
To the extent that such tangible assets are consumed in exploration and evaluation the amount re ecting that consumption is recorded as part of the cost of the intangible asset.
Upon successful conclusion of the appraisal programme and determination that commercial reserves exist, such costs are transferred to tangible non-current assets as property, plant and equipment.
Exploration and evaluation costs carried forward are assessed for impairment as described below.
Proceeds from the disposal of oil and gas assets are credited against the relevant cost centre.
Any overall surplus arising in a cost centre is credited to the income statement.
Depreciation and depletion Depletion is provided on oil and gas assets in production using the unit of production method, based on proven and probable reserves, applied to the sum of the total capitalised exploration, evaluation and development costs, together with estimated future development costs at current prices.
Oil and gas assets which have a similar economic life are aggregated for depreciation purposes.
Impairment of value Where there has been a change in economic conditions or in the expected use of a tangible non-current asset that indicates a possible impairment in an asset, management tests the recoverability of the net book value of the asset by comparison with the estimated discounted future net cash ows based on managements expectations of future oil prices and future costs.
Any identi ed impairment is charged to the income statement.
Intangible non-current assets are considered for impairment at least annually by reference to the indicators in IFRS 6.
Where there is an indication of impairment of an exploration and evaluation asset which is within a geographic pool where the Group has tangible oil and gas assets with commercial reserves, the exploration asset is assessed for impairment together with all other cash generating units and related tangible and intangible assets in that geographic pool and any balance remaining after impairment is amortised over the proven and probable reserves of the pool.
Where the exploration asset is in an area where the Group has no established pool, the exploration asset is tested for impairment separately and, where determined to be impaired, is written off.
Other tangible non-current assets Other tangible non-current assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis at rates calculated to write off the cost of those assets, less residual value, over their expected useful lives of three to seven years.
Decommissioning The decommissioning provision is calculated as the net present value of the Groups share of the expenditure which is expected to be incurred at the end of the producing life of each eld in the removal and decommissioning of the production, storage and transportation facilities currently in place.
The cost of recognising the decommissioning provision is included as part of the cost of the relevant property, plant and equipment and is thus charged to the income statement on a unit of production basis in accordance with the Groups policy for depletion and depreciation of tangible non-current assets.
Period charges for changes in the net present value of the decommissioning provision arising from discounting are included in finance costs.
SOCO International plc 79 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 02 Signi cant accounting policies continued i Changes in estimates The effects of changes in estimates on the unit of production calculations are accounted for prospectively over the estimated remaining proven and probable reserves of each pool.
j Inventories Inventories, except for inventories of hydrocarbons, are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Physical inventories of hydrocarbons, which are held for trading purposes, are valued at net realisable value and recorded as inventory.
Underlifts and overlifts are valued at market value and are included in prepayments and accrued income and accruals and deferred income, respectively.
Changes in hydrocarbon inventories, underlifts and overlifts are adjusted through cost of sales.
k Leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Bene ts received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.
l Share-based payments Equity-settled awards under share-based incentive plans are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a straight line basis over the performance period along with a corresponding increase in equity.
Fair value is measured using an option pricing model taking into consideration managements best estimate of the expected life of the option and the estimated number of shares that will eventually vest.
m Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable pro t for the year.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that suf cient taxable pro ts will be available to recover the asset.
Deferred tax is not recognised where an asset or liability is acquired in a transaction which is not a business combination for an amount which differs from its tax value.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
n Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group does not currently utilise derivative financial instruments.
Other than the convertible bonds there are no material financial assets and liabilities for which differences between carrying amounts and fair values are required to be disclosed.
The classi cation of financial instruments as required by IFRS 7 is disclosed in Notes 18, 22, 23 and 24.
Financial asset at fair value through pro t or loss Where a financial instrument is classi ed as a financial asset at fair value through pro t or loss it is initially recognised at fair value.
At each balance sheet date the fair value is reviewed and any gain or loss arising is recognised in the income statement.
Changes in the net present value of the financial asset arising from discounting are included in other gains and losses.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Trade payables Trade payables are stated at their nominal value.
SOCO International plc 80 A An nn nu ua al R l Re ep po or rt a t an nd A d Ac cc co ou un nt ts 2 s 20 01 13 3 St rategic Report Go vernance Financi al Statements Additional Information Convertible bonds The net proceeds received from the issue of convertible bonds are split between a liability element and an equity component at the date of issue.
The fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bonds and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in equity and is not remeasured.
The liability component is carried at amortised cost.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds based on their relative carrying amounts at the date of issue.
The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt to the liability component of the instrument.
The difference between this amount and the interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the convertible bonds.
Upon redemption of convertible bonds, in accordance with their terms at inception, the carrying amount of the liability is adjusted through the income statement to match the redemption amount.
Where bonds are repurchased in the market, the repurchase cost is allocated between the repurchased liability and the repurchased embedded option to convert, using the same method described above.
The difference between the amount allocated to the liability and the carrying amount of the liability is recorded in the income statement, and the amount allocated to the repurchase of the embedded option to convert is debited to equity.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Equity instruments repurchased are deducted from equity at cost.
o Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are stated in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
Transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currency are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date, or if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
Any resulting gains and losses are included in net pro t or loss for the period.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements the results of entities denominated in currencies other than US dollars are translated at the average rate of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on retranslation at the closing rate of the opening net assets and results of entities denominated in currencies other than US dollars are dealt with through equity and transferred to the Groups retained earnings reserve.
p Pension costs The contributions payable in the year in respect of pension costs for fide ned contribution schemes and other post-retirement bene ts are charged to the income statement.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown either as accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
03 Financial risk management The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing financial risks that may affect the Group.
In certain cases the Board delegates responsibility for such reviews and policy setting to the Audit and Risk Committee.
The main financial risks affecting the Group are discussed in the Risk Management Report on pages 28 to 31.
SOCO International plc 81 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 04 Critical judgements and accounting estimates a Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies described in Note 2, management has made judgements that may have a signi cant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
These are discussed below: Oil and gas assets Note 2 h describes the judgements necessary to implement the Groups policy with respect to the carrying value of intangible exploration and evaluation assets and tangible property, plant and equipment.
Management considers these assets for impairment at least annually with reference to indicators in IFRS 6 and IAS 36, respectively.
Note 15 discloses the carrying value of intangible exploration and evaluation assets and Note 16 discloses the carrying value of property, plant and equipment.
Further, Note 2 h describes the Groups policy regarding reclassi cation of intangible assets to tangible assets.
Management considers the appropriateness of asset classi cation at least annually.
Financial asset Note 2 n describes the accounting policy with respect to financial assets at fair value through pro t or loss.
The key judgements that are used in calculating the fair value of the Groups financial asset arising on the disposal of its Mongolia interest are described in Note 18 and are reviewed at least annually.
The only market risk assumption that has a signi cant impact on the fair value of this asset is the discount rate, as described in the Risk Management Report on page 31. b Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, other than those mentioned above, that may have a signi cant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are discussed below: Oil and gas reserves Note 2 h sets out the Groups accounting policy on depreciation and depletion DD&A.
Proven and probable reserves are estimated using standard recognised evaluation techniques and are disclosed on page 100.
The estimate is reviewed at least twice a year and is regularly reviewed by independent consultants.
Future development costs are estimated taking into account the level of development required to produce the reserves by reference to operators, where applicable, and internal engineers.
As discussed in the Review of Operations on page 21, independent consultants RPS have been retained to provide an interim update of stock tank oil initially in place STOIIP and gas initially in place GIIP and recovery factors.
Management has prepared sensitivities based on the range of STOIIP GIIP and recovery factors estimated by RPS based on the information available to date, and have concluded that there would be no material impact on the results or position of the Group at 31 December 2013.
However, reserves estimates are inherently uncertain, especially in the early stages of a elds life, and are routinely revised over the producing lives of oil and gas elds as new information becomes available and as economic conditions evolve.
Such revisions may impact the Groups future financial position and results, in particular, in relation to DD&A and impairment testing of oil and gas property plant and equipment.
Decommissioning provision The accounting policy for decommissioning is discussed in Note 2 h. The cost of decommissioning is estimated by reference to operators, where applicable, and internal engineers.
Further details are provided in Note 25.

12 Option to sell majority interest in SOCO Cabinda Limited to non-controlling interest holder In September 2012, SOCO announced that it had entered into a conditional agreement the Disposal with Quill Trading Corporation Quill wherein SOCO will sell its 80% majority interest in SOCO Cabinda Limited SOCO Cabinda to Quill, which holds the remaining 20% interest.
SOCO Cabinda has a 17% participating interest in the Cabinda North Block, onshore the Angolan enclave of Cabinda.
Quill paid a non-refundable deposit to the Company for the option to acquire SOCOs entire shareholding in SOCO Cabinda.
Consequently, as at 31 December 2012 SOCO Cabinda was classi ed as held for sale.
Although discussions continued with Quill regarding the possible sale of SOCO`s majority interest, it was determined that there was no certainty that a transaction would occur.
Accordingly, SOCO Cabinda has been reclassi ed as an intangible asset.

Under the terms of the transaction the Group will receive a subsequent payment amount of up to $52.7 million, once cumulative production reaches 27.8 million barrels of oil, at the rate of 20% of the average monthly posted marker price for Daqing crude multiplied by the aggregate production for that month.
The subsequent payment amount is included in non-current assets as a financial asset at fair value through pro t or loss.
The timescale for the production of crude oil in excess of 27.8 million barrels and the price of Daqing marker crude oil are factors that cannot accurately be predicted.
However, based upon the Directors current estimates of proven and probable reserves from the Mongolia interests and the development scenarios as discussed with the buyer, the Directors believe that the full subsequent payment amount will be payable.
The fair value of the subsequent payment amount was determined using a valuation technique as there is no active market against which direct comparisons can be made Level 3 as fide ned in IFRS 7.
Assumptions made in calculating the fair value include the factors mentioned above, risked as appropriate, with the resultant cash ows discounted at a commercial risk free interest rate.
The fair value of the financial asset at the date of completion of the sale was $31.5 million.
As at 31 December 2013 the fair value was $43.4 million 2012 $42.1 million after accounting for the change in fair value see Note 7.

The weighted average market price and estimated fair value of the 2013 grants at grant date were 3.93 and 1.13, respectively.
The fair value of awards at date of grant has been estimated using a binomial option pricing model, based on the market price at date of grant set out above and a nil exercise price.
