The Group has made the restructuring provision for unavoidable costs which will be incurred due to its decisions to dispose of its insurance distribution business and to close its SIP business.
The provision is expected to unwind over 2 years.
The insurance provision is made in relation to the Groups Professional Indemnity, Motor and Employee Liability exposures.
The Group uses a captive insurer to reduce the cost of providing this cover for its operations: claims that are in excess of the Captives liability are reinsured with a number of large insurance underwriters.
The Group makes provision when a claim has been made where it is more probable than not that an insured loss will occur.
These provisions are reassessed regularly to ensure that the level of provisioning is consistent with the claims that have been reported.
In the year the Group has settled a number of insurance liabilities which it had provided for in previous years.
Additionally, it has made provision for new claims and increased or decreased existing provisions where more information on the progress of the claim has become available.
Within the property provisions there is included a discounted provision for the difference between the market value of the property leases acquired in 2011 with Ventura and Vertex Private Sector and the lease obligations committed to at the date the leases were signed by the previous owners.
This is in accordance with IFRS 3 revised which requires the use of fair value measurement.
The remaining property provision is made on a discounted basis for the future rent expense and related cost of leasehold property net of estimated sub-lease income where the space is vacant or currently not planned to be used for ongoing operations.
The expectation is that this expenditure will be incurred over the remaining periods of the leases which range from 1 to 25 years.
Included in other provisions at 1 January 2013 was an onerous contract in relation to the ALS courts interpretation contract, recognised through the fair value exercise on acquisition.
During the year through restructuring the delivery methodologies, the contract became profitable for the first time and is expected to remain profitable through to the end of the contract.
As a result, the remaining unutilised provision of 3.8m was released to the income statement in the year.
Other relates to provisions in respect of potential claims arising due to the nature of some of the operations that the Group provides and a provision for an onerous contract in relation to contracts acquired with the Reliance Secure Task Management acquisition.
These are likely to unwind over a period of 1 to 3 years.
