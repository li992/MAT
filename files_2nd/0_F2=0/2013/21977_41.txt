Taxation continued Unrecognised tax losses and other temporary differences At 31 March 2013, the group had operating losses, capital losses and other temporary differences carried forward in respect of which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to 22.0bn 2011 12: 21.8bn.
The groups capital losses and other temporary differences have no expiry date restrictions.
The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the tax law of the various territories in which the losses arose.
A summary of expiry dates for losses in respect of which restrictions apply is set out below: 2013 At 31 March m Expiry of losses Restricted losses Europe 464 2014 27 Americas 102 2014 32 Other 1 2014 22 Total restricted losses 567 Unrestricted losses Operating losses 3,640 No expiry Capital losses 17,214 No expiry Total unrestricted losses 20,854 Other temporary differences 543 Total 21,964 At 31 March 2013, the undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries were 11.1bn 2011 12: 10.8bn.
No deferred tax liabilities have been recognised in respect of these unremitted earnings because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
