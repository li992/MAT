Intangible assets Intangible assets consist of goodwill on acquisitions of $62.0m, purchased syndicate capacity of $10.7m, US admitted licences of $9.3m and capitalised expenditure on IT projects of $9.6m.
During the year renewal rights in relation to specific business within the specialty lines and life, accident and health divisions have been fully impaired by $11.5m: therefore at 31 December 2013 there is no carrying value remaining in respect of renewal rights within intangible assets.
In addition, amortisation on IT development costs and renewal rights has contributed to the reduction in the groups intangible assets.
Reinsurance assets Reinsurance assets represent recoveries from reinsurers in respect of incurred claims of $978.4m, and the unearned reinsurance premiums reserve of $199.8m.
The reinsurance receivables from reinsurers are split between recoveries on claims paid or notified of $253.7m and an actuarial estimate of recoveries on claims that have not yet been reported of $724.7m.
The groups exposure to reinsurers is managed through: minimising risk through selection of reinsurers who meet strict financial criteria e. g. minimum net assets, minimum A rating by S&P.
These criteria vary by type of business short vs medium-tail.
The chart on page 41 shows the profile of these assets based on their S&P rating at the end of 2013: timely calculation and issuance of reinsurance collection notes from our ceded reinsurance team: and regular monitoring of the outstanding debtor position by our reinsurance security committee and credit control committee.
We continue to provide against impairment of reinsurance recoveries, and at the end of 2013 our provision had reduced to $14.5m 2012: $18.0m in respect of reinsurance recoveries, following a partial recovery during the year in relation to Lehman Re.

We continue to outsource the collection of our Lloyds broker premium balances to Randall and Quilter Investment Holdings plc, which operates within the Lloyds market as a specialist credit controller.
Other assets Other assets are analysed separately in the notes to the accounts.
The largest items included comprise: financial assets at fair value of $4,043.6m: cash and cash equivalents of $382.7m: deferred acquisition costs of $206.0m: profit commissions of $11.5m and other balances of $17.0m receivable from syndicate 623: and deferred tax assets available for use against future taxes payable of $8.7m.
Insurance liabilities Insurance liabilities of $4,577.3m consist of two main elements, being the unearned premium reserve UPR and gross insurance claims liabilities.
Our UPR has increased by 7% to $956.8m.
The majority of the UPR balance relates to current year premiums that have been deferred and will be earned in future periods.
Current indicators are that this business is profitable.
Gross insurance claims reserves are made up of claims which have been notified to us but not yet paid and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported IBNR.
These are estimated as part of the quarterly reserving process involving the underwriters and group actuary.
Gross insurance claims reserves have increased by 1% to $3,620.5m.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities comprise borrowings and derivative financial liabilities.
The group utilises three long-term debt facilities: in 2006 we raised 150m of lower tier 2 unsecured fixed rate debt that is payable in 2026 and callable in 2016.
The initial interest rate payable is 7.25% and the nominal value of this debt as at 31 December 2013 is 76.5m 2012: 103m : a US$18m subordinated debt facility raised in 2004.
This loan is also unsecured and interest is payable at the USD London interbank offered rate LIBOR plus 3.65%.
These subordinated notes are due in 2034 and have been callable at the groups option since 2009: and during September 2012 we issued a sterling denominated 5.375% retail bond under a 250m euro medium term note programme which raised 75m for the group and is due in 2019.
This diversified the source and maturity profile of the groups debt financing.
A syndicated short-term banking facility led by Lloyds Banking Group Plc provides potential borrowings up to $225m.
Under the facility $225m may be drawn as letters of credit to support underwriting at Lloyds.
Of this, $175m may be advanced as cash under a revolving facility.
The cost of the facility is based on a commitment fee of 0.6% per annum and any amounts drawn are charged at a margin of 1.75% per annum.
The cash element of the facility will last for three years, expiring on 31 December 2016, whilst letters of credit issued under the facility can be used to provide support for the 2013, 2014 and 2015 underwriting years.
The facility is currently unutilised.
com Beazley 41 Annual report 2013 Financial review Capital structure Capital structure Beazley has a number of requirements for capital at a group and subsidiary level.
Capital is primarily required to support underwriting at Lloyds and in the US and is subject to prudential regulation by local regulators PRA, FCA, Lloyds, Central Bank of Ireland, and the US state level supervisors.
Beazley is subject to the capital adequacy requirements of the European Union EU Insurance Groups Directive IGD.
We comply with all IGD requirements.
Further capital requirements come from rating agencies who provide ratings for Beazley Insurance Company Inc. We aim to manage our capital levels to obtain the ratings necessary to trade with our preferred client base.
Beazley holds a level of capital over and above its regulatory requirements.
The amount of surplus capital held is considered on an ongoing basis in light of the current regulatory framework, opportunities for organic or acquisitive growth and a desire to maximise returns for investors.
The group actively seeks to manage its capital structure and continued to reduce its cost of debt in 2013.
Our preferred use of capital is to deploy it on opportunities to underwrite profitably.
However there may be times in the cycle when the group will generate excess capital and not have the opportunity to deploy it.
At such points in time the board will consider returning capital to shareholders.
In 2013 Beazley acquired 5.0m of its own shares.
These were acquired at an average price of 230p and the cost to the group was $17.7m.
Our funding comes from a mixture of our own equity of $1,338.7m alongside 76.5m of tier 2 subordinated debt, $18.0m subordinated long-term debt, a 75m retail bond and an undrawn banking facility of $225.0m as detailed on page 160.
The following table sets out the groups sources and uses of capital: 2013 2012 $m $m Sources of funds Shareholders funds 1,338.7 1,204.5 Tier 2 subordinated debt 127.0 166.3 Retail bond 124.5 122.3 Long-term subordinated debt 18.0 18.0 1,608.2 1,511.1 Uses of funds Lloyds underwriting 935.4 876.0 Capital for US insurance company 107.7 107.7 1,043.1 983.7 Surplus 565.1 527.4 Unavailable surplus 150.8 145.0 Fixed and intangible assets 97.6 122.1 Available surplus 316.7 260.3 Unutilised banking facility 225.0 225.0 U navailable surplus primarily represents profits earned that have not yet been transferred from the Lloyds syndicates.
The cash transfers occur half-yearly in arrears and are reflected as unavailable until the cash is received into Beazley corporate accounts.
In addition certain items other than fixed and intangible assets such as deferred tax assets are not immediately realisable as cash and have also accordingly been reflected as unavailable surplus.
com Annual report 2013 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Individual capital assessment The group is required to produce an individual capital assessment ICA which sets out the amount of capital that is required to reflect the risks contained within the business.
Lloyds reviews this assessment to ensure that ICAs are consistent across the market.
The current capital assessment has been established using our Solvency II internal model which has been run within the ICA regime as prescribed by Lloyds.
In order to determine the capital assessment, we have made significant investments in both models and process: we use sophisticated mathematical models that reflect the key risks in the business allowing for probability of occurrence, impact if they do occur, and interaction between risk types.
A key focus of these models is to understand the risk posed to individual teams, and to the business as a whole, of a possible deterioration in the underwriting cycle: and the internal model process is embedded so that teams can see the direct and objective link between underwriting decisions and the capital allocated to that team.
This gives a consistent and comprehensive picture of the risk reward profile of the business and allows teams to focus on strategies that improve return on capital.
The increase in our funds at Lloyds from 558.0m to 563.0m is in proportion to the increase in business planned and the changes in the economic conditions.
These numbers are presented in the table on page 42 in US dollars, being $935.4m and $876.0m for 2014 and 2013 respectively, which have been translated at the spot exchange rate at reporting dates.
Solvency II Beazley has set two guiding principles for Solvency II, namely: to develop a framework that can be used to inform management and assist with business decision making: and to hold an appropriate and efficient level of capital for the agreed risk appetite through risk identification and mitigation.
During 2013, Beazley has continued to embed the principles of Solvency II and the use of our internal model in our business.
As well as providing the basis for Lloyds capital setting, our internal model is used extensively to inform risk management, capital allocation and decision making both on a routine and an ad hoc basis.
In December, Lloyds confirmed that it assesses us as continuing to meet the principles of Solvency II as currently drafted.
The Solvency II programme continues to oversee the development of our capability and engagement with regulators as they complete their assessment of our model and our overall readiness for Solvency II.
The Central Bank of Ireland has continued to progress its pre-application review of our model which will be used for both individual and group capital setting purposes.
Following the provisional agreement which has been reached between the European Parliament, the European Commission and European Council on the Omnibus II Directive, we now look forward with a greater degree of certainty to the recently revised implementation date for Solvency II of 1 January 2016.
The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authoritys guidelines for the preparation of Solvency II provide for a lead in to implementation over the next two years.
The work which we have already done in our programme to date leaves us well placed to respond to this final phase of Solvency II preparation.
