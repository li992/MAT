As the direct method of presentation has been adopted for these activities, no further disclosure is required.
In respect of financing activities, the following items pass through the Companys own bank accounts.
2013 2012 m m Cash flows from investing activities Purchase of Financial investments 294 Net cash used in investing activities 294 Cash flows from financing activities Funding provided by subsidiaries 1,283 887 New borrowings, net of expenses 2,137 2,200 Repayment of borrowings 2,179 2,295 Net repayment of borrowings 42 95 Proceeds from issue of fixed rate tier 1 notes, net of expenses 392 Preference dividends paid 17 17 Ordinary dividends paid 429 630 Interest paid on direct capital instruments and fixed rate tier 1 notes 92 73 Interest paid on borrowings 328 310 Treasury shares purchased for employee trusts 25 25 Shares issued under equity compensation plans 1 Net cash from financing activities 350 130 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 56 130 Cash and cash equivalents at 1 January 152 17 Exchange gains on cash and cash equivalents 15 5 Cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 223 152 Where applicable, the accounting policies of the Company are the same as those of the Group on pages 110 to 123.
242 Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2013 Notes to the Companys financial statements A Investments in subsidiaries i Movements in the Companys investments in its subsidiaries are as follows: 2013 2012 m m Fair value as at 1 January 31,023 28,889 Movement in fair value 2,072 2,134 At 31 December 33,095 31,023 Fair values are estimated using applicable valuation models underpinned by the Companys market capitalisation, and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described in note 23 to the Group consolidated financial statements.
ii At 31 December 2013, the Company has two wholly owned subsidiaries, both incorporated in the UK.
These are General Accident plc and Aviva Group Holdings Limited.
Aviva Group Holdings Limited is an intermediate holding company, whilst General Accident plc has preference shares listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The principal subsidiaries of the Aviva Group at 31 December 2013 are described in note 62 to the Group consolidated financial statements.
B Operating expenses i Operating expenses Operating expenses comprise: 2013 2012 m m Staff costs and other employee-related expenditure see below 194 208 Other operating costs 156 96 Net foreign exchange gains losses 24 29 Total 326 333 ii Staff costs Total staff costs were: 2013 2012 m m Wages and salaries 84 143 Social security costs 8 12 Post-retirement obligations Defined benefit schemes see iii below 1 Defined contribution schemes 11 12 Profit sharing and incentive plans 2 Equity compensation plans see iv below 11 32 Termination benefits 80 10 Total 194 208 iii Pension costs The Company is one of a number of UK companies being charged for its employees participating in the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme, and its contributions are affected by the financial position of the scheme.
There is no contractual agreement or policy for charging the net defined benefit cost for this scheme across the participating Group entities but, instead, this cost is recognised in the financial statements of the main UK employing company.
The Company therefore recognises a pension expense equal to its contributions payable in the year for its staff, together with the service cost of any unfunded benefits, within staff costs above.
Full disclosure on the Groups pension schemes is given in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 49. iv Equity compensation plans All transactions in the Groups equity compensation plans involve options and awards for ordinary shares of the Company.
Full disclosure of these plans is given in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 32.
The cost of such options and awards is borne by all participating businesses and, where relevant, the Company bears an appropriate charge.
As the majority of the charge to the Company relates to directors options and awards, for which full disclosure is made in the Directors Remuneration Report, no further disclosure is given here on the grounds of immateriality.
v Termination benefits The 80 million of termination benefits recognised during 2013 relate to costs borne by the Company as part of the Groups transformation programme, which is referred to in note 7 of the Group consolidated financial statements.
Strategic report Governance IFRS Financial statements Other information 243 Aviva plc Notes to the Companys financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 C Tax i Tax credited charged to the income statement The total tax credit comprises: 2013 2012 m m Current tax For this year 84 46 Prior year adjustments 7 6 Total current tax 91 52 Deferred tax Origination and reversal of temporary differences 49 180 Changes in tax rates or tax laws 24 Total deferred tax 25 180 Total tax credited to income statement 116 232 ii Tax charged to other comprehensive income No tax was charged or credited to other comprehensive income in 2013 or 2012. iii Tax credited to equity Tax credited to equity comprises 22 million 2012: 18 million in respect of coupon payments on the direct capital instruments and fixed rate tier 1 notes.
iv Tax reconciliation The tax on the Companys profit before tax differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the tax rate of the home country of the Company as follows: 2013 2012 m m Profit before tax 486 384 Tax calculated at standard UK corporation tax rate of 23.25% 2012: 24.5% 113 94 Adjustment to tax credit in respect of prior years 7 6 Non-assessable dividends 337 388 Disallowable expenses 13 76 Non-taxable loss on settlement of intra-group loan 17 Movement in deferred tax not recognised 118 Change in future local statutory tax rate 32 4 Losses surrendered intra-group for nil value 53 106 Total tax credited to income statement 116 232 The UK corporation tax rate reduced to 23% from 1 April 2013.
Legislation was substantively enacted in July 2013 to reduce the main rate of UK corporation tax to 21% from 1 April 2014, with a further reduction to 20% from 1 April 2015.
The 20% rate has been used in the calculation of the Companys deferred tax as at 31 December 2013. v Deferred tax A deferred tax asset of 205 million, arising in respect of deferred interest, has been recognised in the Company at 31 December 2013 at 20% 2012: 180 million.
The Company has unrecognised temporary differences of 54 million 2012: 50 million to carry forward indefinitely against future taxable income.
vi Current tax assets Current tax assets recoverable in more than one year are 93 million 2012: 50 million.
D Other assets Included in other assets are financial investments of 297 million 2012: nil made up of UK Government Bonds which are due to expire during 2014.
These financial investments are valued as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy described in note 23 to the Group consolidated financial statements and are classified as other than trading as described in note 27.

Annual interest payments for these borrowings are 73 million 2012: 72 million.
The fair value of the subordinated debt at 31 December 2013 was 4,707 million 2012: 4,435 million, calculated with reference to quoted prices.
The fair value of the 9.5% guaranteed bonds 2016 at 31 December 2013 was 236 million 2012: 246 million, calculated with reference to quoted prices.
The fair value of the commercial paper is considered to be the same as its carrying value.
On 28 February 2014, the Company notified the respective holders of the 200 million subordinated notes due 2019 and the 50 million subordinated notes due 2019 that it would redeem each of the notes on their respective first call dates in April 2014.
Further details of these borrowings and undrawn committed facilities can be found in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 50, with details of the fair value hierarchy in relation to these borrowings in note 23.
G Contingent liabilities Details of the Companys contingent liabilities are given in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 53.
Strategic report Governance IFRS Financial statements Other information 245 Aviva plc Notes to the Companys financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 H Risk management Risk management in the context of the Group is considered in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 58.
The business of the Company is managing its investments in subsidiary and joint venture operations.
Its risks are considered to be the same as those in the operations themselves and full details of the major risks and the Groups approach to managing these are given in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 58.
Such investments are held by the Company at fair value in accordance with accounting policy D. The fair values of the subsidiaries and joint venture are estimated using applicable valuation models, underpinned by the Companys market capitalisation.
This uses the Companys closing share price at year end.
Given that the key input into the valuation model is based on an observable current share price, and therefore sensitive to movements in that price, the valuation process is not sensitive to non-observable market assumptions.
Financial assets, other than investments in subsidiaries and the joint venture, largely consist of amounts due from subsidiaries.
As at the balance sheet date, these receivable amounts were neither past due nor impaired.
Financial liabilities owed by the Company as at the balance sheet date are largely in respect of borrowings details of which are provided in note F and the Group consolidated financial statements, note 50 and loans owed to subsidiaries.
Loans owed to subsidiaries were within agreed credit terms as at the balance sheet date.
Interest rate risk Loans to and from subsidiaries are at either fixed or floating rates of interest, with the latter being exposed to fluctuations in these rates.
The choice of rates is designed to match the characteristics of financial investments which are also exposed to interest rate fluctuations held in both the Company and the relevant subsidiary, to mitigate as far as possible each companys net exposure.
All the Companys long term external borrowings are at fixed rates of interest and are therefore not exposed to changes in these rates.
However, for short term commercial paper, the Company is affected by changes in these rates to the extent the redemption of these borrowings is funded by the issuance of new commercial paper or other borrowings.
Further details of the Companys borrowings are provided in note F and the Group consolidated financial statements, note 50.
The effect of a 100 basis point increase decrease in interest rates would be a decrease increase in profit before tax of 109 million 2012: decrease increase of 111 million.
The net asset value of the Companys financial resources is not materially affected by fluctuations in interest rates.
Currency risk The Companys direct subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates during the course of providing insurance and asset management services around the world.
The exposure of the subsidiaries to currency risk is considered from a Group perspective in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 58.
The Company faces exposure to foreign currency risk through some of its borrowings which are denominated in Euros.
However, most of these borrowings have been on-lent to a subsidiary which holds investments in Euros, generating the net investment hedge described in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 59 a iii.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to make payments as they become due because there are insufficient assets in cash form.
The Companys main sources of liquidity are liquid assets held within the Company and its subsidiary Aviva Group Holdings Limited AGH, and dividends received from the Groups insurance and asset management businesses.
Sources of liquidity in normal markets also includes a variety of short and long-term instruments including commercial papers and medium and long-term debt.
In addition to the existing liquid resources and expected inflows, the Company maintains significant undrawn committed borrowing facilities 1.5 billion from a range of leading international banks to further mitigate this risk.
Maturity analysis of external borrowings and amounts due to and by subsidiaries are provided in notes F and I respectively.
246 Aviva plc Notes to the Companys financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 I Related party transactions The Company receives dividend and interest income from subsidiaries and pays interest and fee expense to those subsidiaries in the normal course of business.
