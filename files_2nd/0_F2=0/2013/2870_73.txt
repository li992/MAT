The non-significant CGUs included within the balance do not individually exceed 5% of the Groups total goodwill balance.
The number of CGUs identified for 2013 has increased due to acquisitions.
The recoverable amount of the CGUs is based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections based on the latest 1-year budget forecast approved by senior management, extrapolated for 4 future years at a growth rate applicable to each unit: an appropriate terminal value is then added.
Pre-tax discount rates, derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital are then applied to these projections.
Strategic report Governance Accounts Capita plc | 113 15 Goodwill continued The key assumptions used in the impairment testing are as follows: profit before interest and taxation year 1 pre-tax discount rates rate of growth in CGUs beyond the budget period years 2 to 5 long term growth 5 years.
Profit before interest and taxation The profit before interest and taxation is based on the assumption that future margins will remain in line with levels currently being achieved.
Non-cash items have been added back where appropriate to the profit before interest and taxation in order to determine the cash flow for the CGU.
Discount rate The Groups post-tax-weighted average cost of capital of 7.7% 2012: 7.0% has been used to derive a Group pre-tax discount rate.
The Group pre-tax rate is adjusted where appropriate to reflect the risks specific to the market in which the CGUs are operating.
The cost of capital and cost of debt has been calculated for each CGU with the expected rate of return for debt and equity constant for all CGUs.
Rates of growth in cash generating units beyond the budget period years 2 to 5 The growth rate assumptions used in each CGU for years 2 to 5 are based on projections provided by third party market research for the relevant market.
Projections have been reviewed by senior management.
Long term growth rates 5 years A terminal value based on a perpetuity calculation using third party market average growth has been added to the projected 5-year cash flows.
The base rates have been disclosed below: Third party market growth rates years 2-5 Pre-tax WACC Insurance Services 4.3% 10.4% Life & Pensions Services 5.5% 10.0% Local Government & Further Education Software 6.5% 10.2% IT & Software Services 2.2% 10.1% Secure Information Solutions 4.6% 10.0% Health & Wellbeing 7.1% 9.5% Property Services 1.3% 11.1% Workforce Services 4.8% 9.4% Non-significant CGUs Range 1.3% 6.5% Range 7.9% 11.5% Sensitivity analysis Impairment testing is dependent on managements estimates and judgements, in particular in relation to the forecasting of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to those cash flows.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed for these key assumptions.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed by risk adjusting the discount rate calculated for each CGU, adjusting growth rates and lowering expected margins.
Based on the sensitivity analysis performed a combined 1% reduction in growth rates and future margins and a 1% increase in the discount rate does not cause an impairment of the associated goodwill in any CGU.
The recoverable amount of Insurance Services continues to be the most sensitive to a change in the key assumptions.
The overall level of projected cash flows would need to reduce by 33% to cause an impairment of the associated goodwill.
Management will continue to closely monitor this CGU.
Overall, management has concluded that no reasonable possible change in the key assumptions discussed above would cause any of the goodwill within the identified significant CGUs to become impaired.
