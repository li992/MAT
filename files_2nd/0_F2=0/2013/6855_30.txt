FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the company accounts For the 52 weeks ended 28 April 2013 34 Accounting policies Basis of accounting and presentation The accounts are prepared on a going-concern basis, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable accounting and financial reporting standards in the United Kingdom UK GAAP.
They are prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of derivatives, where the company uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate borrowings.
Changes in accounting policy The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost less impairment and held as fixed assets on the balance sheet.
The carrying value of investments is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more tax, with the following exceptions: provision is made for tax on gains arising from the revaluation and similar fair value adjustments of fixed assets, and gains on disposal of fixed assets that have rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned.
However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, itis more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold: and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing difference can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Financial instruments Financial instruments are recognised when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are fide-recognised when the company no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, normally through sale or when all cash flows attributable to the instrument are passed to an independent third party.
The company is exempt, in accordance with FRS 29.2D, from producing disclosure required by the standard as the group accounts contain disclosure that complies with FRS 29 IFRS 7.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The company uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate borrowings.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value, if any, and carried on the balance sheet as an asset or liability.
Subsequent measurement is at fair value determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
If a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting the gain or loss arising on the movement in fair value is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Hedge accounting To qualify for hedge accounting the hedge relationship must be designated and documented at inception.
Documentation must include the companys risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and formal allocation to the item or transaction being hedged.
The company also documents how it will assess the effectiveness of the hedge and carries out assessments on a regular basis to determine whether it has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly effective.
Hedges can be classified as either fair value hedging exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability, or cash flow hedging the variability in cash flows attributable to an asset, liability, or forecast transaction.
The company uses its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.
For these cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the profit and loss account when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are then transferred to the profit and loss account as above.
If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to profit and loss.
Own shares Own shares consist of treasury shares and shares held within an employee benefit trust.
The company has an employee benefit trust forthegranting of shares to applicable employees.
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from equity shareholders funds.
Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds and the original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
Nogain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on transactions in treasury shares.

co. uk 34 Accounting policies continued Share-based payments Certain employees and directors of subsidiary companies receive equity-settled remuneration, whereby they render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
The fair value of the shares and options granted is measured using a Black-Scholes model, at the date at which they were granted.
No account is taken in the fair value calculation of any vesting conditions service and performance, other than market conditions performance linked to the price of the shares of the company.
Any other conditions that are required to be met in order for an employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered non-vesting conditions.
Like market performance, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining the grant date fair value.
The fair value of shares and options granted is recognised as an increase inthe companys investments in its subsidiaries with a corresponding increase in equity spread over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled ending on the relevant vesting date.
The cumulative amount recognised as an investment reflects the extent towhich the vesting period has expired, adjusted for the estimated number of shares and options that are ultimately expected to vest.
In accordance with the exemption within FRS 20 no amount is recorded in respect of grants made under the above schemes prior to7November 2002 which had not vested by the date of implementation of FRS 20.

HMRC have appealed against the ruling and last year the case was referred from the European Court of Justice back to UK courts.
We are awaiting their final decision.
If HMRCs appeal is upheld the refund of 6.1m and associated interest of 0.9m would become repayable.
