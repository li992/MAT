Waste data is gathered for all properties in the GRIP Fund portfolio where Grainger has waste management contracts in place, excluding Bethnal Green and West Tenter Street where it was not possible to convert the available waste data into weight.
Waste weight in metric tonnes is calculated from bin volume in litres using the WRAP waste conversion factor 20 03 01 for mixed municipal waste, rather than actual weight measurements at each property.
Proportion of waste by disposal route is based on statistics foreach applicable waste management contractor as a whole and is not specific to Grainger properties.
Own occupied offices Waste data was not gathered for our German office.
Our Martlesham office closed in 2013 and was excluded.
Our Birmingham office relocated during the financial year and waste data was estimated for the year based on actual waste data collected at the new office occupied since February 2013.
Annual figures are estimated from an audit of actual waste weight produced by each office on two separate days during the financial year.
Total weight was calculated for the 255 working days per year, excluding bank holidays and weekends.
