FINANCIAL RISk MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICY The Group has identified exposure to the following financial risks: Market risk Credit risk Liquidity risk Capital risk The policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are summarised below: A MARkET RISk Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions will affect the Groups interest rates.
Borrowings at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and borrowings.
The Group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps and caps to generate the desired interest and risk profile.
At 31 March 2013 79% 2012: 77% of Group borrowings were fixed through the use of interest rate swaps.
All transactions entered into are approved by the Board and are in accordance with the Groups treasury policy.
The Board also monitors variances on interest rates to budget and forecast rates to ensure that the risk relating to interest rates is being sufficiently safeguarded against.
Based upon year end variable rate loan balances, a reasonably possible interest rate movement of -0.5% would have increased or decreased net interest payable and equity by 0.4m 2012: 0.4m.
80 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Review of operations 01-26 Governance 27-61 Financial statements 62-95 Shareholder information 96-100 B CREDIT RISk The Groups main financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks and financial institutions and trade and other receivables.
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a tenant or a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Groups exposure to this risk principally relates to the receivables from tenants, deferred consideration on the sale of investment property and cash and cash equivalent balances held with counterparties.
The Groups exposure to credit risk in relation to receivables from tenants is influenced mainly by the characteristics of individual tenants occupying its rental properties.
The Group has approximately 4,000 tenants over approximately 100 properties.
The largest 10 single tenants generate around 6% of net rent roll.
As such, the credit risk attributable to individual tenants is low.
The Groups credit risk in relation to tenants is further managed by requiring that tenants provide a deposit equivalent to three months rent on inception of lease as security against default.
Total tenant deposits held are 10.4m 2012: 10.0m.
The Group monitors aged debt balances and any potential bad debts every week, the information being reported to the Executive Committee every month as part of the performance monitoring process.
The Groups debtor recovery is consistently high and as such is deemed a low risk area.
Deferred consideration on the sale of investment property is contractual and valued regularly by the external valuer based on current and future market factors.
Cash and cash equivalents and financial derivatives are held with major UK high street banks or building societies and strict counterparty limits are operated on deposits.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: 2013 2012 m m Cash and cash equivalents note 14 11.8 26.5 Trade receivables current note 13 2.4 2.5 Deferred consideration current note 13 1.4 Deferred consideration non current note 13 6.1 4.6 21.7 33.6 C LIQUIDITY RISk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure it will always have sufficient funds to meet obligations as they fall due.
This is performed via a variety of methods including daily cash flow review and forecasting, monthly monitoring of the maturity profile of debt and the regular revision of borrowing facilities in relation to the Groups requirements and strategy.
To ensure it can effectively manage its liquidity risk, the Group has an overdraft facility of 4m, a revolving loan facility of 55m and term loans.
At 31 March 2013 headroom excluding overdraft was 45m 31 March 2012: 55m.
Cash flow is monitored formally on a monthly basis as part of internal performance monitoring with regular daily monitoring and forecasting undertaken to manage day-to-day cash flows and any balances which are ring-fenced by lenders.
The Board reviews compliance with loan covenants which include agreed interest cover and loan to value ratios, alongside review of available headroom on loan facilities.

Equity comprises issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Debt comprises drawings against revolving and term loan facilities from banks, the Retail Bond less cash at bank and in hand.
At 31 March 2013 Group equity was 500.4m 2012: 435.4m, and Group net borrowings debt less cash at bank and in hand were 327.6m 2012: 312.8m.
Actions taken in the last few years in relation to borrowings and capital raising have enabled the Group to have sufficient headroom on financing and to ensure it is comfortably within all applicable loan to value covenants applied on borrowings which range between 65% to 75%.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Group operates a number of share schemes: I LONG TERM EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN LTIP The LTIP scheme is a performance award scheme whereby shares are issued against three Group performance measures which are assessed over the three year vesting period.
These are: Absolute TSR Relative TSR Relative nAV The shares are issued at nil consideration provided the performance conditions are met.
Under the 2012 LTIP scheme 886,774 performance and matching shares were awarded in June 2012 and 276,642 in november 2012 to Directors and senior management 2011 LTIP scheme: 953,009.
Details of the movements for the LTIP scheme during the year were as follows: LTIP number At 1 April 2011 6,127,951 Granted 953,009 Lapsed 3,216,493 At 31 March 2012 3,864,467 Granted 1,163,416 Exercised 515,866 Lapsed 875,177 At 31 March 2013 3,636,840 The weighted average share price at the date of exercise of shares exercised during the year was 2.48 2012: no exercises.
A binomial model was used to determine the fair value of the LTIP grant for the Absolute TSR and Relative TSR elements of the LTIP scheme.
Assumptions used in the model were as follows: 2013 2013 Nov 2012 June 2012 2012 Share price at grant 306p 227p 270p Exercise price pence Nil Nil nil Average expected life years 3 3 3 Risk free rate 0.5% 0.5% 2% Expected dividend yield 4% 4% 4% Average share price volatility 41% 41% 55% Fair value per option Absolute TSR element 249p 125p 177p Fair value per option Relative TSR element 172p 128p 183p The relative nAV is a non-market based condition and the intrinsic value is therefore the share price at date of grant of 229p 18 June 2012 and 305p 19 november 2012.
At each balance sheet date, the Directors assess the likelihood of meeting the conditions under this element of the scheme.
The impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The assessment at year end was that up to 50% of the relative nAV element will vest.
Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 85 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 24.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued The expected Workspace share price volatility was determined by taking account of the daily share price movement over a three year period.
The respective FTSE 250 Real Estate share price volatility and correlations were also determined over the same period.
The average expected term to exercise used in the models has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural conditions and historical experience.
The risk free rate has been determined from market yield curves for government gilts with outstanding terms equal to the average expected term to exercise for each relevant grant.
The expected dividend yield was determined by calculating the present value of expected future dividend payments to expiry.
II EMPLOYEE SHARE OPTION SCHEMES The Group operates a Save As you Earn SAyE share option scheme and an Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS for which there have been no grants since 2008.
Grants under ESOS were normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant and normally granted at the market price ruling at the date of grant.
Grants under the SAyE scheme are normally exercisable after three or five years saving.
In accordance with UK practice, the majority of options under the SAyE schemes are granted at a price 20% below the market price ruling at the date of grant.
Details of the movements for the ESOS and SAyE schemes during the year were as follows: ESOS SAyE Weighted Weighted exercise exercise Options outstanding number price number price At 1 April 2011 306,172 10.46 444,211 1.20 Options granted 39,475 1.91 Options lapsed 115,001 9.49 85 8.89 At 31 March 2012 191,171 11.05 483,601 1.26 Options granted 193,992 1.93 Options exercised 328,871 1.15 Options lapsed 139,656 10.34 15,394 1.55 At 31 March 2013 51,515 12.97 333,328 1.74 The exercise of all options, other than those obtained under the Groups Save As you Earn scheme, was dependent upon the Group achieving specified performance targets.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the SAyE options exercised during the year was 2.63 2012: no exercises.
193,992 SAyE share options were granted in the year.
The fair value has been calculated using the Black-Scholes model.

The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
The expected dividend yield is based on the present value of expected future dividend payments to expiry.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued The weighted average exercise price for vested and exercisable shares at 31 March 2013 is: LTIP nil 2012: nil, ESOS 13.22 2012: 11.05.
The share awards options outstanding at 31 March 2013 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of: LTIP 1.1 years 2012: 1 year, ESOS nil years 2012: nil years, SAyE 2.2 years 2012: 1.1 years, SIP 3 years.
V CASH SETTLED SHARE BASED PAYMENTS national Insurance payments due on the exercise of non-approved ESOS options and shares from the LTIP are considered cash settled share based payments.
The estimated fair value of the national Insurance cash settled share based payments have been calculated using the Black-Scholes model.
At each balance sheet date the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement.

CONTINGENT LIABILITY In December 2009 Workspace acquired full control of its former Workspace Glebe joint venture.
The purchase was satisfied by a cash payment of 15m and a debt facility of 68m provided by the former lenders to the joint venture, with further amounts potentially payable under a proceed share arrangement.
The proceed share provides for the former lenders to Workspace Glebe to share in net cash proceeds from disposals from the Glebe property portfolio once Workspace has received its priority return.
The priority return at 31 March 2013 is 92m.
