42 Pensions a Defined benefit pension scheme The Company operates a pension scheme the scheme providing benefits defined on retirement based on age at date of retirement, years of service and a formula using either the employees compensation package or career average revalued earnings CARE.
The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The latest full actuarial valuation was carried out at 6 April 2010 and was updated for FRS 17 Retirement benefits purposes for the period to 3 February 2013 by a qualified independent actuary.
Under FRS 17 the investment held by the scheme represents a scheme asset in the Company financial statements.
As a partner in SLP the scheme is entitled to a semi-annual share of the profits of SLP each year for 20 years.
The current best estimate of employer contributions to be paid for the year commencing 4 February 2013 is 18m 2012: 18m.
b Assumptions The major assumptions used in this valuation to determine the present value of the schemes defined benefit obligation are shown below.
i Financial 2013 2012 Rate of increases in salaries 3.70% 4.55% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.30% to 3.70% 2.50% to 3.30% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 4.85% 4.75% Inflation assumption RPI CPI 3.70% 2.90% 3.30% 2.50% ii Longevity The average life expectancy in years of a member who reaches normal retirement age of 65 and is currently aged 45 is as follows: 2013 2012 Male 24.5 24.4 Female 25.4 25.3 The average life expectancy in years of a member retiring at the age of 65 at balance sheet date is as follows: 2013 2012 Male 22.1 22.0 Female 23.1 23.0 Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on actuarial advice and in accordance with published statistics.
The longevity assumption considers how long a member will live when they reach the age of retirement.
Amongst the UK population there is a continuing trend for a generation to live longer than the preceding generation, and this has been reflected in the longevity assumption.
This means that a 45-year-old today is assumed to live on average longer than a 65-year-old today.
This particular adjustment, described in the mortality tables below, is known as long cohort and is in line with the latest advice from the Pension Regulator.
In calculating the present value of the liabilities the actuary selects the appropriate mortality table that reflects the longevity assumption.
The most up-to-date tables are used in each period.
The current mortality table used is S1PMA S1PFA-Heavy YOB 2012: S1PMA S1PFA-Heavy YOB.

c Valuations The fair value of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain, were as follows: 2013 2012 m m Equities 310 260 Bonds 196 178 Gilts 199 Liability driven investments 208 Scottish Limited Partnership 30 Cash 1 1 Total market value of assets 745 638 Present value of scheme liabilities 717 638 Net pension asset 28 Related deferred tax liability 2 Net pension asset after deferred tax 26 The movement in the fair value of the schemes assets over the period was as follows: 2013 2012 m m Fair value of scheme assets at start of period 638 553 Expected return on scheme assets 30 34 Actuarial gain 37 36 Employer contributions 48 18 Employee contributions 5 5 Benefits paid 13 8 Fair value of scheme assets at end of period 745 638 104 Performance and strategy review Governance Financial statements 42 Pensions continued The movement in the present value of the defined benefit obligation during the period was as follows: 2013 2012 m m Defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the period 638 537 Current service cost 17 17 Employee contributions 5 5 Other finance income 31 30 Actuarial loss 39 57 Benefits paid 13 8 Defined benefit obligation at the end of the period 717 638 d Sensitivities Below is listed the impact on the liabilities of changing key assumptions whilst holding other assumptions constant: 2013 2012 m m Discount factor 0.1% 18 16 Longevity 1 year 22 19 e Profit and loss account impact The following amounts have been charged in arriving at operating profit in respect of pension costs: 2013 2012 m m Current service cost 17 17 The amounts for current service cost and pensions credit have been charged in the following profit and loss account lines: 2013 2012 m m Cost of sales 14 14 Administrative expenses 3 3 17 17 The following amounts have been included in other finance income: 2013 2012 m m Expected return on pension scheme assets 30 34 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 31 30 1 4 f Amounts recognised in statement of total recognised gains and losses The amounts included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses STRGL were: 2013 2012 m m Actual return less expected return on scheme assets 37 36 Experience gains and losses arising on scheme liabilities 1 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of scheme liabilities 39 58 Actuarial loss recognised in the STRGL 2 21 105 Financial statements Annual report and financial statements 2012 13 Notes to the Company financial statements continued 53 weeks ended 3 February 2013 42 Pensions continued 2013 2012 m m Cumulative gross actuarial movement recognised in the STRGL 166 164 Taxation on cumulative actuarial movement recognised in the STRGL 38 41 Cumulative net actuarial movement recognised in the STRGL 128 123 The actual return on the schemes assets can therefore be summarised as follows: 2013 2012 m m Expected return on schemes assets 30 34 Actuarial movement recognised in the STRGL reflecting the difference between expected and actual return on assets 37 36 Actual return on schemes assets 67 70 The expected return on schemes assets was determined by considering the expected returns available on the assets underlying the current investment policy.
Expected yields on fixed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields as at the balance sheet date.
Expected returns on equity and property investments reflect long term real rates of return experienced in the respective markets.

In June 2001 the Company established a stakeholder pension scheme, open to all employees, to which the Company makes matching contributions of a maximum of 5% of eligible earnings.
Pension costs for the defined contribution scheme are as follows: 2013 2012 m m Stakeholder pension scheme 3 4 i Other schemes On 24 September 2012, the Group opened a new cash balance scheme, the Morrisons Retirement Saver Plan.
The scheme provides a lump sum benefit based upon a defined proportion of an employees earnings each year, revalued in line with a guaranteed rate prior to retirement.
All employees joining the Company after 24 September 2012 are automatically enrolled.
Existing employees are also eligible to join.
In the year contributions of 3m were made by the Company into the scheme.
