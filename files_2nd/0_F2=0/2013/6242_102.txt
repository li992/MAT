com Fresnillo plc Annual report 2013 179 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to the same fiscal authority.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of tax losses amounting to US$159.2 million 2012: US$67.9 million.
The Group has further tax losses and other similar attributes carried forward of US$5.6 million 2012: US$3.6 million on which no deferred tax is recognised due to insufficient certainty regarding the availability of appropriate future taxable profits.
d Unrecognised deferred tax on investments in subsidiaries The Group has not recognised all of the deferred tax liability in respect of distributable reserves of its subsidiaries because it controls them and only part of the temporary differences are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to US$1,271 million 2012: US$1,256 million.
Corporate Income Tax Impuesto Sobre la Renta or ISR, Special Mining Right SMR and Business Flat Tax Impuesto Empresarial a Tasa Unica or IETU The Groups principal operating subsidiaries are Mexican residents for taxation purposes.
In December 2013, a new Tax Reform was enacted, effective as from 1 January 2014.
As a result of such Tax Reform, a new Income Tax Law ISR was enacted and the IETU Law was abolished.
The new ISR includes: new criteria and limits for certain tax deductions, that among others are: payroll-related expenses, including contributions to pension funds that are considered exempt income for employees will be considered non-deductible: certain payments to related parties, that do not comply with specific legal requirements would be considered as non-deductible: the requirement to calculate the mandatory profit sharing PTU that is paid to Mexican employees on the same base as the income tax, before deduction for profit sharing and before the use of net operating losses.
Differences between the profit sharing and income tax base historically relate to inflation accounting, which is not included in profit sharing, the recognition of exchange gains and losses, and the recognition of income for dividends: and a dividend withholding tax of 10% tax on distributions of dividends paid to Mexican individuals as well as foreign residents.
Dividends between Mexican resident entities are not subject to tax at the shareholder level.
The corporate income tax rate for 2013, under the new ISR, will remain at 30%.
Previously enacted reductions of the tax rate over the next two years to 28% have been repealed.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been remeasured to reflect these changes, the remeasurement increased income tax expense by US$14.5 million.
As part of the new Tax Reform, the Federal Rights Law was amended on certain mining matters with the new SMR added as from 1 January 2014.
The SMR is considered as income tax under IFRS, and states that the owners of mining titles and concessions will be subject to pay an annual mining right of 7.5% of the profit derived from the extractive activities.
The 7.5% tax will apply to a base of income before interest, annual inflation adjustment, taxes paid on the regular activity, depreciation and amortisation, as defined by the new ISR.
This SMR can be credited against the corporate income tax of the same fiscal year and its payment must be remitted no later than the last business day of March of the following year.
Depreciation expense relating to property, plant and equipment will not be deductible for this SMR, consequently, the Group has recognised at 31 December 2013, a deferred tax liability of US$36.1 million in the income statement for the year.
IETU was an alternative minimum corporate income tax, effective from 1 January 2008 through 31 December 2013.
Companies were required to pay the greater of their mainstream corporate income tax liability for the year or their liability to IETU which was calculated at the rate of 17.5% and applied to the sale of goods, rendering of independent services and temporary use or enjoyment of goods.
In calculating the charge to IETU, deductions were allowed for certain expenses incurred in generating income.
Other mining rights In addition to the SMR, the following new mining rights were added to the Federal Right Law, as part of the Tax Reform, which will be effective 1 January 2014.
These rights are not considered as an income tax.
Additional Mining Right which consists of a 50% increase in the duties per hectare for concessions not explored nor exploited during two continuous years during the first 11 years of obtaining the concession.
Furthermore, there is a 100% increase in the right per hectare for concessions not being explored or exploited during a continuous two-year period starting on year 12 of the concession.
This right is payable semi-annually in January and July of each year.
Extraordinary Mining Right consists of a 0.5% rate, applicable to the owners of mining titles, over its sales of gold, silver or platinum obtained during a fiscal year.
The payment must be calculated over the total sales of all mining concessions.
It is explicitly required that the taxpayers must maintain separate accounting to identify the specific sales of gold, silver and platinum.
The compliance with this Extraordinary Mining Duty is independent from other mining rights.
The payment of this mining right must be remitted no later than the last business day of March of the following year and can be credited against corporate income tax.
