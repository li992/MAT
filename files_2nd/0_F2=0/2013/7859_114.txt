This reclassification was made as it more accurately reflects the split between these two classes of the original value paid by the Group for two separate properties when they were acquired in November 2010.
The intention at the time of acquisition was that the properties would be demolished and that new buildings would be constructed in their place, therefore the majority of the value paid was for the land.
At 30 April 2013, the unamortised cost of buildings under construction accounted for within freehold land and buildings was 8,412,000 2012: 7,688,000.
