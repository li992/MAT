INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 64 Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 1.
Basis of Preparation International Public Partnerships Limited is a closed ended authorised investment company incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies Guernsey Law, 2008.
The address of the registered office is given on page 90.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in pages 4 and 9 to 14 respectively.
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling as this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates and represents the functional currency of the Parent and all values are rounded to the nearest 000, except when otherwise indicated.
Basis of preparation: These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, adopted by the European Union: interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee: applicable legal and regulatory requirements of Guernsey: and the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.
The financial statements follow the historical cost basis, except for financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss and derivatives that have been measured at fair value.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out in relevant notes to the financial statements.
Going concern: As set out in the Directors Report, the Directors have reviewed comprehensive cash flow forecasts prepared by management.
Based on those forecasts and an assessment of the Group's parent and consolidated subsidiary entities committed banking facilities, they have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements of the Group on a going concern basis.
In arriving at their conclusion that the Group has adequate financial resources, the Directors were mindful that the Group had unrestricted cash of 49.7 million as at 31 December 2013.
On 20 January 2014, the Companys corporate debt facility was renewed to 175 million 2012: 100 million which is available for investment in new and existing projects and is committed until December 2016.
The new facility is forecast to continue in full compliance with the associated banking covenants.
The company also continues to fully cover cost and distributions from underlying operational investment cash flows.
During the year, the Company completed various capital tap issuances as disclosed in note 17.
Change in Accounting Policy Investment Entities Amendments to IFRS 10, 11, 12 and IAS 27 International Public Partnerships Limited has chosen to early adopt IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 Investment entities amendments which were endorsed by the European Union on 20 November 2013 and are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
The amendments require an investment entity as defined by IFRS 10 to consolidate only those subsidiaries that provide services relevant to its investment activities, such as management services, strategic advice and financial support to its investees.
Subsidiaries that do not provide investment-related services are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The Directors have determined that International Public Partnerships Limited is an investment entity as defined by IFRS 10 on the basis that: a it obtains funds from one or more investor s for the purpose of providing those investor s with investment management services, b it commits to its investors that its business purpose is to invest funds solely for returns from capital appreciation, investment income, or both: and c it measures and evaluates the performance of substantially all of its investments on a fair value basis.
Part of the assessment in relation to meeting the business purpose aspects of the IFRS10 criteria requires consideration of exit strategies.
Given the Company does not intend to hold investments indefinitely currently debt interests are not perpetual and the majority of equity interests are held in entities that have fixed term concessions the Directors have determined the Companys investment plans support its business purpose as an investment entity.
A small number of subsidiary entities within the International Public Partnerships Limited group have been deemed to provide investment related services and hence are consolidated on a line by line basis within the Companys investment basis financial statements as at 31 December 2013. INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 65 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2013 2.
Change in Accounting Policy Investment Entities Amendments to IFRS 10, 11, 12 and IAS 27 continued The change in accounting policy has resulted in service concession entities previously consolidated now being recorded as investments at fair value through profit or loss.
The significant unconsolidated subsidiary entities are disclosed in note 22.
The impact of the application of IFRS 10, 12 and 27 Investment entity amendments on each of the line items in the 31 December 2012 financial statements is provided below: Impact of change Restated in accounting 31 December As at 31 December 2012 policy 2012 CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET Intangible assets 376,470 376,470 - Property plant and equipment 7,085 7,085 - Interest in joint ventures and associates 50,451 50,451 - Investments at fair value through profit or loss - 790,663 790,663 Available for sale financial assets 30,197 30,197 - Deferred tax assets 36,102 36,102 - Financial assets Loans and receivables 2,627,349 2,627,349 - Trade and other receivables 50,788 39,833 10,955 Cash and cash equivalent 426,589 360,813 65,776 Derivative financial instruments 1,632 1,632 - Trade and other payables 81,984 75,830 6,154 Current tax liabilities 777 777 - Bank loans 2,543,487 2,543,487 - Deferred tax liabilities 83,574 83,574 - Long-term provisions 18,289 18,289 - Derivative financial instruments 358,182 357,896 286 Net assets 520,370 340,584 860,954 Share capital 463,054 - 463,054 Revaluation reserves 5,095 5,095 - Hedging and translation reserves 187,877 187,708 169 Other distributable reserve 182,481 - 182,481 Retained earnings 62,669 152,919 215,588 Equity and reserves 525,422 335,532 860,954 Minority interest 5,052 5,052 - Equity and reserves attributable to shareholders of the Company 520,370 340,584 860,954 CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Interest income 180,571 157,016 23,555 Dividend income - 17,275 17,275 Investments at fair value through profit loss - 40,554 40,554 Revenue 244,089 244,089 - Cost of sales 215,860 215,860 - Share of results of joint ventures and associates 999 999 - Other operating income 4,151 4,151 - Other net losses 1,772 1,772 - Financial costs 144,617 143,014 1,603 Operating expenses 36,198 36,853 655 Management fees - 9,418 9,418 Secretarial and administration fees - 1,090 1,090 Transaction costs - 1,301 1,301 Directors' fees - 205 205 Administrative expenses 2,487 2,487 - Impairment charges 90 90 - Tax 825 987 1,812 Minority interest 1,696 1,696 - Net income attributable to equity holders of the parent 29,309 40,925 70,234 Earnings per share 4.71 6.57 11.28 INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 66 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2013 3.
Significant Judgments and Estimates: Service entities and consolidation group Following the adoption of IFRS10 Investment Entity Amendments see change in accounting policy in note 2, the consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and service entities controlled by the Company up to 31 December 2013.
Judgment is required in assessing the entities which qualify as service entities.
Typically a service entity provides management services, strategic advice and financial support to investee entities.
Judgment is therefore required in assessing which entities meet these definitional requirements.
The Directors have reviewed and assessed the criteria applied in the assessment of services entities based on the guidance in place as at 31 December 2013 and are satisfied with the resulting conclusion.
Since 31 December 2013 the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Council has proposed the International Accounting Standards Board IASB provide further clarity on the accounting treatment for investment service entities.
It is currently unclear if the IASB will make any changes to IFRS10.
If future guidance or changes to IFRS10 require investment service entities such as those currently consolidated to instead be accounted for at fair value this would have an impact on disclosures in the Financial Statements, however this would not be expected to have a substantial impact on overall Group net assets.
Fair valuation of investments at fair value through profit or loss Fair values are determined using the income approach which discounts the expected cash flows at a rate appropriate to the risk profile of each asset.
In determining the discount rate, to relevant long-term government bond yields, specific risks and the evidence of recent transactions are considered.
Details of the valuation process and key sensitivities are provided in note 13.
Segmental Reporting Based on a review of information provided to the chief operating decision makers in International Public Partnerships Limited, the Group has identified four reportable segments based on the geographical risk associated within the Group.
The factors used to identify the Groups reportable segments are centered on the risk free rates and the maturity of the Infrastructure sector particularly PFI PPP within each country.
Further, foreign exchange and political risk is identified, as these also determine where resources are allocated.
Management has concluded that the Group is currently organised into four reportable segments being UK, Europe non UK, Australia and North America.

Fair value movements in the period for North America and Australia are primarily due to strengthening of Sterling against the local currency denominated underlying investment cash flows.
Fair value movements in the period for the UK are due to changes in macroeconomic assumptions, in particular, reduction in enacted tax rates and changes in long-term inflation assumption.
Investment Income Accounting policy Interest income Interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of income can be measured reliably.
Interest income is accrued on a time-apportioned basis, using the effective interest rate of the instrument concerned as calculated at the acquisition or origination date.
Interest income is recognised gross of withholding tax, if any.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments and receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period.
When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not future credit losses.
Dividend income Dividend income is recognised gross of withholding tax in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on the date the right to receive payment is established.
This is usually the date when the directors of the underlying project entity approve the payment of a dividend.
Net gain from financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss Net gain from financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss includes all realised and unrealised fair value changes including foreign exchange movements other than interest and dividend income recognised separately.

The interest rate margin on the corporate facility is 225 basis points over Libor.
The loan facility matures in December 2016 and is secured over the assets of the Company.
Tax Accounting policy Current tax is based on taxable profit for the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in past or future years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups asset liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
The current tax charge credit in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income is recognised net of receivables recognised for losses surrendered to unconsolidated group subsidiary entities.
Under the current system of taxation in Guernsey, the Company itself is exempt from paying taxes on income, profits or capital gains.
Dividend income and interest income received by the Consolidated Group may be subject to withholding tax imposed in the country of origin of such income.

The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired, with investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries other than those providing investmentrelated services being designated at fair value through profit and loss as required by IFRS 10.
Investments at fair value through profit or loss Investments in underlying unconsolidated subsidiaries are designated upon initial recognition as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
The Groups policy is to fair value both the equity and debt investments in PPP assets together.
All transaction costs relating to the acquisition of new investments are recognised directly in profit or loss.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the investments are measured on a combined basis at fair value with changes in fair value recognised within operating income in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Financial assets loans and receivables Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that are non-derivative financial assets and that have fixed or determinable payments and are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and other receivables.
Loans and other receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instruments, but does not consider future credit losses.
Financial assets with maturities less than 12 months are included in current assets, financial assets with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date are classified as non-current assets.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets other than those classified as at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been adversely impacted.
Derivative financial instruments Derivatives are recognised initially, and are subsequently remeasured, at fair value.
Derivatives are classified as assets when their fair value is positive or as liabilities when their fair value is negative.
Derivative assets and liabilities arising from different transactions are offset only if the transactions are with the same counterparty, a legal right of offset exists, and the parties intend to settle the cash flows on a net basis.
Fair value movements on derivative financial instruments held for trading are recognised in Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The method of recognising fair value gains or losses depends on whether derivatives are held for trading or are designated as hedging instruments, and if the latter, the nature of the risks being hedged.

The cost of other liabilities is considered to approximate their fair value.
13.3 Financial risk and management objectives The Groups objective in managing risk is the creation and protection of shareholder value.
Risk is inherent in the Groups activities, but it is managed through a process of ongoing identification, measurement and monitoring, subject to risk limits and other controls.
The process of risk management is critical to the Groups continuing profitability.
The Group is exposed to market risk which includes currency risk, interest rate risk and inflation risk, credit risk and liquidity risk arising from the financial instruments it holds.
The Groups Investment Advisor is responsible for identifying and controlling risks.
The Board of Directors supervises the Investment Advisor and is ultimately responsible for the overall risk management of the Group.
The Groups risk management framework and approach is set out within the Strategic Report page 33.
The Boards considerations of key risks impacting the business are set out within the Strategic Report.
The Board takes into account market, credit and liquidity risks in forming the Groups risk management strategy.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market variables such as changes in inflation, foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Inflation risk The majority of the Groups cash flows from underlying investments are linked to inflation indices.
Changes in inflation rates can have a positive or negative impact on the Groups cash flows from investments.
The long-term inflation assumptions applied in the Groups valuation of investments at fair value through profit or losses are disclosed in the fair value hierarchy section 13.4.
The Companys portfolio of investments has been developed in anticipation of continued inflation at or above the levels used in the Groups valuation assumptions.
Where inflation is at levels below the assumed levels, investment performance may be impaired.
The level of inflation linkage across the investments held by the Company varies and is not consistent.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows from underlying investments therefore impacting the value of investments at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group has limited exposure to interest rate risk as the underlying borrowings within the investee entities are either hedged through interest rate swap arrangements or are fixed rate loans.
It is generally a requirement under a PFI PPP concession that any borrowings are matched to the life of the concession.
Hedging activities are aligned with the period of the loan, which also mirrors the concession period and are highly effective.
The Groups corporate facility is unhedged on the basis it is utilised as an investment bridging facility and therefore drawn for a relatively short period of time.
Therefore, the Group is not significantly exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates over its variable rate borrowings.
INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 73 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2013 13.3 Financial risk and management objectives continued Foreign currency risk The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies and therefore is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations.
Currency risk arises in financial instruments that are denominated in a foreign currency other than the functional currency in which they are measured.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary financial instruments at the reporting date are set out in the table below: 31 Dec 2013 31 Dec 2012 000s 000s Cash Euro 1,367 2,727 Canadian Dollar 489 584 Australian Dollar 1 - 1,857 3,311 Current receivables Euro receivables - 478 Canadian Dollar receivables - 56 - 534 Investments at fair value through profit or loss Euro 187,104 148,392 Canadian Dollar 41,659 37,174 Australian Dollar 90,559 108,796 319,322 294,362 Total 321,179 298,207 The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the risk of short-term volatility in foreign exchange on significant investment returns from overseas investments.
Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of dealing only with creditworthy counterparties at the underlying entity level.
PFI PPP concessions are entered into with government, quasi government, other public or equivalent low risk bodies.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group would encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.
The Group invests in relatively illiquid investments mainly non-listed equity and loans.
As a closed-ended investment vehicle there are no automatic redemption of capital rights.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities and by continuously monitoring the forecast and actual cash flows.
Cash flow forecasts assume full availability of underlying infrastructure to the public sector entities.
Failure to maintain assets available for use or operating in accordance with pre-determined performance standards may entitle the public sector to stop wholly or partially paying the income that the Group has projected to receive.
The Directors review the underlying performance of each investment on a quarterly basis, allowing asset performance to be monitored.
Contractual mechanisms also allow for significant pass-down of unavailability and performance risk to sub-contractors.
13.4 Fair value hierarchy All financial instruments for which fair value is recognised or disclosed are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 Quoted market prices in an active market that are unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable Level 3 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable During the period there were no transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 categories.
INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 74 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2013 13.4 Fair value hierarchy continued Level 1: The Group has no financial instruments classified as level 1.
Level 2: This category includes derivative financial instruments such as interest rate SWAPs, RPI SWAPs and currency forward contracts.
As at 31 December 2013, the Groups only derivative financial instruments were currency forward contracts amounting to an asset of 3.6 million 2012: liability of 0.3 million.
Financial instruments classified as Level 2 have been valued using models whose inputs are observable in an active market spot exchange rates, yield curves, interest rate curves.
Valuations based on observable inputs include financial instruments such as swaps and forward contracts which are valued using market standard pricing techniques where all the inputs to the market standard pricing models are observable.
Level 3: This category consists of investments in equity and loan instruments in underlying unconsolidated subsidiary entities which are classified at fair value through profit or loss.
At 31 December 2013, fair value of financial instruments classified as level 3 totalled 844.4 million 2012: 790.7 million.
Financial instruments are classified as Level 3 if their valuation incorporates significant inputs that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
A valuation input is considered observable if it can be directly observed from transactions in an active market, or if there is compelling external evidence demonstrating an executable exit price.
Valuation process Valuations are the responsibility of the Board of Directors of the Group.
The valuation of unlisted equity and debt investments is performed on a quarterly basis by the Investment Advisor and reviewed by the senior members of the Investment Advisor.
The valuations are also subject to quality assurance procedures performed by the Investment Advisor.
The Investment Advisor verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the valuation computation to relevant project financial models and market information.
In addition, the accuracy of the computation is tested.
The latest valuation is also compared with the valuations in the preceding semi-annual and annual reporting periods.
The senior members of the Investment Advisor consider the appropriateness of the valuation methods and inputs.
On a quarterly basis, after the checks above have been performed the Investment Advisor presents the valuation results to the Audit and Risk Committee.
This includes a discussion of the major assumptions used in the valuations, with an emphasis on the more significant investments.
Any changes in valuation methods and assumptions are discussed and agreed with the Groups Audit Committee.
Valuation methodology The valuation methodologies used are primarily based on discounting the underlying investee entities future projected net cash flows at appropriate discount rates.
Valuations are also reviewed against recent market transactions for similar assets in comparable markets observed by the Group or Investment Advisor and adjusted where appropriate.
Projected net future cash flows: Cash flow forecasts for each underlying investment are generated through detailed project specific financial models.
Financial models forecast the project related cash flows for the full term of the underlying service concession.
The cash flows included in the forecasts used to determine fair value are typically fixed under contracts however there are certain variable cash flows which are based on management estimation.
These models also forecast the dividend, shareholder loan interest payments, capital repayments and senior debt repayments where applicable expected from the underlying investments.
Key macroeconomic inputs and assumptions utilised in projecting the Groups net future cash flows include: Europe UK Non UK North America Australia Inflation 2.75% 2.00% 2.00% 2.50% Long-term tax 20.00% 12.50% - 34.00% 25.00% - 26.50% 30.00% Foreign exchange rates N A 1.16 1.78 2.01 Long-term deposit rates 3.50% 3.00% 3.00% 4.50% INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 75 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2013 13.4 Fair value hierarchy continued Discount rate: The discount rate used for valuation of each investment is the aggregate of the following: yield on government bonds with an average life equivalent to the weighted average concession length of the Group, issued by the national government for the location of the asset government bond yield : a premium to reflect the inherent greater risk in investing in infrastructure assets over government bonds: a further premium to reflect the state of maturity of the asset with a larger premium applied to immature assets and or assets in construction and or to reflect any current asset specific or operational issues.
Typically this risk premium will reduce over the life of any asset as an asset matures, its operating performance becomes more established, and the risks associated with its future cash flows decrease: a further adjustment reflective of market based transaction valuation evidence for similar assets.
Over the period, the weighted average government bond increased by 0.59%.
This was offset by a 0.63% decrease in the weighted average project premium to reflect the transactions observed in the market and the decrease in risk premia relating to construction assets nearing or reached completion.

Related Party Transactions continued Changes in the period Up to 30 June 2013, AFML was also entitled to an Incentive Fee in respect of each Incentive Period equal to 20% of the excess if any of the Ordinary Share Return over the Benchmark Return as defined in the IAA in the Incentive Period, provided that the Incentive Fee was only payable if and to the extent that the change in the Ordinary Share Return Index in the relevant Incentive Period was greater than the change in the Benchmark Return Index.
The incentive fee was removed as part of the rebased IAA which was approved by the board on 29 August 2013.
At the same time: o The Company and the Investment Advisor agreed that retrospectively from 30 June 2013, the Base Fee payable to the Investment Advisor would reduce to 1% per annum in respect of the Gross Asset Value of the Companys operational projects that exceeds 750 million.
For GAVs less than 750 million and for non-operational projects the Base Fee payable to the Investment Advisor remains unchanged at 1.2% per annum.
o Provisions in relation to the termination of the Investment Advisor in the IAA were amended to replace the existing mechanism for early termination which was linked to the relative performance of the Companys shares to UK gilts, with i new mechanism allowing for early termination if less than 95% of the Companys assets are available for use for certain periods and the Investment Advisor fails to implement a remediation plan agreed with the Company, and ii enhanced rights for the Company to monitor and manage Amber in order to reflect certain changes to the Listing Rules that were effective from 1 August 2013.
The IAA may also be terminated by either party giving to the other five years notice of termination, expiring at any time after 10 years from the date of the Investment Advisory Agreement.

Adoption of investment entities resulted in a change in accounting policy in the financial statements as discussed in note 2.
Standards issued but not yet effective Standards issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the Groups financial statements are listed below.
The Group intends to adopt applicable standards when they become effective.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments - Classification and Measurement effective date to 1 January 2015.
The standard has been issued as the IASB completes each phase of its project to replace IAS 39.
The first elements of IFRS 9 were issued in November 2009 and October 2010 to replace the parts of IAS 39 that relate to the classification and measurement of financial instruments.
In November 2013 an amendment was issued to address hedge accounting and to remove the previously determined effective date of 1 January 2015.
Instead, the IASB proposes to set the effective date of IFRS 9 when it completes the impairment phase of the project.
The Group will assess IFRS 9s full impact and will determine the date to adopt IFRS 9 once it is endorsed for use in the EU.

Service Concession Arrangements The Group operates 33 service concession arrangements in the Accommodation, Custodial, Energy and Transport sectors.
The concessions vary on the nature of the asset but typically require the construction and operation of an asset during the concession period.
The concession may require the acquisition or replacement of an existing asset or the construction of a new asset.
The operation of the accommodation based assets normally includes the provision of facilities management services such as cleaning, catering, caretaking, security, maintenance, and lifecycle.
At the end of the concession period on the majority of the concessions the assets are returned back to the concession provider.
However on seven of the projects the Group has a right to retain the asset.
The rights of both the concession provider and concession operator are stated within the specific project documentation.
The standard rights of the provider to terminate the project include poor performance and in the event of force majeure.
The operators rights to terminate include the failure of the provider to make payment under the agreement, a material breach of contract and relevant changes of law which would render it impossible for the service company to fulfil its requirements.
The table overleaf sets out the Groups economic interests in PFI concessions that are consolidated within the financial statements.
All economic interests reflect an investment in the capital of the underlying project.
