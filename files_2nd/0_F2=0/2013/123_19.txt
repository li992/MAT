G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies General information A. G. BARR p. l. c. the Company and its subsidiaries together the Group manufacture, distribute and sell soft drinks.
The Group has manufacturing sites in the U. K. and sells mainly to customers in the U. K. but does have some international sales.
The Company is a public limited company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and incorporated and domiciled in Scotland.
The address of its registered office is Westfield House, 4 Mollins Road, Cumbernauld, G68 9HD.
Summary of significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation The consolidated and parent Company financial statements of A. G. BARR p. l. c. have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
They have been prepared under the historical cost accounting rules except for the derivative financial instruments and the assets of the Group pension scheme which are stated at fair value and the liabilities of the Group pension scheme which are valued using the projected unit credit method.
The directors have adopted the going concern basis in preparing these accounts for the reasons set out in note 31.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in the accounting policies on page 78.
The directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under s408 of the Companies Act 2006 and have not presented an income statement for the Company.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures a New and amended standards adopted by the Group There are no IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 29 January 2012 that have a material impact on the Group.
b New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning 29 January 2012 and not adopted early A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for future year ends, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
These standards and amendments are listed in the table below: International Accounting Standards and Interpretations Effective date IFRS 1 First time adoption of IFRSs amended 2012 1 January 2013 IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures amended 2011 1 January 2015 IFRS 9 Financial instruments: Classification and measurement revised 2009 1 January 2015 IFRS 9 Financial instruments: Classification and measurement revised 2010 1 January 2015 IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements 1 January 2013 IFRS 11 Joint arrangements 1 January 2013 IFRS 12 Disclosures of interests in other entities 1 January 2013 IFRS 13 Fair value measurement 1 January 2013 IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements revised 2011 1 July 2012 IAS 19 Employee benefits revised 2011 1 January 2013 IAS 27 Consolidated and separate financial statements revised 2011 1 January 2013 IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures revised 2011 1 January 2013 IAS 32 Financial instruments: Presentation amended 2011 1 January 2014 IFRIC 20 Stripping costs in the production phase of a surface mine 1 January 2013 The Directors have reviewed the requirements of the new standards and interpretations listed above, and with the exception of IAS 19 revised 2011 Employee Benefits IAS 19R, they are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2013 71 Notes to the accounts Continued 1 Accounting policies continued Changes in accounting policy and disclosures In June 2011, the IASB issued an amended version IAS 19R.
The Group will be required to apply the new version of IAS 19R to its financial statements for the year commencing 27 January 2013 and restate comparative amounts accordingly.
The IAS 19R change that will have the most significant effect on the Groups reported profit is that the Groups annual expense for defined benefit pension schemes will be required to include net interest expense or income calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit asset or liability.
This net interest expense or income will replace the finance charge on scheme liabilities and the expected return on scheme assets and is expected to result in a higher annual expense.
The effect of IAS 19R for the year ended 26 January 2013 is to reduce the net finance income relating to defined benefit plans notes 7 and 26 to nil and create a net finance charge relating to defined benefit plans of 21,000.
Under IAS 19R the plan administration costs relating to managing the assets should be included within operating profit.
As the plan administration costs are met by the Group note 30 IAS 19R has no effect on the operating profit.
Had IAS 19R been applied to the Groups financial statements for the year ended 26 January 2013 the consolidated statement of financial position would have been the same as reported.
The effect on the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income and the consolidated cash flow statement is summarised as follows: Effect of applying 2013 2013 IAS 19 Revised Restated Extract of Consolidated Income Statement 000 000 000 Operating profit 31,788 31,788 Finance income 369 209 160 Finance costs 335 21 356 profit before tax 31,822 230 31,592 Tax on profit 6,258 53 6,205 profit attributable to equity holders 25,564 177 25,387 Effect of applying 2013 2013 IAS 19 Revised Restated Extract of Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income 000 000 000 Profit after tax 25,564 177 25,387 Other comprehensive income Actuarial loss on defined benefit pension plans 3,184 230 2,954 Effective portion of changes in fair value of cash flow hedges 1,463 1,463 Deferred tax movements on items taken direct to equity 36 53 89 Other comprehensive income for the year, net of tax 1,757 177 1,580 Total comprehensive income attributable to equity holders of the parent 23,807 23,807 Effect of applying 2013 2013 IAS 19 Revised Restated Extract of Consolidated Cash Flow Statement 000 000 000 Operating activities Profit on ordinary activities before tax 31,822 230 31,592 Interest receivable 369 209 160 Interest payable 335 21 356 IAS 19R has no other impact on any further line items in the consolidated cash flow statement.
72 A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Consolidation subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls an entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations.
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group and for acquisitions prior to 1 July 2009 costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
Currently, there are no non-controlling interests in any of the entities within the Group.
Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the fair value of non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed.
If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised as a credit in profit or loss.
Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Profits and losses resulting from intercompany transactions that are recognised in net assets are also eliminated.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries are consistent with those adopted by the Group.
Revenue recognition Revenue is the net invoiced sales value, after deducting promotional costs invoiced by customers and exclusive of value added tax of goods and services supplied to external customers during the year.
Sales are recorded based on the price specified in the sales invoices, net of any agreed discounts and rebates.
Revenue is recognised when the goods have passed to the buyer and the amount can be measured reliably.
Sales related discounts and rebates are calculated based on the expected amounts necessary to meet the claims of the Groups customers in respect of these discounts and rebates.
Segment reporting An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Groups other components and for which discrete financial information is available.
Segment results that are reported to the management committee as chief operating decision maker include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those which can be allocated on a consistent basis.
Foreign currency translation a Functional and presentation currency Functional and presentation currency items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling which is the Companys functional and the Groups presentation currency.
b Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are remeasured.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement in the same line in which the transaction is recorded.
Exceptional items As permitted by IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements, an item is treated as exceptional if it is considered unusual by its nature and scale and is of such significance that separate disclosure is required for the financial statements to be properly understood.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2013 73 Notes to the accounts Continued 1 Accounting policies continued Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment charges.
Impairment charges on goodwill are not reversed.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside of goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Brands Separately acquired brands are recognised at cost at the date of purchase.
Brands acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Brands acquired separately or through a business combination are assessed at the date of acquisition as to whether they have an indefinite life.
The assessment includes whether the brand name will continue to trade, and the expected lifetime of the brand.
All brands acquired to date have been assessed as having an indefinite life as they are expected to continue to contribute to the long term future of the Group.
The brands are reviewed annually for impairment, being carried at cost less accumulated impairment charges.
The fair value of a brand at the date of acquisition is based on the Relief from Royalties method, which is a valuation model based on discounted cash flows.
Customer relationships Customer relationships acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
The customer relationships have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over the expected life of the customer relationship.
The closing balance in the current year represents the carrying value of the customer relationships acquired during the acquisitions of the Strathmore Water business and Groupe Rubicon Limited.
The fair value of the customer relationships at the acquisition date was based on the Multiple Excess Earnings Method MEEM which is a valuation model based on discounted cash flows.
The useful lives of customer relationships are based on the churn rate of the acquired portfolio and are up to 10 years corresponding to a yearly amortisation of between 10% and 33%.
The useful lives of all intangible assets are reviewed annually and amended, as required, on a prospective basis.
Water rights Water rights represent the cost of purchasing the water rights at Pitcox.
This is the source of Findlays Mineral Water.
As the land rights give indefinite access to the water source at no cost, the rights have been given an indefinite life and are tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Property, plant and equipment Land and buildings comprise mainly factories, distribution sites and offices.
All property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairments.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets.
The purchase price of an asset will include the fair value of the consideration paid to acquire the asset.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
The carrying amount of any replaced part is derecognised.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation is charged from the date that assets, other than land, are available for use.
It is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost to the residual values of the related assets using the following rates: Buildings 1% Leasehold buildings Term of lease Plant, equipment and vehicles 10% to 33% 74 A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2013 The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each year end date.
The carrying value of the property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recoverable amount may be less than the carrying value.
An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or where no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the net proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within administration costs in the income statement.
Leases Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
The Group has two heritable properties accounted for under an operating lease.
Payments made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Impairment of non-financial assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not berecoverable.
An impairment charge is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that is based on current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units.
Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised although any reversal cannot result in a carrying amount that would exceed the carrying amount that would have been recognised, net of amortisation, had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.
Non-current assets classied as held for sale Non-current assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continued use, and a sale is considered highly probable.
They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell if their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
Non-derivative financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade payables.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the estimated cash flows.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of a bad debt provision account and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within administration costs.
When a trade receivable becomes uncollectable it is written off against the bad debt provision.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment in the parent company accounts.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2013 75 Notes to the accounts Continued 1 Accounting policies continued Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the cash flow statement.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interestbearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
At the inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The fair values of the derivative instrument used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 13.
Movements on the hedging reserve in shareholders equity are shown in the statement of changes in equity.
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as non-current when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months from the statement of financial position date and as current when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months from the statement of financial position date.
Cash ow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within administration costs.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled through the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of forward foreign currency contracts hedging overseas purchases is recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement within administration costs.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised within the income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completing production and selling expenses.
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their primary distribution location and condition.
This includes direct labour costs and an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating activity.
Company shares held by employee benefit trusts Company shares are purchased on behalf of employee benefit trusts to satisfy the liability of various employee share schemes.
The amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a charge in equity.
Purchased shares are classified as Company shares held by employee benefit trusts, and presented as a deduction from retained earnings.
Deferred income Government grants in respect of capital expenditure are treated as deferred credits and a proportion of the grants are credited each year to the income statement based on the depreciation rate for the related property, plant and equipment.
Current and deferred income tax Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is charged in the income statement except where it relates to tax on items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is charged to equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the year end date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
76 A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Deferred tax is provided in full using the liability method, providing for temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts, in the consolidated financial statements.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: r the initial recognition of goodwill: r differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Where the carrying value of an asset is to be recovered through both use and subsequent disposal, a single tax base is attributed to that asset resulting in a single temporary difference being recognised.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the year end date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Employee benets Retirement benefit plans The Group operates two pension schemes as detailed in note 26.
The schemes are generally funded through payments to trustee-administered funds.
The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
Dened contribution pension plans A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity.
Obligations for contributions are recognised as an expense in the income statement as they fall due.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Dened benefit pension plans A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan.
Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The liability surplus recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of plan assets less the fair value of the defined benefit obligation, together with adjustments for unrecognised past service costs at the statement of financial position date.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
The Group recognises gains and losses on the curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan when the curtailment or settlement occurs.
The gain or loss on curtailment comprises any resulting change in the fair value of plan assets, changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation and any related actuarial gains and losses and past service costs that had not previously been recognised.
Share-based compensation The Group grants equity settled share-based payments to certain employees.
These are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions at the grant date.
The fair value of the equity settled share-based payment determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes pricing model.
The Group also provides employees with the ability to purchase the Companys ordinary shares at a discount to the current market value through payroll.
The Group records as an expense the fair value of the discount on the shares purchased by the employee as a charge to the income statement and a credit to the share options reserve.
At each year end date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non market vesting conditions.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to the share options reserve.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2013 77 Notes to the accounts Continued 1 Accounting policies continued profit-sharing and bonus plans The Group recognises a liability and an expense for various bonuses based on formulae that take into consideration the profit attributable to the Companys shareholders after certain adjustments.
The Group recognises a provision where there is a contractual obligation or where there is a past practice that has created a .
Provisions A provision is recognised if, as the result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan which has been either announced or has commenced.
Future operating costs are not provided for.
Dividend distributions Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Key judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the statement of financial position date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year.
Due to the nature of estimation, the actual outcomes may well differ from these estimates.
Management has made the following judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies: Retirement benefit obligations note 26 The determination of any defined benefit pension scheme surplus obligation is based on assumptions determined with independent actuarial advice.
The assumptions used include discount rate, inflation, pension increases, salary increases, the expected return on scheme assets and mortality assumptions.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives note 11 Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives must be tested for impairment each year under IAS 36 Impairment of assets.
Determining whether there is any impairment requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill or intangible asset has been allocated.
Value in use calculations require the estimation of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit along with a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Fair value estimation The carrying values of trade payables and trade receivables less impairment provisions are assumed to approximate their fair values.
Restatements Revenue The revenue figure for all comparative periods presented has been restated to include, as a deduction therefrom, customer invoiced promotional investment that was previously included within distribution costs.
The change in policy reduces the revenue to include certain invoiced costs associated with promotional activities to bring the reporting to a basis consistent with the accounting policy adopted by our peer group and in line with the prospectus which detailed the proposed merger with Britvic plc issued in December 2012.
The change in policy reduces the revenue to the amount that will be collected net from customers following deductions made and invoiced by customers for promotional activity rebates.
This has no impact on the operating profit previously reported.
Cost of sales Rockstar royalties Royalties incurred under the Rockstar franchise agreement have been restated to cost of sales from administration costs.
As sales of the Rockstar brand increase, this amendment has been made to give a more accurate reflection of the gross profitability of the Group and impacts all comparative periods presented.
This restatement has no impact on the operating profit of the Group.
78 A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Foreign exchange Foreign exchange gains and losses incurred on forward currency contracts have been restated to cost of sales from administration costs.
The forward currency contracts are used to purchase raw materials from overseas, therefore this restatement more accurately reflects the cost of goods to the Group.
Fair value movements on financial instruments Previously fair value movements on forward foreign exchange contracts recognised in the consolidated income statement were included within administration costs.
In the year to 26 January 2013 the policy has been amended to include these costs within finance income and finance costs as this provides a clearer presentation of the trading of the Group.
The effect on the gross profit, operating profit and profit before tax for the year to 28 January 2012 following the aforementioned restatements are shown in the following table: Impact of Impact of Impact of change in Impact of change Restated Before change in change in foreign in fair value policy before exceptional revenue royalties exchange for financial exceptional items policy policy policy instruments items 000 000 000 000 000 000 Revenue 236,998 14,102 222,896 Cost of sales 117,142 1,202 519 117,825 Gross profit 119,856 14,102 1,202 519 105,071 Operating expenses 86,495 14,102 1,202 519 352 71,358 Operating profit 33,361 352 33,713 Finance income 936 936 Finance costs 744 352 1,096 Profit before tax 33,553 33,553 Tax on profit 7,933 7,933 Profit attributable to equity holders 25,620 25,620 Earnings per share A share subdivision of the Companys issued and to be issued share capital was approved at the annual general meeting on 21 May 2012.
This resulted in treble the number of shares being in issue after the subdivision.
As a result of the change in the number of shares in issue and in line with the requirements of IAS 33 Earnings per share, the earnings per share figures for the year to 28 January 2012 have been restated as if the subdivision had taken place at 30 January 2011, the first day of that financial year.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2013 79 Notes to the accounts Continued 2 Segment reporting The Groups management committee has been identified as the chief operating decision maker.
The management committee reviews the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
The management committee has determined the operating segments based on these reports.
The management committee considers the business from a product perspective.
This led to the operating segments identified in the table below after aggregation : there has been no change to the segments during the year.
The performance of the operating segments is assessed by reference to their gross profit before exceptional items.
Exceptional items are reported separately in note 6.
Year ended 26 January 2013 Other Still drinks including Carbonates and water ice-cream Total 000 000 000 000 Total revenue 182,921 53,639 1,035 237,595 Gross profit before exceptional items 92,519 14,827 658 108,004 Year ended 28 January 2012 restated see note 1 Still drinks Carbonates and water Other Total 000 000 000 000 Total revenue 170,864 51,452 580 222,896 Gross profit before exceptional items 91,401 13,153 517 105,071 There are no intersegment sales.
All revenue is from external customers.
Other segments represent income from water coolers for the Findlays 19 litre water business, rental income for vending machines, the sale of Rubicon ice-cream and other soft drink related items such as water cups.
Rubicon ice-cream was launched in the year to 26 January 2013.
The gross profit from the segment reporting is stated before exceptional costs as the dual running and external manufacture exceptional costs allocated to cost of sales in the consolidated income statement in the prior year relate to both Carbonates and Still drinks and water.
The gross profit from the segment reporting is reconciled to the total profit before income tax, as shown in the consolidated income statement.
All of the assets and liabilities of the Group are managed by the management committee on a central basis rather than at a segment level.
As a result no reconciliation of segment assets and liabilities to the statement of financial position has been disclosed for either of the periods presented.
Each of the following items are included in the reportable segments results and balances, and no adjustments are required in arriving at the costs included in the consolidated primary statements: 2013 2012 000 000 Capital expenditure 21,166 6,937 Depreciation and amortisation 6,772 7,301 Capital expenditure comprises cash additions to property, plant and equipment note 12.
All of the segments included within Carbonates and Still drinks and water meet the aggregation criteria set out in IFRS 8 Operating Segments.

G BARR p. l. c. and Britvic plc announced shareholder approval of a proposed all-share merger.
Professional and legal fees and employee costs of 2,866,000 were incurred in relation to the proposed merger and have been classified as exceptional in the current year.
The deal has since been referred to the Competition Commission for further investigation see note 29.
Construction of a new production site at Crossley in Milton Keynes commenced in July 2012.
Project management and associated recruitment costs of 122,000 have been treated as exceptional in the year to 26 January 2013.
During the year to 26 January 2013 preliminary work in relation to the replacement of the existing Enterprise Resource Planning ERP system was undertaken with costs of 45,000 treated as exceptional.
A further 125,000 of redundancy costs relating to a reorganisation of the distribution operations within England was incurred in the year.
In the year to 28 January 2012 the Mansfield distribution site was sold.
During the period of the closure, a third party had taken over the distribution operations with dual running costs of 182,000 incurred.
A further 929,000 of additional costs were incurred for the manufacture of goods at third parties following operational difficulties in the commissioning of production plant at Cumbernauld during the closure of Mansfield and shortly thereafter.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2013 83 Notes to the Accounts Continued 6 Exceptional items continued An environmental provision of 63,000 relating to the closure of Mansfield was released during the prior year and redundancy costs of 109,000 were recognised as result of the site closure.
In the prior year a curtailment in the Group retirement pension plan arose due to the Mansfield site closure.
An exceptional credit of 497,000 was recognised reflecting a decrease in the number of employees within the scheme.
A pension increase exchange exercise was undertaken during the year to 28 January 2012 resulting in an improvement in the risk profile of the defined benefit scheme.
An associated pension credit of 2,582,000 and consultancy costs of 94,000 were recognised as exceptional in this year.
A gain on disposal of Mansfield assets of 49,000 was recognised during the prior year, with 13,000 of costs associated with the closure of the site also being incurred in the year to 28 January 2012.

84 A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2013 The tax on the Groups profit before tax differs from the amount that would arise using the tax rate applicable to the consolidated profits of the Group as follows: 2013 2013 2012 2012 000 % 000 % Profit before tax 31,822 35,417 Tax at 24.33% 2012: 26.31% 7,742 24.3 9,318 26.3 Tax effects of: Items that are not deductible in determining taxable profit 330 1.0 316 0.9 Exceptional items that are not deductible in determining taxable profit 640 2.0 Current tax adjustment in respect of prior years 322 1.0 205 0.6 Deferred tax adjustment in respect of prior years 6 172 0.5 Deferred tax adjustment in respect of change of deferred tax rate 1,526 4.8 1,466 4.1 Allowable loss on disposal of properties 1,181 3.3 Current year impact of change in deferred tax rate 10 51 0.1 Share options permanent difference 244 0.8 1 Tax deduction available in respect of cash settlement of LTIP awards 296 0.9 Other differences 70 0.2 41 0.1 Total tax expense 6,258 19.7 7,271 20.5 The weighted average tax rate was 19.7% 2012: 20.5%.
The 2012 Budget on 21 March 2012 announced that the U. K. corporation tax rate will continue to reduce.
Ultimately the corporation tax rate is expected to be 20% by 2015.
A reduction in the rate from 26% to 24% effective from 1 April 2012 was substantively enacted on 26March2012 and substantive enactment of the rate of 23% with effect from 1 April 2013 took place on 3 July 2012.
The deferred tax liability at 26 January 2013 has therefore been calculated having regard to the rate of 23% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further 3% rate reduction, although this will further reduce the companys future current tax charge and reduce the companys deferred tax liability accordingly.
9 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share have been calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding shares held by the employee share scheme trusts.
2012 Restated 2013 note 1 Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company 000 25,564 28,146 Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 115,883,733 114,985,479 Basic earnings per share pence 22.06 24.48 The weighted average number of shares in issue and the diluted weighted average number of shares in issue have been restated for the year ended 28 January 2012 following the share subdivision on 28 May 2012 note 27.
This is in line with the requirement of IAS 33 Earnings pershare.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.

These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management which cover a three year period.
Cash flows beyond the three years are extrapolated using the growth rates and other key assumptions as stated below: Key assumptions 2013 2012 Gross Growth Discount Gross Growth Discount margin rate rate margin rate rate % % % % % % Rubicon operating unit 32.85 2.25 9.85 33.10 2.25 9.09 Strathmore operating unit 31.98 2.25 9.85 30.75 2.25 9.09 The Rubicon operating unit can be further allocated across carbonates and still drinks when determining the CGU required for impairment testing.
No impairment was identified through this allocation.
The budgeted gross margin is based on past performance and managements expectation of market development.
The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.
The discount rates used are pre-tax.
The discount rate reflects managements estimate of pre-tax cost of capital adjusted for the specific risks impacting on each operating unit.
The estimated pre-tax cost of capital is a benchmark for the Group provided by an independent third party.
Advertising and promotional costs are included in the breakdown, using latest annual budgets for the year to 26 January 2014 and projected costs thereafter.
Sensitivity analysis was carried out on the above calculations to review possible levels of impairment after adjusting discount rates.
At 12%, neither of the CGUs were impaired.
Whilst cash flow projections used within the impairment reviews are subject to inherent uncertainty, changes within reason to the key assumptions applied in assessing the value in use calculation would not result in a change in the conclusionsreached.
During the year a full review was carried out of the asset register to identify redundant assets and to physically verify the assets on the register.
This resulted in disposals of assets with a cost of 8,470,000 and an associated net book value of 10,400 being recorded in the above note.

The term loan of 10,000,000 is scheduled to be repaid in July 2013 in line with the facility agreement.
A bank arrangement fee of 366,000 was incurred in arranging the original borrowing facility in the year to 30 January 2009.
During the year to 28 January 2012 negotiations were concluded with the bank to replace the 2011 expiring facility with a new three year 10,000,000 working capital facility through to 2014.
A further 60,000 of arrangement fees were incurred in negotiating this facility.
The combined fees are amortised over the life of the loan from the date that the fees were incurred and are expected to be fully amortised in the year to 26 January 2014.
96 A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2013 The amortisation charge is included in the finance costs line in the income statement.
During the year, a revolving facility of 15,000,000 was negotiated to fund the building of the new manufacturing site at Crossley.
This facility has been fully drawn down at the year end and is repayable in June 2015.
The arrangement fee of 98,000 has been capitalised as part of the construction costs.

K. government has introduced legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 26% to 24% from April 2012 and to 23% from April 2013.
This has resulted in a 499,000 charge to equity in the year to 26 January 2013, included within the net charge for the year of 188,000.
Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate to 20% by 2015.
These proposed reductions of the main rate of corporation tax are expected to be enacted separately each year.
These changes have not been substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date and have therefore not been recognised in these financial statements.
It has not been possible to quantify the impact of the changes in these financial statements.
No deferred tax asset is recognised in the statement of financial position for unused capital losses of 2,382,000 2012: 1,895,000.
A further deferred tax asset of 1,026,000 2012: 1,115,000 has not been recognised in respect of acquired tax losses in Taut U. K. Limited, a subsidiary of the Company.
24 Financial risk management Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including foreign exchange risk, cash flow and fair value interest rate risk and price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by the finance department in accordance with policies approved by the board of directors.
The Groups finance department identifies, evaluates and manages financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups business units.
The board provides guidance on overall market risk management including use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess liquidity.
In addition, treasury matters are dealt with by the Treasury Committee.
Market risk Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally.
The Group primarily buys and sells in Sterling but does have some purchases and sales denominated in USDollars and Euros.
Due to the hedging arrangements that have been in place for the year ended 26 January 2013, if Sterling had weakened strengthened by 10% against the US dollar or Euro, with all other variables held constant, there would have been a negligible effect on post tax profit year ended 28 January 2012: negligible impact on post taxprofit.
The Group periodically enters into forward option contracts to purchase foreign currencies for known capital purchases where the value and volume of trading purchases is known.
The Treasury Committee assesses whether hedge accounting should be elected for each forward option contract.
100 A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Price risk The Group is not exposed to equity securities price risk because no such investments are held by the Group.
The Group purchases a wide range of commodities in the ordinary course of business.
Exposure to changes in the market price of certain of these commodities, including sugar, plastic, aluminium and mango, is managed through the use of forward physical supply contracts, primarily to convert floating or indexed prices to fixed prices.
The use of such contracts to hedge commodity exposures is governed by the Groups risk management policies and is continually monitored by the Treasury Committee.
Commodity derivatives also provide a way to meet customers pricing requirements whilst achieving a price structure consistent with the Groups overall pricing strategy.
All of the Groups commodity derivatives are treated as own use contracts, which are outside the scope of IAS 39, since they are both entered into, and continue to be held, for the purposes of the Groups ordinary operations, and are not net settled the Group takes physical delivery of the commodity concerned.
Own use contracts do not require accounting entries until the commodity purchase actually crystallises.
The majority of the Groups forward physical contracts and commodity derivatives have original maturities of less than one year.
As all of the commodity contracts qualify for the own use treatment, no sensitivity analysis has been carried out.
Cash ow and fair value interest rate risk As the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets, the Groups income and operating cash inflows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings.
Borrowings obtained at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, which is partially offset by cash held at variable rates.
For the year ended 26 January 2013, if interest rates on Sterling-denominated borrowings at that date had been 0.5% higher lower with all other variables held constant, there would have been a negligible change in the post tax profit for the year year ended 28 January 2012: negligible impact.
Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to major and direct to store customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of A are accepted.
If major customers are independently rated, these ratings are used.
Otherwise, if there is no independent rating, risk control processes assess the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors.
Individual risk limits are set by the management committee based on internal or external ratings.
The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored.
Sales to direct to store customers are largely settled in cash in order to manage credit risk from smaller, independent stores.
Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, the Group maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining sufficient cash reserves and the availability of borrowing facilities.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity reserve which comprises undrawn borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flows.
This is carried out at a Group level and involves projecting cash flows for capital expenditure and considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these.
Capital risk management The Group defines capital as being net debt plus equity.
The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern and maintain an appropriate capital structure to balance the needs of the Group to grow, whilst operating with sufficient headroom within its bank covenants.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group has a number of options available to it including modifying dividend payments to shareholders, returning capital to shareholders or issuing new shares.
In this way, the Group balances returns to shareholders between long term growth and current returns whilst maintaining capital discipline in relation to investing activities and taking any necessary action on costs to respond to the currentenvironment.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2013 101 Notes to the Accounts Continued 24 Financial risk management continued The Group monitors capital on the basis of the net debt EBITDA ratio.
Net debt is calculated as being the net of cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
The net debt position is discussed in the Financial Review on pages 18 to 26.
The net debt EBITDA ratio enables the Group to plan its capital requirements in the medium term.
The Group uses this measure to provide useful information to financial institutions and investors.
The Group believes that the current net debt EBITDA ratio provides an efficient capital structure and an acceptable level of financial flexibility.
For the year ended 26 January 2013, the net debt EBITDA ratio was 0.6 times year ended 28 January 2012: 0.2 times.
The Group monitors capital efficiency on the basis of the return on capital employed ratio ROCE.
In the financial year ended 26 January 2013, ROCE decreased to 20.6% from 22.8%.
The slight reduction has been caused by the 17m of assets relating to Milton Keynes which are not generating any return during the construction period.
Restating ROCE to take account of this would generate a ROCE slightly ahead of the position reported last year.
25 Lease commitments The total future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows for the Group and Company: 2013 2012 000 000 No later than one year 1,222 1,436 More than one year but not more than five years 1,610 1,482 Due beyond five years 363 559 Total lease commitments 3,195 3,477 26 Retirement benefit obligations During the year the Company operated two pension schemes, the A. G. BARR p. l. c. 2005 Defined Contribution Scheme and the A. G. BARR p. l. c. 2008 Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.
The latter is a funded defined benefit scheme based on final salary which also includes a defined contribution section for the pension provision of new executive entrants.
Under the defined benefit scheme, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on final pensionable pay.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.
Dened benefit scheme: actuarial valuation The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Company and are invested in managed funds.
Full valuations of these schemes were conducted as at 5 April 2011 using the attained age method.
The total assets of the defined benefit scheme at valuation were 81,825,000.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuations are those relating to the discount rate, rate of inflation, real salary growth above inflation and life expectancy.
For the purposes of the 5 April 2011 valuation, the discount and inflation rates were assumed to be 4.9% and 3.45% respectively.
Salary increases were assumed to be 4.7% and the expected age at death for males was 88 to 89 and for females was 90 to 92 depending on their age at 5 April 2011.
The surplus as at 5 April 2011 determined using the above assumptions was 2,300,000.
Dened benefit scheme: IAS 19 information The full actuarial valuation carried out at 5 April 2011 was updated to 26 January 2013 by a qualified independent actuary.
The valuation used for the defined benefit schemes has been based on market conditions as at the Company year end.

The curtailment gain in the year to 28January 2012 arose due to the closure of the Mansfield production site.
The Groups defined benefit obligation reduced by 497,000, with a corresponding 497,000 credit being recognised in the consolidated income statement within exceptional items.
As disclosed in note 6, a pension increase exercise was undertaken during the prior year, resulting in a past service cost credit of 2,582,000 being recognised as an exceptional item in the year to 28 January 2012.
A final sweep up exercise took place during the year to 26 January 2013 resulting in a past service cost credit of 200,000 being included within administration costs.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumptions for the portfolio.
This resulted in the selection of the 4.6% assumption as at 26 January 2013 and is the expected long term rate of return for the year ending 26 January 2014.
Mortality assumptions The mortality tables adopted in finalising the fair value of the liabilities are S1NMA and S1NFA based on the members year of birth.
This assumes that the expected age at death for males is 87 to 88 and for females is 89 to 91 depending on their age at 26 January 2013.
The fair value of scheme assets at the year end dates is analysed as follows: 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 000 000 000 000 000 Equities 56,829 53,595 55,247 42,521 32,783 Bonds 25,894 24,526 22,087 21,739 18,333 Cash 4,171 4,833 2,172 4,102 5,997 Total market value of scheme assets 86,894 82,954 79,506 68,362 57,113 The history of the schemes is as follows: 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 000 000 000 000 000 Defined benefit obligation 90,295 83,341 77,414 74,217 62,102 Scheme assets 86,894 82,954 79,506 68,362 57,113 deficit surplus 3,401 387 2,092 5,855 4,989 Sensitivity review The sensitivity of the overall pension liability to changes in the weighed principle assumptions is: Change in assumption Impact on overall liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decreases increases liabilities by 1.7m Rate of inflation Increase decrease by 0.1% Increases decreases liabilities by 1.4m Life expectancy Increase decrease by 1 year Increases decreases liabilities by 2.7m The Group expects to pay 1.3m of contributions to the defined benefit schemes in the year to 26 January 2014.
As disclosed in note 1, the IASB issued IAS 19R, an amendment to IAS 19, in June 2011.
The interest cost and expected return on assets will be replaced with a net interest amount that will be calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability.
This is applicable to financial periods starting on or after 1 January 2013 and will be adopted by the Group for the year commencing 27 January 2013.
The estimated impact of applying IAS 19R on the Group for the year ended 26 January 2013 is included in note 1.
