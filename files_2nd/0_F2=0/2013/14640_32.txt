Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 109 Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The Parent Company and consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB that have been adopted by the European Union EU.
The preparation of accounts in conformity with IFRS requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
As further explained below, the most significant effect on the financial statements from accounting policies requiring judgement are in the areas of capitalisation of research and development R&D and software, goodwill, taxation and pensions.
The major judgements made in respect of R&D are those in assessing whether an intangible asset arises from the development phase of a product development project, i. e. : i The technical feasibility of completing the product so it will be ready for sale ii The market for the product and the future sales that the product will generate iii A ssessing the costs directly attributable to the individual product during its development.
The Group has a very wide product range and the general nature of product development is that of a number of modest sized projects.
The value of capitalised development costs is disclosed in note 13.
The judgements made in respect of capitalising software costs are those in assessing whether future economic benefits will be generated by the asset and the useful life of the asset.
More detail on the useful life is given in the intangible assets accounting policy on page 111 below.
The judgements made in respect of goodwill are those relating to the key assumptions used to assess the value in use in the annual impairment tests.
More detail about these key assumptions is disclosed in note 13.
The judgements made in respect of taxation are those in assessing the amount of exposure to challenges from tax authorities with regard to liabilities in relation to corporate and indirect taxation.
Judgement is also required in assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets.
More detail is given in the taxation accounting policy on page 113 below.
The judgements made in respect of pensions are those in assessing the assumptions chosen to calculate the net obligation in respect of defined benefit pensions.
More detail is given in the Employee Benefits accounting policy on page 112 below.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The Group has considerable financial resources together with a diverse range of products and customers across wide geographic areas and industries.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
Further information on the Groups business activities, performance and position, together with the financial position of the Group, its capital structure and cash flow are included in the business review and financial review on pages 28 to 47.
In addition, note 31 to the financial statements discloses details of the Groups financial risk management and credit facilities.
The consolidated accounts are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Companys functional currency, rounded to the nearest thousand.
With effect from 1st January 2013, the Group has adopted IAS 19 revised 2011 Employee Benefits which introduces a number of changes to accounting for defined benefit plans.
The key change that impacts the Group is the change in assumption on the expected return on plan assets.
The requirement to use the expected return on plan assets has been replaced with a requirement to recognise interest on plan assets by using the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation.
Strategic report 110 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial statements continued Notes to the Accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued The impact of this change in accounting policy on the current and prior year financial statements, which have been restated, is as follows: 2013 2012 Consolidated income statement 000 000 Financial Income 3,822 3,559 Taxation 866 956 Profit for the period 2,956 2,603 2013 2012 Consolidated statement of comprehensive income 000 000 Actuarial loss on post-retirement benefits 3,822 3,559 Deferred tax on actuarial loss on post-retirement benefits 866 956 Total comprehensive income for the period 2,956 2,603 Earnings per share 2013 2012 Basic 3.9p 3.4p Diluted 3.8p 3.3p An additional cost in 2012 of 114,000 for administrative and investment expenses under IAS 19 revised 2011 has not been recognised due to materiality.
There has been no change to previously reported retained earnings, balance sheet amounts or cash flows, other than consequential adjustments to the analysis of operating cash flows.
The Group has adopted IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement which lays out the framework for determining the measurement of fair value and the disclosure of information relating to fair value and the disclosure of information relating to fair value measurement.
IFRS 13 does not materially affect any fair value measurement of the Groups assets or liabilities, with changes being limited to presentation and disclosure, and therefore has no effect on the Groups financial position or performance.
The Group has also adopted IAS 1 Amendment Presentation of Financial Statements which changes the grouping of items presented in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income so that items which may be reclassified to profit and loss in the future are presented separately from items that will never be reclassified.
The amendment affects presentation only and has no impact on the Groups financial position or performance.
In addition, with effect from 1st January 2013, the Group has implemented IAS 28 Amendment Investments in Associates and IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
The adoption of these standards has had no material impact on the Groups financial performance or position and there has been no requirement to restate prior year comparatives.
A number of standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued and endorsed by the EU but are not yet effective and accordingly the Group has not yet adopted.
The cumulative impact of these standards is not expected to be significant.
Basis of accounting i Subsidiaries The Group accounts include the results of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The accounts of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated accounts from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
ii Associates Associates are those entities for which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The accounts include the Groups share of the total recognised income and expense of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
iii T ransactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the accounts.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the entity.
iv Company Under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own income statement.
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 111 1 Accounting policies continued Foreign currency i O n consolidation The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into sterling at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues, expenses and cash flows of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange ruling during the year.
Where the notes to the Group accounts include tables reconciling movements between opening and closing balances, assets and liabilities are translated at balance sheet rates and revenue and expenses are translated at average rates with the exchange differences arising being disclosed separately.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to a separate translation reserve within equity.
They are recycled and recognised in the income statement upon disposal of the operation.
In respect of all foreign operations, any differences that have arisen before 1st January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are not presented as a separate component of equity.
ii Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective currencies of the Group entities at the foreign exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates fair value was determined.
Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a highly probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the Cash flow hedge reserve.
The associated gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement in the period in which the transaction to which it relates occurs.
Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost, less accumulated depreciation.
Certain items of property, plant and equipment that had been revalued to fair value prior to 1st January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis at rates which write down the value of assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives.
The principal rates are as follows: Freehold buildings 1.5% Office equipment 12.5-33.3% Plant and machinery 10-12.5% Motor vehicles 20% Office furniture and fittings 10% Tooling and patterns 10% The depreciation rates are reassessed annually.
Intangible assets i Goodwill All business combinations after 1st January 2004 are accounted for by applying the acquisition method.
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment see note 13 for more detail.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1st January 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under previous UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice GAAP.
ii R&D Expenditure on R&D is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred except that development expenditure is capitalised where the development costs relate to new or substantially improved products that are subsequently to be released for sale and will generate future economic benefits.
The expenditure capitalised includes staff costs and related expenses.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and any impairment losses.
iii Other intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and any impairment losses.
Annual impairment tests are performed on acquired intangible assets by comparing the carrying value with the recoverable amount, being the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and value in use, discounted at an appropriate discount rate, of future cash flows in respect of intangible assets for the relevant cash generating unit.
More detail is given in note 13. iv Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other than goodwill, from the date they are available for use.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually.
The principal amortisation rates are as follows: Capitalised development costs 20% Manufacturing designs and core technology 10% ERP systems and software 12.5-20% Non compete undertakings 20-50% Brand names and trademarks 10-20% 3.
Strategic report 112 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial statements continued Notes to the Accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of inventories includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs in bringing them to their existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity.
Cost also includes transfers from equity of any gain or loss on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of inventories.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity usually of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statements.
Going concern The statement on the going concern assumption is included within corporate governance on page 98.
Employee benefits i Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
ii Defined benefit plans The costs of providing pensions under defined benefit schemes are calculated in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries and spread over the period during which benefit is expected to be derived from the employees services.
The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pensions is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
Past service costs are recognised straight away.
That benefit is discounted at rates reflecting the yields on AA credit rated corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations to determine its present value.
Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses, differences between the expected and actual returns, and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the year they arise.
Any scheme surplus to the extent it is considered recoverable or deficit is recognised in full in the balance sheet.
The cost of other post-employment liabilities are calculated in a similar way to defined benefit pension schemes and spread over the period which benefit is expected to be derived from the employees services, in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
iii Employee share plans Incentives in the form of shares are provided to employees under share option and share award schemes.
The fair value of these options and awards at their date of grant is charged to the income statement over the relevant vesting periods with a corresponding increase in equity.
The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of options and share awards vesting.
iv Long-term share incentive plans The fair value of awards is measured at the date of grant and the cost spread over the vesting period.
The amount recognised as an expense is not adjusted to reflect market based performance conditions, but is adjusted for non-market based performance conditions.
Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, which is typically on delivery.
For service contracts, revenue is recognised at the point of customer acceptance.
Revenue from projects is recognised as income in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date.
Judgements can be required to assess the stage of completion, although in the vast majority of projects the position is relatively easy to identify.
Projects where a stage of completion assessment is needed typically involve the sale of products, installation and commissioning, which are usually separately identified elements in the project order.
No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due or associated costs, or there is the possibility of return of the goods.
No revenue is recognised if there is significant continuing management involvement with the goods.
As soon as the outcome of a project or service contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and expenses are recognised in the income statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the project or service contract.
An expected loss on a project or service contract is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 113 1 Accounting policies continued Leases i Operating leases Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
ii Finance leases Leases where the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases as if the asset had been purchased outright.
Assets acquired under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group and the capital and interest elements of the leasing commitments are shown as obligations in creditors.
Depreciation is charged on a consistent basis with similar owned assets or over the lease term if shorter.
The interest element of the lease payment is charged to the income statement on a basis which produces a consistent rate of charge over the period of the liability.
Taxation The tax charge comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax expense is recognised in the income statement unless it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income, when it is also recognised in equity or other comprehensive income respectively.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the profit for the year and any adjustments in respect of previous years using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities, and their carrying amounts in the accounts.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided using rates of tax that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date or the date that the temporary differences are expected to reverse.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Share capital and repurchased shares When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares or placed in an Employee Benefit Trust and are presented as a deduction from total equity.
Share options granted to subsidiary employees The Parent Company grants share options over its own Ordinary shares directly to employees of subsidiary companies.
These employees provide services to the subsidiary companies.
The cost of these shares is not recharged and therefore the fair value of the share options granted is recognised as a capital contribution to the subsidiary companies.
This is accounted for as an increase in investments with a corresponding increase in a non-distributable component of equity.

The Groups tax charge in future years is likely to be affected by the proportion of profits arising and the effective tax rates in the various territories in which the Group operates.
The UK corporation tax charge is calculated after deducting tax allowable deficit reduction cash contributions to the UK post retirement benefit schemes of 7,302,000 2012: 7,500,000 covering all employees in the UK defined benefit schemes.
Reductions in the UK corporation tax from 26% to 24% effective from 1st April 2012 and to 23% effective 1st April 2013 were substantively enacted on 26th March 2012 and 3rd July 2012 respectively.
Further reductions to 21% effective from 1st April 2014 and 20% effective from 1st April 2015 were substantively enacted on 2nd July 2013.
This will reduce the companys future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax asset at 31st December 2013 has been calculated based on the rate of 20% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
No UK tax after double tax relief for underlying tax is expected to be payable on the future remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries.

These have been estimated using cash flows based on forecast information for the next financial year and in the case of recent acquisitions on detailed five year forecasts.
This information has been approved by the Board.
The key assumptions on which the impairment tests are based are the discount and growth rates and the forecast cash flows Pre-tax discount rates range from 10-14% 2012: 10-13% Growth rates vary between 2.5-6.5% depending on detailed forecasts 2012: 3-10% No impairments were identified as a result of this exercise.
Long-term growth rates are set using IMF forecasts.
The principal value in use assumptions for the three largest cash-generating units were as follows: Recoverable Pre-tax Long-term Amount Cash-Generating Unit Discount Rate Growth Rate 000 Spirax-Sarco Mexicana 13.0% 6.5% 62,367 Flexicon A S Denmark 12.5% 3.5% 57,042 MasoSine 14.0% 3.0% 56,223 Sensitivity analysis shows that if long-term revenue growth assumptions are lowered by 1% and pre-tax discount rates raised by 1%, no impairment would arise.

Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 129 27 Employee benefits Retirement benefit obligations The Group The Group operates a wide range of retirement benefit arrangements, which are established in accordance with local conditions and practices within the countries concerned.
These include funded defined contribution and funded and unfunded defined benefit schemes.
Defined contribution arrangements The majority of the retirement benefit arrangements operated by the Group are of a defined contribution structure, where the employer contribution and resulting income statement charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees pay.
Contributions made to defined contribution schemes and charged to the income statement totalled 7,373,000 2012: 6,832,000.
In the UK, following the closure of the defined benefit schemes to new entrants, the main scheme for new employees is a defined contribution scheme.
Defined benefit arrangements The Group operates several funded defined retirement benefit schemes where the benefits are based on employees length of service.
Whilst the Groups primary schemes are in the UK, it also operates other material benefit schemes in the US as well as less material schemes elsewhere.
In funded arrangements, the assets of defined benefit schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds or similar structures in the countries concerned.
UK defined benefit arrangements The defined benefit schemes in the UK account for approximately 66% of the Groups net balance sheet liability for defined retirement benefit schemes.
Spirax Sarco operates three UK schemes: the Spirax Sarco Employees Pension Fund, the Spirax Sarco Executives Retirement Benefits Scheme and the Watson Marlow Pension Fund.
These are all final salary pension schemes.
The UK schemes are closed to new members but are open to future accrual.
There is a mix of different inflation-dependent pension increases in payment and deferment which vary from member to member according to their membership history and which scheme they are a member of.
All three schemes have been setup under UK Law and are governed by a Trustee committee, which is responsible for the schemes investments, administration and management.
A funding valuation is carried out for the Trustees of each scheme every three years by an independent firm of actuaries.
Depending on the outcome of that valuation a schedule of future contributions is negotiated with Spirax Sarco.
Further information on the contribution commitments is shown in the Financial review on pages 46 to 47.
US defined benefit Schemes The Group operates a pension scheme in the US which is open to new entrants and defines the pension in terms of the highest average pensionable pay for any five consecutive years prior to retirement.
No pension increases in payment and deferment are offered by this scheme.
It also operates a post-retirement medical plan in the US, which is unfunded, as is typical for these plans.
Principal Risks The pension schemes create a number of risk exposures.
Annual increases on benefits are, to a varying extent from scheme to scheme, dependent on inflation so the main uncertainties affecting the level of benefits payable are future inflation levels including the impact of inflation on future salary increases and the actual longevity of the membership.
Benefits payable will also be influenced by a range of other factors including member decisions on matters such as when to retire and the possibility to draw benefits in different forms.
A key risk is that additional contributions are required if the investment returns fall short of those anticipated when setting the contributions to the pension schemes.
All pension schemes are regulated by the relevant jurisdictions.
These include extensive legislation and regulatory mechanisms that are subject to change and may impact on the Groups pension schemes.
The IAS 19 R liability measurement DBO and the Service Cost are sensitive to the actuarial assumptions made on a range of demographic and financial matters that are used to project the expected benefit payments, the most important of these assumptions being about the future inflation and salary growth levels and the assumptions made about life expectation.
The DBO and Service Cost are also very sensitive to the IAS 19 R discount rate, which determines the discounted value of the projected benefit payments.
The discount rate depends on market yields on high-quality corporate bonds.
Investment strategies are set with funding rather than IAS 19 R considerations in mind and do not seek to provide a specific hedge against the IAS 19 R measurement of DBO.
As a result the difference between the market value of the assets and the IAS 19 R DBO may be volatile.
Sensitivity analysis to changes in discount rate and inflation are included on page 132.
With effect from 1st January 2013, the Group has adopted IAS 19 revised 2011.
It differs from the previous adopted standard IAS 19 revised 2008 in that discount rates that are used to calculate the interest cost on the defined benefit obligation are used to calculate the expected return on assets.
The 2012 comparative figures have therefore been restated in compliance with IAS 19 revised 2011 resulting in the expected return on assets being 3,559,000 lower at 12,418,000.

Pension plans Parent Company The Parent Company is accounting for pension costs in accordance with International Accounting Standard 19.
The disclosures shown here are in respect of the Parent Companys defined benefit obligations.
Other plans operated by the Parent Company were defined contribution plans.
The total expense relating to the Parent Companys defined contribution pension plans in the current year was 49,351 2012: 29,163.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions in respect of the Parent Company Defined Benefit Scheme follows the SAPS light tables, with improvements based on the 2009 CMI Core Projections with a 1.5% long-term trend.
This basis gives a life expectancy of 24 years and 26 years respectively for a male and female currently aged 65.
These figures reflect the generally recognised trend of increased longevity.
These assumptions are regularly reviewed in light of scheme specific experience and more widely available statistics.
With effect from 1st January 2013, the Parent Company has adopted IAS 19 revised 2011.
The 2012 comparative figures have therefore been restated in compliance with IAS 19 revised 2011 resulting in the expected return on assets being 539,000 lower at 2,246,000.
The financial assumptions used at 31st December were: Assumptions weighted by value of liabilities % per annum UK pensions 2013 2012 Rate of increase in salaries 3.9 3.6 Rate of increase in pensions 3.1 2.8 Rate of price inflation 3.4 2.9 Discount rate 4.5 4.6 The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.

For options granted from 1995 to 2001 the performance condition is an increase in EPS of more than 6% greater than the increase in the UK Retail Price Index over a consecutive three-year period between grant and ten years from date of grant.
From and including the 2002 options, the increase in EPS was revised to 9% greater than the increase in the UK Retail Price Index over a three-year consecutive period and from 2007 the performance condition needs to be met over the three-year period from 1st January prior to the date of the grant.
If the condition is not met at the end of the three year period the option will lapse.
The share options granted have been measured by Towers Watson, using the Present Economic Value PEV valuation methodology.

Strategic report 136 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial statements continued Notes to the Accounts continued 27 Employee benefits continued Performance Share Plan Awards under the Performance Share Plan are made to Executive Directors and other senior managers and take the form of contingent rights to acquire shares, subject to the satisfaction of a performance target.
To the extent that they vest, awards may be satisfied in cash, in shares or an option over shares.
For awards granted up to 2007 the performance target is based on the Companys total shareholder return TSR relative to the TSR of other companies included in the FTSE All-Share Industrial Engineering Sector over a three-year performance period where awards will vest on a sliding scale.
All shares within an award will vest if the Companys TSR is at or above the upper quartile.
25% will vest if the TSR is at the median and the number of shares that will vest will be calculated pro-rata on a straight line basis between 25% and 100% if the Companys TSR falls between the median and the upper quartile.
No shares will vest if the Companys TSR is below the median.
The performance criteria for awards from 2008 onwards are split into two separate parts.
The vesting of the first part, amounting to 60% of the award, is based on the existing TSR measure.
The vesting of the second part, amounting to 40% of the award, is subject to achievement of a target based on aggregate EPS over a three-year performance period.
For the 2008 to 2010 awards, 25% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to 5% and 100% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to or exceeds 11%, there is pro-rata vesting for actual growth between these rates.
For awards made in 2011 onwards, 25% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to the growth in the UK Retail Price Index plus 3% and 100% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to or exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Price Index plus 9%, there is pro-rata vesting for actual growth between these rates.

Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 141 31 Derivatives and other financial instruments The Group does not enter into significant derivative transactions.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors, which arise directly from its operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies have remained fundamentally unchanged since the beginning of 2000. Credit risk The Group sells products and services to customers around the world and its customer base is extremely varied in size and industry sector.
The Group operates credit control policies to assess customers credit ratings and provides for any debt that is identified as non-collectable.
Interest rate risk The Group borrows in desired currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest as appropriate to the purposes of the borrowing.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts, loans and finance leases as appropriate.
Foreign currency risk The Group has operations around the world and therefore its balance sheet can be affected significantly by movements in the rate of exchange between sterling and various other currencies particularly the US dollar and euro.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of this structural currency exposure by borrowing in these currencies where appropriate while maintaining a low cost of debt.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures principally as a result of trading between Group companies.
Such exposures arise from sales or purchases by an operating unit in currencies other than the units functional currency.
Net cash flows between any two currencies of less than 1 million per annum would not usually be considered sufficiently material to warrant forward cover.
Forward cover is not taken out more than 24 months in advance or for more than 90% of the next 12 months and 60% of the following 12 months forecast exposure.
Fair values The following table compares amounts and fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities: 2013 2012 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair value value value value 000 000 000 000 Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 84,417 84,417 99,832 99,832 Bank deposits 32,901 32,901 Trade and other receivables 156,860 156,860 154,563 154,563 274,178 274,178 254,395 254,395 2013 2012 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair value value value value 000 000 000 000 Financial liabilities Bank loans 98,041 98,041 46,348 46,348 Finance lease obligations 1,068 1,132 1,421 1,506 Bank overdrafts 1,809 1,809 387 387 Trade payables 30,135 30,135 27,529 27,529 Other payables 25,041 25,041 31,794 31,794 156,094 156,158 107,479 107,564 There are no other assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis for which fair value is disclosed.

The undrawn committed facilities available at 31st December in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date were as follows: The Group 2013 2012 000 000 Expiring in one year or less 11,577 14,555 Expiring in more than two years but no more than three 18,535 12,500 30,112 27,055 The Parent 2013 2012 000 000 Expiring in one year or less 6,000 8,000 Expiring in more than two years but no more than three 18,535 12,500 24,535 20,500 Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Fair values of financial assets and liabilities at 31st December 2013 are not materially different from book values due to their size or the fact that they were at short-term rates of interest.
Fair values have been assessed as follows: Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are marked to market using year-end exchange rates Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease agreements.
The estimated fair values reflect change in interest rates Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate and currency risks, the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Groups earnings.
Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At 31st December 2013, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would reduce the Groups profit after tax and equity by approximately 700,000 2012: 250,000.
For the year ended 31st December 2013, it is estimated that a decrease of one percentage point in the value of sterling weighted in relation to the Groups profit and trading flows would have increased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 2,000,000 2012: 1,800,000.
The effect can be very different between years due to the weighting of different currency movements.
Forward exchange contracts have been included in this calculation.
