B EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEMES ESOS Under the ESOS now closed, Directors and Senior Management were awarded an annual grant of share options at market price, provided that the total amount payable by the individual to exercise options under the ESOS or any other share option scheme of the Group excluding savings related schemes granted during the immediately preceding ten years did not exceed four times base salary, bonus and benefits.

C LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN LTIP Under the existing LTIP policy, Executive Directors can be awarded an annual grant of nil paid share options up to a maximum value of 100% of base salary.
The criteria and vesting conditions of the LTIP options are as follows: 2013 and 2012 awards 2011 award EPS ROCE EPS ROCE Weighting of criteria 67% 33% 100% 0% Vesting conditions: does not vest 30p 9.0% 30p n a vests proportionately 30p 40p 9.0% 13.0% 30p 40p n a vests in full 40p 13.0% 40p n a exercise period 310 years 34 years The right to exercise options terminates upon the employee ceasing to hold office with the Group, subject to certain exceptions and the discretion of the Board.
Awards have also been made annually since 2011 through a shadow Cash LTIP scheme that requires the Group to pay the intrinsic value of the share appreciation rights to the employee at the date of exercise.
This scheme has exactly the same conditions and vesting criteria as the LTIP, the difference being that the award is settled in the cash value of the equity in the event of the options being exercised, rather than through the issue of shares.
This scheme has been accounted for in the same way as the equity-settled scheme, with the exception that the liability is recognised within accruals as opposed to equity.

D SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN SIP The SIP is offered to UK employees.
The SIP is an HM Revenue and Customs approved scheme and operates by inviting participants, including Executive Directors, to purchase shares in the Company in a tax efficient manner on a monthly basis.
For each share purchased by the employee, the Company will match one free share up to a maximum of four free shares per month.
No performance criteria are attached to these matching shares, other than to avoid forfeiture the participants must remain within the plan for a minimum of two years.
In 2013, 37,650 2012: 41,179 matching shares were granted during the year.
Given the nature of the scheme, the fair value of the matching shares equates to the cost of the Company acquiring these shares.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT CONTINUED The net book value of plant and machinery at 31 December 2013 includes an amount of 9.0m 2012: 6.3m in respect of assets held under finance lease contracts.
Included within plant and machinery additions in 2012 were assets in the course of construction of 1.5m.
Of the 10.4m impairment charges, 10.2m relates to the post balance sheet divestment of the Groups German Roofing business see Note 12, and 0.2m relates to other fixed asset impairments.
INTEREST IN ASSOCIATE On 5 March 2013 the Group purchased an additional 26% shareholding in its associate, Ice Energy Technologies Limited Ice, for a consideration of 1.5m debt for equity exchange, taking its total shareholding to 51%.
Following this transaction Ice became a subsidiary of the Group.
The Group has a call option to purchase the remaining 49% shareholding of Ice in 2015.
The Groups share of loss after tax arising from its interest in Ice for the period ending 5 March 2013 was 0.1m 2012: 0.7m, of which 0.4m was included within Other items, which has been recognised on the face of the Consolidated Income Statement.
In accordance with IFRS 3, the 25% holding in Ice is deemed to have been disposed of and reacquired on the same day, and as a result a profit on disposal of 0.2m has been recognised within Other items in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The current accounting period for Ice ends on 31 March 2014.
Ice does not have the same accounting reference date as SIG plc for commercial reasons.
In the period to 5 March 2013 there were no material transactions between Ice and SIG companies.
DIVESTMENTS DIVESTMENT OF GERMAN ROOFING As at 31 December 2013 the Group Board had resolved to dispose of the Groups German Roofing operations.
The disposal was completed on 28 February 2014.

IMPAIRMENT REVIEW PROCESS The Group tests goodwill and the associated intangible assets and property, plant and equipment of CGUs annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that an impairment may exist.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, sales and operating profit growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs to reflect the operational gearing of the Group.
These assumptions have been revised in the year in light of the current economic environment.
The Directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money for the Group.
In respect of the other assumptions, external data and managements best estimates are applied.
For the majority of CGUs, the Group performs goodwill impairment reviews by forecasting cash flows based upon the following years budget and a projection of sales and cash flows based upon industry growth expectations 0%3% over a further period of four years.
Where detailed five year forecasts for a CGU have been prepared and approved by the Board, which can include higher growth rates or varied results reflecting specific economic factors, these are used in preparing cash flow forecasts for impairment review purposes.
After this period, the sales growth rates applied to the cash flow forecasts are no more than 1% and operating profit growth no more than 3%, which do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the industry or economy.
The discount rates applied to all impairment reviews represent pre-tax rates and range between 10% and 13%.
2013 IMPAIRMENT REVIEW RESULTS The most recent results of the impairment review process indicated that the carrying value of goodwill associated with the Groups Energy Management and German Roofing CGUs were no longer supportable.
The SIG Energy Management business has undergone significant structural change in recent years, and consequently now operates in different markets to those in which it had made historical acquisitions.
The goodwill recognised in respect of these acquisitions is therefore no longer generating economic benefit, and as a result an impairment charge of 2.0m has been made to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in respect of this CGU to nil.
There are no intangible assets in respect of this CGU.
On 28 February 2014 the Group sold its German Roofing business.
The consideration received did not support the carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets of the CGU, and therefore an impairment charge of 21.5m of which 19.6m relates to goodwill has been recorded as at 31 December 2013.
The carrying value of the Groups other CGUs remain supportable.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The Group currently has twelve CGUs.
The forecasts used in the annual impairment reviews have been prepared taking into account current economic conditions.
Revenue is the key assumption in the forecasts used in the goodwill impairment reviews, and therefore a 5% reduction in turnover has been determined as a reasonably possible change for the purposes of the disclosure requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
If a 5% reduction in revenue were to arise from that forecast in the goodwill impairment reviews, an impairment of 43m would arise in one CGU, Larivire.
The Board has actively reviewed the forecast associated with Larivire, noting the conservative assumptions used, its continued pattern of strong results in a challenging economic environment and its outperformance of the markets in which it operates, and is satisfied that no impairment is necessary.
If revenues fell by 2% then the recoverable amount of the CGU would equal its carrying value.
The current forecasts provide headroom of 22m.

In accordance with IFRS 3 2008, acquisition expenses of 0.8m in relation to the above acquisitions have been recognised within Other items in the Consolidated Income Statement.
SIG plc 106 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Overview Strategic report Directors report Accounts 15.
ACQUISITIONS CONTINUED In addition, it is currently expected that, dependent upon future profits, a further 2.8m will be paid to the vendors of recent acquisitions who are employed by the Group.
These payments are contingent upon the vendors remaining within the business and, as required by IFRS 3 2008, this will be treated as remuneration and will be charged to the income statement as earned.
The related accrual of potential consideration in the period to 31 December 2013 is 0.6m 31 December 2012: 0.1m.
Added to the 0.8m acquisition expenses this has led to a charge within Other items in the Consolidated Income Statement of 1.4m in respect of acquisitions see Note 2.
Further to this, 0.6m of contingent consideration not subject to the vendors remaining within the business has been recognised within goodwill and intangible assets in the year in relation to the acquisition of United Trading Company UK Limited.
The Directors have made a provisional assessment of the fair value of the net assets acquired.
Any further adjustments arising will be accounted for in 2014.
These fair value adjustments may relate primarily to: a the review of the carrying value of all non-current assets to ensure that they accurately reflect their fair value: b the alignment of valuation and provisioning methodologies to those adopted by the Group: and c an assessment of all provisions and payables to ensure they are accurately reflected in accordance with the Groups policies.
Included within goodwill is the benefit of staff acquired as part of the business and strategic acquisition synergies which are specifically excluded in the identification of intangible assets on acquisition in accordance with the relevant accounting standards.
Goodwill arising is not deductible for tax purposes.
Post-acquisition revenue and operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2013 for all 2013 acquisitions amounted to 39.0m and 3.0m respectively.
The Directors estimate that the combined pre-acquisition revenue and operating profit of the 2013 acquisitions for the period from 1 January 2013 to the acquisition dates was 32.7m and 1.1m respectively.
POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS On 20 January 2014, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Trimform Products Limited, a manufacturer and distributor of roofing materials and associated products in the United Kingdom for an initial consideration of 3.6m with net assets acquired of 0.9m.
Due to the proximity to the period end, further financial information has not been provided.

No interest is charged on receivables.
An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods of 27.7m at 31 December 2013 2012: 29.3m.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
Included within the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 125.0m 2012: 127.1m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided, as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the Group considers that the amounts are still recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The average age of these receivables is 33 days overdue 2012: 29 days.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
The Directors therefore believe that no further credit provision is required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are trade receivables with a gross balance of 40.3m 2012: 43.6m and a provision for impairment of 27.7m 2012: 29.3m.
The provision for impairment represents the difference between the carrying amount of the specific trade receivable and the present value of the expected recoverable amount.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Trade receivable credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are set, reviewed and approved by operational management on a regular basis.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of typically small to medium sized customers, spread across a number of different market sectors and geographical areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single customer.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Treasury Risk Management section of the Strategic Report on pages 35 to 37 includes a review of all treasury, liquidity, interest rate and foreign currency risks, and provides an explanation of the role that derivative financial instruments have had during the year in changing the risks the Group faces in its activities.
The capital structure of the Group is outlined in the Strategic Report on page 34.
The Groups financial assets consist of trade and other receivables, assets held for sale, associate loan and deferred consideration, cash and cash equivalents, and derivative financial instruments.
The following financial assets form part of the net debt of the Group: 2013 2012 m m Cash and cash equivalents including cash deposits repayable on demand 118.7 128.1 Associate loan and deferred consideration 2.7 Derivative financial instruments 29.7 43.6 Total 148.4 174.4 The Directors consider the fair value of financial assets to approximate to their book value.
The interest received on cash deposits is at variable rates of up to 4% 2012: 4%.
The Groups credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Of the above cash and cash equivalents, 36.2m is denominated in Sterling, 69.3m in Euros, 11.5m in Polish Zloty and 1.7m in other currencies.
2013 INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY PROFILE The interest rate and currency profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2013, after taking account of interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments including derivative assets of 29.7m as noted above, was as follows: Weighted Effective average Floating Fixed fixed interest time for which Amount Amount Total rate rate rate rate is fixed secured unsecured Currency m m m % Years m m Private placement notes Sterling 141.5 37.8 103.7 4.2% 3.7 141.5 Other borrowings Sterling 0.1 0.1 n a 0.2 0.1 Finance lease contracts Sterling 0.2 0.2 7.0% 2.2 0.2 Private placement notes Euro 83.3 83.3 4.0% 8.5 83.3 Other borrowings Euro 5.0 5.0 5.0% 1.0 0.5 4.5 Finance lease contracts Euro 7.7 7.7 7.4% 4.1 7.7 Other borrowings Polish Zloty 0.2 0.2 n a n a 0.2 Finance lease contracts Polish Zloty 1.9 1.9 7.4% 3.9 1.9 Total 239.9 43.0 196.9 10.5 229.4 In addition to the currency exposures above, the Group has entered into a short-term currency derivative financial instrument which alters the currency profile of the Groups financial liabilities.

The Directors considered the fair value of these remaining fixed rate debts to materially approximate to the book values shown above.
In both 2013 and 2012, the interest rate on floating rate financial liabilities is based upon appropriate local market rates.
HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Included within financial assets are derivative financial instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships amounting to 29.7m 2012: 43.6m and loans and receivables including cash and cash equivalents and associate loan and deferred consideration of 496.8m 2012: 483.7m.
Included within financial liabilities are derivative financial instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships amounting to 2.1m 2012: 10.6m and liabilities including trade payables at amortised cost of 482.0m 2012: 473.8m.
The Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Where the Group can demonstrate a hedge relationship under the rules of IAS 32 and IAS 39, movements in the fair values of these derivative financial instruments for cash flow and net investment hedges will be recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Where the Group does not meet these rules, movements in the fair value will be recognised as gains and losses on derivative financial instruments in the Consolidated Income Statement in the column entitled Other items.
The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
In order to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate and exchange rate changes, the Group utilises both currency and interest rate derivative financial instruments.
The fair values of these derivative financial instruments, adjusted for credit risk, are calculated by discounting the associated future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
The Group is required to analyse financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All of the financial instruments below are categorised as Level 2.
A NET INVESTMENT HEDGES As at 31 December 2013, the Group had no 31 December 2012: one cross-currency interest rate derivative financial instruments which swap fixed Sterling denominated debt into fixed Euro denominated debt.
In addition, as at 31 December 2013, the Group had entered into one 31 December 2012: one cross-currency forward contract which swaps Sterling denominated debt into Euro denominated debt.
This derivative financial instrument forms a net investment hedge of the Groups Euro denominated assets and is effective as a net investment hedge, and the fair value movement has therefore been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

The cash flow hedges described below are expected to impact upon both profit and loss and cash flow annually over the life of the hedging instrument and the related debt as interest falls due and upon maturity of the debt and related hedging instrument.
As at 31 December 2013, the Group had entered into two 31 December 2012: three cross-currency interest rate derivative financial instruments which swap fixed US Dollar denominated debt held in the UK into fixed Sterling denominated debt.
In addition, as at 31 December 2013, the Group had entered into one 31 December 2012: one cross-currency interest rate derivative financial instrument which swaps fixed rate US Dollar denominated debt into variable rate Sterling denominated debt.
These derivative financial instruments form a cash flow hedge as they fix the functional currency cash flows of the Group.
All of these derivative financial instruments are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value movement has therefore been deferred in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
At 31 December 2013, the weighted average maturity date of these swaps is 2.8 years 31 December 2012: 3.2 years.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IFRS 7 requires the disclosure of a sensitivity analysis that details the effects on the Groups profit or loss and other equity of reasonably possible fluctuations in market rates.
This sensitivity analysis has been prepared to illustrate the effect of the following hypothetical variations in market rates on the fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities: i a 1% 100 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates: and ii a 10% strengthening or weakening of Sterling against all other currencies to which the Group is exposed.
A INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY The Group is currently exposed to Sterling, Euro and US Dollar interest rates.
To a lesser extent the Group is also exposed to Polish Zloty interest rates.
In order to illustrate the Groups sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations, the following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 100 basis point change in each respective interest rate.
The sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to interest rate risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period.
A positive number indicates an increase in profit or loss and other equity.

B FOREIGN CURRENCY SENSITIVITY The Group is exposed to currency rate changes between Sterling and Euros, US Dollars and Polish Zloty.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% change in Sterling against each respective foreign currency to which the Group is exposed, indicating the likely impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on the Groups financial position.
The sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period.
Therefore, in order to present a complete analysis of the Groups exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, the exposure on the Groups total assets and liabilities has been disclosed.
The movements noted above are mainly attributable to: i gains and losses on derivative financial instruments on the Groups net investment hedges and retranslation of Euro interest flows: ii mark-to-market valuation changes in the fair value of effective cash flow and net investment hedges and retranslation of assets and liabilities under the scope of IFRS 7: iii retranslation of Euro profit streams and gains and losses on derivative financial instruments on the Groups net investment hedges: iv retranslation of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities outside the scope of IFRS 7 and mark-to-market valuation changes in the fair value of fully effective cash flow and net investment hedges: v retranslation of Polish Zloty interest flows: and vi retranslation of Polish Zloty profit streams.

The provision has been calculated after taking into account both the periods over which the properties are likely to remain vacant and the likely income from existing and future sub-lease agreements on a contract-by-contract basis.
The provision covers potential transfer of economic benefit over the full range of current lease commitments disclosed in Note 30.
LEASEHOLD DILAPIDATIONS This provision relates to contractual obligations to reinstate leasehold properties to their original state of repair.
The provision is calculated with reference to the expired portion of individual lease agreements where such a clause exists in the lease contract.
The transfer of economic benefit will be made at the end of the leases as set out in Note 30.
CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION Contingent consideration relates to the amounts due to vendors of prior year acquisitions providing certain future profit targets are met.
The transfer of economic benefit is expected to be made within three years.
OTHER AMOUNTS Other amounts relate principally to claims and warranty provisions.
The transfer of economic benefit is expected to be made between one and three years time.

DEFERRED TAX CONTINUED SUMMARY OF DEFERRED TAX The different components of deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and prior years are analysed below: Goodwill Property, Retirement and plant and Tax benefit intangibles equipment assets obligations Losses Other Total m m m m m m m At 31 December 2011 14.0 7.5 12.2 9.7 0.5 1.0 14.9 Credit charge to income 5.1 3.2 0.4 2.3 0.3 1.1 1.6 Credit charge to equity 0.2 0.2 Added on acquisition 1.0 1.0 Exchange differences 0.1 0.1 0.2 Transfer between categories 1.1 1.5 0.4 Change of rate charged to equity 0.8 0.8 At 31 December 2012 9.9 4.4 10.7 8.3 0.8 2.6 11.7 Credit charge to income 3.8 3.1 2.2 0.2 0.6 1.7 0.2 Credit charge to equity 2.0 0.1 1.9 Added on acquisition 1.8 0.8 1.0 Exchange differences 0.1 0.1 0.2 Change of rate charged to equity 0.9 0.9 At 31 December 2013 7.9 1.2 8.5 5.6 1.0 0.9 7.5 The deferred tax charge for 2013 includes a charge of 0.7m arising from the change in domestic tax rates in the countries in which the Group operates and is net of a charge of 2.0m relating to retirement benefit obligations and a credit of 1.3m 0.5m goodwill and intangibles and 0.8m other in relation to the reversal of the deferred tax in respect of the German Roofing business divested in 2014.
Given current and forecast trading the Directors consider that recognition of the deferred tax assets above is appropriate.
The Group has not taken account of excess non-trading losses associated with financial instruments in determining the above deferred tax asset at 31 December 2013 on the grounds of uncertainty.
During the year, the Group has utilised c. 6m gross of previously unrecognised deferred tax on non-trading losses.
In this respect, any future utilisation of the unrecognised deferred tax asset associated with the gross non-trading losses of 69m 2012: 75m will result in a reduction of cash payments of tax and will also result in a profit and loss benefit in the year of utilisation.
There are other potential deferred tax assets in relation to tax losses totalling 8m 2012: 8m that have not been recognised on the basis that the realisation of their future economic benefit is uncertain.
The tax losses in Poland of 1m expire after five years and the tax losses in The Netherlands of 3m expire after nine years.
The remaining tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
The total gross value of unrecognised tax losses at 31 December 2013 therefore amounted to 77m 2012: 83m.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries with a lower rate of corporation tax than that suffered in the UK, for which no deferred tax liabilities have been recognised, was 17m 2012: 15m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences as the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

C PENSION SCHEMES The Group operates a number of pension schemes, five 2012: five of which provide defined benefits based on final pensionable salary.
Of these schemes, one 2012: one has assets held in a separate trustee administered fund and four 2012: four are overseas book reserve schemes.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes, all of which are independently managed.
The trustees of the pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme.
The trustees of the pension fund are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
In The Netherlands, the Group participates in the industry-wide pension plan for the construction materials industry BPF HiBiN.
The pension plan classifies as a multi-employer defined benefit scheme under IAS 19, but is recognised in the Accounts as a defined contribution scheme since the pension fund is not able to provide sufficient information to allow SIGs share of the assets and liabilities to be separately identified.
Therefore, the Groups annual pension expense for this scheme is equal to the required contribution each year.
The coverage ratio of the multi-employer union plan increased to 107.5% as at 31 December 2013 31 December 2012: 106.2%.
As the coverage ratio improved, no change was made to the pension premium percentage of 22.2% 2012: 22.2%.
The coverage ratio is calculated by dividing the funds assets by the total sum of pension liabilities and is based upon market interest rates.
The Groups total pension charge for the year including amounts charged to interest was 8.6m 2012: 2.8m, of which a charge of 3.4m 2012: credit of 1.8m related to defined benefit pension schemes and 5.2m 2012: 4.6m related to defined contribution schemes.
Included within the defined benefit pension scheme credit in 2012 was a curtailment gain of 4.4m.
SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 119 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 30.
GUARANTEES AND OTHER FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS CONTINUED C PENSION SCHEMES CONTINUED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION SCHEME VALUATIONS In accordance with IAS 19 the Group has recognised all actuarial gains and losses in full in the period in which they arise in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The actuarial valuations of the defined benefit pension schemes are assessed by an independent actuary every three years who recommends the rate of contribution payable each year.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the SIG plc Retirement Benefits Plan, the UK scheme, was conducted at 31 December 2010 and showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 98.2m and their actuarial value covered 75% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable salaries.
The other four schemes are book reserve schemes whereby the sponsoring company does not hold any separate assets to fund the pension scheme but makes a reserve in its accounts.
Therefore, these schemes do not hold separate scheme assets.
The liabilities of the schemes are met by the sponsoring companies.
The schemes typically expose the Group to actuarial risks such as: investment risk: interest rate risk: longevity risk: and salary risk.
The risk relating to benefits to be paid to the dependants of scheme members on death in service is re-insured by an external insurance company.
Risk Description Investment risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high quality corporate bond yields: if the return on plan assets falls below this rate, it will create a plan deficit.
Currently the plan has relatively balanced investments in line with the trustees Statement of Investment Principles between equity securities and debt instruments.
Due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities, the trustees of the pension fund consider it appropriate that a reasonable portion of the plan assets should be invested in growth assets to leverage the return generated by the fund.
Interest rate A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability but this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the risk plans debt investments.
Longevity risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment.
An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plans liability.
Salary risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants.
As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plans liability.
However, a pensionable salary cap was introduced from 1 July 2012 of 2.5% per annum.
CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES The pension charge for the year including amounts charged to interest of 1.1m 2012: 0.5m relating to the defined benefit pension schemes was 3.4m 2012: credit of 1.8m.
The prior year credit included a curtailment gain of 4.4m which arose following changes to cap the amount by which pensionable pay may increase and to limit the amount by which all pensionable service earned from 1 July 2012 would change to be the increase in the Consumer Price Index CPI capped at 2.5% per annum.
In accordance with IAS 19, the charge credit for the defined benefit schemes has been calculated as the sum of the cost of benefits accruing in the year, the increase in the value of benefits already accrued and the expected return on assets.
In accordance with revisions to IAS 19, the calculation and the treatment of the inherent interest cost are now on a net basis.
This has caused both finance income and finance costs to be reduced by 5.3m and 6.0m in the periods ended 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 respectively.
The actuarial valuations described previously have been updated at 31 December 2013 by a qualified actuary using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of IAS 19.
Investments have been valued, for this purpose, at fair value.
The UK defined benefit scheme is closed to new members and has an age profile that is rising, and therefore under the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
The four overseas book reserve schemes remain open to new members.
CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET LIABILITY The balance sheet position in respect of the five defined benefit schemes can be summarised as follows: 2013 2012 m m Pension liability before taxation 25.5 34.4 Related deferred tax asset 5.6 8.3 Pension liability after taxation 19.9 26.1 The actuarial gain of 8.3m 2012: loss of 0.2m for the year, together with the associated deferred tax charge of 2.0m 2012: credit of 0.2m and deferred tax charge of 0.9m 2012: 0.8m in respect of the change in the UK standard rate of corporation tax to 20% effective but not enacted from 1 April 2013, has been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
In addition a deferred tax credit of 0.2m 2012: charge of 2.3m has been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
A full reconciliation of the deferred tax movement is shown in Note 24.
The cumulative actuarial gains and losses gross of deferred tax from 2004 onwards recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income amounted to a loss of 31.9m 2012: 40.2m.
Of the above pension liability before taxation, 16.6m 2012: 26.3m relates to wholly or partly funded schemes and 8.9m 2012: 8.1m relates to the overseas unfunded schemes.

GUARANTEES AND OTHER FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS CONTINUED C PENSION SCHEMES CONTINUED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET LIABILITY CONTINUED The movement in the pension liability before taxation in the year can be summarised as follows: 2013 2012 m m Pension liability at 1 January 34.4 44.5 Current service cost 2.3 2.1 Curtailment gain 4.4 Contributions 4.0 8.5 Net finance cost 1.1 0.5 Actuarial gain loss 8.3 0.2 Pension liability at 31 December 25.5 34.4 Contributions of approximately 3.5m are expected to be paid to defined benefit pension schemes during the annual period beginning 1 January 2014.
The Group is contracted to pay 2.5m per annum to January 2020 and a final payment of 3m at January 2021.
The principal assumptions used for the IAS 19 actuarial valuation of the schemes were: 2013 2012 2011 % % % Rate of increase in salaries 2.5 2.5 3.5 Rate of fixed increase of pensions in payment 2.5 2.5 3.5 Rate of increase of LPI pensions in payment 3.3 2.9 3.0 Discount rate 4.5 4.5 4.7 Inflation assumption 3.3 2.9 3.0 Deferred pensions are revalued to retirement in line with the schemes rules and statutory requirements, with the inflation assumption used for LPI revaluation in deferment.
The life expectancy for a male employee beyond the normal retirement age of 60 is 28.1 years 2012: 28.7 years.
The life expectancy on retirement at age 60 of a male employee currently aged 40 years is 29.8 years 2012: 29.9 years.
If the discount rate were to be increased decreased by 0.25%, this would decrease increase the Groups gross pension scheme deficit by 7.0m.
If the rate of inflation increased decreased by 0.25% this would increase decrease the Groups gross pension scheme deficit by 1.3m.
If the life expectancy for employees increased decreased by one year the Groups gross pension scheme deficit would increase decrease by 4.1m.
The average duration of the defined benefit scheme obligation at 31 December 2013 is 20 years 2012: 21 years.
