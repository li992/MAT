Overview Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Addi onal informa on QinetiQs Pension Funding Partnership Structure Following the 30 June 2011 valuation, a package of pension changes has been agreed with the Trustees to provide stability to the Scheme.
As part of the package of proposals, on 26 March 2012 QinetiQ established the QinetiQ PFP Limited Partnership the Partnership with the Scheme.
Under this arrangement, properties to the capitalised value of 32.3m were transferred to the Partnership.
The transfers were affected through a 20-year sale and leaseback agreement.
The Schemes interest in the Partnership entitles it to an annual distribution of approximately 2.5m for 20 years: indexed with reference to CPI.
These contributions will replace part of the regular contributions made under the past deficit recovery payments plan.
The Schemes interest in the Partnership will revert back to QinetiQ Limited in 2032.
The Partnership is controlled by QinetiQ and its results are consolidated by the Group.
Under IAS 19, the interest held by the Scheme in the Partnership does not qualify as a plan asset for the purposes of the Groups consolidated financial statements and is therefore not included within the fair value of plan assets.
As a result, the Groups consolidated financial statements are unchanged by the Partnership.
In addition, the value of the property transferred to the Partnership and leased back to QinetiQ remains on the balance sheet.
QinetiQ retains the operational flexibility to substitute properties of equivalent value within the Partnership and has the option to settle outstanding amounts due under the interest before 2032 if it so chooses.
Other UK schemes In the UK the Group has a small number of employees for whom benefits are secured through the Prudential Platinum Scheme.
The net pension deficits of this scheme at 31 March 2013 amounted to nil 2012: nil.
QinetiQ also offers employees access to a Group Self Invested Personal Pension Plan, but no Company contributions are paid to this arrangement.
