Together these Codes represent current best practice for reporting Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources.

However, for US reporting, the US Securities and Exchange Commission requires historical price data to be used.
For this reason, some Reserves reported TALC 000 tonnes to the SEC in the Form 20-F may differ from those reported below.
