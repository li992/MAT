Notes to the accounts Continued 26 Cash-flow continued Smiths Group cash-flow measures The Group uses two non-statutory cash-flow measures to monitor performance: headline operating cash-flow and free cash-flow.
Headline operating cash-flow is net cash inflow from headline operating activities less capital expenditure.
See note 3 for a description of headline profit measures.
Free cash-flow is cash-flow after interest and tax but before acquisitions, financing activities and dividends.
The tables below reconcile these two measures to statutory cash-flow measures.

The nature of the principal schemes and plans, including general conditions, is set out below: Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP is a share plan under which an award over a capped number of shares will vest after the end of the three year performance period if performance conditions are met.
Group LTIP awards are made to selected senior corporate executives, including the executive directors.
These awards have three performance conditions: 50% of the award is conditional on 3-year growth of headline EPS adjusted to exclude tax: 30% of the award is conditional on 3-year TSR relative to the FTSE 100 excluding financial services companies : and 20% of the award is conditional on 3-year average annual headline operating cash conversion.
Divisional LTIP awards are made to selected divisional senior executives.
These awards also have three performance conditions, and the relative significance of the conditions reflects the strategic priorities for each division: 20% to 40% of the awards are conditional on 3-year revenue growth: 30% to 40% of the awards are conditional on 3-year average annual headline operating margins: and 30% to 40% of the awards are conditional on 3-year average annual headline operating cash conversion.
Each performance condition has a threshold below which no shares vest and a maximum performance target at or above which the award vests in full.
For performance between threshold and maximum, awards vest on a straight-line sliding scale.
The performance conditions are assessed separately, so performance on one condition does not affect the vesting of the other elements of the award.
To the extent that the performance targets are not met over the three year performance period, awards will lapse.
There is no re-testing of the performance conditions.
2010 Value Sharing Plan 2010 VSP The 2010 VSP is a long-term incentive plan approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 16 November 2010 rewarding executives for value creation at Group and Divisional levels.
The awards have the same structure and calculation methods as the 2008 VSP.
The performance conditions are measured over a three-year period commencing with the financial year 2010 11, and the Group scheme hurdle rate is 8.5% a year.
