the option period ends six months following the end of the vesting period.
the Group also has an Executive Share option Scheme and Performance Share Plan PSP, full details of which are given in the directors Remuneration Report.
the following table illustrates the movements in share options during the year.
As the PSP includes the grant of options at nil exercise price the weighted average prices below are calculated including and excluding the options under this plan.
the fair values calculated and the assumptions used are as follows: Charge to Income Risk-free Expected Dividend Share Statement interest rate volatility yield price m % % % th 30 November 2013 1.9 0.41.1 37.656.9 1.1 1.233.20 th 30 November 2012 0.3 0.41.1 37.656.9 1.6 1.232.00 th based on the earlier of the 90 day average to 30 November 2011 or, for options granted after this date, the closing share price on the date of grant.
the fair value of the share incentive reserve in respect of share options outstanding at the year end was 2.1m 2012: 2.4m and included 0.7m 2012: 0.4m in respect of options that had vested at the year end.
in arriving at fair value it has been assumed that, when vested, shares options are exercised in accordance with historical trends.
Expected volatility was determined by reference to the historical volatility of the Groups share price over a period consistent with the expected life of the options.
the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 3.00 2012: 1.97. the executive share options outstanding at the year end had a range of exercise prices between 1.69 and 3.75 2012: 1.14 and 3.75 with PSP options exercisable at nil 2012: nil cost.
outstanding options had a weighted average maximum remaining contractual life of 9.0 years 2012: 9.0 years.

A deferred tax asset of 1.6m 2012: 1.7m has not been recognised in respect of current and prior year tax losses as it is not considered sufficiently certain that there will be taxable profits available in the short-term against which these can be offset.
d. Factors that may affect future tax charges based on current capital investment plans, the Group expects to continue to be able to claim capital allowances in excess of depreciation in future years.
As a property group, tax planning is often an integral part of transactions.
Where tax planning is entered into benefits are recognised by the Group to the extent the outcome is reasonably certain.
Where tax planning has been challenged by hMRC, or management believe that there is a risk of such challenge, provision is made for the best estimate of potential exposure based on the information available at the balance Sheet date.

Fair value hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, are required to be grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets: level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
derivative financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss are the only financial instruments held by the Group th at fair value.
the net liability of 12.8m recognised as at 30 November 2013 2012: 19.5m is categorised as a level 2 fair value measurement.
Capital risk the Group manages its capital to ensure that the entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
the capital structure of the Company consists of debt as disclosed in note 14, cash and cash equivalents and equity, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
Market risk Market risk is the potential adverse change in Group income or the Group net worth arising from movements in interest rates or other market prices.
interest rate risk is the Groups principal market risk and is considered below.
Interest rate risk management: the Group is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows funds at variable interest rates.
the Group uses a combination of variable rate borrowings and interest rate swaps to manage the risk.
Interest rate sensitivity: the subsequent table details the Groups sensitivity, after tax, to a 1% change in interest rates based on yearend levels of debt.

the credit risk on the Groups liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with acceptable generally A and above credit ratings.
bank deposits are only placed with banks in accordance with Group policy that specifies minimum credit rating and maximum exposure.
Credit risk on derivatives is closely monitored.
trade and other receivables consist of amounts due from a large number of parties spread across geographical areas.
the Group does not have any significant concentrations of credit risk as the tenant base is large and diverse with the largest individual tenant accounting for 1.6m 2012: 1.6m of gross rental income.

PENSioNS the Group operates a pension scheme with both defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
the defined benefit section is st closed to new members and, from 1 September 2009, future accrual.
the income Statement includes: a charge of 0.2m 2012: 0.1m for the defined benefit section: and a charge of 0.6m 2012: 0.6m for the defined contribution section.
th the last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 5 April 2011, when the market value of the net assets of the scheme was 33.5m, a funding level of 104% based on the trustees proposed assumptions for technical provisions these are yet to be finalised.
the valuation was performed using the Projected unit Credit Method under iAS 19. the main actuarial assumptions were: investment rate of return: pre-retirement 6.3% pa post-retirement 4.8% pa increase in pensions 3.6% pa th the actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section, a final salary scheme, was updated to 30 November 2013 on an iAS basis by a qualified independent actuary.
the major assumptions used by the actuary were: 2013 2012 2011 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.6% 2.0% 2.4% Rate of increase in pensions in payment th Pre-6 April 1997 benefits 3.0% 2.7% 3.0% th Post-5 April 1997 benefits 3.4% 2.7% 3.1% discount rate 4.5% 4.3% 4.9% inflation assumption 2.6% 2.0% 2.4% Following the closure of the defined benefit section to future accrual, the assumption regarding the rate of increase in salaries is no st longer applicable as retirement benefits will be based on salaries at 31 August 2009. benefits earned up to the point of the scheme closure will be protected and will be increased in line with inflation, subject to a maximum of 5% per annum.
From 2010 the basis of the inflation assumption has been amended, in line with market practice, from the Retail Price index to the Consumer Price index.
the mortality rates adopted are from the S1 year of birth and medium cohort tables with an underpin to future improvements of 1.5% to reflect the fact that medium cohort improvements will reduce over time.
the resultant assumptions are, for example, male members who are currently retired are expected to draw their pensions for 26.7 years and non-retired members for 29.0 years, based on a normal retirement age of 60. the Group made a contribution of 0.2m to the defined benefit section of the scheme in 2013 and expects contributions to remain at similar levels in future years.
