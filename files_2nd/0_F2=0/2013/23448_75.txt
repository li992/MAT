19 Financial Instruments i Management of Risk As an investment trust, the Groups investment objective is to seek capital growth from a portfolio of securities drawn from markets both within the UK and worldwide.
The holding of these financial instruments to meet this objective results in certain risks.
The Groups financial instruments comprise: 1.
Securities in unquoted and quoted companies, partnership interests and liquidity funds.
A loan facility, issuance of Zero Dividend Preference shares and Convertible Bonds, the purpose of which is the financing of new investment and refinancing of existing debt, and to finance on-market purchases of shares, other share buy-backs and tender offers.
Interest rate Swaps and Caps in order to manage the risk of interest rate fluctuation in interest payable on the new multi-currency loan facility.
The main risks arising from the Groups and Companys financial instruments are fluctuations in market price, interest rate, credit, liquidity, capital and foreign currency exchange rate risk.
The policies for managing each of these risks are summarised below.
These policies have remained constant throughout the year under review and the preceding year.
The financial risks of the Company are aligned to the Groups financial risks.
42 Market Price Risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Groups operations.
It represents the potential loss the Group might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements, mitigated by stock selection.
Electra Partners has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio in accordance with the Groups investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
The Group is exposed to the risk of the change in value of its fund investments, listed and unlisted equity and non-equity shares and fixed income securities.
For listed investments and liquidity funds the market risk variable is deemed to be the price itself.
For unlisted equity and non-equity shares the market risk is deemed to be the price earnings ratio or other appropriate valuation methodology as set out in the accounting policy.
The impact on profit or loss after tax and on shareholders equity, in absolute and percentage terms of those figures, due to movements in these variables, is set out in part ii of this Note.
Foreign Currency Risk The Companys total return and net assets are affected by foreign exchange translation movements as a significant proportion of the investments held are denominated in or impacted by currencies other than sterling.
The foreign investments held are principally held in the USA, Continental Europe and the Asia.
During the year, the Company held loans denominated in US Dollars and Euros, which partially offset foreign currency risk on foreign currency investments.
The ratio of loans held in US Dollar and Euro is under regular review in order to partially hedge as efficiently as possible.
The impact on profit after tax and on shareholders equity of 10% increases and decreases in the value of US Dollar and Euros, in absolute terms and as a percentage of those figures, are analysed in part iii of this Note.
Interest Rate Risk The Group finances its operations through retained profits including both realised and unrealised capital profits.
In addition, financing is obtained through loan facilities.
During the year, a long-term multicurrency loan facility was in existence.
The loan has a floating rate of interest.
Interest rate swap and cap derivatives are utilised to manage the risk of interest rate fluctuation in interest payable on the multicurrency facility.
The cash balances held on deposit mitigate in part the interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk profiles for financial assets and liabilities and the impact of the profit or loss after tax and on shareholders equity of a 1.0% increase or decrease in interest rates, in absolute terms and as a percentage of those figures, are shown in part iv of this Note.
These profiles exclude short term receivables and payables.
Liquidity Risk The Groups assets comprise listed and unlisted equity and non-equity shares, fixed income securities and liquidity funds whilst the unlisted equity is intentionally illiquid.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the revolving loan facility, and liquidity funds which are relatively liquid and cash which is available on demand.
The maturity of the Groups existing borrowings are set out in part v of this Note.
Credit Risk The Groups exposure to credit risk principally arises from its investment in liquidity funds and its cash deposits.
Only major banks with market capitalisation above 20 billion are used when making cash deposits and the level of cash is reviewed on a regular basis.
A well-diversified portfolio of liquidity funds is maintained with no more than 10% of gross assets held with any one institution.
The total invested in liquidity funds was 244,800,000 with associated accrued income of 75,000 2012: 298,800,000 with associated accrued income of 169,000.
Cash held on deposit was principally with three UK banks see table below and totalled 207,057,000 2012: 78,387,000.

In doing so the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders whilst remaining within the restrictions imposed by its investment trust status, return capital to shareholders, change the level of borrowing in the 195,000,000 committed multi-currency revolving credit facility or issue new shares or debt.
During the year the Group paid no dividend 2012: nil.
The Group manages the levels of cash deposits held whilst maintaining sufficient liquidity for investments.
The Group has an existing authority to implement an on-market share buy-back programme to generate shareholder value.
During the year nil 2012: nil was utilised to repurchase shares for cancellation.
The level of outstanding borrowings is reviewed on an on-going basis taking into account the need to buy back shares, future levels of investment and any foreign currency hedging concerns.
