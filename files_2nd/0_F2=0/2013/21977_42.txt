Goodwill impairment review The group performs an annual goodwill impairment review, based on its cash generating units CGUs.
The CGUs that have associated goodwill are BT Global Services and BT Retails business units: BT Consumer, BT Business, BT Enterprises and BT Ireland.
These are the smallest identiable groups of assets that generate cash inows that are largely independent of the cash inows from other groups of assets, and to which goodwill is allocated.
Goodwill is allocated to the groups CGUs as follows: BT Retail BT Global Services BT Consumer BT Business BT Enterprises BT Ireland Total m m m m m m At 1 April 2011 1,110 65 46 123 21 1,365 Disposals 7 7 Exchange differences 13 2 11 At 1 April 2012 1,090 65 46 125 21 1,347 Acquisition note 14 33 33 Disposals 8 8 Exchange differences 43 3 46 At 31 March 2013 1,125 65 46 161 21 1,418 58 British Telecommunications plc Annual Report & Form 20-F 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 12.
Intangible assets continued The discount rate used in performing the value in use calculation in 2012 13 was 8.8% 2011 12: 9.2% for all CGUs.
The perpetuity growth rate for BT Global Services was 2.5% 2011 12: 2.5% and 2.0% 2011 12: 2.0% for all BT Retail CGUs.
Recoverable amount The value in use of each CGU is determined using cash ow projections derived from financial plans approved by the BT Group plc Board covering a three-year period and a further two years approved by the line of business and group senior management team.
They reect managements expectations of revenue, EBITDA growth, capital expenditure, working capital and operating cash ows, based on past experience and future expectations of business performance.
Cash ows are also adjusted downwards to reect the different risk attributes of each CGU.
Cash ows beyond the five-year period have been extrapolated using perpetuity growth rates.
Discount rate The pre-tax discount rates applied to the cash ow forecasts are derived from the groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital.
The assumptions used in the calculation of the groups weighted average cost of capital are benchmarked to externally available data.
Growth rates The perpetuity growth rates are determined based on the long-term historical growth rates of the regions in which the CGU operates, and they reect an assessment of the long-term growth prospects of that sector.
The growth rates have been benchmarked against external data for the relevant markets.
None of the growth rates applied exceed the long-term historical average growth rates for those markets or sectors.
Sensitivities For BT Global Services, the value in use exceeds the carrying value of the CGU by approximately 760m.
The following changes in assumptions would cause the recoverable amount to fall below the carrying value: a reduction in the perpetuity growth rate from the 2.5% assumption applied to a revised assumption of a 0.1% growth or less an increase in the discount rate from the 8.8% assumption applied to a revised assumption of 10.6% or more a reduction in the projected operating cash ows across five years by 22.8% or more.
For the BT Retail CGUs, significant headroom exists in each CGU and, based on the sensitivity analysis performed, no reasonably possible changes in the assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount.
