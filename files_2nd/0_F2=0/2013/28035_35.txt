Financial Instruments The Companys financial instruments comprise its investment portfolio as shown on pages8 to 10 cash, borrowings including overdraft and debenture, debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations such as sales and purchases awaiting settlement and accrued income.
The accounting policies in note 1 include criteria for the recognition and the basis of measurement applied for financial instruments.
Note 1 also includes the basis on which income and expenses arising from financial assets and liabilities are recognised and measured.
The principal risks that an investment company faces in its portfolio management activities are set out below: Market risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk: Currency risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in foreign exchange rates: Interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in market interest rates: and Other price risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument for reasons other than changes in foreign exchange rates or market interest rates.
Liquidity risk arising from any difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Credit risk arising from financial loss for a company where the other party to a financial instrument fails to discharge an obligation.
Risk Management Policies and Procedures The Directors have delegated to the Manager the responsibility for the day-to-day investment activities of the Company as more fully described in the Report of the Directors.
As an investment trust the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to meet its investment objective and policies.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction of the profits available for dividends.
The risks applicable to the Company and the policies the Company used to manage these risks for the two years under review follow.
Market Risk The Companys Manager assesses the Companys direct exposure when making each investment decision, and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
The Board meets at least quarterly to assess risk and review investment performance, as disclosed on page 20.
No other derivative or hedging instruments are utilised to manage market risk.
Gearing is used to enhance returns, but this also increases the Companys exposure to market risk and volatility.
Currency risk The majority of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in sterling.
There is some exposure to US dollars, Swiss francs and Swedish krona.
PIGIT pp34 51 PIGIT pp34 51 06 06 2013 14:54 Page 47 PERPETUAL INCOME AND GROWTH INVESTMENT TRUST 50 47 Management of the currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys direct exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the board on a regular basis.
Forward currency contracts can be used to reduce the Companys exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which are used also to achieve the portfolio characteristics that assist the Company in meeting its investment objective and policies.
All contracts are limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the asset denominated in those currencies.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
Currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items that have currency exposure at 31 March are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are priced in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
31 MARCH 2013 31 MARCH 2012 US SWISS SWEDISH US SWISS SWEDISH DOLLAR FRANC KRONA DOLLAR FRANC KRONA 000 000 000 000 000 000 Forward currency sales Foreign currency exposure on net monetary items Investments at fair value through profit or loss that are equities 41,118 77,331 1,138 33,907 34,840 1,291 Total net foreign currency exposure 41,118 77,331 1,138 33,907 34,840 1,291 The above may not be representative of the exposure to risk during the year, because the levels of foreign currency exposure may change significantly throughout the year.
Currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year using exchange rates for sterling to US dollars, Swiss francs and Swedish krona.
It is based on the Companys monetary foreign currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date and takes account of forward foreign exchange contracts that offset the effects of changes in currency exchange rates.
The exchange rate of 2.1% 2012: 2.1% for US dollars, 2.2% 2012:4.3% for Swiss francs and 3.9% 2012:2.0% for Swedish krona has been determined based on market volatility in the year, using the standard deviation of sterlings fluctuation to the applicable foreign currency against the mean.
If sterling had strengthened, this would have had the following effect: 31 MARCH 2013 31 MARCH 2012 US SWISS SWEDISH US SWISS SWEDISH DOLLAR FRANC KRONA DOLLAR FRANC KRONA 000 000 000 000 000 000 Income statement profit loss after taxation Revenue return 36 49 40 66 Capital return 866 1,675 45 713 1,503 25 Total loss after taxation for the year 902 1,724 45 753 1,569 25 If sterling had weakened against the currencies above, the effect would have been the exact opposite.
In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analysis is not representative of the year as a whole, since the level of exposure may change frequently as part of the currency risk management process of the Company.

Financial Instruments continued Risk Management Policies and Procedures continued Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits and the interest payable on variable rate borrowings.
When the Company has cash balances, they are held on variable rate bank accounts yielding rates of interest dependent on the base rate of the Custodian.
At the year end the Company had an uncommitted bank overdraft facility based on the lower of 25% of the net assets of the Company and 100 million.
The Company uses the facility when required at levels approved and monitored by the Board.
The Company also has in issue a 30 million 6.125% Debenture 2014.
At the year end drawings on the Companys overdraft were 74,383,000 2012: 74,302,000 and the debenture had an amortised cost of 29,915,000 2012: 29,860,000.
At the maximum overdraft of 100 million, the effect of a 1% in the interest rate would result in a decrease increase to the Companys income statement of 1 million.
The table below shows the maturity analysis and exposure of the debt securities: 2013 2012 FIXED FLOATING FIXED FLOATING RATE RATE RATE RATE EXPOSURE EXPOSURE EXPOSURE EXPOSURE 000 000 000 000 Less than one year 2,100 More than one year but less than two years 3,600 More than two years but less than five years 465 2,100 4,065 Fixed rate exposure gives rise to fair value interest rate risk and floating rate exposure gives rise to cash flow interest rate risk.
If interest rates were either to increase or decrease by 1%, there would be no effect on revenue as all was fixed: the estimated effect on capital profit after taxation is nil 2012: 17,000, resulting in insignificant effect on the net asset value.
Other price risk Other price risks i. e. changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of the equity investments, but it is the business of the Manager to manage the portfolio to achieve the best return that he can.
Management of other price risk The Directors manage the market price risks inherent in the investment portfolio by meeting regularly to monitor on a formal basis the Managers compliance with the Companys stated objectives and policies and to review investment performance.
The Companys portfolio is the result of the Managers investment process and as a result is not correlated with the Companys benchmark or the market in which the Company invests.
The value of the portfolio will not move in line with the market but will move as a result of the performance of the company shares within the portfolio.
If the value of the portfolio rose or fell by 10% at the balance sheet date, the profit after tax for the year would increase or decrease by 84.7 million 2012: 68.4 million respectively.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is minimised as the majority of the Companys investments are readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet funding commitments as necessary.
In addition, the 100 million bank overdraft facility provides for additional funding flexibility, and this facility was unchanged at the year end.

This risk is minimised by using only approved counterparties.
Investments may be adversely affected if the Companys custodian suffers insolvency or other financial difficulties.
The Board reviews the custodians annual controls report and the Managers management of the relationship with the custodian.
Cash balances are limited to a maximum of 2.5 million with any one depositary, with only approved depositories being used.
Fair Values of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The fair values of the financial assets and financial liabilities are either carried in the balance sheet at their fair value investments, or the balance sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value due from brokers, dividends receivable, accrued income, due to brokers, accruals, cash at bank and overdraft.
The fair value of the 30 million 6.125% Debenture 2014, based on the offer value at the balance sheet date, is 31,950,000 2012: 30,480,000.
Fair Value of Hierarchy Disclosures Nearly all of the Companys portfolio of investments are in the Level 1 category as defined in FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
The three levels set out in FRS29 follow.
Level 1 fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
Level 2 fair values based on valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1.
Level 3 fair values based on valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.

Financial Instruments continued Fair Value of Hierarchy Disclosures continued Categorisation within the hierachy is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of each relevant asset liability.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies note.
All bar one of the quoted equity investments are deemed to be Level 1.
Level 2 includes all quoted fixed income investments and the Companys holding of Barclays Bank Nuclear Power Notes.
Level 3 investments at the year end comprise solely of unquoted securities.

The Companys total capital employed is managed to achieve the Companys investment objective and policy as set out on pages 14 and 15, including that borrowings may be used to raise equity exposure up to a maximum of 25% of net assets.
At the balance sheet date, gross gearing of 14.1% 2012: 18% and equalled net gearing.
The Companys policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding year.
PIGIT pp34 51 PIGIT pp34 51 06 06 2013 14:54 Page 51 PERPETUAL INCOME AND GROWTH INVESTMENT TRUST 50 51 The main risks to the Companys investments are shown in the Report of the Directors under the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section on pages 16 and 18.
These also explain that the Company is able to gear and that gearing will amplify the effect on equity of changes in the value of the portfolio.
The Board can also manage the capital structure directly since it has taken the powers, which it is seeking to renew, to issue and buy-back shares and it also determines dividend payments.
The Company is subject to externally imposed capital requirements with respect to the obligation and ability to pay dividends by section 1159 Corporation Tax Act 2010 and by the Companies Act 2006, respectively, and with respect to the availability of the overdraft facility, by the terms imposed by the custodian.
The Board regularly monitors, and has complied with, the externally imposed capital requirements.
This is unchanged from the prior year.
Borrowings comprise a bank overdraft, details of which are given in note 11, and debenture stock, details of which are contained in note 12.
Post Balance Sheet Event There are no significant post balance sheet events requiring disclosure.
