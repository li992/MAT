8 Unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities Deferred tax assets of 29.0m 2012: 27.1m have not been recognised in respect of tax losses of 126.2m 2012: 120.4m.
The majority of the tax losses have no expiry date, but have not been recognised as deferred tax assets due to uncertainty over their recoverability.
It is likely that the majority of unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries would qualify for the UK dividend exemption.
However 78.0m 2012: 75.4m of those earnings may still result in a tax liability principally as a result of withholding taxes levied by the overseas jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.
These tax liabilities are not expected to exceed 7.9m 2012: 7.9m, of which only 1.5m 2012: 1.5m has been provided as the Group is able to control the timing of the dividends.
It is not expected that further amounts will crystallise in the foreseeable future.
