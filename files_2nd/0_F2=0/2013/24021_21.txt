Approval of the Company under S1158 has been received.
The Company intends to conduct its affairs so as to enable it to continue to comply with the requirements of S1158.
Such approval exempts the Company from UK Corporation Tax on gains realised in the relevant year on its portfolio of fixed asset investments and derivatives.

Dividends payable to equity shareholders are shown in the Reconciliation of Movement in Shareholders Funds.
2 Significant accounting policies a Basis of accounting The accounts of the Company have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, modified to include fixed asset investments and derivatives at fair value, and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, Accounting Standards applicable in the United Kingdom and with the Revised Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts SORP issued in January 2009.
The functional and presentational currency of the Company is pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates.
The Company had no operating subsidiaries at any time during the years ended 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012.
Consequently, consolidated accounts have not been prepared.
There have been no significant changes to the accounting policies during the year ended 31 December 2013.
In accordance with the SORP, the Income Statement has been analysed between a Revenue Account dealing with items of a revenue nature and a Capital Account relating to items of a capital nature.
Revenue returns include, but are not limited to, dividend income and operating expenses and tax insofar as the expenses and tax are not allocated to capital, as described in note 2 b below.
Net revenue returns are allocated via the revenue account to the Revenue Reserve, out of which interim and final dividend payments are made.
Capital returns include, but are not limited to, realised and unrealised profits and losses on fixed asset investments and derivatives and currency profits and losses on cash and borrowings.
b Principal accounting policies The policies set out below have been applied consistently throughout the year.
i Financial instruments Financial Instruments include fixed asset investments, derivative assets and liabilities, and long-term debt instruments, cash and short-term deposits, debtors and creditors.
Accounting Standards recognise a hierarchy of fair value measurements, for financial instruments measured at fair value in the Balance Sheet, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 3.
The classification of financial instruments depends on the lowest significant applicable input, as follows: Level 1 Unadjusted, fully accessible and current quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Included within this category are investments listed on any recognised stock exchange or quoted on the AIM Market in the UK.
Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, or other directly or indirectly observable inputs which exist for the duration of the period of investment.
Examples of such Instruments would be those for which the quoted price has been suspended, forward exchange contracts and certain other derivative instruments.
The Company held no such securities during the year under review.
Level 3 External inputs are unobservable.
Value is the Directors best estimate, based on advice from relevant knowledgeable experts, use of recognised valuation techniques and on assumptions as to what inputs other market participants would apply in pricing the same or similar instrument.
Included within this category are investments in private companies or securities, whether invested in directly or through pooled Private Equity vehicles.
44 Foreign & Colonial Investment Trust PLC 2 Significant accounting policies continued ii Fixed asset investments and derivative financial instruments As an Investment Trust, the Company measures its fixed asset investments at fair value through profit or loss and treats all transactions on the realisation and revaluation of investments held as fixed assets, as transactions on the Capital Account.
Purchases are recognised on the relevant trade date, inclusive of expenses which are incidental to the acquisition of the investments.
Sales are also recognised on the trade date, after deducting expenses incidental to the sales.
Quoted investments are valued at bid value at the close of business on the relevant date on the exchange on which the investment is listed.
Investments which are not quoted or which are not frequently traded are stated at Directors best estimate of fair value.
In arriving at their estimate, the Directors make use of recognised valuation techniques and may take account of recent arms length transactions in the same or similar investment instruments.
Where no reliable fair value can be estimated, investments are carried at cost or less any provision for impairment.
With respect specifically to investments in private equity, whether through funds or partnerships, the Directors rely on unaudited valuations of the underlying unlisted investments as supplied by the managers of those funds or partnerships.
The Directors regularly review the principles applied by the managers to those valuations to ensure they are in compliance with the above policies.
Distributions from private equity funds are recognised when the right to distributions is established.
iii Derivative Instruments Derivatives including forward exchange contracts and options are classified as held for trading and are accounted for as financial assets or liabilities.
Where it can be demonstrated that the derivative is connected to the maintenance of the Companys investments, the change in fair value is recognised as capital and shown in the Capital column of the Income Statement.
Where an option is written in the expectation that it will not be exercised, or that any losses on exercise will be outweighed by the value of the premiums received, the premiums are recognised in the Revenue column of the Income Statement.
The value of the premium is usually the options initial fair value and is recognised evenly over the life of the option.
Subsequent changes to fair value are adjusted in the Capital column of the Income Statement such that the total amounts recognised within Revenue and Capital represent the change in fair value of the option.
iv Debt Instruments The Companys debt instruments include the debenture stock included in the Balance Sheet at proceeds received, net of issue costs, and short-term bank borrowings and overdrafts, initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
No debt instruments held during the year required hierarchical classification.
The 11.25% debenture stock was issued in 1989 and 4.25% perpetual debenture stock was issued in 1960.
The fair market value of these debenture stocks is set out in notes 14 and 17 on the accounts.
Finance charges, including interest, are accrued using the effective interest rate method.
See 2 vii below for allocation of finance charges within the Income Statement.
v Foreign currency Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are expressed in Sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Purchases and sales of investment securities, dividend income, interest income and expenses are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the respective dates of such transactions.
Exchange profits and losses on fixed assets investments are included within the changes in fair value in the Capital Account.
Exchange profits and losses on other currency balances are separately credited or charged to the Capital Account except where they relate to revenue items.
vi Income Income from equity shares is brought into the Revenue Account except where, in the opinion of the Directors, its nature indicates it should be recognised as within the Capital Account on the ex-dividend date or, where no ex-dividend date is quoted, when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
Fixed returns on nonequity shares and debt securities are recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield on the investment.
Dividends are accounted for in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 16 Current Taxation FRS16 on the basis of income actually receivable, without adjustment for the tax credit attaching to the dividends.
Dividends from overseas companies continue to be shown gross of withholding tax.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash scrip dividends, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in capital reserves.
Report and Accounts 2013 45 Notes on the Accounts continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued vii Expenses, including finance charges Expenses are charged to the Revenue Account of the Income Statement, except as noted below: expenses incidental to the acquisition or disposal of fixed assets investments are included within the cost of the investments or deducted from the disposal proceeds of investments and are thus charged to Capital Reserve realised via the Capital Account: 100% of management fees, invoiced to the Company in respect of certain Private Equity investments, are allocated to capital reserves, via the Capital Account, in accordance with the Boards long-term expected split of returns from those investments: 50% of other management fees, and 50% of finance costs both net of applicable tax relief are allocated to Capital Reserves via the Capital Account, in accordance with the Boards long-term expected split of returns from the investment portfolio excluding private equity investments of the Company: and all expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
viii Taxation Deferred tax is provided on an undiscounted basis in accordance with FRS19 on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the Balance Sheet date, based on tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of timing differences can be deducted.
In line with the recommendations of the SORP, the allocation method used to calculate the tax relief on expenses charged to capital is the marginal basis.
Under this basis, if taxable income is capable of being offset entirely by expenses charged through the Revenue Account, then no tax relief is transferred to the Capital Account.
ix Capital Redemption Reserve The nominal value of ordinary share capital repurchased for cancellation is transferred out of Share Capital and into the Capital Redemption Reserve, on a trade date basis.
x Capital Reserves Capital reserve arising on investments sold The following are accounted for in this reserve: gains and losses on the disposal of fixed asset investments and derivatives: realised exchange differences of a capital nature: costs of professional advice, including related irrecoverable VAT, relating to the capital structure of the Company: other capital charges and credits charged or credited to this account in accordance with the above policies: and costs of repurchasing ordinary share capital are recognised on a trade date basis.
Capital reserve arising on investments held The following are accounted for in this reserve: increases and decreases in the valuation of fixed asset investments and derivatives held at the year end: and unrealised exchange differences of a capital nature.

There are no outstanding balances with the Board at year end.
Transactions between the Company and F&C are detailed in note 4 on management fees: in note 10, where investments managed and advised by F&C are disclosed: and in note 15 in relation to fees owed to F&C at the Balance Sheet date.
58 Foreign & Colonial Investment Trust PLC 26 Financial Risk Management The Company is an investment company, listed on the London Stock Exchange, and conducts its affairs so as to qualify in the United Kingdom UK as an investment trust under the provisions of Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
In so qualifying, the Company is exempted in the UK from corporation tax on capital gains on its portfolio of investments.
The Companys investment objective is to secure long-term growth in capital and income through a policy of investing primarily in an internationally diversified portfolio of public listed equities, as well as unlisted securities and private equity, with the use of gearing.
In pursuing the objective, the Company is exposed to financial risks which could result in a reduction of either or both of the value of the net assets and the profits available for distribution by way of dividend.
These financial risks are principally related to the market currency movements, interest rate changes and security price movements, liquidity and credit.
The Board of Directors, together with the Manager, is responsible for the Companys risk management.
The Directors policies and processes for managing the financial risks are set out in a, b and c below.
The accounting policies which govern the reported Balance Sheet carrying values of the underlying financial assets and liabilities, as well as the related income and expenditure, are set out in note 2 on the accounts.
The policies are in compliance with UK Accounting Standards and best practice, and include the valuation of financial assets and liabilities at fair value except as noted in d below and in notes 14 and 17 in respect of debenture stocks.
The Company does not make use of hedge accounting rules.
a Market risks The fair value of equity and other financial securities including derivatives held in the Companys portfolio fluctuates with changes in market prices.
Prices are themselves affected by movements in currencies and interest rates and by other financial issues, including the market perception of future risks.
The Boards policies for managing these risks within the Companys objective include: risk diversification no more than 5% of the portfolio may be invested in unlisted securities, excluding private equity investments, and no single investment may be made which exceeds 10% of the value of the portfolio at the time of acquisition: currency exposure borrowings are limited to amounts and currencies commensurate with the portfolios exposure to those currencies: and gearing borrowings including the debentures value at market value should not normally exceed 20% of shareholders funds.
Options may only be written on quoted stocks and the total nominal exposure is limited to a maximum of 5% of the UK portfolio at the time of investment for both put and call options.
The Board meets regularly to review full, timely and relevant information on investment performance and financial results.
The Manager assesses exposure to market risks when making each investment decision and monitors ongoing market risk within the portfolio.
A description of derivative positions, which are also exposed to market price changes, together with the Managers and Boards strategies for using these positions for efficient portfolio management is contained in this note, under Other market risk exposures page 62.
The Companys other assets and liabilities may be denominated in currencies other than Sterling and may also be exposed to interest rate risks.
The Manager and the Board regularly monitor these risks.
The Company does not normally hold significant cash balances.
Borrowings are limited to amounts and currencies commensurate with the portfolios exposure to those currencies, thereby limiting the Companys exposure to future changes in foreign exchange rates.
Debenture stocks were issued as part of the Companys planned gearing.
All contracts and compliance with them, including the Debenture trust deeds, are agreed and monitored by the Board.
Gearing may be short or long-term in Sterling and foreign currencies, and enables the Company to take a long-term view of the countries and markets in which it is invested without having to be concerned about short-term volatility.
The exchange rates applying against Sterling at 31 December, and the average rates during the year, were as follows: 2013 Average 2012 US Dollar 1.6562 1.5708 1.6255 Euro 1.2020 1.1815 1.2329 Yen 174.0800 152.5053 140.5489 Based on the financial assets and liabilities held, and exchange rates applying at each Balance Sheet date, a weakening or strengthening of Sterling against each of these currencies by 10% would have had the following approximate effect on annualised income after tax and on net asset value NAV per share: 2013 2012 US$ US$ Weakening of Sterling 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Income Statement Return after tax Revenue return 743 551 106 676 383 109 Capital return 109,808 38,189 9,725 84,023 33,074 5,427 Total return 110,551 38,740 9,831 84,699 33,457 5,536 NAV per share pence 19.38 6.79 1.72 14.67 5.80 0.96 60 Foreign & Colonial Investment Trust PLC 26 Financial Risk Management continued 2013 2012 US$ US$ Strengthening of Sterling 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Income statement return after tax Revenue return 743 551 106 676 383 109 Capital return 109,808 38,189 9,725 84,023 33,074 5,427 Total return 110,551 38,740 9,831 84,699 33,457 5,536 NAV per share pence 19.38 6.79 1.72 14.67 5.80 0.96 These analyses are broadly representative of the Companys activities during the current and prior year as a whole, although the level of the Companys exposure to currencies fluctuates in accordance with the investment and risk management processes.
Interest rate exposure The exposure of the financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risks at 31 December is shown below: 2012 2013 Within More than Within More than one year one year Total one year one year Total 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Exposure to floating rates Cash and deposits 21,846 21,846 9,660 9,660 Borrowings Overdrafts Exposure to fixed rates Cash and deposits 10,631 10,631 16,339 16,339 Debentures 110,000 575 110,575 110,575 110,575 Other borrowings 30,000 86,216 116,216 115,000 96,175 211,175 Net exposures At year end 107,523 86,791 194,314 89,001 206,750 295,751 Maximum in year 89,436 210,406 295,890 129,784 215,607 345,391 Minimum in year 2,477 196,791 194,314 92,053 161,479 253,532 Exposures vary throughout the year as a consequence of changes in the composition of the net assets of the Company arising out of the investment and risk management processes.
Interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts and borrowings, is at ruling market rates.
The interest rates applying on the debenture stocks are set out in notes 14 and 17 on the accounts.
There were no material holdings in fixed interest investment securities during the year or at the year end.
The Companys total returns and net assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates on cash and borrowings, except in respect of the debentures on which the interest rate is fixed.
The debentures are valued in the accounts at par value.
Based on the financial assets and liabilities held, and the interest rates pertaining, at each Balance Sheet date, a decrease or increase in interest rates by 2% would have the following approximate effects on the Income Statement revenue and capital returns after tax and on the NAV: 2013 2012 Increase Decrease Increase Decrease in rate in rate in rate in rate 000s 000s 000s 000s Revenue return 219 219 97 97 Capital return 219 219 97 97 Total return 438 438 194 194 NAV per share pence 0.08 0.08 0.03 0.03 Report and Accounts 2013 61 Notes on the Accounts continued 26 Financial Risk Management continued Other market risk exposures The portfolio of investments, valued at 2,623,202,000 at 31 December 2013 2012: 2,374,431,000 is therefore exposed to market price changes.
The Manager assesses these exposures at the time of making each investment decision.
The Board reviews overall exposures at each meeting against indices and other relevant information.
An analysis of the portfolio by country and major industrial sector is set out in the Fund Managers Review.
Derivative contracts entered into during the year comprise options written in the expectation that they will not be exercised.
Based on the portfolio of investments held at each Balance Sheet date, and assuming other factors remain constant, a decrease or increase in the fair values of the portfolio by 20% would have had the following approximate effects on the net capital return attributable to equity shareholders and on the NAV: 2013 2012 Increase Decrease Increase Decrease in value in value in value in value 000s 000s 000s 000s Income statement capital return 524,640 524,640 474,886 474,886 NAV per share pence 91.98 91.98 82.28 82.28 b Liquidity risk exposure The Company is required to raise funds to meet commitments associated with financial instruments, private equity investments and share buybacks.
These funds may be raised either through the realisation of assets or through increased borrowing.
The risk of the Company not having sufficient liquidity at any time is not considered by the Board to be significant, given: the large number of quoted investments held in the Companys portfolio over 600 at 31 December 2013 : the liquid nature of the portfolio of investments: the industrial and geographical diversity of the portfolio and the existence of ongoing overdraft and loan facility agreements.
Cash balances are held with approved banks, usually on overnight deposit.
The Manager reviews liquidity at the time of making each investment decision.
The Board reviews liquidity exposure at each meeting.
The Company has loan facilities of 300 million as set out in notes 13 and 16 on the accounts.
The facilities limit the amount which the Company may borrow at any one time as a proportion of the relevant portfolio of investments and cash.
At 31 December 2013 the most onerous financial covenant limits total borrowings to 33.3% of the Companys adjusted net asset value, which at 31 December 2013 was 2,088 million.
Actual borrowings at market value at 31 December 2013 were 116 million in loans see notes 13 and 16 and 118 million debentures at market value see notes 14 and 17.
The 11.25% debenture stock is governed by a trust deed and is redeemable in 2014 or at an earlier date or dates at the Companys behest.
The perpetual debenture stock is also governed by a trust deed and is redeemable at par only on the security becoming enforceable.
The Board does not therefore consider the repayment of these debenture stocks as a liquidity issue.
At 31 December 2013 the Company had 78.1 million outstanding commitments to private equity investments, payable over more than one year see note 24.
The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at each balance sheet date, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, were as follows: More than three Three months months but less More than or less than one year one year Total 2013 000s 000s 000s 000s Current liabilities Overdrafts Other borrowings 30,000 30,000 Other creditors 3,846 3,846 Long-term liabilities 86,216 86,216 Debentures 110,000 575 110,575 33,846 110,000 86,791 230,637 Interest payable on debentures 12,399 24 12,423 33,846 122,399 86,815 243,060 62 Foreign & Colonial Investment Trust PLC 26 Financial Risk Management continued More than three Three months months but less More than or less than one year one year Total 2012 000s 000s 000s 000s Current liabilities Overdrafts Other borrowings 115,000 115,000 Other creditors 3,515 3,515 Long-term liabilities 96,175 96,175 Debentures 110,575 110,575 118,515 206,750 325,265 Interest payable on debentures 12,399 12,399 24,798 118,515 12,399 219,149 350,063 c Credit Risk and counterparty exposure The Company is exposed to potential failure by counterparties to deliver securities for which the Company has paid, or to pay for securities which the Company has delivered.
The Board approves all counterparties used in such transactions, which must be settled on the basis of delivery against payment except where local market conditions do not permit.
A list of pre-approved counterparties is maintained by the Manager and regularly reviewed by the Board.
Broker counterparties are selected based on a combination of criteria, including credit rating, balance sheet strength and membership of a relevant regulatory body.
The rate of default in the past has been negligible.
Payments in respect of private equity investments are made only to counterparties with whom a contracted commitment exists.
Cash and deposits are held with approved banks.
The Company has an ongoing contract with its Custodian for the provision of custody services.
The contract was reviewed and updated in 2010.
Details of securities held in custody on behalf of the Company are received and reconciled monthly.
To the extent that F&C carries out management and administrative duties or causes similar duties to be carried out by third parties on the Companys behalf, the Company is exposed to counterparty risk.
The Board assesses this risk continuously through regular meetings with the management of F&C including the Fund Manager and with F&Cs Internal Audit function.
In reaching its conclusions, the Board also reviews F&Cs parent groups annual Audit and Assurance Faculty Report, Group Accounts and other public information indicative of its financial position and performance.
The Company had no credit-rated bonds or similar securities in its portfolio at the year end 2012: none and does not normally invest in them.
None of the Companys financial liabilities are past their due date or impaired.
In summary, compared to the amounts included in the balance sheet, the maximum exposure to credit risk was as follows: Exposure at 2013 Exposure at 2012 Balance Maximum Balance Maximum sheet date exposure sheet date exposure Current liabilities 000s 000s 000s 000s Derivative financial instruments 9,250 9,250 2,500 19,020 Report and Accounts 2013 63 Notes on the Accounts continued 26 Financial Risk Management continued d Fair Values of financial assets and liabilities The assets and liabilities of the Company are, in the opinion of the Directors, reflected in the balance sheet at fair value, or at a reasonable approximation thereof, except for the debentures which are carried at par value in accordance with Accounting Standards.
The fair value of the debentures, derived from their quoted market price at 31 December 2013 was 117,997,000 2012: 125,548,000.
Borrowings under overdraft and loan facilities are short-term in nature and hence do not have a value materially different from their capital repayment amount.
Borrowings in foreign currencies are converted into Sterling at exchanges rates ruling at each valuation date.
The fair value of investments quoted on active markets is determined directly by reference to published price quotations in these markets.
Unquoted investments, including private equity investments, are valued based on professional advice and assumptions that are not wholly supported by prices from current market transactions or by observable market data.
The Directors make use of recognised valuation techniques and may take account of recent arms length transactions in the same or similar investments.
With respect specifically to investments in private equity funds or partnerships, the underlying managers provide regular valuations to the Directors, based on the latest information available to the managers and not necessarily co-terminous with the reporting dates of the Company.
The Directors review the valuations for consistency with the Companys accounting policies and with fair value principles.
e Capital Risk Management The objective of the Company is stated as being to provide shareholders with long-term growth in capital and income.
In pursuing this long-term objective, the Board has a responsibility for ensuring the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.
It must therefore maintain an optimal capital structure through varying market conditions.
This involves the ability to: issue and buy back share capital within limits set by the shareholders in general meeting: borrow monies in the short and long term: and pay dividends to shareholders out of current year revenue earnings as well as out of brought forward revenue reserves.
Changes to ordinary share capital are set out in note 18 on the accounts.
Dividend payments are set out in note 9 on the accounts.
Borrowings are set out in notes 13,14, 16 and 17 on the accounts.
27 Post Balance Sheet Movement in Net Assets The NAV per share debt at par on 28 February 2014 was 422.45p 31 December 2013: 426.10p.

AIC Association of Investment Companies, the trade body for Closed-end Investment Companies.
AIFMD Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive.
Issued by the European Parliament in 2012 and 2013, the Directive requires that all investment vehicles in the European Union, including Investment Trusts, must appoint a Depositary and an Alternative Investment Fund Manager before 22 July 2014.
The Board of Directors of an Investment Trust, nevertheless, will remain fully responsible for all aspects of the Companys strategy, operations and compliance with regulations.
Benchmark the FTSE All-World Total Return Index is the benchmark against which the increase or decrease in the Companys net asset value is measured.
The Index averages the performance of a defined selection of companies listed in stock markets around the world and gives an indication of how those markets have performed in any period.
As the investments within this Index are not identical to those of the Company, the Index does not take account of operating costs and the Companys strategy does not include replicating tracking this Index, there is likely to be some level of divergence between the performance of the Company and the Index.
Closed-end company a company, including an Investment Company, with a fixed issued ordinary share capital which is traded on an exchange at a price not necessarily related to the net asset value of the company and which shares can only be issued or bought back by the company in certain circumstances.
This contrasts with an open-ended company or Fund, which has units not traded on an exchange but issued or bought back from investors at a price directly related to net asset value.
Cum-dividend shares are classified as cum-dividend when the buyer of a security is entitled to receive a dividend that has been declared, but not paid.
Shares which are not cum-dividend are described as ex-dividend.
Custodian A specialised financial institution responsible for safeguarding, worldwide, the listed securities and certain cash assets of the Company, as well as the income arising therefrom, through provision of custodial, settlement and associated services.
The Companys Custodian is JP Morgan Chase Bank.
Depositary under AIFMD rules applying from July 2014, the Company must appoint a Depositary, whose duties in respect of investments, cash and similar assets include: safekeeping: verification of ownership and valuation: and cash monitoring.
The Depositary will be strictly liable for loss of any investments or other assets in its custody and will be obliged to maintain oversight of share buy backs, dividend payments and adherence to investment limits.
Derivative a contract between two or more parties, the value of which fluctuates in accordance with the value of an underlying security.
The contract is usually short-term for less than one year.
Examples of derivatives are Put and Call Options, Swap contracts, Futures and Contracts for Difference.
A derivative can be an asset or a liability and is a form of gearing because the fluctuations in its value are usually greater than the fluctuations in the underlying securitys value.
Discount Premium the share price of an Investment Trust is derived from buyers and sellers trading their shares on the stock market.
This price is not identical to the net asset value NAV per share of the underlying assets less liabilities of the Company.
If the share price is lower than the NAV per share, the shares are trading at a discount.
This usually indicates that there are more sellers of shares than buyers.
Shares trading at a price above NAV per share are deemed to be at a premium.
The Board of the Company tries to ensure that the shares trade in normal market conditions at around 90% of the value of the net assets i. e. that the discount is around 10% by means of buying shares from sellers at the below-NAV price and cancelling them.
This effectively creates a profit for the Company and at least temporarily deals with the perceived excess of shares in the market.
Distributable Reserves Reserves distributable by way of dividend or for the purpose of buying back ordinary share capital see notes 19 to 21.
Company Law requires that Share Capital and the Capital Redemption Reserve may not be distributed.
The Companys articles of association currently further restrict it from making distributions by way of dividend out of Capital Reserves although a resolution will be put to shareholders to remove this prohibition.
All dividend payments are currently made out of Revenue Reserve and the cost of all share buybacks is deducted from Capital Reserves.
Dividend Dates Reference is made in announcements of dividends to three dates.
The record date is the date after which buyers of the shares will not be recorded on the shareholders register as qualifying for the pending dividend payment.
The payment date is the date that dividends are credited to shareholders bank accounts.
This may be several weeks or even months after the record date.
The ex-dividend date is normally the second business day prior to the record date most ex-dividend dates are on a Wednesday.
GAAP Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.
This includes UK GAAP and International GAAP IFRS or International Financial Reporting Standards applicable in the European Union.
74 Foreign & Colonial Investment Trust PLC Gearing this is the ratio of the borrowings of the Company to its net assets.
Borrowings have a prior charge over the assets of a company, ranking before ordinary shareholders in their entitlement to capital and or income.
They include: preference shares: debentures: overdrafts and short and long-term loans from banks: and derivative contracts.
If the Company has cash assets, these may be assumed either to net off against borrowings, giving a net or effective gearing percentage, or to be used to buy investments, giving a gross or fully invested gearing figure.
Where cash assets exceed borrowings, the Company is described as having net cash.
The Companys maximum permitted level of gearing is set by the Board and is described within the Strategic Report and Directors Report.
Investment Company Section 833 UK Company Law allows an Investment Company to make dividend distributions out of realised distributable reserves, even in circumstances where it has made Capital losses in any year see note 2 a, provided the Companys assets remaining after payment of the dividend exceed 150% of the liabilities.
An Investment Company is defined as investing its funds in shares, land or other assets with the aim of spreading investment risk.
Investment Trust taxation status Section 1158 UK Corporation Tax law allows an Investment Company referred to in Tax law as an Investment Trust to be exempted from tax on its profits realised on investment transactions, provided it complies with certain rules.
These are similar to Section 833 Company law rules but further require that the Company must be listed on a regulated stock exchange and that it cannot retain more than 15% of income received set out in note 3 on the accounts.
The Directors Report contains confirmation of the Companys compliance with this law and its consequent exemption from taxation on capital gains.
Manager F&C Management Limited F&C, a subsidiary of the F&C Asset Management Group FCAM.
The responsibilities and remuneration of the Manager are set out in the Buisness Model, Directors Report and note 4 on the accounts.
Market capitalisation the stock market quoted price of the Companys shares, multiplied by the number of shares in issue.
If the Companys shares trade at a discount to NAV, the market capitalisation will be lower than the Net asset value.
Net asset value NAV the assets less the liabilities of the Company, as set out on the Balance Sheet, all valued in accordance with the Companys Accounting Policies see note 2 and UK Accounting Standards.
The net assets correspond to Total Shareholders Funds, which comprise the share capital account, capital redemption reserve, and capital and revenue reserves.
The Companys debenture is valued in the Accounts at par redemption value and this Balance Sheet NAV is sometimes referred to as NAV, Debenture at par.
The Debenture trades on the London Stock Exchange at a value higher than its redemption value and the NAV using this debenture value is described as NAV, debenture at market value.
Non-executive Director a Director who has a contract for services, rather than a contract of employment, with the Company.
The Company does not have any executive directors.
Non-executive Directors remuneration is described in detail in the Remuneration Report.
The duties of the Directors, who govern the Company through the auspices of a Board and Committees of the Board, are set out in the Corporate Governance Statement.
Ongoing Charges all operating costs expected to be incurred in future and that are payable by the Company or suffered within underlying investee funds including private equity funds, expressed as a proportion of the average net assets of the Company over the reporting year see Ten year Record.
The costs of buying and selling investments and derivatives are excluded, as are interest costs, taxation, non-recurring costs and the costs of buying back or issuing ordinary shares.
Private Equity an asset consisting of shares and debt in operating companies that are not publicly traded on a stock exchange.
The holdings in such companies may be collected in a Fund which operates as a limited partnership LP, with Partners contributing capital to the Fund over a period of years and receiving proportional repayments of capital and income as and when the investments are sold.

Total expense ratio TER an alternative measure of expenses to Ongoing Charges.
It comprises all operating costs incurred in the reporting period by the Company, calculated as a percentage of the average net assets in that year see Ten Year Record.
Operating costs exclude costs suffered within underlying investee funds, costs of buying and selling investments and derivatives, interest costs, taxation and the costs of buying back or issuing ordinary shares.
Total return the return to shareholders calculated on a per share basis by adding dividends paid in the period to the increase or decrease in the Share Price or NAV in the period.
The dividends are assumed to have been re-invested in the form of shares or net assets, respectively, on the date on which the shares were quoted ex-dividend.
