The Groups Imperial Tobacco Group PLCAnnual Report and Accounts 2013 97 Notes to the Financial Statements 3 SEGMENT INFORMATION Imperial Tobacco comprises two distinct businesses Tobacco and Logistics.
The Tobacco business comprises the manufacture, marketing and sale of tobacco and tobacco-related products, including sales to but not by the Logistics business.
The Logistics business comprises the distribution of tobacco products for tobacco product manufacturers, including Imperial Tobacco, as well as a wide range of non-tobacco products and services.
The Logistics business is run on an operationally neutral basis ensuring all customers are treated equally, and consequently transactions between the Tobacco and Logistics businesses are undertaken on an arms length basis re ecting market prices for comparable goods and services.
During 2013 we reorganised the Tobacco business to manage our footprint based on the strategic role of groups of markets rather than their geographic proximity, with divisions focused on prioritising growth or returns.
Returns markets are typically mature markets where we have relatively large market shares and our objective is to maximise returns over the long term by growing pro ts while actively managing market share.
Growth markets are mainly large pro t or volume pools where we typically have market shares below 15 per cent and where our total tobacco approach provides many opportunities for share and pro t growth both now and in the future.
Following the introduction of these changes we have revised our segmental reporting as required under IFRS 8.
The function of Chief Operating Decision Maker fide ned in IFRS 8, which is to review performance and allocate resources, is performed by the Board and the Chief Executive, who are regularly provided with information on our segments.
This information is used as the basis of the segment revenue and pro t disclosures provided below.
The main pro t measure used by the Board and the Chief Executive is adjusted operating pro t. Segment balance sheet information is not provided to the Board or the Chief Executive.
Our reportable segments are Returns Markets North, Returns Markets South, Growth Markets which includes our Cuban joint ventures and Fontem Ventures and Logistics.
Prevailing market characteristics such as maturity, excise structure and the breadth of the distribution networks determine the allocation of Returns Markets between Returns Markets North and Returns Markets South.
The main tobacco business markets in each of the new reportable segments are: Returns Markets North Australia, Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, Poland, United Kingdom: Returns Markets South France, Spain and our African markets including Algeria, Ivory Coast, Morocco: Growth Markets Iraq, Norway, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, United States of America.
To aid the transition from our former to our new segments we present information below for the current year on both bases, including prior year comparatives.

The programme includes major restructurings of a number of sales forces to align with our strategy, rationalisation of our manufacturing footprint, and aligning organisational structures and resource levels with future requirements.
A number of initiatives have been delivered or are underway, already delivering savings of over 30 million in our 2013 results, mostly in the second half, and we expect this gure to rise signi cantly in 2014.
Cash out ows in 2013 for the programme were around 100 million.
We additionally incurred non-cash charges of around 75 million for asset impairments mainly due to the closure of our facility in Cadiz, and charged provisions of around 50 million for actions taken which will result in cash out ows in future years.
The overall charge for the year for restructuring costs under our cost optimisation programme was consequently around 225 million.
We made additional charges of around 45 million due to other restructuring activity which does not fall under our cost optimisation programme, mainly due to legacy projects and non-material disposals of non-core businesses, bringing our total restructuring costs for 2013 to 270 million 2012: 101 million.
The net charge for the year of 270 million 2012: 101 million included 24 million 2012: 29 million of unused provisions reversed during the year, 163 million 2012: 33 million of additional restructuring provisions and 83 million 2012: 43 million impairment of tangible assets.
The remaining charge of 48 million 2012: 54 million was charged directly to the consolidated income statement as incurred.
Restructuring costs of 101 million in 2012 included impairments of surplus properties in Spain, integration of our American businesses, manufacturing rationalisation in Europe and the streamlining of parts of our Logistics operations.
Restructuring costs are included within administrative and other expenses in the consolidated income statement.

During the year the Group purchased 9 million of intellectual property rights.
Supply agreements include Logistics customer relationships and exclusive supply arrangements in Cuba.
All were acquired under the purchase of Altadis.
Intangible amortisation and impairment are included within administrative and other expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Amortisation and impairment in respect of intangible assets other than software are treated as reconciling items between reported operating pro t and adjusted operating pro t. Impairment charges include 0.6 billion 2012: 1.2 billion in respect of goodwill and other intangible assets relating to the Spanish market, which are explained in more detail below.
Goodwill and intangible asset impairment review Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to bene t from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
For the Tobacco business the groups of CGUs are based on the geographic areas in which the Group operates.
A summary of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with inde nite lives is set out below.

106 Imperial Tobacco Group PLCAnnual Report and Accounts 2013 OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS The Group tests goodwill and intangible assets with inde nite lives for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are any indications that impairment may have arisen.
The value of a CGU, or group of CGUs as appropriate, is based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cash ow projections derived from three year financial plans which are approved by the Board annually and are based on detailed bottom-up market-by-market forecasts of projected sales volumes for each product line.
These forecasts re ect, on an individual market basis, numerous assumptions and estimates regarding anticipated changes in market size, prices and duty regimes, consumer uptrading and downtrading, consumer preferences and other changes in product mix, based on long-term market trends, market data, anticipated regulatory developments, and management experience and expectations.
We consider that pricing, market size, market shares and cost in ation are the key assumptions used in our plans.
Growth rates and discount rates used The compound annual growth rates implicit in these value-in-use calculations are shown below.
2013 2012 Initial growth Long-term Initial growth Long-term % rate rate rate rate Spain 6.5 1.5 1.7 1.5 Other European Union 0.7 1.8 5.8 1.8 Americas 3.4 2.5 5.0 2.5 Cuban cigar joint ventures 7.1 4.0 9.7 4.0 Rest of the World 6.9 4.0 12.0 4.0 Logistics 6.3 1.7 7.4 1.7 Cash ows from the three year plan period are extrapolated out to year five using the growth rate implicit in the three year plan.
Estimated long-term weighted average compound annual growth rates of between 1.5 per cent and 4.0 per cent per annum are used beyond year five.
In addition to the initial growth rates shown above applied to cash ows arising in existing markets, the valuation of the Cuban cigar joint ventures includes assumptions about the timing and extent of cash ows from entry to new markets.
Long-term growth rates are based on managements long-term expectations, taking account of industry speci c factors such as the nature of our products, the role of excise in government scal policy, and relatively stable and predictable long-term macro trends in the Tobacco industry.
Discount rates used are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the different risk pro les of the CGUs.
Pre-tax discount rates in 2013 ranged from 8.4 per cent to 13.5 per cent 2012: 8.5 per cent to 13.1 per cent.
Our impairment projections are prepared under the basis set out in IAS 36 which can differ from our internal plans.
Spain We have reviewed our forecasts for Spain and the carrying value of our Spanish intangible assets in the light of continued economic weakness and duty increases which have led to further legitimate market decline in Spain.
Based on a revised short-term growth rate of -6.5 per cent, our review indicated a further impairment of 580 million this year.
This has reduced our Spanish goodwill by 225 million to nil, and our brand intangibles by 355 million to 815 million.
Further impairment of our Spanish intangible assets could result in the event of an increase in the discount rate, or a reduction in the initial or long-term growth rates, or a reduction in the value of overall cash ows.
An increase of 50 basis points in the discount rate from 13.5 per cent would result in a further impairment of 40 million, a reduction in the initial growth rate of 50 basis points in a further impairment of 23 million, and a reduction of 50 basis points in the long-term growth rate in a further impairment of 25 million.
A reduction of 5 per cent in overall cash ows as compared to those used in our impairment test would result in a further impairment of 58 million.
Other CGUs The impairment test for Americas indicated headroom of 268 million, and that an impairment would result in the event of either an increase in the discount rate of 80 basis points from 9.9 per cent, or a 200 basis point reduction in the short-term growth rate, or a 100 basis point reduction in the long-term growth rate, or an 8 per cent reduction in overall cash ows as compared to those used in our impairment test.
For the rest of the Group, any reasonable movement in the assumptions used in the impairment tests would not result in an impairment.
Effect of segment changes We have performed the 2013 impairment tests as described above and as required by IAS 36 on the basis of our existing CGUs and groups of CGUs established for this purpose in accordance with our accounting policy.
Following our change of segments to align with our strategy and the way we manage the business see note 3, we will in future monitor our goodwill and other intangibles on the basis of CGUs and groups of CGUs consistent with our new segments.

It is generally recognised industry practice to classify leaf tobacco inventory as a current asset although part of such inventory, because of the duration of the processing cycle, ordinarily would not be consumed within one year.
We estimate that around 262 million 2012: 120 million of leaf tobacco held within raw materials will not be utilised within a year of the balance sheet date.

On 2 October 2013, the 500 million 5.125% notes were repaid.
The bank loans and overdrafts are oating rate liabilities.
The capital market issuances in place at the balance sheet date bear interest before the effects of derivative financial instruments which are detailed in note 20 at a xed rate throughout their life.
The Group has not defaulted on any borrowings during the year 2012: no defaults.
All borrowings except finance leases are unsecured.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLCAnnual Report and Accounts 2013 111 Notes to the Financial Statements 18 BORROWINGS CONTINUED Undrawn borrowing facilities At 30 September the Group had the following undrawn committed facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date: million 2013 2012 Amounts maturing: Between one and two years 251 639 Between two and five years 3,474 2,415 3,725 3,054 Included within the amount of 3,474 million maturing between two and five years is a facility of 990 million which was contractually agreed as at the year end but is not available to be drawn down until 22 November 2013.
Non-current financial liabilities The maturity pro le of the carrying amount of the Groups non-current financial liabilities at 30 September including net derivative financial liabilities detailed in note 20 was as follows: 2013 2012 Net derivative Net derivative financial financial million Borrowings liabilities Total Borrowings liabilities Total Amounts maturing: Between one and two years 1 72 73 2,011 29 1,982 Between two and five years 3,688 24 3,712 2,118 34 2,152 In five years or more 4,169 123 4,292 4,204 88 4,292 7,858 219 8,077 8,333 93 8,426 19 FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS Financial risk management Overview In the normal course of business, the Group is exposed to amongst other risks market, liquidity and credit risk.
This note explains the Groups exposure to these risks, how they are measured and assessed, and summarises the policies and processes used to manage them, including those related to the management of capital.
The Group operates a centralised treasury function, Group Treasury, which is responsible for the management of the financial risks of the Group, together with its nancing and liquidity requirements.
It does not operate as a pro t centre, nor does it enter into speculative transactions.
The Group Treasury Committee GTC oversees the operation of Group Treasury in accordance with terms of reference set out by the Board.
The Board reviews and approves all major treasury decisions.
The GTC currently comprises the Group Finance Director, the Company Secretary and other senior management from Group Finance, Manufacturing and Group Treasury.
The GTC agrees a framework which sets out the current expectations and boundaries to assist in the effective oversight of Group Treasury activities, covering all key areas within Group Treasury.
The Group Treasurer reports on a regular basis to the Board, including the provision of a monthly treasury report which is also provided to the GTC.
Market risk Price risk The Group is not exposed to equity securities price risk or financial instrument price risk other than its pension assets disclosed in note 22.
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk in that there may be uctuations in the price of tobacco leaf.
As with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf tends to be cyclical as supply and demand considerations in uence tobacco plantings in those countries where tobacco is grown.
Also, different regions may experience variations in weather patterns that may affect crop quality or supply and so lead to changes in price.
The Group seeks to reduce this price risk by sourcing tobacco leaf from a number of different countries and counterparties and by varying the levels of tobacco leaf held.
Currently, these techniques reduce the expected exposure to this risk to levels considered not material and accordingly, no sensitivity analysis has been presented.
Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates due to its commercial trading transactions denominated in foreign currencies, foreign currency cash deposits, borrowings and non-sterling derivatives.
Currently, the Groups financial results are principally exposed to gains or losses arising from uctuations in sterling-euro and sterling-US dollar exchange rates.
112 Imperial Tobacco Group PLCAnnual Report and Accounts 2013 OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS Translation risk The Group has a policy of managing its balance sheet translation risk by funding material acquisitions and the underlying material business assets with borrowings post cross currency swaps, where necessary in the currency of the underlying net assets.
This also results in foreign currency operating pro ts being partially offset by foreign currency interest costs thereby minimising the translation exposure on foreign currency pro ts after tax.
The Group issues debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of raising new finance and has a policy of using derivative financial instruments, such as cross currency swaps and foreign exchange swaps where necessary, to change the debt into the desired currency.
Transaction risk Material costs denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of subsidiaries include the purchase of tobacco leaf, which is sourced from various countries but purchased principally in US dollars, and packaging materials which are sourced from various countries and purchased in a number of currencies.
After taking into account other US dollar in ows the Group currently does not consider this foreign exchange cash ow risk to be material enough to hedge.
The Groups sterling dividend to shareholders is partly sourced from foreign subsidiary earnings.
In order to manage the foreign exchange cash ow risk, and to provide greater certainty as to the amount of sterling available to pay expected future dividends, the Group has entered into transactional cross currency swaps maturing between now and 2015 that will convert expected euro dividends from subsidiaries into sterling.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The tables below illustrate the Groups currency exposures arising on financial assets and liabilities held by Group companies in currencies other than their functional currencies and resulting in exchange movements in the income statement and balance sheet.

Other larger or smaller changes are also possible.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the designated net investment hedges in place at 30 September.
The sensitivity analysis does not re ect any change to revenue or nonfinance costs that may result from changing exchange rates and ignores any taxation implications and offsetting effects of derivative financial instruments fair value movements.
The effect in the consolidated income statement from foreign exchange rate movements primarily relates to financial instruments that commercially hedge Group exposures, but which are not accounted for as hedges under IAS 39 although commercially effective see note 20 for hedge accounting.
This value is expected to be substantially offset by related movements through other comprehensive income and, accordingly, any residual gain or loss is excluded from our adjusted performance measures.
At 30 September 2013, approximately 16 per cent 2012: 24 per cent of reported net debt was denominated in sterling, 70 per cent in euro 2012: 56 per cent and 14 per cent in US dollars 2012: 20 per cent.
Cash ow and fair value interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents.
Borrowings at variable rates expose the Group to cash ow interest rate risk.
Borrowings at xed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Group Treasury monitors the Groups borrowing levels using adjusted net debt which excludes interest accruals, the fair value of derivative financial instruments providing commercial cash ow hedges and finance lease liabilities.
The Group transacts interest rate swaps to achieve an appropriate balance of xed and oating interest rates within limits set out in the interest rate risk section of the framework, approved by the GTC.
At 30 September 2013, including the effect of derivative financial instruments detailed in note 20, 49 per cent 2012: 31 per cent of reported net debt was at oating rates of interest and 51 per cent 2012: 69 per cent was at xed rates of interest.
114 Imperial Tobacco Group PLCAnnual Report and Accounts 2013 OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS Interest rate sensitivity analysis The table below illustrates the effect on the income statement of movements in interest rates related to the Groups net variable rate debt.
These movements have no net impact on other comprehensive income.

The above movements in interest rates are considered to represent reasonably possible changes.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt and the ratio of xed to oating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio are all constant.
The impact in the consolidated income statement due to changes in interest rates re ects the effect on net finance costs in respect of the Groups oating rate debt at 30 September, and ignores any taxation implications and offsetting effects of derivative financial instruments fair value movements.
Interest rate risk on Group borrowings is managed by issuing debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of raising new finance and then using derivative financial instruments where necessary to change the debt into the appropriate proportions of xed and oating interest rates in accordance with the interest rate risk management section of the framework.
Interest rate swaps entered into in order to change xed rate debt into oating rate debt match the maturity pro le of the underlying debt.
The Group is therefore exposed to the risk that interest rates will increase over time which will increase the cost of the oating rate portion of the debt portfolio.
The maturity pro le of the Groups borrowings is detailed in the contractual cash ows table below, which also includes the net contractual cash ows on derivative financial instruments as detailed in note 20, as part of the Groups liquidity risk.
Liquidity risk The Group is exposed to liquidity risk, which represents the risk of having insuf cient funds to meet its nancing needs.
To manage this risk the Group has a policy of actively maintaining a mixture of short, medium and long-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has suf cient available funds for the forecast requirements of the Group over the short to medium term.
To prevent over-reliance on individual sources of liquidity, funding is provided by a range of instruments including bank loans, credit facilities, commercial paper and corporate bonds.
Management periodically performs stress tests and sensitivity analyses on these forecasts, which are subsequently reviewed by the Audit Committee.
The Group is exposed to liquidity risk as a result of credit risk on undrawn committed borrowing facilities or when drawn committed facilities are due to be rolled over: that is to say if a counterparty was unable to provide credit as it was required to do so, the Group would have increased liquidity risk.
Undrawn committed borrowing facilities are detailed in note 18. Credit risk for financial counterparties is discussed below in the credit risk section.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLCAnnual Report and Accounts 2013 115 Notes to the Financial Statements 19 FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS CONTINUED As well as forecasting and monitoring the Groups core liquidity needs, the Group Treasury function is in regular dialogue with subsidiary companies to ensure their liquidity needs are met.
Subsidiary companies are funded by a combination of share capital and retained earnings, loans from central finance companies on commercial terms, or in some limited cases through local borrowings by the subsidiaries in the required currencies.
Available liquidity from subsidiary companies is remitted to Group Treasury where practical and possible on a regular basis.
The table below summarises the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities by maturity based on their contractual cash ows.
The contractual cash ows disclosed in the table include interest to be paid, are undiscounted and have been calculated using spot rates of exchange at the relevant balance sheet date.

The Group fide fines capital as adjusted net debt see note 30 and equity attributable to owners of the parent company see Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The only externally imposed capital requirements for the Group are interest cover and gearing covenants under the terms of the bank facilities, with which we have fully complied during both the current period and the prior period.
The Group manages the capital structure to maintain an investment grade credit rating and has taken and will continue to take the appropriate measures to maintain this, including ongoing consideration of the return of capital to shareholders through an appropriate mix of share buybacks and dividends, or raising equity to finance material acquisitions.
Fair value estimation and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities All financial assets and financial liabilities are carried on the balance sheet at amortised cost, other than derivative financial instruments, which are carried at fair value.
All derivative financial instruments are valued using techniques based signi cantly on observable market data such as yield curves and foreign exchange rates, as at the balance sheet date Level 2 classi cation hierarchy of IFRS 7.
With the exception of issued bonds, the fair value of all financial assets and financial liabilities is considered to be approximate to their carrying amount.
Set out below is a comparison of carrying amount of the Groups bonds as detailed in note 18 to their fair value, by currency.
The fair value of these bonds has been determined by reference to market prices as at the balance sheet date.

Trade and other receivables The Group has some signi cant concentrations of customer credit risk.
However, the Group has implemented policies to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history and obtains guarantees or other means of credit support to reduce the risk where this is considered necessary.
Analysis of trade and other receivables is provided in note 15.
Financial instruments The Group has a policy of having no concentrations of credit risk from financial institutions that are in excess of limits agreed by the Group Treasury Committee.
The Group has placed cash deposits and entered into derivative financial instruments with a diversi ed group of financial institutions with suitable credit ratings in order to manage its credit risk with any one financial institution.
Utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored and to reduce credit exposures, the Group has ISDA Master Agreements with most of its counterparties for financial derivatives, which permit net settlement of assets and liabilities in certain circumstances.
In limited cases, collateral is deposited against derivative financial liabilities and these are supported by an ISDA Credit Support Annex in each case.
The table below summarises the Groups 5 largest financial institution counterparties, based on maximum exposure to credit risk, by credit rating and balances at 30 September.

In order to disclose more comparable data from year-to-year, the presentation of these tables has been changed to include all derivative financial instruments, as prior year disclosures showed only derivative financial liabilities.
Derivatives as hedging instruments The Group has entered into various cross currency swaps, forward foreign currency contracts, interest rate swaps and swaptions to manage foreign exchange and interest rate risk arising on financial assets and liabilities.
These risks are discussed in more detail in note 19.
The Group hedges underlying exposures in an ef cient, commercial and structured manner.
However, the strict hedging requirements of IAS 39 may lead to some commercially effective hedge positions not qualifying for hedge accounting.
As a result, and as permitted under IAS 39, the Group has decided not to apply cash ow or fair value hedge accounting for its derivative financial instruments.
However, the Group does apply net investment hedging, designating certain borrowings and derivatives as hedges of the net investment in the Groups foreign operations, as permitted by IAS 39, in order to minimise income statement volatility.
Applied as commercial hedges As mentioned in note 19, interest rate risk on Group borrowings is managed by issuing debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of raising new finance and then using derivative financial instruments where necessary to change the debt into the appropriate proportions of xed and oating interest rates in accordance with the interest rate risk section of the risk management framework.

Assumptions have been made based on market information and from counterparties expectations at 30 September 2013 to determine whether, and if so when, such options are likely to be exercised in order to determine the probable maturity date.
The actual maturity date could be earlier or later depending upon future market conditions and a cancellation would not result in a cash ow other than in respect of interest outstanding at the cancellation date.
The effect of the cancellation of any of these interest rate swaps would be to reduce the proportion of the Groups borrowings that were at a xed rate, increasing the Groups exposure to cash ow interest rate risk.
The embedded options are as follows: 15 million interest rate swap maturing in 2031 where the counterparty has the option to cancel every six months throughout the life of the trade.
This trade is expected to be cancelled in October 2023.
50 million interest rate swap maturing in 2041 where the counterparty has the option to cancel every five years throughout the life of the trade.
Additionally, the Group has entered into several forward starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of 1,266 million equivalent 2012: 1,135 million equivalent with tenors extending between 5 and 10 years, starting between April 2014 and May 2017.
The fair value of these swaps was a net liability of 43 million 2012: net liability of 73 million as at the balance sheet date.
The Group has sold options to two counterparties providing them with the right to transact interest rate swaps with notional values of 100 million and 100 million.
The options are available for exercise by the counterparty on 27 March 2014 and 30 April 2014 and if exercised, would result in the Group paying xed rates of 2.79 per cent and 2.72 per cent respectively for 5 years.
The fair value of these instruments was a net liability of 11 million as at the balance sheet date 2012: net liability of 13 million.
Forward foreign currency contracts The Group has entered into forward foreign currency contracts to manage short-term foreign currency exposures.
As at 30 September 2013 the notional amount of these contracts was 3,011 million equivalent 2012: 2,373 million equivalent and the fair value of these swaps and contracts was a net liability of 47 million 2012: net asset of 2 million as at the balance sheet date.
Cross currency swaps The Group has entered into cross currency swaps to manage the risk of foreign exchange cash ows relating to interest and dividends.
As at the balance sheet date, the following cross currency swaps were in place for the reasons set out below.
To manage foreign exchange cash ow risk associated with converting euro dividends from subsidiaries into sterling.
As at 30 September 2013 the notional amount of these contracts was 1,299 million equivalent 2012: 2,311 million and the fair value of these swaps was a net liability of 69 million 2012: net asset of 9 million.
Principal amounts are exchanged at the start and maturity of these trades.
To convert issued xed rate debt into the desired currency at oating rates of interest.
As at 30 September 2013 the notional amount of these contracts was 650 million equivalent 2012: 1,828 million equivalent and the fair value of these swaps was a net liability of 73 million 2012: net liability of 100 million.
To convert oating rate sterling debt after interest rate swaps into the desired currency at oating rates of interest.
As at 30 September 2013 the notional amount of these contracts was 1,000 million equivalent 2012: nil and the fair value of these swaps was a net liability of 1 million 2012: nil.
Principal amounts will be exchanged at maturity of these trades.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLCAnnual Report and Accounts 2013 119 Notes to the Financial Statements 20 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations At 30 September 2013 external debt with a carrying value of 6,507 million 2012: 6,424 million and cross currency swaps with a notional value of 2,835 million 2012: 2,922 million have been designated as hedges of the net investment in the Groups foreign operations.
To the extent that these hedges are effective, gains or losses on the retranslation of these borrowings and derivatives are recognised in other comprehensive income to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the Groups foreign operations.
Permanent intra-Group loans with a fair value of 5,608 million 2012: 6,792 million as at the balance sheet date have been treated as a reduction in investments in the Groups foreign operations, in line with IAS 21.
During the year, as a result of net investment hedging, foreign exchange losses amounting to 662 million 2012: 1,143 million gain were transferred to reserves through other comprehensive income.

As at the balance sheet date, deferred tax assets of 598 million 2012: 593 million have not been recognised due to the potential uncertainty of the utilisation of the underlying tax losses in certain jurisdictions.
Of these unrecognised deferred tax assets, 486 million 2012: 539 million losses are expected to expire at approximately 60 million 2012: 60 million per annum between 2014 and 2021, 12 million 2012: 12 million are expected to expire within 5 years, 15 million 2012: nil are expected to expire within 7 years and 69 million 2012: 38 million are expected to expire between 2023 and 2029.
Also within other temporary differences, deferred tax assets of 22 million 2012: 48 million are recognised for tax credits carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the tax related bene t through future taxable pro ts is probable.
Deferred tax assets of 131 million 2012: 57 million have not been recognised due to the potential uncertainty of the utilisation of the credits.
These unrecognised deferred tax assets are expected to expire between 2016 and 2021.
We have reviewed the recoverability of deferred tax assets in an overseas territory in the light of further economic deterioration in economic indicators.
Consequently, we have reduced deferred tax assets by 44 million 2012: 55 million relating to losses and tax credits previously recognised on the basis that it was more likely than not that these were not recoverable.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 7 billion 2012: 8 billion.
A provision of 6 million 2012: 6 million has been made for taxation expected to arise on a planned future dividend payment of 92 million from one subsidiary.
No liability has been recognised in respect of other differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The rate of UK corporation tax was reduced by 1 per cent from 24 per cent to 23 per cent from 1 April 2013.
Further reductions to 21 per cent from 1 April 2014 and 20 per cent from 1 April 2015 were enacted at the balance sheet date and are re ected in the deferred tax balances.
22 RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES The Group operates a number of retirement bene t schemes for its employees, including both fide ned bene t and fide ned contribution schemes.
The Groups two principal schemes are final salary fide ned bene t schemes and are operated by Imperial Tobacco Limited in the UK and Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH in Germany.
The UK schemes assets are held in trustee administered funds, whereas the German scheme is unfunded.
The UK fide ned bene t scheme was closed to new members with effect from 1 October 2010 and since that date new employees are offered a fide ned contribution scheme instead.
The results of the most recent actuarial valuation for the principal UK scheme have been updated to 30 September 2013 by Towers Watson Limited, actuaries and consultants, in order to determine the amounts to be included in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
Actuarial valuations of the pension liabilities of other schemes of the Group were made as at or updated to 30 September 2013 by the various actuaries to those schemes.

This level of contribution will be reviewed again when the next triennial valuation is completed later this year at which time future payments may be increased or decreased.
In relation to the last triennial valuation, the assumptions which had the most signi cant effect when valuing the ITPFs liabilities were those relating to the rate of investment return on the ITPFs existing assets, the rates of increase in pay and pensions and estimated mortality rates.
On the basis that the ITPF is continuing, it was assumed that the future investment returns relative to market values at the valuation date would be 5.5 per cent per annum and that pay and pension increases would average 5.0 per cent and 3.5 per cent respectively.
The assets were brought into account at their market value.
At 31 March 2010 the market value of the invested assets of the ITPF was 2,622 million.
The total assets were suf cient to cover 100 per cent of the bene ts that had accrued to members for past service, after allowing for expected future pay increases.
The total assets were suf cient to cover 88 per cent of the total bene ts that had accrued to members for past service and future service bene ts for current members.

In the opinion of the Groups lawyers, the Group has meritorious defences to these actions, all of which are being vigorously contested.
Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending litigation, the Directors believe that the pending actions will not have a material adverse effect upon the results of the operations, cash ow or financial condition of the Group.
Consequently, the Group has not provided for any amounts in respect of these cases in the financial statements.
In August 2012 Imperial Tobacco Ukraine ITU received a decision from the State Tax Service Department the Department seeking to apply financial sanctions equivalent to approximately 87 million based on ITUs alleged contravention of the law on state regulation of production and circulation of alcohol and tobacco, by engaging in the wholesale trade of tobacco without the correct licence.
ITUs appeal against the decision was upheld by the Circuit Administrative Court in Kiev in October 2012.
The Departments appeal to the Kiev Administrative Court of Appeal was dismissed in February 2013 and its further appeal to the Superior Administrative Court of Ukraine was dismissed in June 2013.
In August 2013, the Superior Administrative Court of Ukraine dismissed the Departments application for its decision to be reviewed by the Supreme Court of Ukraine.
There are limited circumstances in which the Department could le a further appeal and ITU has been advised that the prospect of this happening is low.
As a consequence, the Group has not provided for any amount in the financial statements in respect of this matter.
29 ACQUISITIONS In July 2013, the Group purchased the sales and distribution business of our former agent in Cambodia, for a total consideration 41 million, of which 6 million is deferred until 2014.
This gave rise to goodwill of 41 million, largely representing the value of the sales force in place.
