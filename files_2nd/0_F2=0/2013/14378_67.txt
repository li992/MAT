Smith & Nephew ANNuAl report 2013 106 FiNANCiAl StAtemeNtS Notes to the Group accounts continued 3 Operating profit ACCOUNTING POLICIES Research and development Research expenditure is expensed as occurred.
Internal development expenditure is only capitalised if the recognition criteria in IAS 38 Intangible Assets have been satisfied.
The Group considers that the regulatory, technical and market uncertainties inherent in the development of new products mean that in most cases development costs should not be capitalised as intangible assets until products receive approval from the appropriate regulatory body.
Payments to third parties for research and development projects are accounted for based on the substance of the arrangement.
If the arrangement represents outsourced research and development activities the payments are generally expensed except in limited circumstances where the respective development expenditure would be capitalised under the principles established in IAS 38.
By contrast, the payments are capitalised if the arrangement represents consideration for the acquisition of intellectual property developed at the risk of the third party.
Capitalised development expenditures are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives from product launch.
Advertising costs Expenditure on advertising costs is expensed as incurred.

3.5 Legal provision In 2011, the Group established a provision of $23m in connection with the previously disclosed investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and Department of Justice DOJ into potential violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the medical devices industry.
On 6 February 2012, Smith & Nephew announced that it had reached settlement with the SEC and DOJ in connection with this matter.
Smith & Nephew paid slightly less than $23m in fines and profit disgorgement and committed to maintain an enhanced compliance programme and appoint an independent monitor for at least 18 months to review and report on its compliance programme.
The monitors final report was filed in late 2013, and the independent monitorship has now been terminated.
The settlement agreements impose detailed reporting, compliance and other requirements on Smith & Nephew for a three-year term.
Failure to comply with these requirements, or any other violation of law, could have severe consequences for the Group.
