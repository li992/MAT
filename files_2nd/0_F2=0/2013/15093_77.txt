Generally, the more senior the employee, the higher the proportion of the remuneration package is delivered through performance-related pay, which has a greater linkage to the results of the Group.
All eligible employees may participate in a Sharesave scheme, under which all employees may save up to 250 per month over a three year period.
How shareholders views are taken into account The remuneration committee encourages dialogue with shareholders and considers their feedback and guidance from shareholder representative bodies as part of any executive remunerative review and when formulating any material changes to the remuneration policy.
Base salary and benefits Executive directors base salaries are reviewed annually by the committee, taking into account the responsibilities, skills and experience of each individual, pay and employment conditions within the company and the Group, and salary levels within listed companies of a similar size.
Following a review of executive salaries in March 2013 against benchmark data for comparable companies it was agreed not to increase salaries.
Current base salary levels are as follows: From 29 April 2013 From 30 April 2012 Julian Dunkerton Chief Executive Officer 400,000 400,000 1 Susanne Given Chief Operating Officer 350,000 350,000 James Holder Brand and Design Director 300,000 300,000 2 Theo Karpathios Chief Executive Officer Wholesale and International n a 300,000 3 Shaun Wills Chief Financial Officer 250,000 250,000 1 From appointment on 10 April 2012.
Taxable benefits for 2013 related to the provision of medical and life insurance and, to certain executive directors, a car allowance.
In addition, the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer may reclaim relocation and accommodation costs incurred, up to pre-agreed limits.
Pension The Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer are eligible to participate in the companys Group Personal Pension Scheme GPPS whereby for an executive contribution of 5% of base salary, the company contributes 7.5% of base salary.
Annual bonus An annual bonus arrangement was introduced for 2013 for the COO and CFO although as disclosed last year, the COOs payout was guaranteed as part of her joining arrangements.
The committee agreed to a guaranteed bonus for the COO recognising that whilst this is not generally best practice, it was necessary in the specific circumstances to enable the business to be able to secure this particular individual.
The maximum bonus opportunity will continue to be 100% of base salary for 2014 and payouts will be based on the achievement of challenging financial metrics.
In addition to the COO and CFO, the Chief Executive Officer and Brand and Design Director will participate from 2014 onwards.
Specific targets have not been disclosed as they are considered to be commercially confidential but they are considered by the committee to be demanding.
22225.04 25 July 2013 7:38 PM Proof 8 Financial Statements Governance Performance Introduction 52 SuperGroup Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Directors Remuneration Report Long-term incentives The SuperGroup Performance Share Plan enables the company to incentivise and reward participants appropriately for contributing to the delivery of the companys strategic objectives and to provide an appropriate level of long-term performance pay.
Under the PSP, each year individuals may receive awards of shares in the company which will normally vest three years after they are awarded, subject to the satisfaction of sliding scale performance conditions measured over a three year period and continued service.
Although founder directors are eligible to participate in the PSP, the committee believes that their significant shareholdings in the company are sufficient to incentivise them and align interests with longer term company performance at the current time.
Therefore, awards under the PSP for 2013 will be restricted to the Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and below board senior executives senior executives.
The PSPs individual annual limit is a maximum of 200% of an individuals base salary with scope to grant up to 300% of base salary in exceptional circumstances e. g. on recruitment.
For 2013, the normal grant policy for executive directors excluding founder directors will be 100% of salary.
Actual award levels to senior executives are generally significantly below the maximum levels.
Consistent with the 2012 awards, performance will be 70% based on sliding scale EPS and 30% based on TSR relative to a selected group of companies as measured over a three year period to the end of financial year 2016.
Performance targets have yet to be determined for the 2013 awards which will be granted later in the year although full disclosure of the targets will be provided in the London Stock Exchange announcement which will be published shortly after the awards will be granted.
The remuneration committee is comfortable that the blend of EPS and TSR targets provides a balance between incentivising and rewarding strong financial performance while creating a strong alignment with the interests of institutional shareholders by rewarding stock market outperformance.
Executives may benefit, in the form of additional cash or shares, from the value of dividends paid over the vesting period, to the extent that awards vest.
Targets for 2012 award Seventy per cent of the 2012 PSP award is subject to an EPS performance condition: 25% of this element of the award will vest for average annual EPS growth of 12% in excess of RPI, increasing on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting for EPS growth of at least 18% per annum in excess of RPI.
The remaining 30% of the 2012 PSP award is subject to a TSR performance condition, measuring the companys TSR against a comparator group comprising FTSE All-Share companies in the following subsectors: Apparel Retailers, Broadline Retailers, Clothing and Accessories, Furnishings, Home Improvement Retailers, Recreational Products & Services, Restaurants & Bars, Specialty Retailers and Toys.
Twenty-five per cent of this part of the award will vest if the companys TSR is ranked at the median of the comparator companies, increasing on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting if the companys TSR is ranked at the upper quartile of the comparator group.
