The market value of investment and development property at 31 December 2013 includes 29.3 million in respect of property considered to be developments.
These are accounted for as investment property and are valued using the same methodology as other investment property.
The Group has only one class of investment and development property asset.
All the Groups significant investment and development property relates to prime shopping centres which share similar nature, characteristics and risks.
co. uk Strategic report Governance Accounts Other information 125 Accounts 20 Investment and development property continued Valuation methodology The fair value of the Groups investment and development property as at 31 December 2013 was determined by independent external valuers at that date.
The valuations are in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS Valuation Professional Standards 2012 and were arrived at by reference to market transactions for similar properties.
Fair values for investment properties are calculated using the present value income approach.
The main assumptions underlying the valuations are in relation to rent profile and yields as discussed below.
The key driver of the property valuations is the terms of the leases in place at the valuation date.
These determine the majority of the cash flow profile of the property for a number of years and therefore form the base of the valuation.
The valuation assumes adjustments from these rental values to current market rent at the time of the next rent review where a typical lease allows only for upward adjustment and as leases expire and are replaced by new leases.
The current market level of rent is assessed based on evidence provided by the most recent relevant leasing transactions and negotiations.
This is based on evidence available at the date of valuation and does not assume future increases in market rent.
The nominal equivalent yield is applied as a discount rate to the rental cash flows which, after taking into account other input assumptions such as vacancies and costs, generates the market value of the property.
The nominal equivalent yield applied is assessed by reference to market transactions for similar properties and takes into account, amongst other things, any risks associated with the rent uplift assumptions.
Annual property income as disclosed in the table below reflects current annualised gross income.
Full definitions of nominal equivalent yield and annual property income are provided in the glossary.
The net initial yield is calculated as the current net income over the gross market value of the asset and is used as a sense check and to compare against market transactions for similar properties.
A full definition of net initial yield is provided in the glossary.
The valuation output, along with inputs and assumptions, are reviewed to ensure these are in line with what a market participant would use when pricing each asset.
A significant change in the nominal equivalent yield in isolation, would result in a significant change in the value of investment and development property.
A decrease in nominal equivalent yield of 50 basis points would result in an increase in the total market value of 747 million, while a 50 basis point increase would result in a decrease in the total market value of 635 million.

The Group provides data to the valuers, including current lease and tenant data along with asset specific business plans.
The valuers use this and other inputs including market transactions for similar properties to produce valuations.
These valuations and the assumptions they have made are then discussed and reviewed with the Group's asset management team and Directors.

The initial exchange price was 4.3752 per ordinary share, a conversion rate of approximately 22,856 ordinary shares for every 100,000 nominal of the 2.5 per cent bonds.
Under the terms of the 2.5 per cent bonds, the exchange price is adjusted on the happening of certain events including the payment of dividends by the Company.
Accordingly, subsequent dividend adjustments resulted in an exchange price at 31 December 2013 of 4.1199 per ordinary share.
The 2.5 per cent bonds may be redeemed at par at the Companys option subject to the Companys ordinary share price having traded at 30 per cent above the conversion price for a specified period, or at any time once 85 per cent by nominal value of the 2.5 per cent bonds originally issued have been converted or cancelled.
If not previously converted, redeemed or purchased and cancelled, the 2.5 per cent bonds will be redeemed at par on 4 October 2018.
A total of 300.0 million nominal of the 2.5 per cent bonds were issued and remain outstanding at 31 December 2013.
The 2.5 per cent bonds are designated as at fair value through profit or loss and so are presented on the balance sheet at fair value with all gains and losses taken to the income statement through the changes in fair value of financial instruments line.
At 31 December 2013, the fair value of the 2.5 per cent bonds was 312.8 million 2012 311.0 million, with the change in fair value presented in note 14.
The 2.5 per cent bonds are listed on the Professional Securities Market of the London Stock Exchange.
During the year interest of 7.5 million 2012 1.8 million in respect of these bonds has been recognised within finance costs.
3.75 per cent convertible bonds the 3.75 per cent bonds On 28 January 2011 the Company issued 127.6 million, 3.75 per cent perpetual subordinated convertible bonds as part of the consideration for the acquisition of intu Trafford Centre.
As a condition of the acquisition the Company also issued to the Peel Group 26.7 million of convertible bonds for a subscription amount of 23.7 million and an implied issue price of the underlying shares of 3.55 per share.
A total of 154.3 million of the 3.75 per cent bonds were issued and remain outstanding at 31 December 2013 2012 154.3 million.
These are accounted for as equity at their fair value on issue which totalled 143.7 million 2012 143.7 million.
The 3.75 per cent bonds can be converted at the option of the bondholder at any time from 28 January 2013 at 4.00 per ordinary share, a conversion rate of 250 ordinary shares for every 1,000 nominal.
Full conversion would result in 38,579,250 ordinary shares being issued.
The 3.75 per cent bonds became redeemable at their principal amount at the Companys option from 28 January 2014 on any subsequent interest payment date, or at any time once 85 per cent or more of the principal amount of the bonds originally issued have been converted or cancelled.
During the year interest of 5.8 million 2012 5.8 million has been recognised on these bonds directly in equity.
This is deducted in arriving at earnings per share note 18.
34 Operating leases The Group earns rental income by leasing its investment properties to tenants under operating leases.
In the UK the standard shopping centre lease is for a term of 10 to 15 years.
Standard lease provisions include service charge payments, recovery of other direct costs and review every five years to market rent.
Standard turnover based leases have a turnover percentage agreed with each lessee which is applied to a retail units annual sales and any excess between the resulting turnover rent and the minimum rent is receivable by the Group.

co. uk Strategic report Governance Accounts Other information 135 Accounts 35 Financial risk management The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks arising from the Groups operations being principally market risk including interest rate risk, and foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The majority of the Groups financial risk management is carried out by the Group treasury department and the policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are summarised below.
Market risk a Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises of both cash flow and fair value risks.
Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of financial instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Bank debt is typically issued at floating rates linked to LIBOR.
Bond debt and other capital market debt are generally issued at fixed rates.
It is Group policy, and often a requirement of the Groups lenders, to eliminate substantially all short and medium-term exposure to interest rate fluctuations in order to establish certainty over medium-term cash flows by using floating to fixed interest rate swaps.
Such swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates.
As a consequence, the Group is exposed to market price risk in respect of the fair value of its fixed rate interest rate swaps, as discussed in the Financial review on pages 48 to 53.
The table below shows the effects of interest rate swaps on the borrowings profile of the Group: Fixed Floating Fixed Floating 2013 2013 2012 2012 m m m m 1 Borrowings 2,292.8 1,640.6 1,041.5 2,611.5 Derivative impact nominal value of interest rate swaps 1,311.8 1,311.8 2,440.4 2,440.4 Net borrowings profile 3,604.6 328.8 3,482.0 171.0 Interest rate protection 91.6% 95.3% 1 Borrowings are stated at nominal value and exclude the Metrocentre compound financial instrument.
At 31 December 2013 they include the 285.0 million 2012 nil drawn under the revolving credit facility which incurs interest at a variable rate.
Excluding the revolving credit facility borrowing interest rate protection is 98.8 per cent 2012 95.3 per cent.
Group policy is to target interest rate protection within the range of 75 per cent to 100 per cent.
The weighted average rate for interest rate swaps currently effective is 2.70 per cent 2012 3.95 per cent.
Unallocated and forward starting swaps are excluded from the above calculation.
The nominal value of these swaps is 746.7 million of which 125.0 million are forward starting.
Their fair value of 142.9 million is included as a liability in the balance sheet.
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift upwards in the level of interest rates would be a positive movement of 73.9 million 2012 101.9 million in the fair value of derivatives.
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift downwards in the level of interest rates would be a negative movement of 78.9 million 2012 108.3 million in the fair value of derivatives.
In practice, a parallel shift in the yield curve is highly unlikely.
However, the above sensitivity analysis is a reasonable illustration of the possible effect from the changes in slope and shifts in the yield curve that may actually occur.
Where the fixed rate derivative financial instruments are matched by floating rate debt, the overall effect on Group cash flow of such a movement would be very small.
b Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a functional currency other than sterling.
The Groups policy is to ensure the Groups net exposure to foreign currency is less than 10 per cent of the Groups equity attributable to owners of the Company.
At 31 December 2013 the Groups exposure amounted to 7.6 per cent of equity attributable to owners of the Company 31 December 2012 6.4 per cent.

The approximate impact of a 10 per cent depreciation in foreign exchange rates would be a negative movement of 24.2 million 2012 17.2 million to equity attributable to owners of the Company.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is managed to ensure that the Group is able to meet future payment obligations when financial liabilities fall due.
Liquidity analysis is conducted to ensure that sufficient headroom is available to meet the Groups operational requirements and committed investments.
The Group treasury policy aims to meet this objective through maintaining adequate cash, marketable securities and committed facilities to meet these requirements.
Undrawn borrowing facilities are detailed in note 31.
The Groups policy is to seek to optimise its exposure to liquidity risk by balancing its exposure to interest rate risk and to refinancing risk.
In effect the Group seeks to borrow for as long as possible at the lowest acceptable cost.
Group policy is to maintain a weighted average debt maturity of over five years.
As at 31 December 2013, the maturity profile of Group debt showed an average maturity of eight years 2012 six years.
The Group regularly reviews the maturity profile of its borrowings and seeks to avoid bunching of maturities through the regular replacement of facilities and by arranging a selection of maturity dates.
Refinancing risk may be reduced by re-borrowing prior to the contracted maturity date, effectively switching liquidity risk for market risk.
The tables below set out the maturity analysis of the Groups financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual obligations to make payments of interest and to repay principal.
Where interest payment obligations are based on a floating rate the rates used are those implied by the par yield curve for the relevant currency.
Where payment obligations are in foreign currencies, the spot exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date is used.

Credit risk arises primarily from trade receivables relating to tenants but also from the Groups holdings of assets with counterparties such as cash deposits and derivative instruments.
Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed: tenants are managed individually by asset managers, who continuously monitor and work with tenants, aiming wherever possible to identify and address risks prior to default.
Prospective tenants are assessed via a review process, including obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial information, which is conducted internally.
As a result deposits or guarantees may be obtained.
The amount of deposits held as collateral at 31 December 2013 is 4.0 million 2012 2.7 million.
It is Group policy to calculate any impairment of receivables specifically on each contract.
The ageing analysis of trade receivables is as follows: Group Group 2013 2012 m m Up to three months 14.6 15.9 Three to six months 2.7 0.9 Trade receivables 17.3 16.8 At 31 December 2013 trade receivables are shown net of provisions totalling 8.6 million 2012 6.8 million.
The credit risk relating to cash deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by the Groups treasury department.
Relationships are maintained with a number of tier one institutional counterparties, ensuring compliance with Group policy relating to limits on the credit ratings of counterparties between BBB and AAA.
Excessive credit risk concentration is avoided through adhering to authorised limits for all counterparties.

Assets and liabilities acquired consisted of investment property with book and fair value of 250.5 million, along with other payables with book and fair value of 1.9 million.
Consideration was equal to the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired and so no goodwill arose.
Acquisition related costs of 11.2 million were incurred and recognised in the income statement in exceptional administration expenses.
During the year the acquired business contributed 11.4 million to the revenue and 9.3 million to the profit of the Group.
Acquisition of Parque Principado In 2013, the Group and CPP Investment Board Real Estate Holdings Inc. CPPIB together established Parque Principado S. r. l. set up for the purpose of acquiring Parque Principado.
On 4 October 2013 a 100 per cent owned subsidiary of Parque Principado S. r. l. acquired 100 per cent of the share capital of Parque Principado S. L. and other properties for total cash consideration of 168.6 million 142.6 million.
The businesses acquired form Parque Principado, a shopping centre in Oviedo, Spain.
Acquisition related costs of 2.0 million were incurred and recognised in the income statement in exceptional administration expenses.
CPPIB hold a 49 per cent non-controlling interest in Parque Principado S. r. l. the holding company for the Groups Parque Principado investment, and provided funding of 71.1 million.
In 2014, following the successful completion of certain preconditions including regulatory approval, CPPIB exercised an option allowing them to acquire an additional one per cent of debt and equity, on terms in line with the original acquisition.
At the date of signing these financial statements this transaction has not completed.
The exercise of this option results in Parque Principado S. r. l. becoming a joint venture.

The goodwill arose due to the recognition of a deferred tax liability.
The deferred tax liability is calculated, as required under IFRS, on the basis of the tax gain that would arise in the acquired company were it to dispose of the asset.
During the year the acquired businesses contributed 3.4 million to the revenue and 2.8 million to the profit of the Group.
Acquisitions during 2012 On 19 December 2012 the Group acquired 100 per cent of the share capital of StyleMeTV Limited renamed IntuDigital Limited for total consideration with a fair value of 3.4 million including 3.2 million of contingent consideration which is subject to the satisfaction of various performance conditions.
The fair value of net liabilities acquired was 0.6 million resulting in goodwill of 4.0 million being recognised on the acquisition.
On 24 December 2012 the Group acquired 100 per cent of the share capital of Capital & Regional Braehead Limited renamed Intu Braehead Limited, which holds a 50 per cent interest in the Xscape Braehead Partnership renamed Braehead Leisure Partnership for consideration of 4.0 million.
As a result of this transaction, the Groups interest in the Xscape Braehead Partnership is now 100 per cent.
