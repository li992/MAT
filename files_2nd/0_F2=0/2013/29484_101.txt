The provision is based on estimates of the total number of complaints expected to be upheld, the average cost of redress and the estimated timing of settlement.
The office restructuring provision represented the expected amounts payable under a number of non-cancellable operating leases for office space that the Group did not occupy.
The provision was based on estimates of the rental payable until the approximate dates on which the Group expected either to have sublet the affected space or to have reached break clauses within the relevant leaseagreements.
The other provisions represent a reserve in respect of self insured liabilities.
As more fully set out in the summary of principal risks and uncertainties on pages 36 and 37, the Group could in the course of its business be subject to legal proceedings and or regulatory activity.
Should any such material circumstance arise, a provision would be established based on the Boards best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation.
While there can be no assurances, the Directors do not believe, based upon information currently available to them, there is any such activity that would have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial position.
