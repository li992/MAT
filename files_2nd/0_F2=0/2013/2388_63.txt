Significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill As a consequence of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in April 2010, BP continues to incur costs and has also recognized liabilities for certain future costs.
Liabilities of uncertain timing or amount, for which no provision has been made, have been disclosed as contingent liabilities.
The cumulative pre-tax income statement charge since the incident amounts to $42.7 billion.
For more information on the types of expenditure included in the cumulative income statement charge, see Impact upon the group income statement below.
The cumulative income statement charge does not include amounts for obligations that BP considers are not possible, at this time, to measure reliably.
For further information, including developments in relation to the interpretation of business economic loss claims under the Plaintiffs Steering Committee PSC settlement, see Provisions and contingent liabilities below.
The total amounts that will ultimately be paid by BP in relation to all the obligations relating to the incident are subject to significant uncertainty and the ultimate exposure and cost to BP will be dependent on many factors, as discussed under Provisions and contingent liabilities below, including in relation to any new information or future developments.
These could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
The risks associated with the incident could also heighten the impact of the other risks to which the group is exposed as further described under Risk factors on page 51 and Legal proceedings on page 257.
The impacts of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill on the income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement of the group are included within the relevant line items in those statements and are shown in the table below.

Trust fund BP established the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Trust the Trust in 2010, to be funded in the amount of $20 billion, to satisfy legitimate individual and business claims, state and local government claims resolved by BP, final judgments and settlements, state and local response costs, and natural resource damages and related costs.
The Trust is available to fund the qualified settlement funds QSFs established under the terms of the settlement agreements comprising the Economic and Property Damages EPD Settlement Agreement and the Medical Benefits Class Action Settlement with the PSC administered through the Deepwater Horizon Court Supervised Settlement Program DHCSSP, and the separate BP claims programme see Provisions and contingent liabilities below for further information.
Fines and penalties are not covered by the trust fund.
The funding of the Trust was completed in the fourth quarter of 2012.
The obligation to fund the $20-billion trust fund, adjusted to take account of the time value of money, was recognized in full in 2010 and charged to the income statement.
BPs rights and obligations in relation to the $20-billion trust fund are accounted for in accordance with IFRIC 5 Rights to Interests Arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds.
An asset has been recognized representing BPs right to receive reimbursement from the trust fund.
This is the portion of the estimated future expenditure provided for that will be settled by payments from the trust fund.
We use the term reimbursement asset to describe this asset.
BP will not actually receive any reimbursements from the trust fund, instead payments will be made directly from the trust fund, and BP will be released from its corresponding obligation.
The reimbursement asset is recorded within other receivables on the balance sheet apportioned between current and non-current elements.
The table below shows movements in the BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2013 139 2.
Significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill continued reimbursement asset during the period to 31 December 2013.
The net increase in the provision of $1,542 million for the full year relates principally to business economic loss claims processed by the DHCSSP subsequent to finalization of the BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2012 that have been paid as well as increases in the provision for claims administration costs.
The amount of the reimbursement asset at 31 December 2013 is equal to the amount of provisions and payables recognized at that date that will be covered by the trust fund see below.
$ million Cumulative since the 2013 2012 incident At 1 January 6,442 9,875 Increase in provision for items covered by the trust fund 1,921 1,985 20,511 Derecognition of provision for items that cannot be reliably estimated 379 794 1,173 Amounts paid directly by the trust fund 3,085 4,624 14,439 At 31 December 4,899 6,442 4,899 Of which current 2,457 4,178 2,457 non-current 2,442 2,264 2,442 Any increases in estimated future expenditure that will be covered by the trust fund up to an aggregate of $20 billion have no net income statement effect as a reimbursement asset is also recognized, as described above.
As at 31 December 2013, the cumulative charges, and the associated reimbursement asset recognized, amounted to $19,338 million.
Thus, a further $662 million could be charged in subsequent periods for items covered by the trust fund with no net impact on the income statement.
Additional liabilities in excess of this amount regarding claims under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 OPA 90, claims that are currently administered by the DHCSSP, or otherwise, including the various claims described in Legal proceedings on page 257, would be expensed to the income statement.
Information on those items that currently cannot be estimated reliably is provided under Provisions and contingent liabilities below.
Under the terms of the EPD Settlement Agreement with the PSC, several QSFs were established in 2012.
These QSFs each relate to specific elements of the agreement, have been and will continue to be funded through payments from the Trust, and are available to make payments to claimants in accordance with those elements of the agreement.
As at 31 December 2013, the aggregate cash balances in the Trust and the QSFs amounted to $6.7 billion, including $1.2 billion remaining in the seafood compensation fund which has yet to be distributed and $0.9 billion held for natural resource damage early restoration.
Should the cash balances in the trust fund not be sufficient, payments in respect of legitimate claims and other costs will be made directly by BP.
The EPD Settlement Agreement with the PSC provides for a court-supervised settlement programme which commenced operation on 4 June 2012.
See Provisions below for further information on the current status of the EPD Settlement Agreement.
In addition, a separate BP claims programme began processing claims from claimants not in the Economic and Property Damages class as determined by the EPD Settlement Agreement or who have requested to opt out of that settlement.
Payments made to claimants through the BP claims programme are paid directly from the Trust.
A separate claims administrator has been appointed to pay medical claims and to implement other aspects of the Medical Benefits Class Action Settlement.
For further information on the PSC settlements, see Legal proceedings on page 257.
Other payables BP reached an agreement with the US government in 2012, which was approved by the court in 2013, to resolve all federal criminal claims arising from the incident.
Under the agreement, BP will pay $4 billion over a period of five years.
At 31 December 2013, the remaining payable was $3,525 million, of which $565 million falls due in 2014.
BP also reached a settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC in 2012, resolving the SECs Gulf of Mexico oil spill-related civil claims.
As part of the settlement, BP agreed to a civil penalty of $525 million.
At 31 December 2013 the remaining payable, due in 2014, was $175 million plus accrued interest.
The amounts described above were reclassified from provisions to other payables upon court approval of the agreement with the US government and settlement with the SEC.
Provisions and contingent liabilities Provisions BP has recorded provisions relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in relation to environmental expenditure, spill response costs, litigation and claims, and Clean Water Act penalties that can be measured reliably at this time.
Movements in each class of provision during the year and cumulatively since the incident are presented in the tables below.

Environmental The environmental provision includes $320 million for BPs commitment to fund the Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative, which is a 10-year research programme to study the impact of the incident on the marine and shoreline environment of the Gulf of Mexico.
In addition, BP faces claims under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 OPA 90 for natural resource damages.
These damages include, among other things, the reasonable costs of assessing the injury to natural resources.
During 2011, BP entered a framework agreement with natural resource trustees for the United States and five Gulf-coast states, providing for up to $1 billion to be spent on early restoration projects to address natural resource injuries resulting from the oil spill, to be funded from the $20-billion trust fund.
In 2012, work began on the initial set of early restoration projects identified under this framework.
At 31 December 2013 the amount provided for natural resource damage assessment costs and early restoration projects was $1,224 million.
Until the size, location and duration of the impact is assessed, it is not possible to estimate reliably either the amounts or timing of the remaining natural resource damages claims other than the assessment and early restoration costs noted above, therefore no additional amounts have been provided for these items and they are disclosed as a contingent liability.
Spill response The spill response provision relates primarily to ongoing shoreline operational activity.
Litigation and claims The litigation and claims provision includes amounts that can be estimated reliably for the future cost of settling claims by individuals and businesses for damage to real or personal property, lost profits or impairment of earning capacity and loss of subsistence use of natural resources Individual and Business Claims, and claims by state and local government entities for removal costs, damage to real or personal property, loss of government revenue and increased public services costs State and Local Claims, under OPA 90 and other legislation, except as described under Contingent liabilities below.
Claims administration costs and legal costs have also been provided for.
The timing of payment of litigation and claims provisions classified as non-current is dependent on on-going legal activity and is therefore uncertain.
BP has provided for its best estimate of the cost associated with the PSC settlement agreements with the exception of the cost of business economic loss claims.
As part of its monitoring of payments made by the DHCSSP, BP identified multiple business economic loss claim determinations that appeared to result from an interpretation of the EPD Settlement Agreement by the claims administrator that BP believes was incorrect.
Between March 2013 and March 2014, there were various rulings from both the federal District Court in New Orleans the District Court and a panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit the business economic loss panel on matters relating to the interpretation of the EPD Settlement Agreement, in particular on the issue of matching revenue and expenses as well as causation requirements of the EPD Settlement Agreement.
As reported in BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2012, the estimated cost of the PSC settlement for Individual and Business Claims was $7.7 billion at 31 December 2012.
This estimate increased during the year to $9.6 billion to reflect all claims processed by the DHCSSP for which eligibility notices had been issued and increases in claims administration costs.
As a result of the District Courts preliminary injunction issued on 18 October 2013 that, amongst other things, required the claims administrator to temporarily suspend payments of business economic loss claims other than those claims supported by sufficiently matched accrual-basis accounting or any other business economic loss claim for which the claims administrator determines that the matching of revenue and expenses is not an issue, the provision for $0.4 billion of claims for which eligibility notices had been issued but had not yet been paid was derecognized as BP considered and continues to consider that no reliable estimate can be made for these claims.
At 31 December 2013, the total costs of the PSC settlement that BP considers can be reliably estimated is therefore $9.2 billion.
On 5 December 2013, the District Court amended its earlier preliminary injunction and temporarily suspended the issuance of final determination notices and payments of business economic loss claims, until the business economic loss issues have been resolved.
On 24 December 2013, the District Court ruled on the issues in relation to the matching of revenue and expenses and causation that were remanded to it by the business economic loss panel.
Regarding matching, the District Court reversed its earlier decision and ruled that the claims administrator, in administering business economic loss claims, must match revenue with the variable expenses incurred by claimants in conducting their business, even where the revenues and expenses were recorded at different times.
The District Court assigned to the claims administrator the development of more detailed matching requirements.
On 12 February 2014, the claims administrator issued a draft policy addressing the matching of revenue and expenses for business economic loss claims.
The parties have made written submissions on the draft policy and the claims administrator will issue a final policy to which BP and the PSC have the right to object and seek review by the District Court.
Regarding causation, the District Court ruled that the EPD Settlement Agreement contained no causation requirement beyond the revenue and related tests set out in an exhibit to that agreement.
BP appealed the District Courts ruling on causation to the business economic loss panel and moved for a permanent injunction that would prevent the claims administrator from making awards to claimants whose alleged injuries are not traceable to the spill.
On 3 March 2014, the business economic loss panel affirmed the District Courts ruling on causation and denied BPs motion for a permanent injunction.
BP is considering its appeal options, including a potential petition that all the active judges of the Fifth Circuit review the 3 March decision.
Under the terms of the business economic loss panels ruling, the injunction temporarily suspending issuance of final determination notices and payments of business economic loss claims will be lifted when the matter is transferred back to the District Court: the timing of this would be affected by the status of any such petition by BP.
BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2013 141 2.
Significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill continued In addition to the proceedings in relation to the interpretation of the EPD Settlement Agreement, following the District Courts final order and judgment approving the EPD Settlement in January 2013, groups of purported members of the Economic and Property Damages Settlement Class the Appellants appealed from the District Courts approval of that settlement to a different panel of the Fifth Circuit.
On 10 January 2014, that other panel of the Fifth Circuit affirmed the District Courts approval of the EPD Settlement but left to the business economic loss panel of the Fifth Circuit the question of how to interpret the EPD Settlement Agreement, including the meaning of the causation requirements of that agreement see above.
BP and several Appellants have filed petitions requesting that all the active judges of the Fifth Circuit review the decision to uphold approval of the EPD Settlement.
See Legal proceedings on page 257 for further details on the settlements with the PSC and related matters.
Until the uncertainties described below are resolved, management is unable to estimate reliably the value and volume of future business economic loss claims and whether and to what extent received or processed but unpaid business economic loss claims will be paid.
Firstly, the inherent uncertainty as to the interpretation of the EPD Settlement Agreement in respect of matching and causation issues will continue until the more detailed matching requirements are finalized by the claims administrator and are implemented by the DHCSSP: the issue of causation and the requirements for class membership under the EPD Settlement Agreement are resolved on appeal: and the impact of any new policies and procedures in response to these issues on the value and volume of business economic loss claims becomes clear.
Furthermore, the Fifth Circuit has yet to decide whether to grant the petitions seeking review of its decision affirming approval of the EPD Settlement and, if granted, whether to alter its decision in that appeal.
Secondly, uncertainty arises from the lack of sufficient claims data under the DHCSSP from which to extrapolate any reliable trends the number of business economic loss claims received and the average amounts paid in respect of such claims prior to the District Courts injunction were higher than previously assumed by BP.
This inability to extrapolate any reliable trends may or may not continue once the uncertainties concerning the interpretation of the EPD Settlement Agreement described above have been resolved.
Thirdly, there is uncertainty as to the ultimate deadline for filing business economic loss claims, which is dependent on the date on which all relevant appeals are concluded.
Management believes, therefore, that no reliable estimate can currently be made of any business economic loss claims not yet received, processed and paid by the DHCSSP.
A provision for business economic loss claims will be established when a reliable estimate can be made of the liability.
The total cost of the PSC settlement is likely to be significantly higher than the amount recognized to date of $9.2 billion because the current estimate does not reflect business economic loss claims not yet received, processed and paid.
The DHCSSP has issued eligibility notices, disputed by BP, in respect of business economic loss claims of $1,019 million which have not yet been paid.
Furthermore, a significant number of business economic loss claims have been received but have not yet been processed, and further claims are likely to be received.
The provision recognized for litigation and claims includes an estimate for State and Local Claims.
Although the provision recognized is BPs current reliable best estimate of the amount required to settle these obligations, significant uncertainty exists in relation to the outcome of any litigation proceedings and the amount of claims that will become payable by BP.
See Legal proceedings on page 257 and Contingent liabilities below for further details.
Clean Water Act penalties A charge for potential Clean Water Act Section 311 penalties was first included in BPs second-quarter 2010 interim financial statements.
At the time that charge was taken, the latest estimate from the intra-agency Flow Rate Technical Group created by the National Incident Commander in charge of the spill response was between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels per day.
The mid-point of that range, 47,500 barrels per day, was used for the purposes of calculating the charge.
For the purposes of calculating the amount of the oil flow that was discharged into the Gulf of Mexico, the amount of oil that had been or was projected to be captured in vessels on the surface was subtracted from the total estimated flow up until when the well was capped on 15 July 2010.
The result of this calculation was an estimate that approximately 3.2 million barrels of oil had been discharged into the Gulf.
This estimate of 3.2 million barrels was calculated using a total flow of 47,500 barrels per day multiplied by the 85 days from 22 April 2010 to 15 July 2010 less an estimate of the amount captured on the surface approximately 850,000 barrels.
This estimated discharge volume was then multiplied by $1,100 per barrel the maximum amount the statute allows in the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct for the purposes of estimating a potential penalty.
This resulted in a provision of $3,510 million for potential penalties under Section 311.
BP intends to argue for a penalty lower than $1,100 per barrel.
The actual penalty a court may impose could be lower than $1,100 per barrel if it were determined that such a lower penalty was appropriate based on the factors a court is directed to consider in assessing a penalty.
In particular, in determining the amount of a civil penalty, Section 311 directs a court to consider a number of enumerated factors, including the seriousness of the violation or violations, the economic benefit to the violator, if any, resulting from the violation, the degree of culpability involved, any other penalty for the same incident, any history of prior violations, the nature, extent, and degree of success of any efforts of the violator to minimize or mitigate the effects of the discharge, the economic impact of the penalty on the violator, and any other matters as justice may require.
Civil penalties above $1,100 per barrel up to a statutory maximum of $4,300 per barrel of oil discharged would only be imposed if alleged gross negligence or wilful misconduct were proven.
The $1,100 per-barrel rate has been utilized for the purposes of calculating the provision after considering and weighing all possible outcomes and in light of: i the companys conclusion that it did not act with gross negligence or engage in wilful misconduct: and ii the uncertainty as to whether a court would assess a penalty below the $1,100 statutory maximum.
On 2 August 2010, the United States Department of Energy and the Flow Rate Technical Group had issued an estimate that 4.9 million barrels of oil had flowed from the Macondo well, and 4.05 million barrels had been discharged into the Gulf the difference being the amount of oil captured by vessels on the surface as part of BPs well containment efforts.
It was and remains BPs view, based on the analysis of available data by its experts, that the 2 August 2010 Government estimate is not reliable.
BP believes that the 2 August 2010 discharge estimate is overstated by at least 20%.
If the flow rate were 20% lower than the 2 August 2010 estimate, then the amount of oil that flowed from the Macondo well would be approximately 3.9 million barrels and the amount discharged into the Gulf would be approximately 3.1 million barrels using a current estimate of barrels captured by vessels on the surface of 810,000 in line with the stipulation entered with the US government see Legal proceedings, which is not materially different from the amount we used for our original estimate at the end of the second quarter 2010.
For the purposes of calculating a provision for fines and penalties under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, BP has continued to use an estimate of 3.2 million barrels of oil discharged to the Gulf of Mexico and a penalty of $1,100 per barrel, as its current best estimate, as defined in paragraphs 36-40 of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, of the amounts which may be used in calculating the penalty under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act and as a result, the provision at the end of the year was $3,510 million.
The amount and timing of the amount to be paid ultimately is subject to significant uncertainty since it will depend on what is determined by the court in the federal multi-district litigation proceedings in New Orleans MDL 2179 as to negligence, gross negligence or wilful misconduct, the volume ofoil spilled and the application of statutory penalty factors.
The trial court could issue its decision on the first two phases of the trial which considered the issues of negligence or gross negligence in phase one, and source control efforts and the volume of oil spilled in phase two at any time and has not yet scheduled a hearing on the subsequent phase regarding the application of statutory penalty factors.
The court has wide discretion in its determination as to whether a defendants conduct involved negligence or gross negligence as well as in its determinations on the volume of oil spilled and the application of statutory penalty factors.

Significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill continued See Legal proceedings on page 257 for further details on all litigation and claims activity.
Provision movements The total amount recognized as an increase in provisions during the year was $2,239 million, including $1,921 million for items covered by the trust fund and $318 million for other items 2012 $6,868 million, including $1,985 million for items covered by the trust fund and $4,883 million for other items.
In addition, $379 million 2012 $794 million was derecognized relating to items that will be covered by the trust fund but which can no longer be reliably estimated.
After deducting amounts utilized during the year totalling $3,777 million, including payments from the trust fund of $3,051 million and payments made directly by BP of $726 million 2012 $5,864 million, including payments from the trust fund of $4,624 million and payments made directly by BP of $1,240 million, and after reclassifications and adjustments for discounting, the remaining provision as at 31 December 2013 was $9,346 million 2012 $15,200 million.
The total amounts that will ultimately be paid by BP in relation to all obligations relating to the incident are subject to significant uncertainty and the ultimate exposure and cost to BP will be dependent on many factors.
Furthermore, significant uncertainty exists in relation to the amount of claims that will become payable by BP, the amount of fines that will ultimately be levied on BP including any determination of BPs culpability based on any findings of negligence, gross negligence or wilful misconduct, the outcome of litigation and arbitration proceedings, and any costs arising from any longer-term environmental consequences of the oil spill, which will also impact upon the ultimate cost for BP.
The amount and timing of any amounts payable could also be impacted by any further settlements which may or may not occur.
Although the provision recognized is the current best reliable estimate of expenditures required to settle certain present obligations at the end of the reporting period, there are future expenditures for which itis not possible to measure the obligation reliably.
Contingent liabilities BP has provided for its best estimate of amounts expected to be paid from the trust fund that can be measured reliably.
This includes certain amounts expected to be paid pursuant to the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 OPA 90.
It is not possible, at this time, to measure reliably other obligations arising from the incident that are under the terms of the trust fund, namely any obligation in relation to natural resource damages claims or associated legal costs except for the estimated costs of the assessment phase and costs relating to early restoration agreements under the $1-billion framework agreement referred to above, claims asserted in civil litigation including any further litigation through excluded parties from the PSC settlement includingasset out in Legal proceedings, the cost of business economic loss claims under the PSC settlement not yet received, processed and paid by the DHCSSP, any further obligation that may arise from state and local government submissions under OPA 90 and any obligation in relation to other potential private or governmental litigation, nor is it practicable to estimate their magnitude or possible timing of payment.
Therefore, no amounts have been provided for these obligations as at 31 December 2013.
Natural resource damages resulting from the oil spill are currently being assessed.
BP and the federal and state trustees are collecting extensive data in order to assess the extent of damage to wildlife, shoreline, near shore and deepwater habitats, and recreational uses, among other things.
The study data will inform an assessment of injury to the Gulf Coast natural resources and the development of a restoration plan to address the identified injuries.
Detailed analysis and interpretation continue on the data that have been collected.
Any early restoration projects undertaken pursuant to the $1-billion framework agreement could mitigate the total damages resulting from the incident.
Accordingly, until the size, location and duration of the impact is assessed, it is not possible to estimate reliably either the amounts or timing of the remaining natural resource damages claims, therefore no such amounts have been provided as at 31 December 2013.
As described under Provisions above, BP has identified multiple business economic loss claim determinations under the PSC settlement that appeared to result from an interpretation of the EPD Settlement Agreement by the claims administrator that BP believes was incorrect.
Uncertainty as to the interpretation of the EPD Settlement Agreement will continue until the effects of the implementation of new policies and procedures are known, the issue of causation and the requirements for class membership under the EPD Settlement Agreement are resolved on appeal and the courts have ruled on the appeals in relation to the final order and judgment approving the EPD Settlement.
Therefore the potential cost of business economic loss claims not yet received, processed and paid is not provided for and is disclosed as a contingent liability.
A significant number of business economic loss claims have been received but have not yet been processed and paid, and further claims are likely to be received.
As described above in Provisions, a provision has been made for State and Local claims that can be measured reliably.
In January 2013, the States of Alabama, Mississippi and Florida submitted or asserted claims to BP under OPA 90 for alleged losses including economic losses and property damage as a result of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
BP is evaluating these claims.
The States of Louisiana and Texas have also asserted similar claims.
The amounts claimed, certain of which include punitive damages or other multipliers, are very substantial.
However BP considers these claims unsubstantiated and the methodologies used to calculate these claims to be seriously flawed, not supported by OPA 90, not supported by documentation, and to substantially overstate the claims.
Similar claims have also been submitted by various local government entities and a foreign government under OPA 90, and more claims are expected to be submitted.
The amounts alleged in the submissions for these State and Local Claims total approximately $35 billion.
BP will defend vigorously against these claims if adjudicated at trial.
Proceedings relating to securities class actions MDL 2185 pending in federal court in Texas, including a purported class action on behalf of purchasers of American Depository Shares under US federal securities law, are continuing.
A jury trial is scheduled to begin in October 2014.
No reliable estimate can be made of the amounts that may be payable in relation to these proceedings, if any, so no provision has been recognized at 31 December 2013.
In addition to the State and Local claims and securities class actions described above, BP is named as a defendant in approximately 2,950 other civil lawsuits brought by individuals, corporations and government entities in US federal and state courts, as well as certain foreign jurisdictions, resulting from the Deepwater Horizon accident, the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, and the spill response efforts.
Further actions are likely to be brought.
Among other claims, these lawsuits assert claims for personal injury or wrongful death in connection with the accident and the spill response, commercial and economic injury, damage to real and personal property, breach of contract and violations of statutes, including, but not limited, to alleged violations of US securities and environmental statutes.
Until further fact and expert disclosures occur, court rulings clarify the issues in dispute, liability and damage trial activity nears or progresses, or other actions such as further possible settlements occur, it is not possible given these uncertainties to arrive at a range of outcomes or a reliable estimate of the liabilities that may accrue to BP in connection with or as a result of these lawsuits.
Therefore no amounts have been provided for these items as at 31 December 2013.
See Legal proceedings on page 257 for further information.
For those items not covered by the trust fund it is not possible to measure reliably any obligation in relation to other litigation or potential fines and penalties except, subject to certain assumptions detailed above, for those relating to the Clean Water Act.
There are a number of federal and state environmental and other provisions of law, other than the Clean Water Act, under which one or more governmental agencies could seek civil fines and penalties from BP.
For example, a complaint filed by the United States sought to reserve the ability to seek penalties and other relief under a number of other laws.
Given the unsubstantiated nature of certain claims that may be asserted, it is not possible at this time to determine whether and to what extent any such claims would be successful or what penalties or fines would be assessed.
Therefore no amounts have been provided for these items.
BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2013 143 2.
Significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill continued Under the settlement agreements with Anadarko and MOEX, and with Cameron International, the designer and manufacturer of the Deepwater Horizon blowout preventer, with M-I L. L. C. M-I, the mud contractor, and with Weatherford, the designer and manufacturer of the float collar used on the Macondo well, BP has agreed to indemnify Anadarko, MOEX, Cameron, M-I and Weatherford for certain claims arising from the accident.
It is therefore possible that BP may face claims under these indemnities, but it is not currently possible to reliably measure any obligation in relation to such claims and therefore no amount has been provided as at 31 December 2013.
The magnitude and timing of all possible obligations in relation to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill continue to be subject to a very high degree of uncertainty as described further in Risk factors on page 51.
Any such possible obligations are therefore contingent liabilities and, at present, it is not practicable to estimate their magnitude or possible timing of payment.
Furthermore, other material unanticipated obligations may arise in future in relation to the incident.
Impact upon the group income statement The amount of the provision recognized during the year can be reconciled to the charge to the income statement as follows: $ million Cumulative since 2013 2012 2011 the incident Net increase in provision 2,239 6,868 5,183 44,551 Derecognition of provision for items that cannot be reliably estimated 379 794 1,173 Change in discount rate relating to provisions 5 17 17 Costs charged directly to the income statement 136 257 512 4,244 Trust fund liability discounted 19,580 Change in discounting relating to trust fund liability 43 283 Recognition of reimbursement asset, net 1,542 1,191 4,038 19,338 Settlements credited to the income statement 19 145 5,517 5,681 Profit loss before interest and taxation 430 4,995 3,800 42,483 Finance costs 39 19 58 193 Profit loss before taxation 469 5,014 3,742 42,676 The group income statement for 2013 includes a pre-tax charge of $469 million 2012 pre-tax charge of $5,014 million in relation to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
The costs charged in 2013 relate primarily to the ongoing costs of operating the Gulf Coast Restoration Organization GCRO and increases in legal costs.
Finance costs of $39 million 2012 $19 million reflect the unwinding of the discount on payables and provisions.
The cumulative amount charged to the income statement to date comprises spill response costs arising in the aftermath of the incident, GCRO operating costs, amounts charged upon initial recognition of the trust obligation, litigation, claims, environmental and legal costs not paid through the Trust, estimated obligations for future costs that can be estimated reliably at this time and rights and obligations relating to the trust fund, net of settlements agreed with the co-owners of the Macondo well and other third parties.
The total amount recognized in the income statement is analysed in the table below.
