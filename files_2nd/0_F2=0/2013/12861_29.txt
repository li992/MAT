108 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Overview Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Addi onal informa on Assumptions The major assumptions weighted to reflect individual Scheme differences were: 2013 2012 Rate of increase in salaries 3.7% 3.6% Discount rate applied to Scheme liabilities 4.4% 4.8% CPI inflation assumption 2.7% 2.6% Assumed life expectancies in years: Future male pensioners currently aged 60 88 88 Future female pensioners currently aged 60 90 90 Future male pensioners currently aged 40 90 90 Future female pensioners currently aged 40 92 92 The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, because of the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
It is important to note that these assumptions are long term and, in the case of the discount rate and the inflation rate, are measured by external market indicators.
The mortality assumptions as at 31 March 2013 were 90% of S1PMA for males and 100% of S1PFA for females, based on year of birth making allowance for improvements in mortality in line with CMI 2011 Core Projections and a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% per annum.
These assumptions are the same as in the prior year.
The balance sheet net pension liability is a snapshot view which can be significantly influenced by short-term market factors.
The calculation of the surplus or deficit depends, therefore, on factors which are beyond the control of the Group principally the value at the balance sheet date of equity shares in which the Scheme has invested and long-term interest rates which are used to discount future liabilities.
The funding of the Scheme is based on long-term trends and assumptions relating to market growth, as advised by qualified actuaries and investment advisors.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is approximately twenty years.
Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure Scheme liabilities Indicative impact on Scheme liabilities Assumption before deferred tax Change in assumption Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decrease increase by 25m Rate of inflation Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 26m Salary increase Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 4m Rate of mortality Increase by one year Increase by 28m The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method projected unit credit method has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of financial position.
The methods and types of assumption did not change.
Risks Through its defined benefit pension plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: Volatility in market Results under IAS 19 can change dramatically depending on market conditions.
The defined benefit conditions obligation is linked to yields on AA-rated corporate bonds, while many of the assets of the Scheme are invested in other assets.
Changing markets in conjunction with discount rate volatility will lead to volatility in the net pension liability on the Groups balance sheet and in other comprehensive income.
To a lesser extent this will also lead to volatility in the IAS 19 pension expense in the Groups income statement.
Choice of accounting The calculation of the defined benefit obligation DBO involves projecting future cash flows from assumptions the Scheme many years into the future.
This means that the assumptions used can have a material impact on the balance sheet position and profit and loss charge.
In practice future experience within the Scheme may not be in line with the assumptions adopted.
For example, members could live longer than foreseen or inflation could be higher or lower than allowed for in the DBO calculation.
Inflation rate risk The majority of the plans benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The accounting assumptions noted above are used to calculate the year-end net pension liability in accordance with the relevant accounting standard, IAS 19 revised Employee benefits.
Changes in these assumptions have no impact on the Groups cash payments into the Scheme.
The payments into the Scheme are reassessed after every triennial valuation.
The triennial valuations are calculated on a funding basis and use a different set of assumptions, as agreed with the pension Trustees.
QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 109 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 30.
Transactions with the MOD The MOD continues to own its Special Share in QinetiQ which conveys certain rights as set out in note 27.
Transactions between the Group and the MOD are disclosed as follows: Recovery of UK restructuring costs QinetiQ reached agreement with the UK MOD in March 2012 involving a payment to QinetiQ of 65m that was received after the year end in April 2012.
The agreement involves the discharging of the MOD from its accumulated liabilities for restructuring costs incurred in previous years, together with MOD agreement to changes in its Special Shareholder rights, and certain other operational issues.
Freehold land and buildings and surplus properties Under the terms of the Groups acquisition of part of the business and certain assets of DERA from the MOD on 1 July 2001, the MOD retained certain rights in respect of the freehold land and buildings transferred.
i Restrictions on transfer of title The title deeds of those properties with strategic assets see below include a clause that prevents their transfer without the approval of the MOD.
The MOD also has the right to purchase any strategic assets in certain circumstances.
ii Property claw-back agreement The MOD retains an interest in future profits on disposal following a trigger event.
A trigger event includes the granting of planning permission for development and or change of use, and the disposition of any of the acquired land and buildings.
During the 12 years from 1 July 2001, following a trigger event, the MOD is entitled to claw-back a proportion of the gain on each individual property transaction in excess of a 30% gain on a July 2001 professional valuation.
The proportion of the excess gain due to the MOD is based on a sliding scale that reduces over time from 50% to 9% and at 31 March 2013 stood at 9% 2012: 16%.
The July 2001 valuation was approximately 16% greater in aggregate than the consideration paid for the land and buildings on 1 July 2001.
MODs generic compliance regime In the year ended 31 March 2013 the Group moved from the bespoke MOD Compliance Regime to a generic MOD conflict of interest management system the generic compliance system in alignment with that followed by other Defence companies.
Adherence to the generic compliance system is monitored by the Risk & CSR Committee.
Refer to the Corporate Governance Report on page 47.
Strategic assets Under the Principal Agreement with the MOD, the QinetiQ controlled Group is not permitted without the written consent of the MOD, to: i dispose of or destroy all or any part of a strategic asset: or ii voluntarily undertake any closure of, or cease to provide a strategic capability by means of, all or any part of a strategic asset.
The net book value of assets identified as being strategic assets as at 31 March 2013 was 1.4m 2012: 1.5m.
Long-Term Partnering Agreement On 27 February 2003 QinetiQ Limited entered into a Long-Term Partnering Agreement to provide Test and Evaluation T&E facilities and training support services to the MOD.
This is a 25-year contract with a total revenue value of up to 5.6bn, dependent on the level of usage by the MOD, under which QinetiQ Limited is committed to providing T&E services with increasing efficiencies through cost saving and innovative service delivery.
Contingent liabilities and assets Subsidiary undertakings within the Group have given unsecured guarantees of 54.3m at 31 March 2013 2012: 55.1m in the ordinary course of business.
The Company has on occasion been required to take legal action to protect its intellectual property rights, to enforce commercial contracts or otherwise and similarly to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties.
Provisions are made for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking into account professional advice received, and represent managements best estimate of the likely outcome.
The timing of utilisation of these provisions is uncertain pending the outcome of various court proceedings and negotiations.
However, no provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties unless management, taking into account professional advice received, assesses that it is more likely than not that such proceedings may be successful.
Contingent liabilities associated with such proceedings have been identified but the Directors are of the opinion that any associated claims that might be brought can be resisted successfully and therefore the possibility of any outflow in settlement is assessed as not probable.
The Group has not recognised contingent amounts receivable relating to the Chertsey property which was disposed of during 2004 or the Fort Halstead property disposed of in September 2005.
Additional consideration, subject to clawback due to the MOD pursuant to the arrangements referred to in note 30, is potentially due on the purchasers obtaining additional planning consents, with the quantum dependent on the scope of the consent achieved.
The Group has also not recognised contingent amounts receivable relating to property impairments in prior years that may potentially be recovered from the MOD.
Recovery is subject to future negotiations.
It is not considered practicable to calculate the value of this contingent asset.
