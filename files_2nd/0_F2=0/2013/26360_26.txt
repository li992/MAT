Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group 212 213 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 nOTeS TO THe COnSOlIDATeD FInAnCIAl STATeMenTS Note 1: Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of lloyds Banking Group plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the european union eu.
IFRS comprises accounting standards prefixed IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and those prefixed IAS issued by the IASBs predecessor body as well as interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC and its predecessor body.
The eu endorsed version of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement relaxes some of the hedge accounting requirements: the Group has not taken advantage of this relaxation, and therefore there is no difference in application to the Group between IFRS as adopted by the eu and IFRS as issued by the IASB.
The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investment properties, available-for-sale financial assets, trading securities and certain other financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and all derivative contracts.
As stated on page 74, the directors consider that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The Group has adopted the following new standards and amendments to standards which became effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2013: Changes in accounting policy i IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 10 supersedes IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements and SIC-12 Consolidation Special Purpose Entities and establishes the principles for when the Group controls another entity and is therefore required to consolidate the other entity in the Groups financial statements.
under IFRS 10, the Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through the exercise of power.
As a result, the Group consolidates certain entities that were not previously consolidated and no longer consolidates certain entities which were previously consolidated, principally in relation to Open ended Investment Companies.
The Group has applied IFRS 10 retrospectively and restated its comparatives in accordance with the transitional provisions included in the standard.
These provisions require the Group to re-assess its control conclusions as at 1 January 2013 and restate its comparative information, applying the revised assessment in 2012 to the extent that the relevant investments were held in that year.
Details of the impact of these restatements are provided in note 56 to the financial statements.
ii Revised IAS 19 Employee Benefits IAS 19R IAS 19R prescribes the accounting and disclosure by employers for employee benefits.
Actuarial gains and losses remeasurements arising from the valuation of defined benefit pension schemes are no longer permitted to be deferred using the corridor approach and must be recognised immediately in other comprehensive income.
In addition, IAS 19R also replaces interest cost and expected return on plan assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability asset.
IAS 19R has been applied retrospectively and comparative figures restated accordingly.
The impact of the implementation of IAS 19R on the Groups results for the year ended 31 December 2013 has been to decrease other operating expenses by 28 million and increase profit before tax by the same amount.
The impact on the balance sheet at 31 December 2013 has been to increase the net retirement benefit liability by 2,817 million, to increase deferred tax assets by 648 million and to reduce shareholders equity by 2,169 million.
iii IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IFRS 13 has been applied with effect from 1 January 2013.
IFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date.
IFRS 13 requires that the fair value of a non-financial asset is determined based on the highest and best use of the asset, and that the fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk.
These changes had no significant impact on the measurement of the Groups assets and liabilities.
The IFRS 13 disclosures are given in notes 53 financial instruments, 26 investment properties and 16 disposal groups, in respect of assets held for sale measured at fair value to the financial statements.
Other presentation and disclosure changes In addition to the accounting policy changes discussed above, on 1 January 2013 the Group adopted the following new standards and amendments to standards which impact the presentation and disclosures in these financial statements: none of these standards has had a material impact on the primary financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income The amendments to IAS 1 require entities to group items presented in other comprehensive income on the basis of whether they may potentially be reclassified to profit or loss subsequently.
The statement of other comprehensive income in these financial statements has been revised to reflect the new requirements.

These disclosures are given in note 53 to the financial statements.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities IFRS 12 requires an entity to disclose information that enables users of financial statements to evaluate the nature of, and risks associated with, its interests in other entities and the effects of those interests on its financial position, financial performance and cash flows.
These disclosures are made in the notes to these financial statements.
Details of those IFRS pronouncements which will be relevant to the Group but which were not effective at 31 December 2013 and which have not been applied in preparing these financial statements are given in note 57.
Note 2: Accounting policies The Groups accounting policies are set out below.
These accounting policies have been applied consistently.
A Consolidation The assets, liabilities and results of Group undertakings including structured entities are included in the financial statements on the basis of accounts made up to the reporting date.
Group undertakings include subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
1 Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it has power over the entity, is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity, and has the ability to affect those returns through the exercise of its power.
This generally accompanies a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an entity if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to any of the above elements.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group: they are fide-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
Details of the principal subsidiaries are given in note 9 to the parent company financial statements.
The Group consolidates collective investment vehicles if its beneficial ownership interests give it substantive rights to remove the external fund manager over the investment activities of the fund.
Where a subsidiary of the Group is the fund manager of a collective investment vehicle, the Group considers a number of factors in determining whether it acts as principal and therefore controls the collective investment vehicle including: an assessment of the scope of the Groups decision making authority over the investment vehicle: the rights held by other parties including substantive removal rights without cause over the Group acting as fund manager: the remuneration to which the Group is entitled in its capacity as decision maker: and the Groups exposure to variable returns from the beneficial interest it holds in the investment vehicle.
Consolidation may be appropriate in circumstances where the Group has less than a majority beneficial interest.
Where a collective investment vehicle is consolidated the interests of parties other than the Group are reported in other liabilities.
Structured entities are entities that are designed so that their activities are not governed by way of voting rights.
In assessing whether the Group has power over such entities in which it has an interest, the Group considers factors such as the purpose and design of the entity: its practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the entity: the nature of the relationship with the entity: and the size of its exposure to the variability of returns of the entity.
The treatment of transactions with non-controlling interests depends on whether, as a result of the transaction, the Group loses control of the subsidiary.
Changes in the parents ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions: any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent entity.
Where the group loses control of the subsidiary, at the date when control is lost the amount of any non-controlling interest in that former subsidiary is derecognised and any investment retained in the former subsidiary is remeasured to its fair value: the gain or loss that is recognised in profit or loss on the partial disposal of the subsidiary includes the gain or loss on the remeasurement of the retained interest.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the Group.
The consideration for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group.
The consideration includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred except those relating to the issuance of debt instruments see e 5 below or share capital see R 1 below.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date.
2 Joint ventures and associates Joint ventures are joint arrangements over which the Group has joint control with other parties and has rights to the net assets of the arrangements.
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity, but is not control or joint control of those policies, and is generally achieved through holding between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the voting share capital of the entity.
The Group utilises the venture capital exemption for investments where significant influence or joint control is present and the business unit operates as a venture capital business.
These investments are designated at initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss.
Otherwise, the Groups investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recorded at Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group 214 215 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 nOTeS TO THe COnSOlIDATeD FInAnCIAl STATeMenTS Note 2: Accounting policies continued cost and adjusted each year to reflect the Groups share of the post-acquisition results of the joint venture or associate based on audited accounts which are coterminous with the Group or made up to a date which is not more than three months before the Groups reporting date.
The share of any losses is restricted to a level that reflects an obligation to fund such losses.
B Goodwill Goodwill arises on business combinations, including the acquisition of subsidiaries, and on the acquisition of interests in joint ventures and associates: goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Where the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity is greater than the cost of acquisition, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset at cost and is tested at least annually for impairment.
If an impairment is identified the carrying value of the goodwill is written down immediately through the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions of associates and joint ventures is included in the Groups investment in joint ventures and associates.
At the date of disposal of a subsidiary, the carrying value of attributable goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal except where it has been written off directly to reserves in the past.
C Other intangible assets Other intangible assets include brands, core deposit intangible, purchased credit card relationships, customer-related intangibles and both internally and externally generated capitalised software enhancements.
Intangible assets which have been determined to have a finite useful life are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life as follows: Capitalised software enhancements up to 7 years Brands which have been assessed as having finite lives 10-15 years Customer-related intangibles up to 10 years Core deposit intangible up to 8 years Purchased credit card relationships 5 years Intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at each reporting date to assess whether there is any indication that they are impaired.
If any such indication exists the recoverable amount of the asset is determined and in the event that the assets carrying amount is greater than its recoverable amount, it is written down immediately.
Certain brands have been determined to have an indefinite useful life and are not amortised.
Such intangible assets are reassessed annually to reconfirm that an indefinite useful life remains appropriate.
In the event that an indefinite life is inappropriate a finite life is determined and an impairment review is performed on the asset.
D Revenue recognition Interest income and expense are recognised in the income statement for all interest-bearing financial instruments using the effective interest method, except for those classified at fair value through profit or loss.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the expected life of the financial instrument.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.
The effective interest rate is calculated on initial recognition of the financial asset or liability by estimating the future cash flows after considering all the contractual terms of the instrument but not future credit losses.
The calculation includes all amounts expected to be paid or received by the Group including expected early redemption fees and related penalties and premiums and discounts that are an integral part of the overall return.
Direct incremental transaction costs related to the acquisition, issue or disposal of a financial instrument are also taken into account in the calculation.
Once a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been written down as a result of an impairment loss, interest income is recognised using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss see H below.
Fees and commissions which are not an integral part of the effective interest rate are generally recognised when the service has been provided.
loan commitment fees for loans that are likely to be drawn down are deferred together with related direct costs and recognised as an adjustment to the effective interest rate on the loan once drawn.
Where it is unlikely that loan commitments will be drawn, loan commitment fees are recognised over the life of the facility.
loan syndication fees are recognised as revenue when the syndication has been completed and the Group retains no part of the loan package for itself or retains a part at the same effective interest rate for all interestbearing financial instruments, including loans and advances, as for the other participants.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Revenue recognition policies specific to life insurance and general insurance business are detailed below see O below : those relating to leases are set out in K 2 below.
E Financial assets and liabilities On initial recognition, financial assets are classified into fair value through profit or loss, available-for-sale financial assets, held-to-maturity investments or loans and receivables.
Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, except for trading liabilities and other financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition which are held at fair value.
The Group initially recognises loans Independent auditors report 198 Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group Consolidated financial statements 204 214 215 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 212 Parent company financial statements 366 Notes to the parent company financial statements 369 1 44 69 123 377 Note 2: Accounting policies continued and receivables, deposits, debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Regular way purchases and sales of securities and other financial assets and trading liabilities are recognised on trade date, being the date that the Group is committed to purchase or sell an asset.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual right to receive cash flows from those assets has expired or when the Group has transferred its contractual right to receive the cash flows from the assets and either: substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred: or the Group has neither retained nor transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards, but has transferred control.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished ie when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expire.
1 Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss Financial instruments are classified at fair value through profit or loss where they are trading securities or where they are designated at fair value through profit or loss by management.
Derivatives are carried at fair value see F below.
Trading securities are debt securities and equity shares acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term or which are part of a portfolio which is managed for short-term gains.
Such securities are classified as trading securities and recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in their fair value together with interest coupons and dividend income are recognised in the income statement within net trading income in the period in which they occur.
Other financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are designated as such by management upon initial recognition.
Such assets and liabilities are carried in the balance sheet at their fair value and gains and losses arising from changes in fair value together with interest coupons and dividend income are recognised in the income statement within net trading income in the period in which they occur.
Financial assets and liabilities are designated at fair value through profit or loss on acquisition in the following circumstances: it eliminates or significantly reduces the inconsistent treatment that would otherwise arise from measuring the assets and liabilities or recognising gains or losses on different bases.
The main type of financial assets designated by the Group at fair value through profit or loss are assets backing insurance contracts and investment contracts issued by the Groups life insurance businesses.
Fair value designation allows changes in the fair value of these assets to be recorded in the income statement along with the changes in the value of the associated liabilities, thereby significantly reducing the measurement inconsistency had the assets been classified as available-for-sale financial assets.
the assets and liabilities are part of a group which is managed, and its performance evaluated, on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy, with management information also prepared on this basis.
As noted in A 2 above certain of the Groups investments are managed as venture capital investments and evaluated on the basis of their fair value and these assets are designated at fair value through profit or loss.
w here the assets and liabilities contain one or more embedded derivatives that significantly modify the cash flows arising under the contract and would otherwise need to be separately accounted for.
The fair values of assets and liabilities traded in active markets are based on current bid and offer prices respectively.
If the market is not active the Group establishes a fair value by using valuation techniques.
These include the use of recent arms length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.
Refer to note 3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements: Fair value of financial instruments and note 53 Financial instruments: Fair values of financial assets and liabilities for details of valuation techniques and significant inputs to valuation models.
The Group is permitted to reclassify, at fair value at the date of transfer, non-derivative financial assets other than those designated at fair value through profit or loss by the entity upon initial recognition out of the trading category if they are no longer held for the purpose of being sold or repurchased in the near term, as follows: if the financial assets would have met the definition of loans and receivables but for the fact that they had to be classified as held for trading at initial recognition, they may be reclassified into loans and receivables where the Group has the intention and ability to hold the assets for the foreseeable future or until maturity: or if the financial assets would not have met the definition of loans and receivables, they may be reclassified out of the held for trading category into available-for-sale financial assets in rare circumstances.
2 Available-for-sale financial assets Debt securities and equity shares that are not classified as trading securities, at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments or as loans and receivables are classified as available-for-sale financial assets and are recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value, inclusive of transaction costs.
Available-for-sale financial assets are those intended to be held for an indeterminate period of time and may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of investments classified as available-for-sale are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, until the financial asset is either sold, becomes impaired or matures, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the income statement.
Interest calculated using the effective interest method and foreign exchange gains and losses on debt securities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
The Group is permitted to transfer a financial asset from the available-for-sale category to the loans and receivables category where that asset would have met the definition of loans and receivables at the time of reclassification if the financial asset had not been designated as available-for-sale and where there is both the intention and ability to hold that financial asset for the foreseeable future.
Reclassification of a Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group 216 217 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 nOTeS TO THe COnSOlIDATeD FInAnCIAl STATeMenTS Note 2: Accounting policies continued financial asset from the available-for-sale category to the held-to-maturity category is permitted when the Group has the ability and intent to hold that financial asset to maturity.
Reclassifications are made at fair value as of the reclassification date.
Fair value becomes the new cost or amortised cost as applicable.
effective interest rates for financial assets reclassified to the loans and receivables and held-to-maturity categories are determined at the reclassification date.
Any previous gain or loss on a transferred asset that has been recognised in equity is amortised to profit or loss over the remaining life of the investment using the effective interest method or until the asset becomes impaired.
Any difference between the new amortised cost and the expected cash flows is also amortised over the remaining life of the asset using the effective interest method.
When an impairment loss is recognised in respect of available-for-sale assets transferred, the unamortised balance of any available-for-sale reserve that remains in equity is transferred to the income statement and recorded as part of the impairment loss.
3 Loans and receivables loans and receivables include loans and advances to banks and customers and eligible assets including those transferred into this category out of the fair value through profit or loss or available-for-sale financial assets categories.
loans and receivables are initially recognised when cash is advanced to the borrowers at fair value inclusive of transaction costs or, for eligible assets transferred into this category, their fair value at the date of transfer.
Financial assets classified as loans and receivables are accounted for at amortised cost using the effective interest method see D above less provision for impairment see H below.
The Group has entered into securitisation and similar transactions to finance certain loans and advances to customers.
In cases where the securitisation vehicles are funded by the issue of debt, on terms whereby the majority of the risks and rewards of the portfolio of securitised lending are retained by the Group, these loans and advances continue to be recognised by the Group, together with a corresponding liability for the funding.
4 Held-to-maturity investments Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Groups management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity other than: those that the Group designates upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss: those that the Group designates as available-for-sale: and those that meet the definition of loans and receivables.
These are initially recognised at fair value including direct and incremental transaction costs and measured subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less any provision for impairment.
A sale or reclassification of a more than insignificant amount of held-to-maturity investments would result in the reclassification of all held-to-maturity investments to available-for-sale financial assets.
5 Borrowings Borrowings which include deposits from banks, customer deposits, debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities are recognised initially at fair value, being their issue proceeds net of transaction costs incurred.
These instruments are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Preference shares and other instruments which carry a mandatory coupon or are redeemable on a specific date are classified as financial liabilities.
The coupon on these instruments is recognised in the income statement as interest expense.
An exchange of financial liabilities on substantially different terms is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.
The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability extinguished and the new financial liability is recognised in profit or loss together with any related costs or fees incurred.
When a financial liability is exchanged for an equity instrument, the new equity instrument is recognised at fair value and any difference between the original carrying value of the liability and the fair value of the new equity is recognised in the profit or loss together with any related costs or fees incurred.
6 Sale and repurchase agreements including securities lending and borrowing Securities sold subject to repurchase agreements repos continue to be recognised on the balance sheet where substantially all of the risks and rewards are retained.
Funds received under these arrangements are included in deposits from banks, customer deposits, or trading liabilities.
Conversely, securities purchased under agreements to resell reverse repos, where the Group does not acquire substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership, are recorded as loans and receivables or trading securities.
The difference between sale and repurchase price is treated as interest and accrued over the life of the agreements using the effective interest method.
Securities borrowing and lending transactions are typically secured: collateral takes the form of securities or cash advanced or received.
Securities lent to counterparties are retained on the balance sheet.
Securities borrowed are not recognised on the balance sheet, unless these are sold to third parties, in which case the obligation to return them is recorded at fair value as a trading liability.
Cash collateral given or received is treated as a loan and receivable or customer deposit.
F Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting All derivatives are recognised at their fair value.
Fair values are obtained from quoted market prices in active markets, including recent market transactions, and using valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow and option pricing models, as appropriate.
Derivatives are Independent auditors report 198 Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group Consolidated financial statements 204 216 217 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 212 Parent company financial statements 366 Notes to the parent company financial statements 369 1 44 69 123 377 Note 2: Accounting policies continued carried in the balance sheet as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative.
Refer to note 3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements: Fair value of financial instruments and note 53 3 Financial instruments: Fair values of financial assets and liabilities for details of valuation techniques and significant inputs to valuation models.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instrument that is not part of a hedging relationship are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Derivatives embedded in financial instruments and insurance contracts unless the embedded derivative is itself an insurance contract are treated as separate derivatives when their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value through profit or loss.
These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
In accordance with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, a policyholders option to surrender an insurance contract for a fixed amount is not treated as an embedded derivative.
The method of recognising the movements in the fair value of derivatives depends on whether they are designated as hedging instruments and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
Hedge accounting allows one financial instrument, generally a derivative such as a swap, to be designated as a hedge of another financial instrument such as a loan or deposit or a portfolio of such instruments.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, formal documentation is drawn up specifying the hedging strategy, the hedged item and the hedging instrument and the methodology that will be used to measure the effectiveness of the hedge relationship in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flow of the hedged risk.
The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is tested both at inception and throughout its life and if at any point it is concluded that it is no longer highly effective in achieving its documented objective, hedge accounting is discontinued.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either: 1 hedges of the fair value of the particular risks inherent in recognised assets or liabilities fair value hedges : 2 hedges of highly probable future cash flows attributable to recognised assets or liabilities cash flow hedges : or 3 hedges of net investments in foreign operations net investment hedges.
These are accounted for as follows: 1 Fair value hedges Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk: this also applies if the hedged asset is classified as an available-for-sale financial asset.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are no longer recognised in the income statement.
The cumulative adjustment that has been made to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to the income statement using the effective interest method over the period to maturity.
2 Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge reserve.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the periods in which the hedged item affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised in the income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
3 Net investment hedges Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income, the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
The hedging instrument used in net investment hedges may include non-derivative liabilities as well as derivative financial instruments.
G Offset Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right of set-off and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
In certain situations, even though master netting agreements exist, the lack of management intention to settle on a net basis results in the financial assets and liabilities being reported gross on the balance sheet.
H Impairment of financial assets 1 Assets accounted for at amortised cost At each balance sheet date the Group assesses whether, as a result of one or more events occurring after initial recognition of the financial asset and prior to the balance sheet date, there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets has become impaired.
Where such an event has had an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets, an impairment allowance is recognised.
The amount of impairment allowance is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the assets original effective interest rate.
If the asset has a variable rate of interest, the discount rate used for measuring the impairment allowance is the current effective interest rate.
Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group 218 219 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 nOTeS TO THe COnSOlIDATeD FInAnCIAl STATeMenTS Note 2: Accounting policies continued Subsequent to the recognition of an impairment loss on a financial asset or a group of financial assets, interest income continues to be recognised on an effective interest rate basis, on the assets carrying value net of impairment provisions.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, such as an improvement in the borrowers credit rating, the allowance is adjusted and the amount of the reversal is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment allowances are assessed individually for financial assets that are individually significant.
Such individual assessment is used primarily for the Groups wholesale lending portfolios in the Commercial Banking and Wealth, Asset Finance and International divisions.
Impairment allowances for portfolios of smaller balance homogenous loans such as most residential mortgages, personal loans and credit card balances in the Groups retail portfolios in both the Retail and Wealth, Asset Finance and International divisions that are below the individual assessment thresholds, and for loan losses that have been incurred but not separately identified at the balance sheet date, are determined on a collective basis.
Individual assessment In respect of individually significant financial assets in the Groups wholesale lending portfolios, assets are reviewed on a regular basis and those showing potential or actual vulnerability are placed on a watchlist where greater monitoring is undertaken and any adverse or potentially adverse impact on ability to repay is used in assessing whether an asset should be transferred to a dedicated Business Support unit.
Specific examples of trigger events that would lead to the initial recognition of impairment allowances against lending to corporate borrowers or the recognition of additional impairment allowances include i trading losses, loss of business or major customer of a borrower: ii material breaches of the terms and conditions of a loan facility, including non-payment of interest or principal, or a fall in the value of security such that it is no longer considered adequate: iii disappearance of an active market because of financial difficulties: or iv restructuring a facility with preferential terms to aid recovery of the lending such as a debt for equity swap.
For such individually identified financial assets, a review is undertaken of the expected future cash flows which requires significant management judgement as to the amount and timing of such cash flows.
Where the debt is secured, the assessment reflects the expected cash flows from the realisation of the security, net of costs to realise, whether or not foreclosure or realisation of the collateral is probable.
For impaired debt instruments which are held at amortised cost, impairment losses are recognised in subsequent periods when it is determined that there has been a further negative impact on expected future cash flows.
A reduction in fair value caused by general widening of credit spreads would not, of itself, result in additional impairment.
Collective assessment Impairment is assessed on a collective basis for 1 homogenous groups of loans that are not considered individually impaired: and 2 to cover losses which have been incurred but have not yet been identified on loans subject to individual impairment.
Homogenous groups of loans In respect of portfolios of smaller balance, homogenous loans, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar risk characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment.
Segmentation takes into account factors such as the type of asset, industry sector, geographical location, collateral type, past-due status and other relevant factors.
These characteristics are relevant to the estimation of future cash flows for groups of such assets as they are indicative of the borrowers ability to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the assets being evaluated.
Generally, the impairment trigger used within the impairment calculation for a loan, or group of loans, is when they reach a pre-defined level of delinquency or where the customer is bankrupt.
loans where the Group provides arrangements that forgive a portion of interest or principal are also deemed to be impaired and loans that are originated to refinance currently impaired assets are also defined as impaired.
In respect of the Groups secured mortgage portfolios, the impairment allowance is calculated based on a definition of impaired loans which are those six months or more in arrears or certain cases where the borrower is bankrupt or is in possession.
The estimated cash flows are calculated based on historical experience and are dependent on estimates of the expected value of collateral which takes into account expected future movements in house prices, less costs to sell.
For unsecured personal lending portfolios, the impairment trigger is generally when the balance is two or more instalments in arrears or where the customer has exhibited one or more of the impairment characteristics set out above.
While the trigger is based on the payment performance or circumstances of each individual asset, the assessment of future cash flows uses historical experience of cohorts of similar portfolios such that the assessment is considered to be collective.
Future cash flows are estimated on the basis of the contractual cash flows of the assets in the cohort and historical loss experience for similar assets.
Historical loss experience is adjusted on the basis of current observable data about economic and credit conditions including unemployment rates and borrowers behaviour to reflect the effects of current conditions that did not affect the period on which the historical loss experience is based and to remove the effects of conditions in the historical period that do not exist currently.
The methodology and assumptions used for estimating future cash flows are reviewed regularly by the Group to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.
Incurred but not yet identified impairment The collective provision also includes provision for inherent losses, that is losses that have been incurred but have not been separately identified at the balance sheet date.
The loans that are not currently recognised as impaired are grouped into homogenous portfolios by key risk drivers.
Risk drivers for secured retail lending include the current indexed loan-to-value, previous mortgage arrears, internal cross-product delinquency data and external credit bureau data: for unsecured retail lending they include whether the account is up-to-date and, if not, the number of payments that have been missed: and for wholesale lending they include factors such as observed default rates and loss given default.
An assessment is made of the likelihood of each account becoming recognised as impaired within the loss emergence period, with the economic loss that each Independent auditors report 198 Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group Consolidated financial statements 204 218 219 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 212 Parent company financial statements 366 Notes to the parent company financial statements 369 1 44 69 123 377 Note 2: Accounting policies continued portfolio is likely to generate were it to become impaired.
The loss emergence period is determined by local management for each portfolio and the Group has a range of loss emergence periods which are dependent upon the characteristics of the portfolios.
loss emergence periods are reviewed regularly and updated when appropriate.
In general the periods used across the Group vary between one month and twelve months based on historical experience.
unsecured portfolios tend to have shorter loss emergence periods than secured portfolios.
loan renegotiations and forbearance In certain circumstances, the Group will renegotiate the original terms of a customers loan, either as part of an ongoing customer relationship or in response to adverse changes in the circumstances of the borrower.
Where the renegotiated payments of interest and principal will not recover the original carrying value of the asset, the asset continues to be reported as past due and is considered impaired.
Where the renegotiated payments of interest and principal will recover the original carrying value of the asset, the loan is no longer reported as past due or impaired provided that payments are made in accordance with the revised terms.
Renegotiation may lead to the loan and associated provision being derecognised and a new loan being recognised initially at fair value.
Write offs A loan or advance is normally written off, either partially or in full, against the related allowance when the proceeds from realising any available security have been received or there is no realistic prospect of recovery and the amount of the loss has been determined.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off decrease the amount of impairment losses recorded in the income statement.
For both secured and unsecured retail balances, the write-off takes place only once an extensive set of collections processes has been completed, or the status of the account reaches a point where policy dictates that forbearance is no longer appropriate.
For wholesale lending, a write-off occurs if the loan facility with the customer is restructured, the asset is under administration and the only monies that can be received are the amounts estimated by the administrator, the underlying assets are disposed and a decision is made that no further settlement monies will be received, or external evidence for example, third party valuations is available that there has been an irreversible decline in expected cash flows.
Debt for equity exchanges equity securities acquired in exchange for loans in order to achieve an orderly realisation are accounted for as a disposal of the loan and an acquisition of equity securities, held as available-for-sale.
Where control is obtained over an entity as a result of the transaction, the entity is consolidated: where the Group has significant influence over an entity as a result of the transaction, the investment is accounted for by the equity method of accounting see A above.
Any subsequent impairment of the assets or business acquired is treated as an impairment of the relevant asset or business and not as an impairment of the original instrument.
2 Available-for-sale financial assets The Group assesses, at each balance sheet date, whether there is objective evidence that an available-for-sale financial asset is impaired.
In addition to the criteria for financial assets accounted for at amortised cost set out above, this assessment involves reviewing the current financial circumstances including creditworthiness and future prospects of the issuer, assessing the future cash flows expected to be realised and, in the case of equity shares, considering whether there has been a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the asset below its cost.
If an impairment loss has been incurred, the cumulative loss measured as the difference between the acquisition cost net of any principal repayment and amortisation and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that asset previously recognised, is reclassified from equity to the income statement.
For impaired debt instruments, impairment losses are recognised in subsequent periods when it is determined that there has been a further negative impact on expected future cash flows: a reduction in fair value caused by general widening of credit spreads would not, of itself, result in additional impairment.
If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, an amount not greater than the original impairment loss is credited to the income statement: any excess is taken to other comprehensive income.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the income statement.
I Investment property Investment property comprises freehold and long leasehold land and buildings that are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both.
The Groups investment property primarily relates to property held for long-term rental yields and capital appreciation within the life insurance funds.
Investment property is carried in the balance sheet at fair value, being the open market value as determined in accordance with the guidance published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
If this information is not available, the Group uses alternative valuation methods such as discounted cash flow projections or recent prices.
These valuations are reviewed at least annually by an independent valuation expert.
Investment property being redeveloped for continuing use as investment property, or for which the market has become less active, continues to be measured at fair value.
Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement as net trading income.
J Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are included at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The value of land included in premises is not depreciated.
Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the difference between the cost and the residual value over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Premises excluding land : Freehold long and short leasehold premises: shorter of 50 years and the remaining period of the lease.
leasehold improvements: shorter of 10 years and, if lease renewal is not likely, the remaining period of the lease.

Other equipment and motor vehicles: 2-8 years.
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
In the event that an assets carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount it is written down immediately.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
K Leases 1 As lessee The leases entered into by the Group are primarily operating leases.
Operating lease rentals payable are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
When an operating lease is terminated before the end of the lease period, any payment made to the lessor by way of penalty is recognised as an expense in the period of termination.
2 As lessor Assets leased to customers are classified as finance leases if the lease agreements transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee but not necessarily legal title.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
When assets are subject to finance leases, the present value of the lease payments, together with any unguaranteed residual value, is recognised as a receivable, net of provisions, within loans and advances to banks and customers.
The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is recognised as unearned finance lease income.
Finance lease income is recognised in interest income over the term of the lease using the net investment method before tax so as to give a constant rate of return on the net investment in the leases.
unguaranteed residual values are reviewed regularly to identify any impairment.
Operating lease assets are included within tangible fixed assets at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives, which equates to the lives of the leases, after taking into account anticipated residual values.
Operating lease rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
The Group evaluates non-lease arrangements such as outsourcing and similar contracts to determine if they contain a lease which is then accounted for separately.
L Employee benefits Short-term employee benefits, such as salaries, paid absences, performance-based cash awards and social security costs are recognised over the period in which the employees provide the related services.
The Group operates a number of post-retirement benefit schemes for its employees including both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
A defined benefit scheme is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and salary.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan into which the Group pays fixed contributions: there is no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions.
Full actuarial valuations of the Groups principal defined benefit schemes are carried out every three years with interim reviews in the intervening years: these valuations are updated to 31 December each year by qualified independent actuaries.
For the purposes of these annual updates scheme assets are included at their fair value and scheme liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method.
The defined benefit scheme liabilities are discounted using rates equivalent to the market yields at the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
The Groups income statement charge includes the current service cost of providing pension benefits, past service costs, net interest expense income, and plan administration costs that are not deducted from the return on plan assets.
Past service costs, which represents the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from a plan amendment or curtailment, are recognised when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs.
net interest expense income is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
Remeasurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets excluding amounts included in net interest expense income and net of the cost of managing the plan assets, and the effect of changes to the asset ceiling if applicable are reflected immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income are reflected immediately in retained profits and will not subsequently be reclassified to profit or loss.
The Groups balance sheet includes the net surplus or deficit, being the difference between the fair value of scheme assets and the discounted value of scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Surpluses are only recognised to the extent that they are recoverable through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the schemes.
The costs of the Groups defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.
The accounting for share-based compensation is set out in M below.
Independent auditors report 198 Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group Consolidated financial statements 204 220 221 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 212 Parent company financial statements 366 Notes to the parent company financial statements 369 1 44 69 123 377 Note 2: Accounting policies continued M Share-based compensation The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans in respect of services received from certain of its employees.
The value of the employee services received in exchange for equity instruments granted under these plans is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the instruments, with a corresponding increase in equity.
This expense is determined by reference to the fair value of the number of equity instruments that are expected to vest.
The fair value of equity instruments granted is based on market prices, if available, at the date of grant.
In the absence of market prices, the fair value of the instruments at the date of grant is estimated using an appropriate valuation technique, such as a Black-Scholes option pricing model or a Monte Carlo simulation.
The determination of fair values excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions, which are included in the assumptions used to estimate the number of options that are expected to vest.
At each balance sheet date, this estimate is reassessed and if necessary revised.
Any revision of the original estimate is recognised in the income statement, together with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Cancellations by employees of contributions to the Groups Save As You earn plans are treated as non-vesting conditions and the Group recognises, in the year of cancellation, the amount of the expense that would have otherwise been recognised over the remainder of the vesting period.
Modifications are assessed at the date of modification and any incremental charges are charged to the income statement.
N Taxation Current income tax which is payable on taxable profits is recognised as an expense in the period in which the profits arise.
For the Groups long-term insurance businesses, the tax charge is analysed between tax that is payable in respect of policyholders returns and tax that is payable on shareholders returns.
This allocation is based on an assessment of the rates of tax which will be applied to the returns under current uK tax rules.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date which are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Income tax payable on profits is recognised as an expense in the period in which those profits arise.
The tax effects of losses available for carry forward are recognised as an asset when it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which these losses can be utilised.
Deferred and current tax related to gains and losses on the fair value re-measurement of available-for-sale investments and cash flow hedges, where these gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income, is also recognised in other comprehensive income.
Such tax is subsequently transferred to the income statement together with the gain or loss.
Deferred and current tax assets and liabilities are offset when they arise in the same tax reporting group and where there is both a legal right of offset and the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
O Insurance The Group undertakes both life insurance and general insurance business.
Insurance and participating investment contracts are accounted for under IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, which permits with certain exceptions the continuation of accounting practices for measuring insurance and participating investment contracts that applied prior to the adoption of IFRS.
The Group, therefore, continues to account for these products using uK GAAP, including FRS 27 Life Assurance, and uK established practice.
Products sold by the life insurance business are classified into three categories: Insurance contracts these contracts transfer significant insurance risk and may also transfer financial risk.
The Group defines significant insurance risk as the possibility of having to pay benefits on the occurrence of an insured event which are significantly more than the benefits payable if the insured event were not to occur.
These contracts may or may not include discretionary participation features.
Investment contracts containing a discretionary participation feature participating investment contracts these contracts do not transfer significant insurance risk, but contain a contractual right which gives the holder the right to receive, in addition to the guaranteed benefits, further additional discretionary benefits or bonuses that are likely to be a significant proportion of the total contractual benefits and the amount and timing of which is at the discretion of the Group, within the constraints of the terms and conditions of the instrument and based upon the performance of specified assets.
non-participating investment contracts these contracts do not transfer significant insurance risk or contain a discretionary participation feature.
The general insurance business issues only insurance contracts.
1 Life insurance business i Accounting for insurance and participating investment contracts Premiums and claims Premiums received in respect of insurance and participating investment contracts are recognised as revenue when due except for unit-linked contracts on which premiums are recognised as revenue when received.
Claims are recorded as an expense on the earlier of the maturity date or the date on which the claim is notified.
Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group 222 223 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 nOTeS TO THe COnSOlIDATeD FInAnCIAl STATeMenTS Note 2: Accounting policies continued Liabilities Insurance and participating investment contracts in the Groups with-profit funds liabilities of the Groups with-profit funds, including guarantees and options embedded within products written by these funds, are stated at their realistic values in accordance with the Prudential Regulation Authoritys realistic capital regime, except that projected transfers out of the funds into other Group funds are recorded in the unallocated surplus see below.
Further details on the realistic capital regime are given on page 187.
Changes in the value of these liabilities are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims.
Insurance and participating investment contracts which are not unit-linked or in the Groups with-profit funds A liability for contractual benefits that are expected to be incurred in the future is recorded when the premiums are recognised.
The liability is calculated by estimating the future cash flows over the duration of in-force policies and discounting them back to the valuation date allowing for probabilities of occurrence.
The liability will vary with movements in interest rates and with the cost of life insurance and annuity benefits where future mortality is uncertain.
Assumptions are made in respect of all material factors affecting future cash flows, including future interest rates, mortality and costs.
Insurance and participating investment contracts which are unit-linked liabilities for unit-linked insurance contracts and participating investment contracts are stated at the bid value of units plus an additional allowance where appropriate such as for any excess of future expenses over charges.
The liability is increased or reduced by the change in the unit prices and is reduced by policy administration fees, mortality and surrender charges and any withdrawals.
Changes in the value of the liability are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims.
Benefit claims in excess of the account balances incurred in the period are also charged through insurance claims.
Revenue consists of fees deducted for mortality, policy administration and surrender charges.
Unallocated surplus Any amounts in the with-profit funds not yet determined as being due to policyholders or shareholders are recognised as an unallocated surplus which is shown separately from liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.
ii Accounting for non-participating investment contracts The Groups non-participating investment contracts are primarily unit-linked.
These contracts are accounted for as financial liabilities whose value is contractually linked to the fair values of financial assets within the Groups unitised investment funds.
The value of the unit-linked financial liabilities is determined using current unit prices multiplied by the number of units attributed to the contract holders at the balance sheet date.
Their value is never less than the amount payable on surrender, discounted for the required notice period where applicable.
Investment returns including movements in fair value and investment income allocated to those contracts are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims.
Deposits and withdrawals are not accounted for through the income statement but are accounted for directly in the balance sheet as adjustments to the non-participating investment contract liability.
The Group receives investment management fees in the form of an initial adjustment or charge to the amount invested.
These fees are in respect of services rendered in conjunction with the issue and management of investment contracts where the Group actively manages the consideration received from its customers to fund a return that is based on the investment profile that the customer selected on origination of the contract.
These services comprise an indeterminate number of acts over the lives of the individual contracts and, therefore, the Group defers these fees and recognises them over the estimated lives of the contracts, in line with the provision of investment management services.
Costs which are directly attributable and incremental to securing new non-participating investment contracts are deferred.
This asset is subsequently amortised over the period of the provision of investment management services and is reviewed for impairment in circumstances where its carrying amount may not be recoverable.
If the asset is greater than its recoverable amount it is written down immediately through fee and commission expense in the income statement.
All other costs are recognised as expenses when incurred.
iii Value of in-force business The Group recognises as an asset the value of in-force business in respect of insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.
The asset represents the present value of the shareholders interest in the profits expected to emerge from those contracts written at the balance sheet date.
This is determined after making appropriate assumptions about future economic and operating conditions such as future mortality and persistency rates and includes allowances for both non-market risk and for the realistic value of financial options and guarantees.
each cash flow is valued using the discount rate consistent with that applied to such a cash flow in the capital markets.
The asset in the consolidated balance sheet is presented gross of attributable tax and movements in the asset are reflected within other operating income in the income statement.
The Groups contractual rights to benefits from providing investment management services in relation to non-participating investment contracts acquired in business combinations and portfolio transfers are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition.
The resulting asset is amortised over the estimated lives of the contracts.
At each reporting date an assessment is made to determine if there is any indication of impairment.
Where impairment exists, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount and the impairment loss recognised in the income statement.

underwriting premiums are included in insurance premium income, net of refunds, in the period in which insurance cover is provided to the customer: premiums received relating to future periods are deferred in the balance sheet within liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts and only credited to the income statement when earned.
Broking commission is recognised when the underwriter accepts the risk of providing insurance cover to the customer.
Where appropriate, provision is made for the effect of future policy terminations based upon past experience.
The underwriting business makes provision for the estimated cost of claims notified but not settled and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date.
The provision for the cost of claims notified but not settled is based upon a best estimate of the cost of settling the outstanding claims after taking into account all known facts.
In those cases where there is insufficient information to determine the required provision, statistical techniques are used which take into account the cost of claims that have recently been settled and make assumptions about the future development of the outstanding cases.
Similar statistical techniques are used to determine the provision for claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date.
Claims liabilities are not discounted.
3 Liability adequacy test At each balance sheet date liability adequacy tests are performed to ensure the adequacy of insurance and participating investment contract liabilities net of related deferred cost assets and value of in-force business.
In performing these tests current best estimates of discounted future contractual cash flows and claims handling and policy administration expenses, as well as investment income from the assets backing such liabilities, are used.
Any deficiency is immediately charged to the income statement, initially by writing off the relevant assets and subsequently by establishing a provision for losses arising from liability adequacy tests.
4 Reinsurance Contracts entered into by the Group with reinsurers under which the Group is compensated for benefits payable on one or more contracts issued by the Group are recognised as assets arising from reinsurance contracts held.
Where the underlying contracts issued by the Group are classified as insurance contracts and the reinsurance contract transfers significant insurance risk on those contracts to the reinsurer, the assets arising from reinsurance contracts held are classified as insurance contracts.
Where the underlying contracts issued by the Group are classified as non-participating investment contracts and the reinsurance contract transfers financial risk on those contracts to the reinsurer, the assets arising from reinsurance contracts held are classified as non-participating investment contracts.
Assets arising from reinsurance contracts held Classified as insurance contracts Amounts recoverable from or due to reinsurers are measured consistently with the amounts associated with the reinsured contracts and in accordance with the terms of each reinsurance contract and are regularly reviewed for impairment.
Premiums payable for reinsurance contracts are recognised as an expense when due within insurance premium income.
Changes in the reinsurance recoverable assets are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims.
Assets arising from reinsurance contracts held Classified as non-participating investment contracts These contracts are accounted for as financial assets whose value is contractually linked to the fair values of financial assets within the reinsurers investment funds.
Investment returns including movements in fair value and investment income allocated to these contracts are recognised in insurance claims.
Deposits and withdrawals are not accounted for through the income statement but are accounted for directly in the balance sheet as adjustments to the assets arising from reinsurance contracts held.
P Foreign currency translation Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the appropriate functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when recognised in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow or net investment hedges.
non-monetary assets that are measured at fair value are translated using the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined.
Translation differences on equities and similar non-monetary items held at fair value through profit and loss are recognised in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss.
Translation differences on available-for-sale non-monetary financial assets, such as equity shares, are included in the fair value reserve in equity unless the asset is a hedged item in a fair value hedge.
Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group 224 225 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 nOTeS TO THe COnSOlIDATeD FInAnCIAl STATeMenTS Note 2: Accounting policies continued The results and financial position of all group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity, are translated into sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average exchange rates unless these do not approximate to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on the translation of a foreign operation are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity together with exchange differences arising from the translation of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments see F 3 above.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of exchange differences relating to that foreign operation are reclassified from equity and included in determining the profit or loss arising on disposal.
Q Provisions and contingent liabilities Provisions are recognised in respect of present obligations arising from past events where it is probable that outflows of resources will be required to settle the obligations and they can be reliably estimated.
The Group recognises provisions in respect of vacant leasehold property where the unavoidable costs of the present obligations exceed anticipated rental income.
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence depends on the outcome of uncertain future events or those present obligations where the outflows of resources are uncertain or cannot be measured reliably.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless they are remote.
Provision is made for irrevocable undrawn loan commitments if it is probable that the facility will be drawn and result in the recognition of an asset at an amount less than the amount advanced.
R Share capital 1 Share issue costs Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options or to the acquisition of a business are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
2 Dividends Dividends paid on the Groups ordinary shares are recognised as a reduction in equity in the period in which they are paid.
3 Treasury shares Where the Company or any member of the Group purchases the Companys share capital, the consideration paid is deducted from shareholders equity as treasury shares until they are cancelled.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in shareholders equity.
S Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and non-mandatory balances with central banks and amounts due from banks with a maturity of less than three months.
Note 3: Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of the Groups financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in applying the accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Due to the inherent uncertainty in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be based upon amounts which differ from those estimates.
estimates, judgements and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The significant judgements made by management in applying the Groups accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty in these financial statements, which together are deemed critical to the Groups results and financial position, are as follows.
Allowance for impairment losses on loans and receivables At 31 December 2013 gross loans and receivables totalled 534,092 million 2012: 570,714 million against which impairment allowances of 12,091 million 2012: 15,459 million had been made see note 24.
The Groups accounting policy for losses arising on financial assets classified as loans and receivables is described in note 2 H 1 : this note also provides an overview of the methodologies applied.
The allowance for impairment losses on loans and receivables is managements best estimate of losses incurred in the portfolio at the balance sheet date.
Impairment allowances are made up of two components, those determined individually and those determined collectively.
Individual impairment allowances are generally established against the Groups wholesale lending portfolios.
The determination of individual impairment allowances requires the exercise of considerable judgement by management involving matters such as local economic conditions Independent auditors report 198 Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group Consolidated financial statements 204 224 225 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 212 Parent company financial statements 366 Notes to the parent company financial statements 369 1 44 69 123 377 Note 3: Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued and the resulting trading performance of the customer, and the value of the security held, for which there may not be a readily accessible market.
In particular, significant judgement is required by management in the current economic environment in assessing the borrowers cash flows and debt servicing capability together with the realisable value of collateral.
The actual amount of the future cash flows and their timing may differ significantly from the assumptions made for the purposes of determining the impairment allowances and consequently these allowances can be subject to variation as time progresses and the circumstances of the customer become clearer.
Collective impairment allowances are generally established for smaller balance homogenous portfolios such as the retail portfolios.
The collective impairment allowance is also subject to estimation uncertainty and in particular is sensitive to changes in economic and credit conditions, including the interdependency of house prices, unemployment rates, interest rates, borrowers behaviour, and consumer bankruptcy trends.
It is, however, inherently difficult to estimate how changes in one or more of these factors might impact the collective impairment allowance.
Given the relative size of the mortgage portfolio, a key variable is house prices which determine the collateral value supporting loans in such portfolios.
The value of this collateral is estimated by applying changes in house price indices to the original assessed value of the property.
If average house prices were ten per cent lower than those estimated at 31 December 2013, the impairment charge would increase by approximately 310 million in respect of uK mortgages and a further 36 million in respect of Irish mortgages.
In addition, a collective unimpaired provision is made for loan losses that have been incurred but have not been separately identified at the balance sheet date.
This provision is sensitive to changes in the time between the loss event and the date the impairment is specifically identified.
This period is known as the loss emergence period.
In the Commercial Banking division, an increase of one month in the loss emergence period in respect of the loan portfolio assessed for collective unimpaired provisions would result in an increase in the collective unimpaired provision of approximately 105million at 31 December 2012, a one month increase in the loss emergence period would have increased the collective unimpaired provision by an estimated 130 million.
Recoverability of deferred tax assets At 31 December 2013 the Group carried deferred tax assets on its balance sheet of 5,104 million 2012: 4,913 million and deferred tax liabilities of 3million 2012: 327 million note 42.
This presentation takes into account the ability of the Group to net deferred tax assets and liabilities only where there is a legally enforceable right of offset.
note 42 presents the Groups deferred tax assets and liabilities by type.
The largest category of deferred tax asset relates to tax losses carried forward.
The recoverability of the Groups deferred tax assets in respect of carry forward losses is based on an assessment of future levels of taxable profit expected to arise that can be offset against these losses.
The Groups expectations as to the level of future taxable profits take into account the Groups long-term financial and strategic plans, and anticipated future tax adjusting items.
In making this assessment account is taken of business plans, the five year board approved operating plan and the following future risk factors: The expected future economic outlook as set out in the Group Chief executives Review and Market Overview: The retail banking business disposal as required by the european Commission: and Future regulatory change.
The Groups total deferred tax asset includes 6,338 million 2012: 7,034 million in respect of trading losses carried forward.
The tax losses have arisen in individual legal entities and will be used as future taxable profits arise in those legal entities, though substantially all of the unused tax losses for which a deferred tax asset has been recognised arise in Bank of Scotland plc and lloyds Bank plc.
The deferred tax asset is expected to be utilised over different time periods in each of the entities in which the losses arise.
under current uK tax law there is no expiry date for unused tax losses.
The losses are still expected to be fully utilised by 2019.
As disclosed in note 42, deferred tax assets totalling 802 million 2012: 1,311 million have not been recognised in respect of certain capital losses carried forward, trading losses carried forward and unrelieved foreign tax credits as there are no predicted future capital or taxable profits against which these losses can be recognised.
Retirement benefit obligations The net liability recognised in the balance sheet at 31 December 2013 in respect of the Groups retirement benefit obligations was 998 million comprising an asset of 98million and a liability of 1,096 million 2012: a net liability of 1,164 million comprising an asset of 741 million and a liability of 1,905 million related to post-retirement defined benefit schemes.
The defined benefit pension schemes net accounting deficit totalled 787 million 2012: deficit of 957 million representing the difference between the schemes liabilities and the fair value of the related assets at the balance sheet date.
The value of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes liabilities requires management to make a number of assumptions.
The key areas of estimation uncertainty are the discount rate applied to future cash flows and the expected lifetime of the schemes members.
The accounting surplus or deficit is sensitive to changes in the discount rate, which is affected by market conditions and therefore potentially subject to significant variation.
The cost of the benefits payable by the schemes will also depend upon the longevity of the members.
Assumptions are made regarding the expected lifetime of scheme members based upon recent experience and extrapolate the improving trend, however given the rate of advance in medical science and increasing levels of obesity, it is uncertain whether they will ultimately reflect actual experience.
The effect on the net accounting surplus or deficit and on the pension charge in the Groups income statement of changes to the principal actuarial assumptions is set out in note 41.

The value of in-force business asset represents the present value of future profits expected to arise from the portfolio of in-force life insurance and participating investment contracts.
The acquired value of in-force business asset represents the contractual rights to benefits from providing investment management services in relation to non-participating investment contracts acquired in business combinations and portfolio transfers.
The methodology used to value these assets is set out in note 28.
The valuation or recoverability of these assets requires assumptions to be made about future economic and operating conditions which are inherently uncertain and changes could significantly affect the value attributed to these assets.
The key assumptions that have been made in determining the carrying value of the value of in-force business assets at 31 December 2013 are set out in note 28.
At 31 December 2013, the Group carried total liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts of 82,777million 2012: 82,953 million.
The methodology used to value these liabilities is described in note 36. elements of the liability valuations require assumptions to be made about future investment returns, future mortality rates and future policyholder behaviour and are subject to significant management judgement and estimation uncertainty.
The key assumptions that have been made in determining the carrying value of these liabilities are set out in note 36.
The effect on the Groups profit before tax and shareholders equity of changes in key assumptions used in determining the life insurance assets and liabilities is set out in note 37.
Payment protection insurance and other regulatory provisions At 31 December 2013, the Group carried provisions of 3,815 million 2012: 3,366 million against the cost of making redress payments to customers and the related administration costs in connection with historical regulatory breaches, principally the misselling of payment protection insurance.
Determining the amount of the provisions, which represent managements best estimate of the cost of settling these issues, requires the exercise of significant judgement.
It will often be necessary to form a view on matters which are inherently uncertain, such as the number of future complaints, the extent to which they will be upheld and the average cost of redress.
Consequently the continued appropriateness of the underlying assumptions is reviewed on a regular basis against actual experience and other relevant evidence and adjustments made to the provisions where appropriate.
note 43 contains more detail on the nature of the assumptions that have been made and key sensitivities.
Fair value of financial instruments In accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, the Group categorises financial instruments carried on the balance sheet at fair value using a three level hierarchy.
Financial instruments categorised as level 1 are valued using quoted market prices and therefore there is minimal judgement applied in determining fair value.
However, the fair value of financial instruments categorised as level 2 and, in particular, level 3 is determined using valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis and valuation models.
These valuation techniques involve management judgement and estimates the extent of which depends on the complexity of the instrument and the availability of market observable information.
Valuation techniques for level 2 financial instruments use inputs that are based on observable market data.
level 3 financial instruments are those where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation is not based on observable market data.
Determining the appropriate assumptions to be used for level 3 financial instruments requires significant management judgement.
At 31 December 2013, the Group classified 7,700 million of financial assets and 1,075 million of financial liabilities as level 3.
Further details of the Groups level 3 financial instruments and the sensitivity of their valuation including the effect of applying reasonably possible alternative assumptions in determining their fair value are set out in note 53.

The Group executive Committee has been determined to be the chief operating decision maker for the Group.
The Groups operating segments reflect its organisational and management structures.
The Group executive Committee reviews the Groups internal reporting based around these segments in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
This assessment includes a consideration of each segments net interest revenue and consequently the total interest income and expense for all reportable segments is presented on a net basis.
The segments are differentiated by the type of products provided, by whether the customers are individuals or corporate entities and by the geographical location of the customer.
The segmental results and comparatives are presented on an underlying basis, the basis reviewed by the chief operating decision maker.
The Groups activities are organised into four financial reporting segments: Retail: Commercial Banking: Wealth, Asset Finance and International: and Insurance.
Retail offers a broad range of retail financial service products in the uK, including current accounts, savings, personal loans, credit cards and mortgages.
It is also a major general insurance and bancassurance distributor, selling a wide range of long-term savings, investment and general insurance products.
Commercial Banking provides banking and related services for all uK and multinational business clients, from small and medium-sized enterprises to major corporate and financial institutions.
Wealth, Asset Finance and International gives increased focus and momentum to the Groups private banking and asset management activities, closely co-ordinates the management of its international businesses and also encompasses the Asset Finance business.
Wealth comprises the Groups private banking, wealth and asset management businesses in the uK and overseas.
International comprises retail businesses, principally in Continental europe.
Insurance provides long-term savings, protection and investment products distributed through the bancassurance, intermediary and direct channels in the uK.
It is also a distributor of home insurance in the uK with products sold through the retail branch network, direct channels and strategic corporate partners.
The business consists of life, Pensions and Investments uK: life, Pensions and Investments europe: and General Insurance.
Other includes the costs of managing the Groups technology platforms, branch and head office property estate, operations including payments, banking operations and collections and sourcing, the costs of which are predominantly recharged to the other divisions.
It also reflects other items not recharged to the divisions, including hedge ineffectiveness, uK bank levy, Financial Services Compensation Scheme costs, gains on liability management, volatile items such as hedge accounting volatility managed centrally, and other gains from the structural hedging of interest rate risk.
Inter-segment services are generally recharged at cost, with the exception of the internal commission arrangements between the uK branch and other distribution networks and the insurance product manufacturing businesses within the Group, where a profit margin is also charged.
Inter-segment lending and deposits are generally entered into at market rates, except that non-interest bearing balances are priced at a rate that reflects the external yield that could be earned on such funds.
For the majority of those derivative contracts entered into by business units for risk management purposes, the business unit recognises the net interest income or expense on an accrual accounting basis and transfers the remainder of the movement in the fair value of the derivative to the central group segment where the resulting accounting volatility is managed where possible through the establishment of hedge accounting relationships.
Any change in fair value of the hedged instrument attributable to the hedged risk is also recorded within the central group segment.
This allocation of the fair value of the swap and change in fair value of the hedged instrument attributable to the hedged risk avoids accounting asymmetry in segmental results and leads to accounting volatility in the central group segment where it is managed.

During February 2012, the Group completed the exchange of certain subordinated debt securities issued by the HBOS group for new subordinated debt securities issued by lloyds Bank plc formerly lloyds TSB Bank plc.
As part of the exchange, the Group announced that all decisions to exercise calls on those original securities that remained outstanding following the exchange offer would be made with reference to the prevailing regulatory, economic and market conditions at the time.
The Group adjusted the carrying amount of these securities to reflect the revised estimated cash flows and recognised a credit of 109 million in interest expense in the year ended 31 December 2012 in 2011 there was a gain following a similar adjustment to carrying value of 570 million.
In December 2011, the Group decided to defer payment of non-mandatory coupons on certain securities and, instead, settle them using an Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism on their contractual terms.
This change in expected cash flows resulted in a gain of 126 million in net interest income in the year ended 31 December 2011 from the recalculation of the carrying value of these securities.

This exchange resulted in a gain on the extinguishment of the existing securities of 59 million being the difference between the carrying amount of the securities extinguished and the fair value of the new securities issued together with related fees and costs.
Additionally, during the second half of 2012 losses totalling 397 million arose on the buy-back of other debt securities.

As a result of that reduction in holding the Group ceased to consolidate St Jamess Place plc in its accounts, instead accounting for the residual investment as an associate.
The Group realised a gain of 394 million on the sale of those shares and the fair valuation of the Groups residual stake.
Subsequently, on 29 May 2013 the Group completed the sale of a further 77 million shares, generating a profit of 39 million and on 13 December 2013 completed the sale of the remainder of its holding, generating a profit of 107 million.

2 The Group has agreed certain changes to early retirement and commutation factors in two of its principal defined benefit pension schemes, resulting in a cost of 104 million recognised in the Groups income statement in the year ended 31 December 2013.
During 2012, following a review of policy in respect of discretionary pension increases in relation to the Groups defined benefit pension schemes, increases in certain schemes are now linked to the Consumer Price Index rather than the Retail Price Index.
The impact of this change was a reduction in the Groups defined benefit obligation of 258 million, recognised in the Groups income statement in 2012, net of a charge of 8 million resulting from a change to the commutation factors in one of the Groups smaller schemes.
3 Other regulatory provisions in 2013 include a fine of 28 million levied on the Group by the Financial Conduct Authority in relation to failings in control over sales incentive schemes in the Groups branch network.
4 Regulatory provisions of 50 million were charged against income in 2012.

Other services supplied pursuant to legislation relate primarily to the costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act audit requirements together with the cost of the audit of the Groups Form 20-F filing.
Audit related fees: This category includes fees in respect of services for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the financial statements, for example acting as reporting accountants in respect of prospectuses and circulars required by the uKlA listing rules.
Services relating to taxation: This category includes tax compliance and tax advisory services.
Other non-audit fees: This category includes due diligence relating to corporate finance, including venture capital transactions and other assurance and advisory services.
It is the Groups policy to use the auditors on assignments in cases where their knowledge of the Group means that it is neither efficient nor cost effective to employ another firm of accountants.
Such assignments typically relate to the provision of advice on tax issues, assistance in transactions involving the acquisition and disposal of businesses and accounting advice.
The Group has procedures that are designed to ensure auditor independence, including that fees for audit and non-audit services are approved in advance.
This approval can be obtained either on an individual engagement basis or, for certain types of non-audit services, particularly those of a recurring nature, through the approval of a fee cap covering engagements of that type provided the fee is below that cap.
All statutory audit work as well as non-audit assignments where the fee is expected to exceed the relevant fee cap must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee on an individual engagement basis.
On a quarterly basis, the Audit Committee receives a report detailing all pre-approved services and amounts paid to the auditors for such pre-approved services.
During the year, the auditors also earned fees payable by entities outside the consolidated lloyds Banking Group in respect of the following: 2013 2012 2011 m m m Audits of Group pension schemes 0.3 0.4 0.4 Audits of the unconsolidated Open ended Investment Companies managed by the Group 0.5 0.8 0.6 Reviews of the financial position of corporate and other borrowers 6.5 5.4 11.0 Acquisition due diligence and other work performed in respect of potential venture capital investments 2.1 0.7 1.0 Note 12: Impairment 2013 2012 2011 m m m Impairment losses on loans and receivables: loans and advances to customers 2,725 5,125 8,020 Debt securities classified as loans and receivables 1 4 49 Total impairment losses on loans and receivables note 24 2,726 5,121 8,069 Impairment of available-for-sale financial assets 15 37 80 Other credit risk provisions 9 55 Total impairment charged to the income statement 2,741 5,149 8,094 Independent auditors report 198 Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group Consolidated financial statements 204 240 241 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 212 Parent company financial statements 366 Notes to the parent company financial statements 369 1 44 69 123 377 Note 13: Investments in joint ventures and associates The Groups share of results of and investments in equity accounted joint ventures and associates comprises: Joint ventures Associates Total 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 m m m m m m m m m Share of income statement amounts: Income 65 278 316 151 63 160 216 341 476 expenses 32 229 261 116 68 161 148 297 422 Impairment 22 6 20 1 1 22 7 19 Profit loss before tax 11 43 35 35 6 46 37 35 Tax 4 9 4 1 3 9 4 Share of post-tax results 7 34 31 36 6 43 28 31 Share of other comprehensive income 6 6 6 6 Share of total comprehensive income 7 40 25 36 6 43 34 25 Share of balance sheet amounts: Current assets 519 3,103 3,346 115 127 246 634 3,230 3,592 non-current assets 1,163 1,596 2,148 508 581 976 1,671 2,177 3,124 Current liabilities 448 729 714 249 128 293 697 857 1,007 non-current liabilities 1,139 3,672 4,471 368 565 904 1,507 4,237 5,375 Share of net assets at 31 December 95 298 309 6 15 25 101 313 334 Movement in investments over the year: At 1 January 298 309 326 15 25 103 313 334 429 exchange and other adjustments 10 2 3 1 1 10 3 4 Additional investments 4 10 7 957 1 3 961 11 10 Disposals 197 44 47 983 6 79 1,180 50 126 Share of post-tax results 7 34 31 36 6 43 28 31 Dividends paid 7 13 5 19 1 26 13 6 Share of net assets at 31 December 95 298 309 6 15 25 101 313 334 The Groups unrecognised share of losses of associates for the year was 4 million 2012: recognised net loss of 10 million: 2011: recognised net loss of 8 million and of joint ventures was 94 million in 2013 2012: 126 million: 2011: 85 million.
For entities making losses, subsequent profits earned are not recognised until previously unrecognised losses are extinguished.
The Groups unrecognised share of losses net of unrecognised profits on a cumulative basis of associates is 36 million 2012: 31 million: 2011: 56 million and of joint ventures is 358 million 2012: 330 million: 2011: 299 million.
In March 2013 the Group sold a tranche of shares in St Jamess Place plc, reducing the Groups holding in that company to approximately 37 per cent and from that point commenced accounting for the residual investment as an associate.
The Group sold its remaining shareholding in May and December 2013 so that the entire investment had been disposed of by the end of the year.
The Groups principal joint venture investment at 31 December 2013 was in Sainsburys Bank plc: the Group owns 50 per cent of the ordinary share capital of Sainsburys Bank plc, whose business is banking and principal area of operation is the uK.
Sainsburys Bank plc is incorporated in the uK and the Groups interest is held by a subsidiary.
In May 2013 the Group reached agreement to sell its interest in Sainsburys Bank plc to J Sainsbury plc: this transaction completed on 31 January 2014 and the Groups investment at 31 December 2013 is included in disposal group assets see note 16.
Where entities have statutory accounts drawn up to a date other than 31 December management accounts are used when accounting for them by the Group.

2 The Finance Act 2012 introduced a new uK tax regime for the taxation of life insurance companies which takes effect from 1 January 2013.
The new regime, combined with current economic forecasts, had a number of impacts on the tax charge in 2012.
The Finance Act 2013 the Act was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013.
The Act further reduced the main rate of corporation tax to 21 per cent with effect from 1 April 2014 and 20 per cent with effect from 1 April 2015.
The change in the main rate of corporation tax from 23 per cent to 20 per cent has resulted in a reduction in the Groups net deferred tax asset at 31 December 2013 of 636 million, comprising the 594 million charge included in the income statement and a 42 million charge included in equity.

Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, which has been calculated after deducting 18 million 2012: 13 million: 2011: 10 million ordinary shares representing the Groups holdings of own shares in respect of employee share schemes.
For the calculation of diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, if any, that arise in respect of share options and awards granted to employees.
The number of shares that could have been acquired at the average annual share price of the Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options and awards is determined.
This is deducted from the number of shares issuable under such options and awards to leave a residual bonus amount of shares which are added to the weighted-average number of ordinary shares in issue, but no adjustment is made to the profit attributable to equity shareholders.
The weighted-average number of anti-dilutive share options and awards excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share was 28million at 31 December 2013 2012: 37million: 2011: 619 million.
Note 16: Disposal groups Disposal groups are classified as held for sale if the Group will recover the carrying amount principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable.
The Group completed the sale of its joint venture interest in Sainsburys Bank on 31 January 2014 and expects to complete the announced sales of its international private banking operations in Monaco and Gibraltar, its German insurance business and Scottish Widows Investment Partnership, its asset management business, in the next 12 months.
The assets and liabilities associated with these operations are therefore classified as held-for-sale disposal groups at 31 December 2013 and included within other assets and other liabilities respectively.

The Group has recognised an impairment of 382 million within other income relating to disposal groups classified as held for sale during 2013.
At 31 December 2012, the Groups uruguayan branch business, its branch remittance business in Japan and its portfolio management business in luxembourg were classified as held-for-sale: these sales completed in 2013.

Included within these assets are investments in unconsolidated structured entities of 24,552 million, see note 22: ii loans and advances to customers of 27 million 2012: 34 million which are economically hedged by interest rate derivatives which are not in hedge accounting relationships and where significant measurement inconsistencies would otherwise arise if the related derivatives were treated as trading liabilities and the loans and advances were carried at amortised cost: and iii private equity investments of 2,632 million 2012: 2,110 million that are managed, and evaluated, on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy and reported to key management personnel on that basis.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2013 of the loans and advances to banks and customers designated at fair value through profit or loss was 27 million 2012: 34 million : the Group does not hold any credit derivatives or other instruments in mitigation of this risk.
There was no significant movement in the fair value of these loans attributable to changes in credit risk which is determined by reference to the publicly available credit ratings of the instruments involved.
Included in the amounts reported above are reverse repurchase agreements treated as collateralised loans witha carrying value of 29,288 million 2012: 14,433 million.
Collateral is held with a fair value of 32,434 million 2012: 19,629 million, all of which the Group is able to repledge.
At 31 December 2013, 8,195 million had been repledged 2012: 15,640 million.
For amounts included above which are subject to repurchase agreements see note 54.
Note 17: Trading and other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Note 18: Derivative financial instruments The Group holds derivatives as part of the following strategies: Customer driven, where derivatives are held as part of the provision of risk management products to Group customers: To manage and hedge the Groups interest rate and foreign exchange risk arising from normal banking business.
The hedge accounting strategy adopted by the Group is to utilise a combination of fair value and cash flow hedge approaches as described in note 54: and Derivatives held in policyholder funds as permitted by the investment strategies of those funds.
Derivatives are classified as trading except those designated as effective hedging instruments which meet the criteria under IAS 39.
Derivatives are held at fair value on the Groups balance sheet.
A description of the methodology used to determine the fair value of derivative financial instruments and the effect of using reasonably possible alternative assumptions for those derivatives valued using unobservable inputs is set out in note 53.
The principal derivatives used by the Group are as follows: Interest rate related contracts include interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options.
An interest rate swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange fixed and floating interest payments, based upon interest rates defined in the contract, without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts.
Forward rate agreements are contracts for the payment of the difference between a specified rate of interest and a reference rate, applied to a notional principal amount at a specific date in the future.
An interest rate option gives the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right, but not the obligation, to fix the rate of interest on a future loan or deposit, for a specified period and commencing on a specified future date.
exchange rate related contracts include forward foreign exchange contracts, currency swaps and options.
A forward foreign exchange contract is an agreement to buy or sell a specified amount of foreign currency on a specified future date at an agreed rate.
Currency swaps generally involve the exchange of interest payment obligations denominated in different currencies: the exchange of principal can be notional or actual.
A currency option gives the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right, but not the obligation, to sell specified amounts of currency at agreed rates of exchange on or before a specified future date.
Credit derivatives, principally credit default swaps, are used by the Group as part of its trading activity and to manage its own exposure to credit risk.
A credit default swap is a swap in which one counterparty receives a premium at pre-set intervals in consideration for guaranteeing to make a specific payment should a negative credit event take place.
The Group also uses credit default swaps to securitise, in combination with external funding, 828million 2012: 2,829 million of corporate and commercial banking loans.
equity derivatives are also used by the Group as part of its equity-based retail product activity to eliminate the Groups exposure to fluctuations in various international stock exchange indices.
Index-linked equity options are purchased which give the Group the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specified amount of equities, or basket of equities, in the form of published indices on or before a specified future date.

As the structured entities are funded by the issue of debt on terms whereby the majority of the risks and rewards of the portfolio are retained by the subsidiary, the structured entities are consolidated fully and all of these loans are retained on the Groups balance sheet, with the related notes in issue included within debt securities in issue.
In addition to the structured entities described below, the Group sponsors three conduit programmes, Argento, Cancara and Grampian.
Covered bond programmes Certain loans and advances to customers have been assigned to bankruptcy remote limited liability partnerships to provide security for issues of covered bonds by the Group.
The Group retains all of the risks and rewards associated with these loans and the partnerships are consolidated fully with the loans retained on the Groups balance sheet and the related covered bonds in issue included within debt securities in issue.
The Groups principal securitisation and covered bond programmes, together with the balances of the advances subject to these arrangements and the carrying value of the notes in issue at 31 December, are listed below.
The notes in issue are reported in note 35.

At 31 December 2013 these obligations had not been triggered and the maximum exposure under these facilities was 402 million 2012: 497 million.
The Group has a number of covered bond programmes, for which limited liability Partnerships have been established to ring-fence asset pools and guarantee the covered bonds issued by the Group.
At the reporting date the Group had over-collateralised these programmes as set out in the table above to meet the terms of the programmes, to secure the rating of the covered bonds and to provide operational flexibility.
From time-to-time, the obligations of the Group to provide collateral may increase due to the formal requirements of the programmes.
The Group may also voluntarily contribute collateral to support the ratings of the covered bonds.
The Group recognises the full liabilities associated with its securitisation and covered bond programmes within debt securities in issue, although the obligations of the Group are limited to the cashflows generated from the underlying assets.
The Group could be required to provide additional support to a number of the securitisation programmes to support the credit ratings of the debt securities issued, in the form of increased cash reserves and the holding of subordinated notes.
Further, certain programmes contain contractual obligations that require the Group to repurchase assets should they become credit impaired.
The Group has not voluntarily offered to repurchase assets from any of its public securitisation programmes during 2013 2012: 471 million was voluntarily repurchased.
Such repurchases are made in order to ensure that the expected maturity dates of the notes issued from these programmes are met.
Note 22: Structured entities The Groups interests in structured entities are both consolidated and unconsolidated.
Detail of the Groups interests in consolidated structured entities are set out in: note 21 for securitisations and covered bond vehicles, note 41 for structured entities associated with the Groups pension schemes, and below in part A and B.
Details of the Groups interests in unconsolidated structured entities are included below in part C. A Asset-backed conduits In addition to the structured entities discussed in note 21, which are used for securitisation and covered bond programmes, the Group sponsors three asset-backed conduits, Argento, Cancara and Grampian, which invest in debt securities and client receivables.
All the external assets in these conduits are consolidated in the Groups financial statements.
The total consolidated exposures in these conduits are set out in the table below: Argento Cancara Grampian Total m m m m At 31 December 2013 loans and advances 161 4,781 9 4,951 Debt securities classified as loans and receivables: Asset-backed securities 299 300 599 Debt securities classified as available-for-sale financial assets: Asset-backed securities 356 356 Total assets 816 5,081 9 5,906 At 31 December 2012 loans and advances 140 4,342 58 4,540 Debt securities classified as loans and receivables: Asset-backed securities 603 367 358 1,328 Debt securities classified as available-for-sale financial assets: Asset-backed securities 396 143 539 Total assets 1,139 4,709 559 6,407 All debt securities and lending assets held by the Group in Cancara are restricted in use, as they are held by the collateral agent for the benefit of the commercial paper investors and the liquidity providers only.
The Group provides liquidity facilities to Cancara under terms that are usual and customary for standard lending activities in the normal course of the Groups banking activities.
The Group could be asked to provide support under the contractual terms of these arrangements if Cancara experienced a shortfall in external funding, which may occur in the event of market disruption.
As at 31 December 2013 and 2012 these obligations had not been triggered.
Argento and Grampian have no Commercial Paper in issue and no external liquidity providers.
Any restriction on the use of the assets included in the table above by the Group is due to their use in repurchase transactions see note 20 and note 53.

However, the Groups investment in the majority of these collective investment vehicles is readily realisable.
As at 31 December 2013, the total carrying value of these consolidated collective investment vehicle assets and liabilities held by the Group was 55,934 million 2012: 68,644million.
The Group has no contractual arrangements such as liquidity facilities that would require it to provide financial or other support to the consolidated collective investment vehicles: the Group has not previously provided such support and has no current intentions to provide such support.
C Unconsolidated collective investment vehicles and limited partnerships The Groups direct interests in unconsolidated structured entities comprise investments in collective investment vehicles, such as Open-ended Investment Companies and limited partnerships with a total carrying value of 24,552 million at 31 December 2013, included within financial assets designated at fair value through profit and loss see note 17.
At 31 December 2013, the total asset value of these unconsolidated structured entities, including the portion in which the Group has no interest, was 543 billion.
The Groups maximum exposure to loss is equal to the carrying value of the investment.
However, the Groups investments in collective investment vehicles are primarily held to match policyholder liabilities in the Insurance division and the majority of the risk from a change in the value of the Groups investment is matched by a change in policyholder liabilities.
The collective investment vehicles are primarily financed by investments from investors in the vehicles.
During the year the Group has not provided any non-contractual financial or other support to these unconsolidated collective investment vehicles.
The Group considers itself the sponsor of a structured entity where it is primarily involved in the design and establishment of the structured entity: and further where the Group transfers assets to the structured entity: market products associated with the structured entity in its own name and or provide guarantees regarding the structured entitys performance.
The Groups asset management businesses sponsor a range of diverse investment funds and limited partnerships where it acts as the fund manager or equivalent decision maker and markets the funds under one of the Groups brands.
The Group earns fees from managing the investments of these funds.
The investment management fees that the Group earned from unconsolidated collective investment vehicles, including those in which the Group held no interest at 31 December 2013, are reported in note 51.

The fair value of investment properties is measured using the market approach and incorporates the income approach where appropriate.
The fair value of investment property is generally measured using observable inputs.
Whether investment properties are categorised as level 2 or 3 see note 53 4 for details of levels in the fair value hierarchy depends on the extent of the adjustments made to observable inputs and this depends on the investment property concerned.
Investment property is compared to property for which there is observable market data about its realisable value on disposal.
Adjustments to this observable data are applied, if necessary, for specific characteristics of the property, such as the nature, location or condition of the specific asset.
If such information is not available, alternative valuation methods using unobservable inputs, such as discounted cash flow analysis or recent prices in less active markets are used.
For investment property under construction, the value on disposal is considered to be at the point at which the property is fully constructed.

The calculation uses pre-tax projections of future cash flows based upon budgets and plans approved by management covering a five-year period, and a discount rate of 12 per cent.
The budgets and plans are based upon past experience adjusted to take into account anticipated changes in sales volumes, product mix and margins having regard to expected market conditions and competitor activity.
The discount rate is determined with reference to internal measures and available industry information.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period have been extrapolated using a steady 3 per cent growth rate which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the life assurance market.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions above would not cause the recoverable amount of Scottish Widows to fall below its balance sheet carrying value.
The recoverable amount of Asset Finance has also been based on a value-in-use calculation using pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets and plans approved by management covering a five-year period and a discount rate of 14 per cent.
The cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 0.5 per cent which does not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the markets in which Asset Finance participates.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions above would not cause the recoverable amount of Asset Finance to fall below the balance sheet carrying value.

This will also contain changes in the other assets and liabilities, including the effects of changes in assumptions used to value the liabilities, of the relevant businesses.
The presentation of economic variance includes the impact of financial market conditions being different at the end of the reporting period from those included in assumptions used to calculate new and existing business returns.
The principal features of the methodology and process used for determining key assumptions used in the calculation of the value of in-force business are set out below: Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group 258 259 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 nOTeS TO THe COnSOlIDATeD FInAnCIAl STATeMenTS Note 28: Value of in-force business continued Economic assumptions each cash flow is valued using the discount rate consistent with that applied to such a cash flow in the capital markets.
In practice, to achieve the same result, where the cash flows are either independent of or move linearly with market movements, a method has been applied known as the certainty equivalent approach whereby it is assumed that all assets earn a risk-free rate and all cash flows are discounted at a risk-free rate.
The certainty equivalent approach covers all investment assets relating to insurance and participating investment contracts, other than the annuity business where an illiquidity premium is included, see below.
A market-consistent approach has been adopted for the valuation of financial options and guarantees, using a stochastic option pricing technique calibrated to be consistent with the market price of relevant options at each valuation date.
Further information on options and guarantees can be found on page 191.
The liabilities in respect of the Groups uK annuity business are matched by a portfolio of fixed interest securities, including a large proportion of corporate bonds and, since late 2012, illiquid loan assets.
The value of the in-force business asset for uK annuity business has been calculated after taking into account an estimate of the market premium for illiquidity in respect of corporate bond holdings and relevant illiquid loan assets.
The determination of the market premium for illiquidity reflects actual asset allocation and relevant observable market data, and has been checked for consistency with the capital markets.
The illiquidity premium is estimated to be 91basis points at 31 December 2013 2012: 73 basis points.
Moving to the actual asset allocation in the calculation of the market premium for illiquidity combined with a change to the assumed level of illiquidity within the illiquid loan assets, has been to increase the value of in-force business by 118 million at 31 December 2013.
This is included as an assumption change in the table above.
The effect of this change on profit before tax, after also including the impacts of movements in liabilities, is given in note 36.
The risk-free rate is derived from the relevant swap curve less a deduction for credit risk.
Prior to 2013, the risk-free rate for the valuation of financial options and guarantees was defined as the spot yield derived from the relevant government bond yield curve.
The risk-free rate for the non-annuity business was defined as the 15 year government bond.
For annuity business, the risk-free rate was based on the uK Government bond yield curve plus an allowance for an illiquidity premium.
The effect of deriving risk-free rates from swap curves instead of government bond yields has been to increase the value of in-force business by 132 million at 31 December 2013.
The effect of this change on profit before tax, after including the impacts of movements in liabilities, is given in note 36.
The table below shows the resulting range of yields and other key assumptions at 31 December for uK business: 1 2013 2012 % % Risk-free rate value of in-force non-annuity business 0.00 to 4.04 2.32 Risk-free rate value of in-force annuity business 0.64 to 5.06 3.25 Risk-free rate financial options and guarantees 0.21 to 3.45 0.22 to 3.56 Retail price inflation 3.59 3.13 expense inflation 4.25 3.61 1 All risk-free rates at 31 December 2013 are quoted as the range of rates implied by the relevant swap curve.
Non-market risk An allowance for non-market risk is made through the choice of best estimate assumptions based upon experience, which generally will give the mean expected financial outcome for shareholders and hence no further allowance for non-market risk is required.
However, in the case of operational risk, reinsurer default and the with-profit funds these can be asymmetric in the range of potential outcomes for which an explicit allowance is made.
Non-economic assumptions Future mortality, morbidity, expenses, lapse and paid-up rate assumptions are reviewed each year and are based on an analysis of past experience and on managements view of future experience.
Mortality and morbidity The mortality and morbidity assumptions, including allowances for improvements in longevity, are set with regard to the Groups actual experience where this provides a reliable basis and relevant industry data otherwise.
For German business, appropriate industry tables have been considered.
Lapse persistency and paid-up rates lapse and paid up rates assumptions are reviewed each year.
The most recent experience is considered along with the results of previous analyses and managements views on future experience.
In determining this best estimate view, a number of factors are considered, including the credibility of the results which will be affected by the volume of data available, any exceptional events that have occurred during the period under consideration and any known or expected trends in underlying data.
The pensions lapse assumptions have been strengthened due to persistency experience and to make allowance for the impact of the Office of Fair Trading review on fairness of legacy pension charges.
The impact of these changes has been to decrease the value of in-force business by 158 million.
Maintenance expenses Allowance is made for future policy costs explicitly.
expenses are determined by reference to an internal analysis of current and expected future costs.
explicit allowance is made for future expense inflation.
For German business appropriate cost assumptions have been set in accordance with the rules of the local regulatory body.
These assumptions are intended to represent a best estimate of future experience, and further information about the effect of changes in key assumptions is given in note 37.

The primary purpose of the conventional and unitised business written in the with-profit funds is to provide a smoothed investment vehicle to policyholders, protecting them against short-term market fluctuations.
Payouts may be subject to a guaranteed minimum payout if certain policy conditions are met.
With-profit policyholders are entitled to at least 90 per cent of the distributed profits, with the shareholders receiving the balance.
The policyholders are also usually insured against death and the policy may carry a guaranteed annuity option at retirement.
ii Method of calculation of liabilities With-profit liabilities are stated at their realistic value, the main components of which are: With-profit benefit reserve, the total asset shares for with-profit policies: Cost of options and guarantees including guaranteed annuity options : Deductions levied against asset shares: Planned enhancements to with-profits benefits reserve: and Impact of the smoothing policy.
The realistic assessment is carried out using a stochastic simulation model which values liabilities on a market-consistent basis.
The calculation of realistic liabilities uses best estimate assumptions for mortality, persistency rates and expenses.
These are calculated in a similar manner to those used for the value of in-force business as discussed in note 28.
Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group 264 265 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 nOTeS TO THe COnSOlIDATeD FInAnCIAl STATeMenTS Note 36: Liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts continued iii Assumptions Key assumptions used in the calculation of with-profit liabilities, and the processes for determining these, are: Investment returns and discount rates The realistic capital regime dictates that with-profit fund liabilities are valued on a market-consistent basis.
This is achieved by the use of a valuation model which values liabilities on a basis calibrated to tradable market option contracts and other observable market data.
The with-profit fund financial options and guarantees are valued using a stochastic simulation model where all assets are assumed to earn, on average, the risk-free yield and all cash flows are discounted using the risk-free yield.
The risk-free yield is defined as the spot yield derived from the relevant swap curve, adjusted for credit risk.
Further information on significant options and guarantees is given on page 191.
Guaranteed annuity option take-up rates Certain pension contracts contain guaranteed annuity options that allow the policyholder to take an annuity benefit on retirement at annuity rates that were guaranteed at the outset of the contract.
For contracts that contain such options, key assumptions in determining the cost of options are economic conditions in which the option has value, mortality rates and take up rates of other options.
The financial impact is dependent on the value of corresponding investments, interest rates and longevity at the time of the claim.
Investment volatility The calibration of the stochastic simulation model uses implied volatilities of derivatives where possible, or historical volatility where it is not possible to observe meaningful prices.
Mortality The mortality assumptions, including allowances for improvements in longevity for annuitants, are set with regard to the Groups actual experience where this is significant, and relevant industry data otherwise.
Lapse rates persistency lapse rates refer to the rate of policy termination or the rate at which policyholders stop paying regular premiums due under the contract.
Historical persistency experience is analysed using statistical techniques.
As experience can vary considerably between different product types and for contracts that have been in force for different periods, the data is broken down into broadly homogenous groups for the purposes of this analysis.
The most recent experience is considered along with the results of previous analyses and managements views on future experience, taking into consideration potential changes in future experience that may result from guarantees and options becoming more valuable under adverse market conditions, in order to determine a best estimate view of what persistency will be.
In determining this best estimate view a number of factors are considered, including the credibility of the results which will be affected by the volume of data available, any exceptional events that have occurred during the period under consideration, any known or expected trends in underlying data and relevant published market data.
Non-profit fund liabilities i Business description The Group principally writes the following types of life insurance contracts within its non-profit funds.
Shareholder profits on these types of business arise from management fees and other policy charges.
Unit-linked business This includes unit-linked pensions and unit-linked bonds, the primary purpose of which is to provide an investment vehicle where the policyholder is also insured against death.
Life insurance The policyholder is insured against death or permanent disability, usually for predetermined amounts.
Such business includes whole of life and term assurance and long-term creditor policies.
Annuities The policyholder is entitled to payments for the duration of their life and is therefore insured against surviving longer than expected.
German insurance business is written through the Groups subsidiary Heidelberger leben and comprises policies similar to the uK definitions above, except that there is participation by the policyholder in the investment, insurance and expense profits of Heidelberger leben.
A minimum level of policyholder participation is prescribed by German law.
The following types of life insurance contracts are written: Traditional and unit linked endowment or pensions business: and life insurance business.
In August 2013 the Group announced the sale of Heidelberger leben, which is expected to complete in the first quarter of 2014. ii Method of calculation of liabilities The non-profit fund liabilities are determined on the basis of recognised actuarial methods and consistent with the approach required by regulatory rules.
The methods used involve estimating future policy cash flows over the duration of the in-force book of policies, and discounting the cash flows back to the valuation date allowing for probabilities of occurrence.

This margin for adverse deviation is based on managements judgement and reflects managements views on the inherent level of uncertainty.
The key assumptions used in the measurement of non-profit fund liabilities are: Interest rates The rates used are derived in accordance with the guidelines set by local regulatory bodies.
These limit the rates of interest that can be used by reference to a number of factors including the redemption yields on fixed interest assets at the valuation date.
Margins for risk are allowed for in the assumed interest rates.
These are derived from the limits in the guidelines set by local regulatory bodies, including reductions made to the available yields to allow for default risk based upon the credit rating of the securities allocated to the insurance liability.
Mortality and morbidity The mortality and morbidity assumptions, including allowances for improvements in longevity for annuitants, are set with regard to the Groups actual experience where this provides a reliable basis, and relevant industry data otherwise, and include a margin for adverse deviation.
For German business appropriate industry tables have been considered.
Lapse rates persistency lapse rates are allowed for on some non-profit fund contracts.
The process for setting these rates is as described for with-profit liabilities, however a prudent scenario is assumed by the inclusion of a margin for adverse deviation within the non-profit fund liabilities.
expenses are determined by reference to an internal analysis of current and expected future costs plus a margin for adverse deviation.
Key changes in assumptions A detailed review of the Groups assumptions in 2013 resulted in the following key impacts on profit before tax: Change in persistency assumptions 210 million decrease.
Change in the assumption in respect of current and future mortality rates 114 million increase.
Change in expenses assumptions 34 million increase.
Move to swap curves to derive risk-free rates 174 million increase.
Determination of illiquidity premium for annuity business based on actual asset allocation and change to assumed level of illiquidity within illiquid loan assets 118 million increase.
These amounts include the impacts of movements in liabilities and value of the in-force business in respect of insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.

Assumptions are intended to be neutral estimates of the most likely or expected outcome.
There has been no significant change in the assumptions and methodologies used for setting reserves.
The reserving methodology and associated assumptions are set out below: The unearned premium reserve is determined on a basis that reflects the length of time for which contracts have been in force and the projected incidence of risk over the term of each contract.
Claims outstanding comprise those claims that have been notified and those that have been incurred but not reported.
Claims incurred but not reported are determined based on the historical emergence of claims and their average cost.
The notified claims element represents the best estimate of the cost of claims reported using projections and estimates based on historical experience.
The movements in non-life insurance contract liabilities and reinsurance assets over the year have been as follows: Gross Reinsurance Net m m m Provisions for unearned premiums At 1 January 2012 566 23 543 Increase in the year 1,081 31 1,050 Release in the year 1,153 38 1,115 Change in provision for unearned premiums charged to income statement note 8 72 7 65 At 31 December 2012 494 16 478 Increase in the year 972 18 954 Release in the year 1,021 24 997 Change in provision for unearned premiums charged to income statement note 8 49 6 43 exchange translation 3 3 At 31 December 2013 442 10 432 Independent auditors report 198 Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group Consolidated financial statements 204 266 267 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 212 Parent company financial statements 366 Notes to the parent company financial statements 369 1 44 69 123 377 Note 36: Liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts continued These provisions represent the liability for short-term insurance contracts for which the Groups obligations are not expired at the year end.

3 This sensitivity shows the impact of reducing lapse and surrender rates to 90 per cent of the expected rate.
4 This sensitivity shows the impact of reducing maintenance expenses and investment expenses to 90 per cent of the expected rate.
5 This sensitivity shows the impact on the value of in-force business, financial options and guarantee costs, statutory reserves and asset values of reducing the risk-free rate by 25 basis points.
6 This sensitivity shows the impact of a flat 5 per cent addition to the expected rate.
7 This sensitivity shows the impact of a flat 1 per cent addition to the expected rate.
8 This sensitivity shows the impact of a 25 basis point increase in credit default spreads on corporate bonds and the corresponding reduction in market values.
Swap curves, the risk-free rate and illiquidity premia are all assumed to be unchanged.
9 This sensitivity shows the impact of a 10 basis point increase in the allowance for illiquidity premia.
It assumes the overall spreads on assets are unchanged and hence market values are unchanged.
Swap curves and the non-annuity risk-free rate are both assumed to be unchanged.
The increased illiquidity premium increases the annuity risk-free rate.

Pension schemes Defined benefit schemes i Characteristics of and risks associated with the Groups schemes The Group has established a number of defined benefit pension schemes in the uK and overseas.
All significant schemes are based in the uK, with the three most significant being the defined benefit sections of the lloyds Bank Pension Schemes nos 1 and 2 and the HBOS Final Salary Pension Scheme.
These schemes provide retirement benefits calculated as a percentage of final pensionable salary depending upon the length of service: the minimum retirement age under the rules of the schemes at 31 December 2013 was generally 55 although certain categories of member are deemed to have a contractual right to retire at 50.
The Group operates a number of funded and unfunded pension arrangements, the majority, including the three most significant schemes, are funded schemes in the uK.
All schemes are operated as separate legal entities under trust law by the trustees.
All uK schemes are funded in compliance with the Pensions Act 2004.
A valuation exercise is carried out for each scheme at least every three years, whereby scheme assets are measured at market value and liabilities Technical Provisions are measured using prudent assumptions, if a deficit is identified a recovery plan is agreed and sent to the Pensions Regulator for review.
The outcome of this valuation process, including agreement of any recovery plans, is agreed between the Group and the scheme Trustee.
The Groups overseas defined benefit pension schemes are subject to local regulatory arrangements.
The latest full valuations of the three main schemes were carried out as at 30 June 2011: the results have been updated to 31 December 2013 by qualified independent actuaries.
The last full valuations of other Group schemes were carried out on a number of different dates: these have been updated to 31 December 2013 by qualified independent actuaries.

These contributions took the form of interests in limited liability partnerships for each of the two schemes which contained assets of approximately 5.4 billion in aggregate entitling the schemes to annual payments of approximately 215 million in aggregate until 31 December 2014.
Thereafter, assuming that all distributions have been made, the value of the partnership interests will equate to a nominal amount.
At 31 December 2013, the limited liability partnerships held assets of approximately 5.4 billion and cash payments of 215 million were made to the pension schemes during the year 2012: 215 million.
The limited liability partnerships are consolidated fully in the Groups balance sheet see note 22.
The Group has also established two private limited companies which hold assets to provide security for the Groups obligations to the HBOS Final Salary Pension Scheme and a section of the lloyds Bank Pension Scheme no 1.
At 31 December 2013 these held assets of approximately 2.6 billion in aggregate: they do not make any distributions to the pension schemes.
The private limited companies are consolidated fully in the Groups balance sheet.
The terms of these arrangements require the Group to maintain assets in these vehicles to agreed minimum values in order to secure obligations owed to the relevant Group pension schemes.
The Group has satisfied this requirement during 2013.
The Group currently expects to pay contributions of approximately 525 million to its defined benefit schemes in 2014.
The responsibility for the governance of the Groups funded defined benefit pension schemes lies with the Pension Trustees.
each of the Groups funded uK defined benefit pension schemes are managed by a Trustee Board the Trustee whose role is to ensure that their Scheme is administered in accordance with the Scheme rules and relevant legislation, and to safeguard the assets in the best interests of all members and beneficiaries.
The Trustee is solely responsible for setting investment policy and for agreeing funding requirements with the employer through the triennial valuation process.
The Board of Trustees must be composed of representatives of the Company and plan participants in accordance with the Schemes regulations.

Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group 276 277 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 nOTeS TO THe COnSOlIDATeD FInAnCIAl STATeMenTS Note 41: Retirement benefit obligations continued Assumptions The principal actuarial and financial assumptions used in valuations of the defined benefit pension schemes were as follows: 2013 2012 % % Discount rate 4.60 4.60 Rate of inflation: Retail Prices Index 3.30 2.90 Consumer Price Index 2.30 2.00 Rate of salary increases 2.00 2.00 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2.80 2.70 2013 2012 Years Years life expectancy for member aged 60, on the valuation date: Men 27.4 27.4 Women 29.7 29.7 life expectancy for member aged 60, 15 years after the valuation date: Men 28.6 28.5 Women 31.0 30.9 The mortality assumptions used in the scheme valuations are based on standard tables published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries which were adjusted in line with the actual experience of the relevant schemes.
The table shows that a member retiring at age 60 at 31 December 2013 is assumed to live for, on average, 27.4 years for a male and 29.7 years for a female.
In practice there will be much variation between individual members but these assumptions are expected to be appropriate across all members.
It is assumed that younger members will live longer in retirement than those retiring now.
This reflects the expectation that mortality rates will continue to fall over time as medical science and standards of living improve.
To illustrate the degree of improvement assumed the table also shows the life expectancy for members aged 45 now, when they retire in 15 years time at age 60. iii Amount timing and uncertainty of future cash flows Risk exposure of the defined benefit schemes Whilst the Group is not exposed to any unusual, entity specific or scheme specific risks in its defined benefit pension schemes, it is exposed to a number of significant risks, detailed below: Inflation rate risk: the majority of the plans benefit obligations are linked to inflation both in deferment and once in payment.
Higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although this will be partially offset by holdings of inflation-linked gilts and, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.
Interest rate risk: The defined benefit obligation is determined using a discount rate derived from yields on AA-rated corporate bonds.
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of bond holdings.
Longevity risk: The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the members so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans liabilities.
Investment risk: Scheme assets are invested in a diversified portfolio of debt securities, equities and other return-seeking assets.
If the assets underperform the discount rate used to calculate the defined benefit obligation, it will reduce the surplus or increase the deficit.
Volatility in asset values and the discount rate will lead to volatility in the net pension liability on the Groups balance sheet and in other comprehensive income.
To a lesser extent this will also lead to volatility in the pension expense in the Groups income statement.
The ultimate cost of the defined benefit obligations to the Group will depend upon actual future events rather than the assumptions made.
The assumptions made are unlikely to be borne out in practice and as such the cost may be higher or lower than expected.

The sensitivities provided assume that all other assumptions and the value of the schemes assets remain unchanged, and are not intended to represent changes that are at the extremes of possibility.
The calculations are approximate in nature and full detailed calculations could lead to a different result.
It is unlikely that isolated changes to individual assumptions will be experienced in practice.
Due to the correlation of assumptions, aggregating the effects of these isolated changes may not be a reasonable estimate of the actual effect of simultaneous changes in multiple assumptions.

Sensitivity analysis method and assumptions The sensitivity analysis above reflects the impact on the Groups three most significant schemes which account for over 90 per cent of the Groups defined benefit obligations.
Whilst differences in the underlying liability profiles for the remainder of the Groups pension arrangements mean they may exhibit slightly different sensitivities to variations in these assumptions, the sensitivities provided above are indicative of the impact across the Group as a whole.
The inflation assumption sensitivity applies to both the assumed rate of increase in the Consumer Prices Index CPI and the Retail Prices Index RPI, and include the impact on the rate of increases to pensions, both before and after retirement.
These pension increases are linked to inflation either CPI or RPI subject to certain minimum and maximum limits.
The sensitivity analysis including the inflation sensitivity does not include the impact of any possible change in the rate of salary increases.
These increases are capped at a maximum of 2 per cent per annum, and have been assumed to increase at this maximum rate in both 2012 and 2013, therefore there is no sensitivity to an increase in this assumption.
The Group is currently in formal consultation with the members of its defined benefit pension schemes regarding proposed changes to the way pensionable pay is calculated, which if introduced would reduce the rate of salary increases to zero.
If implemented these changes would have the effect of decreasing both the Groups income statement charge and net defined benefit scheme liability.
The life expectancy assumption has been applied by allowing for an increase decrease in life expectation from age 60 of one year, based upon the approximate weighted average age for each scheme.
Whilst this is an approximate approach and will not give the same result as a one year increase in life expectancy at every age, it provides an appropriate indication of the potential impact on the schemes from changes in life expectancy.
There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from the re-stated prior year.
Asset-liability matching strategies The main schemes assets are invested in a diversified portfolio, consisting primarily of debt securities and equities.
The investment strategy is not static and will evolve to reflect the structure of liabilities within the schemes.
Specific asset-liability matching strategies for each pension plan are independently determined by the responsible governance body for each scheme and in consultation with the employer.
A significant goal of the asset-liability matching strategies adopted by Group schemes is to reduce volatility caused by changes in market expectations of interest rates and inflation.
In the main, this is achieved by investing scheme assets in bonds, primarily fixed interest gilts and index linked gilts, and by entering into interest rate and inflation swap arrangements.
These investments are structured to take into account the profile of scheme liabilities, and actively managed to reflect both changing market conditions and changes to the liability profile.
The current asset-liability matching strategy has the objective of mitigating approximately 54 per cent 2012: 45 per cent of the interest rate volatility and 71 per cent 2012: 54 per cent of the inflation rate volatility of the liabilities.

They are shown in their undiscounted form and therefore appear large relative to the discounted assessment of the defined benefit obligations recognised in the Groups balance sheet.
They are in respect of benefits that have been accrued prior to the respective year-end date only and make no allowance for any benefits that may have been accrued subsequently.
Defined contribution schemes The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes in the uK and overseas, principally Your Tomorrow and the defined contribution sections of the lloyds Bank Pension Scheme no.
During the year ended 31 December 2013 the charge to the income statement in respect of defined contribution schemes was 255 million 2012: 229 million: 2011: 202 million, representing the contributions payable by the employer in accordance with each schemes rules.
Other post-retirement benefit schemes The Group operates a number of schemes which provide post-retirement healthcare benefits and concessionary mortgages to certain employees, retired employees and their dependants.
The principal scheme relates to former lloyds Bank staff and under this scheme the Group has undertaken to meet the cost of post-retirement healthcare for all eligible former employees and their dependants who retired prior to 1 January 1996.
The Group has entered into an insurance contract to provide these benefits and a provision has been made for the estimated cost of future insurance premiums payable.
For the principal post-retirement healthcare scheme, the latest actuarial valuation of the liability was carried out at 30 June 2008: this valuation has been updated to 31 December 2013 by qualified independent actuaries.
The principal assumptions used were as set out above, except that the rate of increase in healthcare premiums has been assumed at 6.90per cent 2012: 6.50 per cent.

Deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
Group companies have recognised deferred tax assets of 6,338million 2012: 7,034 million in relation to trading tax losses carried forward.
After reviews of medium-term profit forecasts, the Group considers that there will be sufficient profits in the future against which these losses will be offset see note 3.
Deferred tax assets of 168 million 2012: 330 million have not been recognised in respect of capital losses carried forward as there are no predicted future capital profits.
Capital losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
Deferred tax assets of 593 million 2012: 939 million have not been recognised in respect of trading losses carried forward, mainly in certain overseas companies and in respect of other temporary differences in the insurance businesses.
Trading losses can be carried forward indefinitely, except for losses in the uSA which expire after 20 years.
In addition, deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of unrelieved foreign tax carried forward at 31 December 2013 of 41 million 2012: 42 million, as there are no predicted future taxable profits against which the unrelieved foreign tax credits can be utilised.
These tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely.

Payment protection insurance Following the unsuccessful legal challenge by the BBA against the Financial Services Authority FSA and the Financial Ombudsman Service FOS, the Group made provisions totalling 6,775 million in 2011 and 2012 against the costs of paying redress to customers in respect of past sales of PPI policies, including the related administrative expenses.
During 2013 average monthly customer initiated complaints have continued to fall.
Good progress has also been made in the planned proactive mailings.
There have been some adverse trends as detailed below, and a further 3,050 million has been added to the provision, of which 500 million was at the half year, 750 million in the third quarter and 1,800 million at the year end.
This brings the total amount provided to 9,825 million, of which approximately 2,090 million relates to anticipated administrative expenses.
As at 31 December 2013, 2,807 million of the provision remained unutilised 29 per cent of total provision relative to an average monthly spend including administration costs in the last six months of 230 million.
The increase of 3,050 million in 2013, and the overall provision, is underpinned by the following drivers: Volumes of customer initiated complaints after excluding complaints from customers where no PPI policy was held at 31 December 2012, the provision assumed a total of 2.3 million complaints would be received.
Average monthly volumes in 2013 decreased by 54 per cent compared to 2012, and fourth quarter volumes fell in line with the Groups revised end third quarter expectations.
However, following further statistical modelling and the results of a customer survey, the Group is now forecasting a slower decline in future volumes than previously expected.
A further provision of 870 million was therefore made during the year to reflect this.
Approximately 2.5 million complaints have been received to date, with the provision assuming approximately 550,000 in the future compared to an average run-rate of approximately 37,000 per month in the last three months.
The table below details the historical complaint trends.
Average monthly complaint volumes reactive Q1 2012 Q2 2012 Q3 2012 Q4 2012 Q1 2013 Q2 2013 Q3 2013 Q4 2013 109,893 130,752 110,807 84,751 61,259 54,086 49,555 37,457 Proactive Mailing resulting from Past Business Reviews PBR the Group is proactively mailing customers where it has been identified that there was a risk of potential mis-sale.
During the year, further groups of customers have been added to the proactive mailing exercise increasing the scope to 2.8 million policies, including approximately 300,000 additional policies in the second half.
This, combined with higher than expected response rates from customers covered by the proactive mailing, resulted in a further provision of 470 million for the full year to reflect the additional cost incurred to date and in relation to future mailings.
Uphold rates average uphold rates per policy have increased from 61 per cent during the first half to 80 per cent for the last six months, with an average of 81 per cent in the fourth quarter.
This reflects the impact of changes to the complaint handling policy, in part following consultation with the Financial Conduct Authority FCA and feedback from the FOS.
In addition to this, there was a greater proportion of proactive mailing complaints received during the period for which uphold rates are higher.
The provision assumes a slightly higher uphold rate going forward to allow for further embedding of complaint handling policy changes.
The impact of higher uphold rates has resulted in a 335 million increase to the provision.
Average redress the average redress paid per policy has been relatively stable, but remains higher than expected by approximately 160 per policy due to the product and age mix of the complaints.
This has resulted in an additional provision of 135 million.
Re-review of previously handled cases previously reviewed complaints are being assessed to ensure consistency with the current complaint handling policy.
At 31 December 2012 the expected level of re-review was minimal.
During 2013, and most notably in the fourth quarter, this has increased to approximately 590,000 cases at an estimated cost of 460 million.
Expenses given the update to volume related assumptions, the Group has also increased its estimate for administrative expenses which comprise complaint handling costs and costs arising from cases subsequently referred to the FOS, by 780 million.

A provision of 50 million has been made in respect of the likely administration costs of responding to the FCAs inquiries.
It is not possible at this stage to make any assessment of what, if any, additional liability may result from the investigation.
Since the commencement of the PPI redress programme in 2011 the Group estimates that it has contacted, settled or provided for approximately 40 per cent of the policies sold since 2000, covering both customer-initiated complaints and actual and expected proactive mailings undertaken by the Group.
The total amount provided for PPI represents the Groups best estimate of the likely future costs, albeit a number of risks and uncertainties remain, in particular complaint volumes, uphold rates, average redress paid, the scope and cost of proactive mailings and remediation, and the outcome of the FCA enforcement Team investigation.
The cost of these factors could differ materially from the Groups estimates and the assumptions underpinning them and could result in a further provision being required.

2 To date volume includes customer initiated complaints.
3 Metric has been adjusted to include mature mailings only, and exclude expected customer initiated complaints.
Future response rates are expected to be lower than experienced to date as mailings to higher risk customers have been prioritised.
4 The percentage of complaints where the Group finds in favour of the customer.
This is a blend of proactive and customer initiated complaints.
The 80 per cent uphold rate is based on the latest six months to December 2013.
5 The amount that is paid in redress in relation to a policy found to have been mis-sold, comprising, where applicable, the refund of premium, compound interest charged and interest at 8 per cent per annum.
Actuals are based on six months to December 2013.
The accumulation of interest on future redress is expected to be offset by the mix shifting away from more expensive cases.
6 The percentage of cases reviewed by the Group that are subsequently referred to the FOS by the customer.
A complaint is considered mature when six months have elapsed since initial decision.
Actuals are based on decision made by the Group during January to June 2013 and subsequently referred to the FOS.
7 The percentage of complaints referred where the FOS arrive at a different decision to the Group.
The future overturn rate is expected to be lower due to changes in the case review process implemented during 2013 which has resulted in a higher uphold rate as noted above.
In turn this reduces the number percentage of cases likely to be overturned by the FOS.

Following decisions in July 2012 from the Federal Court of Justice FCJ in Germany the Group recognised a further provision of 150 million in its accounts for the year ended 31 December 2012 bringing the total amount provided to 325 million.
During the half-year to 30 June 2013 the Group has charged a further 75 million with respect to this litigation increasing the total provision to 400 million.
The remaining unutilised provision as at 31 December 2013 is 246 million.
However, there are still a number of uncertainties as to the full impact of the FCJs decisions, and the validity of any of the claims facing CMIG will turn upon the facts and circumstances in respect of each claim.
As a result the ultimate financial effect, which could be significantly different from the current provision, will only be known once there is further clarity with respect to a range of legal issues and factual determinations involved in these claims and or all relevant claims have been resolved.
Interest rate hedging products In June 2012, a number of banks, including the Group, reached agreement with the FSA now FCA to carry out a review of sales made since 1 December 2001 of interest rate hedging products IRHP to certain small and medium-sized businesses.
As at 31 December 2013 the Group had identified 1,771 sales of IRHPs to customers within scope of the agreement with the FCA which are being reviewed and, where appropriate, redressed.
The Group agreed that on conclusion of this review it would provide redress to any in-scope customers where appropriate.
The Group provided 400 million in its accounts for the year ended 31 December 2012 for the estimated cost of redress and related administration costs, based on a pilot review that had been conducted at the time.
In the final quarter of 2013, a significant number of additional cases were reviewed, providing a larger and more representative sample from which to estimate the total cost of the review.
As a result, an additional provision of 130 million has been recognised.
During the same period, the Group confirmed it would pay any redress due to in-scope customers before any consequential loss claims had been outlined and agreed with them.
At 31 December 2013, the total amount provided for the cost of redress and related administration costs is 530 million of which 162 million had been utilised.
no provision has been recognised in relation to claims from customers which are not covered by the agreement with the FCA, or incremental claims from customers within the scope of the review.
These will be monitored and future provisions will be recognised to the extent an obligation resulting in a probable outflow is identified.
Other regulatory matters In the course of its business, the Group is engaged in discussions with the PRA, FCA and other uK and overseas regulators and governmental authorities in relation to a range of matters: a provision is held against the costs expected to be incurred as a result of the conclusions reached.
In 2013 the provision was increased by a further 200 million, in respect of matters affecting the Retail, Commercial, and Wealth and Asset Finance businesses, bringing the total amount charged to 300 million of which 75 million had been utilised at 31 December 2013.
This increase reflects the Groups assessment of a limited number of matters under discussion, none of which currently is individually considered financially material in the context of the Group.
Vacant leasehold property Vacant leasehold property provisions are made by reference to a prudent estimate of expected sub-let income, compared to the head rent, and the possibility of disposing of the Groups interest in the lease, taking into account conditions in the property market.
These provisions are reassessed on a biannual basis and will normally run off over the period of under-recovery of the leases concerned, currently averaging three years: where a property is disposed of earlier than anticipated, any remaining balance in the provision relating to that property is released.
Other Provisions are made for staff and other costs related to Group restructuring initiatives at the point at which the Group becomes irrevocably committed to the expenditure.
Other provisions include those arising out of the insolvency of a third party insurer, which remains exposed to asbestos and pollution claims in the uS.
The ultimate cost and timing of payments are uncertain.
The provision held of 37 million at 31 December 2013 represents managements current best estimate of the cost after having regard to actuarial estimates of future losses.

In addition, the Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities and or voting rights.
Information regarding significant direct or indirect holdings of shares in the Company can be found on page 75.
The directors have authority to allot and issue ordinary and preference shares and to make market purchases of ordinary and preference shares as granted at the annual general meeting on 16 May 2013.
The authority to issue shares and the authority to make market purchases of shares will expire at the next annual general meeting.
Shareholders will be asked, at the annual general meeting, to give similar authorities.
Subject to any rights or restrictions attached to any shares, on a show of hands at a general meeting of the Company every holder of shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote has one vote and on a poll every member present and entitled to vote has one vote for every share held.
Further details regarding voting at the annual general meeting can be found in the notes to the notice of the annual general meeting.
Ordinary shares The holders of ordinary shares excluding the limited voting ordinary shares, who held 99.9 per cent of the total ordinary share capital at 31 December 2013, are entitled to receive the Companys report and accounts, attend, speak and vote at general meetings and appoint proxies to exercise voting rights.

Limited voting ordinary shares The limited voting ordinary shares are held by the lloyds Bank Foundations the Foundations.
The holders of the limited voting ordinary shares, who held 0.1 per cent of the total ordinary share capital at 31 December 2013, are entitled to receive copies of every circular or other document sent out by the Company to the holders of other ordinary shares.
These shares carry no rights to dividends but rank pari passu with the ordinary shares in respect of other distributions and in the event of winding up.
These shares do not have any right to vote at general meetings other than on resolutions concerning acquisitions or disposals of such importance that they require shareholder consent, or for the winding up of the Company, or for a variation in the class rights of the limited voting ordinary shares.
In the event of an offer for more than 50 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company, each limited voting ordinary share will convert into an ordinary share and shall rank equally with the ordinary shares in all respects from the date of conversion.
The Company has entered into deeds of covenant with the Foundations under the terms of which the Company makes annual donations.
The deeds of covenant can be cancelled by the Company at nine years notice, at which point the limited voting ordinary share capital would convert into ordinary shares.
Such notice has been given to the lloyds Bank Foundation for Scotland.
Preference shares The Company has in issue various classes of preference shares which are all classified as liabilities under IFRS and details of which are shown in note 44.

Lloyds Banking Group executive share option schemes The executive share option schemes were long-term incentive schemes available to certain senior executives of the Group, with grants usually made annually.
Options were granted within limits set by the rules of the schemes relating to the number of shares under option and the price payable on the exercise of options.
The last grant of executive options was made in August 2005.
These options were granted without a performance multiplier and the maximum limit for the grant of options in normal circumstances was three times annual salary.
Between March 2004 and August 2004, the aggregate value of the award based upon the market price at the date of grant could not exceed four times the executives annual remuneration and, normally, the limit for the grant of options to an executive in any one year would be equal to 1.5 times annual salary with a maximum performance multiplier of 3.5.
Performance conditions for executive options For options granted in 2004 The performance condition was linked to the performance of lloyds Banking Group plcs total shareholder return calculated by reference to both dividends and growth in share price against a comparator group of 17 companies including lloyds Banking Group plc.
The performance condition was measured over a three year period which commenced at the end of the financial year preceding the grant of the option and continued until the end of the third subsequent year.
If the performance condition was not then met, it was measured at the end of the fourth financial year.
If the condition was not then met, the options would lapse.
To meet the performance conditions, the Groups ranking against the comparator group was required to be at least ninth.
The full grant of options only became exercisable if the Group was ranked first.
A performance multiplier of between nil and 100 per cent was applied below this level to calculate the number of shares in respect of which options granted to executive Directors would become exercisable, and were calculated on a sliding scale.
If lloyds Banking Group plc was ranked below median the options would not be exercisable.
Options granted to senior executives other than executive Directors were not so highly leveraged and, as a result, different performance multipliers were applied to their options.
For the majority of executives, options were granted with the performance condition but with no performance multiplier.
Options granted in 2004 became exercisable as the performance condition was met on the re-test.
The performance condition vested at 14 per cent for executive Directors, 24 per cent for Managing Directors, and 100 per cent for all other executives.
For options granted in 2005 The same conditions applied as for grants made in 2004, except that: the performance condition was linked to the performance of lloyds Banking Group plcs total shareholder return calculated by reference to both dividends and growth in share price against a comparator group of 15 companies including lloyds Banking Group plc: if the performance condition was not met at the end of the third subsequent year, the options would lapse: and the full grant of options became exercisable only if the Group was ranked in the top four places of the comparator group.
A sliding scale applied between fourth and eighth positions.
If lloyds Banking Group was ranked below the median ninth or below the options would lapse.
Options granted in 2005 became exercisable as the performance condition was met when tested.
The performance condition vested at 82.5 per cent for all options granted.

Other share plans Lloyds Banking Group Long-Term Incentive Plan The long-Term Incentive Plan lTIP introduced in 2006 is aimed at delivering shareholder value by linking the receipt of shares to an improvement in the performance of the Group over a three year period.
Awards are made within limits set by the rules of the Plan, with the limits determining the maximum number of shares that can be awarded equating to three times annual salary.
In exceptional circumstances this may increase to four times annual salary.
Participants may be entitled to any dividends paid during the vesting period if the performance conditions are met.
An amount equal in value to any dividends paid between the award date and the date the Remuneration Committee determine that the performance conditions were met may be paid, based on the number of shares that vest.
The Remuneration Committee will determine if any dividends are to be paid in cash or in shares.

If the share price at the end of the performance period was 75 pence or less, none of this element of the award would vest.
If the share price was 114 pence or higher, 100 per cent of this element would vest.
Vesting between threshold and maximum would be on a straight line basis, provided that shares comprised in the Absolute Share Price element may only be released if both the ePS and eP performance measures had been satisfied at the threshold level or above.
The ePS and eP performance conditions each relate to 36 per cent of the total award.

The amendment introduced the receipt of shares in lloyds Banking Group plc as an element of the total award.
For awards made in June 2012, the other element continued to be cash-based, with the split between cash-based and share-based determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Awards made in June 2013 were fully share-based.
The amendment is aimed at delivering shareholder value by linking the receipt of shares to an improvement in the performance of SWIP over a three year period.
Awards are made within limits set by the rules of the Plan, with the maximum limits for combined cash and shares awarded equating to 3.5 times annual salary.
In exceptional circumstances this may increase to 4 times annual salary.
The performance conditions for share-based awards made in June 2012 are as follows: i Profitability: relevant to 40 per cent of the award.

MasterCard has appealed the General Courts judgment to the Court of Justice of the european union.
MasterCard is supported by several card issuers, including the Group.
Judgment is not expected until the summer of 2014 or later.
In parallel: the european Commission is also considering further action, and has proposed legislation to regulate interchange fees, following its 2012 Green Paper Towards an integrated european market for cards, internet and mobile payments consultation: the european Commission has consulted on commitments proposed by VISA to settle an investigation into whether arrangements adopted by VISA for the levying of the MIF in respect of cross-border credit card payment transactions also infringe european union competition laws.
VISA has proposed inter alia to reduce the level of interchange fees on cross-border credit card transactions to the interim level 30 basis points also agreed by MasterCard.
VISA has previously reached an agreement which expires in 2014 with the european Commission to reduce the level of interchange fees for cross-border debit card transactions to the interim levels agreed by MasterCard: the Office of Fair Trading OFT has placed on hold its examination of whether the levels of interchange fees paid by retailers in respect of MasterCard and VISA credit cards, debit cards and charge cards in the uK infringe competition law.
The OFT has placed the investigation on hold pending the outcome of the MasterCard appeal to the Court of Justice of the european union: and the uK Government held a consultation in 2013, Opening up uK Payments.
The consultation included a proposal to legislate to introduce a new economic regulator with responsibility for payment systems, including three and four party card schemes, and a role in setting or approving interchange fees.

The allegations in these cases, the majority of which have been coordinated for pre-trial purposes in multi-district litigation proceedings MDl in the uS District Court for the Southern District of new York the District Court, are substantially similar to each other.
The lawsuits allege violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act RICO and the Commodity exchange Act CeA, as well as various state statutes and common law doctrines.
Certain of the plaintiffs claims have been dismissed by the District Court, various motions directed to the sufficiency of their pleading of certain claims are still pending, and many of these cases have been stayed by order of the District Court.

Following the default of a number of deposit takers in 2008, the FSCS borrowed funds from HM Treasury to meet the compensation costs for customers of those firms.
Although the substantial majority of this loan, which totalled approximately 17 billion at 31 March 2013, will be repaid from funds the FSCS receives from asset sales, surplus cash flow or other recoveries in relation to the assets of the firms that defaulted, any shortfall will be funded by deposit-taking participants of the FSCS.
In July 2013, the FSCS confirmed that it expects to raise compensation costs levies of approximately 1.1 billion on all deposit-taking participants over a three year measurement period from 2012 to 2014 to enable it to repay the balance of the HM Treasury loan which matures in 2016.
The Group has provided for its share of the 2012 and 2013 element of the levy.
The amount of future compensation costs levies payable by the Group depends on a number of factors including participation in the market at 31 December, the level of protected deposits and the population of deposit-taking participants.
Investigation into Bank of Scotland and report on HBOS The FSAs enforcement investigation into Bank of Scotland plcs Corporate division between 2006 and 2008 concluded with the publication of a Final notice on 9 March 2012. no financial penalty was imposed on the Group or Bank of Scotland plc.
On 12 September 2012 the FSA confirmed it was starting work on a public interest report on HBOS.
That report is currently expected to be published in 2014.
US shareholder litigation In november 2011 the Group and two former members of the Groups Board of Directors were named as defendants in a purported securities class action filed in the united States District Court for the Southern District of new York.
The complaint asserted claims under the Securities exchange Act of 1934 in connection with alleged material omissions from statements made in 2008 in connection with the acquisition of HBOS.
In October 2012 the court dismissed the complaint.
The plaintiffs appeal against this decision was dismissed on 19 September 2013 and the time limit for further appeals expired in December 2013.
US-Swiss tax programme The uS Department of Justice the DOJ and the Swiss Federal Department of Finance announced on 29 August 2013 a programme the Programme for Swiss banks to obtain resolution concerning their status in connection with ongoing investigations by the DOJ into individuals and entities that use foreign i. e. non-u.
S. bank accounts to evade u. S. taxes and reporting requirements, and individuals and entities that facilitate or have facilitated the evasion of such taxes and reporting requirements.
Swiss banks that choose to participate have to notify the DOJ of their election to categorise their relevant banking operations according to one of a number of defined categories under the Programme.
The Group, which carried out private banking operations in Switzerland prior to disposing of these operations in november 2013, has notified the DOJ of its elected categorisation on the basis that while it believes it has operated in full compliance with all uS federal tax laws, there remains the possibility that certain of its clients may not have declared their assets in compliance with such laws.
The Group will continue to co-operate with the DOJ under the terms of the Programme.
However, at this time, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of the Groups participation in the Programme, including the timing and scale of any fine finally payable to the DOJ.
Tax authorities The Group provides for potential tax liabilities that may arise on the basis of the amounts expected to be paid to tax authorities.
This includes open matters where Her Majestys Revenue and Customs HMRC adopt a different interpretation and application of tax law which might lead to additional tax.
The Group has an open matter in relation to a claim for group relief of losses incurred in its former Irish banking subsidiary, which ceased trading on 31 December 2010.
In the second half of 2013 HMRC informed the Group that their interpretation of the uK rules, permitting the offset of such losses, denies the claim: if HMRCs position is found to be correct management estimate that this would result in an increase in current tax liabilities of approximately 600 million and a reduction in the Groups deferred tax asset of approximately 400 million.
The Group does not agree with HMRCs position and, having taken appropriate advice, does not consider that this is a case where additional tax will ultimately fall due.
Other legal actions and regulatory matters In addition, during the ordinary course of business the Group is subject to other threatened and actual legal proceedings including class or group action claims brought on behalf of customers, shareholders or other third parties, and regulatory challenges, investigations and enforcement actions, both in the uK and overseas.
All such material matters are periodically reassessed, with the assistance of external professional advisers where appropriate, to determine the likelihood of the Group incurring a liability.
In those instances where it is concluded that it is more likely than not that a payment will be made, a provision is established to managements best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the relevant balance sheet date.
In some cases it will not be possible to form a view, either because the facts are unclear or because further time is needed properly to assess the merits of the case and no provisions are held against such matters.
However the Group does not currently expect the final outcome of any such case to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, operations or cash flows.

During 2012 the Group has reviewed its holding of government securities classified as held-to-maturity and in view of the fact that it was no longer the Groups intention to hold these to maturity, securities with a carrying amount of 10,811 million and a fair value of 11,979million were reclassified as available-for-sale financial assets in December 2012. no financial assets were reclassified in 2011.
In 2010, government securities with a fair value of 3,601 million were reclassified from available-for-sale financial assets to held-to-maturity investments reflecting the Groups then positive intent and ability to hold them until maturity.
In 2009, no financial assets were reclassified.
In 2008, in accordance with the amendment to IAS 39 that became applicable during that year, the Group reviewed the categorisation of its financial assets classified as held for trading and available-for-sale.
On the basis that there was no longer an active market for some of those assets, which are therefore more appropriately managed as loans, with effect from 1 July 2008, the Group transferred 2,993 million of assets previously classified as held for trading into loans and receivables.
With effect from 1 november 2008, the Group transferred 437 million of assets previously classified as available-for-sale financial assets into loans and receivables.
At the time of these transfers, the Group had the intention and ability to hold them for the foreseeable future or until maturity.
As at the date of reclassification, the weighted average effective interest rate of the assets transferred was 6.3 per cent with the estimated recoverable cash flows of 3,524 million.
Carrying value and fair value of reclassified assets The table below sets out the carrying value and fair value of reclassified financial assets.

Wherever possible, fair values have been calculated using unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical instruments held by the Group.
Where quoted market prices are not available, or are unreliable because of poor liquidity, fair values have been determined using valuation techniques which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use non-market observable inputs.
Valuation techniques used include discounted cash flow analysis and pricing models and, where appropriate, comparison to instruments with characteristics similar to those of the instruments held by the Group.
Because a variety of estimation techniques are employed and significant estimates made, comparisons of fair values between financial institutions may not be meaningful.
Readers of these financial statements are thus advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Groups financial position.
Fair value information is not provided for items that are not financial instruments or for other assets and liabilities which are not carried at fair value in the Groups consolidated balance sheet.
These items include intangible assets, such as the value of the Groups branch network, the long-term relationships with depositors and credit card relationships: premises and equipment: and shareholders equity.
These items are material and accordingly the Group believes that the fair value information presented does not represent the underlying value of the Group.
Valuation control framework The key elements of the control framework for the valuation of financial instruments include model validation, product implementation review and independent price verification.
These functions are carried out by appropriately skilled risk and finance teams, independent of the business area responsible for the products.
Model validation covers both qualitative and quantitative elements relating to new models.
In respect of new products, a product implementation review is conducted preand post-trading.
Pre-trade testing ensures that the new model is integrated into the Groups systems and that the profit and loss and risk reporting are consistent throughout the trade life cycle.
Post-trade testing examines the explanatory power of the implemented model, actively monitoring model parameters and comparing in-house pricing to external sources.
Independent price verification procedures cover financial instruments carried at fair value.
The frequency of the review is matched to the availability of independent data, monthly being the minimum.
Valuation differences in breach of established thresholds are escalated to senior management.
The results from independent pricing and valuation reserves are reviewed monthly by senior management.
Formal committees, consisting of senior risk, finance and business management, meet at least quarterly to discuss and approve valuations in more judgemental areas, in particular for unquoted equities, structured credit, over-the-counter options and the Credit Valuation Adjustment CVA reserve.
Valuation of financial assets and liabilities Assets and liabilities carried at fair value or for which fair values are disclosed have been classified into three levels according to the quality and reliability of information used to determine the fair values.
level 1 level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Products classified as level 1 predominantly comprise equity shares, treasury bills and other government securities.
level 2 level 2 valuations are those where quoted market prices are not available, for example where the instrument is traded in a market that is not considered to be active or valuation techniques are used to determine fair value and where these techniques use inputs that are based significantly on observable market data.
examples of such financial instruments include most over-the-counter derivatives, financial institution issued securities, certificates of deposit and certain asset-backed securities.
level 3 level 3 portfolios are those where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation is not based on observable market data.
Such instruments would include the Groups venture capital and unlisted equity investments which are valued using various valuation techniques that require significant management judgement in determining appropriate assumptions, including earnings multiples and estimated future cash flows.
Certain of the Groups asset-backed securities and derivatives, principally where there is no trading activity in such securities, are also classified as level 3. unless otherwise noted, the following disclosures are provided separately for assets and liabilities carried at fair value and those carried at amortised cost.
The Group manages valuation adjustments for its derivative exposures on a net basis: the Group determines their fair values on the basis of their net exposures.
In all other cases, fair values of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are determined on the basis of their gross exposures.

Where there is limited trading activity in debt securities, the Group uses valuation models, consensus pricing information from third party pricing services and broker or lead manager quotes to determine an appropriate valuation.
Debt securities are classified as level 3 if there is a significant valuation input that cannot be corroborated through market sources or where there are materially inconsistent values for an input.
Asset classes classified as level 3 mainly comprise certain collateralised loan obligations and collateralised debt obligations.
Equity investments unlisted equity and fund investments are valued using different techniques in accordance with the Groups valuation policy and International Private equity and Venture Capital Guidelines.
Depending on the business sector and the circumstances of the investment, unlisted equity valuations are based on earnings multiples, net asset values or discounted cash flows.
A number of earnings multiples are used in valuing the portfolio including price earnings, earnings before interest and tax and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
The particular multiple selected being appropriate for the type of business being valued and is derived by reference to the current market-based multiple.
Consideration is given to the risk attributes, growth prospects and financial gearing of comparable businesses when selecting an appropriate multiple.
Discounted cash flow valuations use estimated future cash flows, usually based on management forecasts, with the application of appropriate exit yields or terminal multiples and discounted using rates appropriate to the specific investment, business sector or recent economic rates of return.
Recent transactions involving the sale of similar businesses may sometimes be used as a frame of reference in deriving an appropriate multiple.
For fund investments the most recent capital account value calculated by the fund manager is used as the basis for the valuation and adjusted, if necessary, to align valuation techniques with the Groups valuation policy.
unlisted equity investments and investments in property partnerships held in the life assurance funds are valued using third party valuations.
Management take account of any pertinent information, such as recent transactions and information received on particular investments, to adjust the third party valuations where necessary.
Derivatives Where the Groups derivative assets and liabilities are not traded on an exchange, they are valued using valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow and options pricing models, as appropriate.
The types of derivatives classified as level 2 and the valuation techniques used include: Interest rate swaps which are valued using discounted cash flow models: the most significant inputs into those models are interest rate yield curves which are developed from publicly quoted rates.
Foreign exchange derivatives that do not contain options which are priced using rates available from publicly quoted sources.
Credit derivatives which are valued using standard models with observable inputs, except for the items classified as level 3, which are valued using publicly available yield and credit default swap CDS curves.
less complex interest rate and foreign exchange option products which are valued using volatility surfaces developed from publicly available interest rate cap, interest rate swaption and other option volatilities: option volatility skew information is derived from a market standard consensus pricing service.
For more complex option products, the Group calibrates its models using observable at-the-money data: where necessary, the Group adjusts for out-of-the-money positions using a market standard consensus pricing service.
Complex interest rate and foreign exchange products where there is significant dispersion of consensus pricing or where implied funding costs are material and unobservable are classified as level 3.
Where credit protection, usually in the form of credit default swaps, has been purchased or written on asset-backed securities, the security is referred to as a negative basis asset-backed security and the resulting derivative assets or liabilities have been classified as either level 2 or level 3 according to the classification of the underlying asset-backed security.
The Groups level 3 derivative assets include 1,212 million 2012: 1,421 million in respect of the value of the embedded equity conversion feature of the enhanced Capital notes issued in December 2009.
The embedded equity conversion feature is valued by comparing the market price of the enhanced Capital notes with the market price of similar bonds without the conversion feature.
The latter is calculated by discounting the expected enhanced Capital note cash flows in the absence of a conversion using prevailing market yields for similar capital securities without the conversion feature.
The market price of the enhanced Capital notes was calculated with reference to multiple broker quotes.
Liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss These principally comprise debt securities in issue which are classified as level 2 and their fair value is determined using techniques whose inputs are based on observable market data.

Credit spreads represent the premium above the benchmark reference instrument required to compensate for lower credit quality: higher spreads lead to a lower fair value.
Volatility parameters represent key attributes of option behaviour: higher volatilities typically denote a wider range of possible outcomes.
earnings multiples are used to value certain unlisted equity investments: a higher earnings multiple will result in a higher fair value.
Reasonably possible alternative assumptions Valuation techniques applied to many of the Groups level 3 instruments often involve the use of two or more inputs whose relationship is interdependent.
The calculation of the effect of reasonably possible alternative assumptions included in the table above reflects such relationships.
Debt securities Reasonably possible alternative assumptions have been determined in respect of the Groups structured credit investment by flexing credit spreads.
Derivatives Reasonably possible alternative assumptions have been determined in respect of the Groups derivative portfolios as follows: In respect of the embedded equity conversion feature of the enhanced Capital notes, the sensitivity was based on the absolute difference between the actual price of the enhanced capital note and the closest, alternative broker quote available plus the impact of applying a 10 bps increase decrease in the market yield used to derive a market price for similar bonds without the conversion feature.
The effect of interdependency of the assumptions is not material to the effect of applying reasonably possible alternative assumptions to the valuations of derivative financial instruments.
uncollateralised inflation swaps are valued using appropriate discount spreads for such transactions.
These spreads are not generally observable for longer maturities.
The reasonably possible alternative valuations reflect flexing of the spreads for the differing maturities to alternative values of between 62 bps and 192 bps 2012: 51 bps and 260 bps.
Swaptions are priced using industry standard option pricing models.
Such models require interest rate volatilities which may be unobservable at longer maturities.
To derive reasonably possible alternative valuations these volatilities have been flexed within a range of 3 per cent to 112 per cent 2012: 31 per cent and 79 per cent.
Unlisted equity, venture capital investments and investments in property partnerships The valuation techniques used for unlisted equity and venture capital investments vary depending on the nature of the investment.
Reasonably possible alternative valuations for these investments have been calculated by reference to the approach taken, as appropriate to the business sector and investment circumstances and as such the following inputs have been considered: for valuations derived from earnings multiples, consideration is given to the risk attributes, growth prospects and financial gearing of comparable businesses when selecting an appropriate multiple: the discount rates used in discounted cash flow valuations: and in line with International Private equity and Venture Capital Guidelines, the values of underlying investments in fund investments portfolios.

Valuation methodology Financial assets The Group provides loans and advances to commercial, corporate and personal customers at both fixed and variable rates.
The carrying value of the variable rate loans and those relating to lease financing is assumed to be their fair value.
For fixed rate lending, several different techniques are used to estimate fair value taking into account expected credit losses, prevailing market interest rates and expected future cash flows.
For retail exposures, fair value is principally estimated by discounting anticipated cash flows including interest at contractual rates at market rates for similar loans offered by the Group and other financial institutions.
Certain loans secured on residential properties are made at a fixed rate for a limited period, typically two to five years, after which the loans revert to the relevant variable rate.
The fair value of such loans is estimated by reference to the market rates for similar loans of maturity equal to the remaining fixed interest rate period.
The fair value of wholesale loans is estimated by discounting anticipated cash flows at a rate which reflects the effects of interest rate changes, adjusted for changes in credit risk.
The fair values of debt securities, which were previously within assets held for trading and were reclassified to loans and receivables, are determined predominantly from lead manager quotes and, where these are not available, by alternative techniques including reference to credit spreads on similar assets with the same obligor, market standard consensus pricing services, broker quotes and other research data.
Financial liabilities The fair value of deposits repayable on demand is considered to be equal to their carrying value.
The fair value for all other deposits is estimated using discounted cash flows applying either market rates, where applicable, or current rates for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
The fair value of short-term debt securities in issue is approximately equal to their carrying value.
Fair value for other debt securities and for subordinated liabilities is estimated using discounted cash flow techniques at a rate which reflects market rates of interest and the Groups own credit spread.

However, the Group retains the right to the current size of the mark-to-market position on the uncollateralised asset: remove loans from the covered bond programmes where they are in excess of the programmes requirements.
In addition, where the Group has retained some of the notes issued by securitisation and covered bond programmes, the Group has the ability to sell or pledge these expectations of future market volatility of the underlying asset: and retained notes.
The table below sets out the carrying values of the transferred assets and the associated liabilities.
For repurchase and securities lending In circumstances where exposures to a counterparty become impaired, any associated derivative valuation adjustment is transferred and transactions, the associated liabilities represent the Groups obligation to repurchase the transferred assets.
For securitisation programmes, assessed for specific loss alongside other non-derivative assets and liabilities that the counterparty may have with the Group.

Debt securities classified as loans and receivables 88 A one per cent rise in the CDS spread would lead to an increase in the DVA of 89 million to 211 million.
Securitisation programmes The risk exposures that are used for the CVA and DVA calculations are strongly influenced by interest rates.
Due to the nature of the Groups loans and receivables: business the CVA DVA exposures tend to be on average the same way around such that the valuation adjustments fall when interest rates rise.

The Group has also recognised a Funding Valuation Adjustment to adjust for the net cost of funding certain uncollateralised derivative positions where the Group considers that this cost is included in market pricing.
This adjustment is calculated on the expected future exposure discounted at a suitable cost of funds.
A ten basis points increase in the cost of funds will increase the funding valuation adjustment by approximately 9 million.

Transferred financial assets that continue to be recognised in full The Group enters into repurchase and securities lending transactions in the normal course of business that do not result in derecognition of the financial assets covered as substantially all of the risks and rewards, including credit, interest rate, prepayment and other price risks are retained by the Group.
As set out in note 21, included within loans and receivables are loans transferred under the Groups securitisation and covered bond programmes.
As the Group retains all of a majority of the risks and rewards associated with these loans, including credit, interest rate, prepayment and liquidity risk, they remain on the Groups balance sheet.
Assets transferred into the Groups securitisation and covered bond programmes are not available to be used by the Group whilst the assets are within the programmes.
However, the Group retains the right to remove loans from the covered bond programmes where they are in excess of the programmes requirements.
In addition, where the Group has retained some of the notes issued by securitisation and covered bond programmes, the Group has the ability to sell or pledge these retained notes.
For repurchase and securities lending transactions, the associated liabilities represent the Groups obligation to repurchase the transferred assets.
For securitisation programmes, the associated liabilities represent the external notes in issue note 35. except as otherwise noted below, none of the liabilities shown in the table below have recourse only to the transferred assets.

3 The amounts set off in the balance sheet as shown above represent derivatives and repurchase agreements with central clearing houses which meet the criteria for offsetting under IAS 32.
4 The Group enters into derivatives and repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements with various counterparties which are governed by industry standard master netting agreements.
The Group holds and provides cash and securities collateral in respective of derivative transactions covered by these agreements.
The right to set off balances under these master netting agreements or to set off cash and securities collateral only arises in the event of non-payment or default and, as a result, these arrangements do not qualify for offsetting under IAS 32.
The effects of over collateralisation have not been taken into account in the above table.
Note 54: Financial risk management As a bancassurer, financial instruments are fundamental to the Groups activities and, as a consequence, the risks associated with financial instruments represent a significant component of the risks faced by the Group.
The primary risks affecting the Group through its use of financial instruments are: credit risk: market risk, which includes interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk: liquidity risk: capital risk: and insurance risk.
Information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks and capital can be found on pages 123 to 196.
The following additional disclosures, which provide quantitative information about the risks within financial instruments held or issued by the Group, should be read in conjunction with that earlier information.
Market risk The Group uses various market risk measures for risk reporting and setting risk appetite limits and triggers.
These measures include Value at Risk and Stress Scenarios.
Interest rate risk In the Groups retail banking business interest rate risk arises from the different repricing characteristics of the assets and liabilities.
liabilities are either insensitive to interest rate movements, for example interest free or very low interest customer deposits, or are sensitive to interest rate changes but bear rates which may be varied at the Groups discretion and that for competitive reasons generally reflect changes in the Bank of englands base rate.
There is a relatively small volume of deposits whose rate is contractually fixed for their term to maturity.
Many banking assets are sensitive to interest rate movements: there is a large volume of managed rate assets such as variable rate mortgages which may be considered as a natural offset to the interest rate risk arising from the managed rate liabilities.
However, a significant proportion of the Groups lending assets, for example many personal loans and mortgages, bear interest rates which are contractually fixed for periods of up to five years or longer.
The Group establishes two types of hedge accounting relationships for interest rate risk: fair value hedges and cash flow hedges.
The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its fixed rate customer loans, its fixed rate customer deposits and the majority of its subordinated debt, and to cash flow interest rate risk on its variable rate loans and deposits together with its floating rate subordinated debt.

The losses on the hedging instruments were 933 million 2012: gains of 572 million.
The gains on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk were 872 million 2012: losses of 560 million.
In addition the Group has cash flow hedges which are primarily used to hedge the variability in the cost of funding within the wholesale business.
note 18 shows when the hedged cash flows are expected to occur and when they will affect income for designated cash flow hedges.
The notional principal of the interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges at 31 December 2013 was 559,690 million 2012: 86,190 million with a net fair value liability of 1,347 million 2012: asset of 215 million note 18.
In 2013, ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement that arises from cash flow hedges was a loss of 60 million 2012: gain of 6 million.
Currency risk Foreign exchange exposures comprise those originating in treasury trading activities and structural foreign exchange exposures, which arise from investment in the Groups overseas operations.
The corporate and retail businesses incur foreign exchange risk in the course of providing services to their customers.
All non-structural foreign exchange exposures in the non-trading book are transferred to the trading area where they are monitored and controlled.
These risks reside in the authorised trading centres who are allocated exposure limits.
The limits are monitored daily by the local centres and reported to the market and liquidity risk function in london.
Associated VaR and the closing, average, maximum and minimum are disclosed on page 166.
Risk arises from the Groups investments in its overseas operations.
The Groups structural foreign currency exposure is represented by the net asset value of the foreign currency equity and subordinated debt investments in its subsidiaries and branches.
Gains or losses on structural foreign currency exposures are taken to reserves.
The Group hedges part of the currency translation risk of the net investment in certain foreign operations using currency borrowings.
At 31 December 2013 the aggregate principal of these currency borrowings was 1,695 million 2012: 2,489 million.
In 2013, an ineffectiveness gain of 16 million before tax and 12 million after tax 2012: ineffectiveness loss of 1 million before and after tax was recognised in the income statement arising from net investment hedges.
The Groups main overseas operations are in the Americas, Asia, Australasia and europe.
Details of the Groups structural foreign currency exposures, after net investment hedges, are as follows: Functional currency of Group operations 2013 2012 m m euro: Gross exposure 567 919 net investment hedge 464 842 103 77 uS dollar: Gross exposure 379 316 net investment hedge 341 542 38 226 Swiss franc: Gross exposure 7 6 net investment hedge 9 7 3 Australian dollar: Gross exposure 853 1,104 net investment hedge 866 1,077 13 27 Japanese yen: Gross exposure 1 19 net investment hedge 1 19 2 Other non-sterling 106 106 Total structural foreign currency exposures, after net investment hedges 225 19 Independent auditors report 198 Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group Consolidated financial statements 204 328 329 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 212 Parent company financial statements 366 Notes to the parent company financial statements 369 1 44 69 123 377 Note 54: Financial risk management continued Credit risk The Groups credit risk exposure arises in respect of the instruments below and predominantly in the united Kingdom, the european union and the united States.
Credit risk appetite is set at Board level and is described and reported through a suite of metrics devised from a combination of accounting and credit portfolio performance measures, which include the use of various credit risk rating systems as inputs and measure the credit risk of loans and advances to customers and banks at a counterparty level using three components: i the probability of default by the counterparty on its contractual obligations: ii the current exposures to the counterparty and their likely future development, from which the Group derives the exposure at default: and iii the likely loss ratio on the defaulted obligations, the loss given default.
The Group uses a range of approaches to mitigate credit risk, including internal control policies, obtaining collateral, using master netting agreements and other credit risk transfers, such as asset sales and credit derivative based transactions.
Maximum credit exposure The maximum credit risk exposure of the Group in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations is detailed below.
no account is taken of any collateral held and the maximum exposure to loss, which includes amounts held to cover unit-linked and With Profits funds liabilities, is considered to be the balance sheet carrying amount or, for non-derivative off-balance sheet transactions and financial guarantees, their contractual nominal amounts.

4 Includes assets within the Groups unit-linked funds for which credit risk is borne by the policyholders and assets within the Groups With-Profits funds for which credit risk is largely borne by the policyholders.
Consequently, the Group has no significant exposure to credit risk for such assets which back related contract liabilities.
5 See note 52 Contingent liabilities and commitments for further information.
Credit quality of assets loans and receivables The disclosures in the table below and those on pages 330 and 331 are produced under the underlying basis used for the Groups segmental reporting.
The Group believes that, for reporting periods following a significant acquisition such as the acquisition of HBOS in 2009, this underlying basis, which includes the allowance for loan losses at the acquisition date on a gross basis, more fairly reflects the underlying provisioning status of the loans.
The remaining acquisition-related fair value adjustments in respect of this lending are therefore identified separately in this table.
The analysis of lending between retail and wholesale has been prepared based upon the type of exposure and not the business segment in which the exposure is recorded.
Included within retail are exposures to personal customers and small businesses, whilst included within wholesale are exposures to corporate customers and other large institutions.

The criteria that the Group uses to determine that there is objective evidence of an impairment loss are disclosed in note 2 H. All impaired loans which exceed certain thresholds, principally within the Groups Commercial Banking division, are individually assessed for impairment by reviewing expected future cash flows including those that could arise from the realisation of security.
Included in loans and receivables are advances which are individually determined to be impaired with a gross amount before impairment allowances of 22,390 million 31 December 2012: 34,533 million.
The table below sets out the reconciliation of the allowance for impairment losses of 11,966 million 2012: 15,250 million shown in note 24 to the allowance for impairment losses on an underlying basis of 15,707 million 2012: 21,772 million shown above: 2013 2012 m m Allowance for impairment losses on loans and advances to customers 11,966 15,250 1 HBOS allowance at 16 January 2009 11,147 11,147 2 HBOS charge covered by fair value adjustments 11,815 11,306 Amounts subsequently written off 19,674 16,383 3,288 6,070 Foreign exchange and other movements 453 452 Allowance for impairment losses on loans and advances to customers on an underlying basis 15,707 21,772 1 Comprises an allowance held at 31 December 2008 of 10,693 million and a charge for the period from 1 January 2009 to 16 January 2009 of 454 million.

The definitions of good quality, satisfactory quality, lower quality and below standard, but not impaired applying to retail and wholesale are not the same, reflecting the different characteristics of these exposures and the way they are managed internally, and consequently totals are not provided.
Wholesale lending has been classified using internal probability of default rating models mapped so that they are comparable to external credit ratings.
Good quality lending comprises the lower assessed default probabilities, with other classifications reflecting progressively higher default risk.

Credit risk in respect of trading and other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss held within the Groups unit-linked funds is borne by the policyholders and credit risk in respect of with-profits funds is largely borne by the policyholders.
Consequently, the Group has no significant exposure to credit risk for such assets which back those contract liabilities.

The Group reduces exposure to credit risk by using master netting agreements and by obtaining collateral in the form of cash or highly liquid securities.
In respect of the Groups maximum credit risk relating to derivative assets of 13,646 million 2012: 18,399 million, cash collateral of 3,188 million 2012: 5,429 million was held and a further 2,372 million was due from OeCD banks 2012: 1,387 million.
Financial guarantees and irrevocable loan commitments Financial guarantees represent undertakings that the Group will meet a customers obligation to third parties if the customer fails to do so.
Commitments to extend credit represent unused portions of authorisations to extend credit in the form of loans, guarantees or letters of credit.
The Group is theoretically exposed to loss in an amount equal to the total guarantees or unused commitments, however, the likely amount of loss is expected to be significantly less: most commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards.
C. Collateral held as security for financial assets A general description of collateral held as security in respect of financial instruments is provided on page 136.
The Group holds collateral against loans and receivables and irrevocable loan commitments: qualitative and, where appropriate, quantitative information is provided in respect of this collateral below.
Collateral held as security for trading and other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and for derivative assets is also shown below.
Loans and receivables The disclosures below are produced under the underlying basis used for the Groups segmental reporting.
The Group believes that, for reporting periods following a significant acquisition, such as the acquisition of HBOS in 2009, this underlying basis, which includes the allowance for loan losses at the acquisition on a gross basis, more fairly reflects the underlying provisioning status of the loans.
The Group holds collateral in respect of loans and advances to banks and customers as set out below.
The Group does not hold collateral against debt securities, comprising asset-backed securities and corporate and other debt securities, which are classified as loans and receivables.
loans and advances to banks The Group may require collateral before entering into a credit commitment with another bank, depending on the type of financial product and the counterparty involved, and netting arrangements are obtained whenever possible and to the extent that such agreements are legally enforceable.
Collateral is held as part of reverse repurchase or securities borrowing transactions.
There were reverse repurchase agreements which are accounted for as collateralised loans within loans and advances to banks with a carrying value of 183 million 2012: 662 million, against which the Group held collateral with a fair value of 183 million 2012: 662 million, all of which the Group is able to repledge.
These transactions were generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary for standard secured lending activities.
loans and advances to customers The Group holds collateral against loans and advances to customers in the form of mortgages over residential and commercial real estate, charges over business assets such as premises, inventory and accounts receivable, charges over financial instruments such as debt securities and equities, and guarantees received from third parties.

The value of collateral used in determining the loan-to-value ratios has been estimated based upon the last actual valuation, adjusted to take into account subsequent movements in house prices, after making allowance for indexation error and dilapidations.
For non-mortgage retail lending to small businesses, collateral will often include second charges over residential property and the assignment of life cover.
The majority of non-mortgage retail lending is unsecured.
At 31 December 2013, impaired non-mortgage lending amounted to 1,696 million, net of an impairment allowance of 1,044 million 2012: 2,328 million, net of an impairment allowance of 1,326 million.
The fair value of the collateral held in respect of this lending was 144 million 2012: 48 million.
In determining the fair value of collateral, no specific amounts have been attributed to the costs of realisation and the value of collateral for each loan has been limited to the principal amount of the outstanding advance in order to eliminate the effects of any  and to provide a clearer representation of the Groups exposure.
unimpaired non-mortgage retail lending amounted to 36,081 million 2012: 42,145 million.
lending decisions are predominantly based on an obligors ability to repay from normal business operations rather than reliance on the disposal of any security provided.
Collateral values are rigorously assessed at the time of loan origination and are thereafter monitored in accordance with business unit credit policy.
The Group credit risk disclosures for unimpaired non-mortgage retail lending report assets gross of collateral and therefore disclose the maximum loss exposure.
The Group believes that this approach is appropriate.
The value of collateral is reassessed if there is observable evidence of distress of the borrower.
unimpaired non-mortgage retail lending, including any associated collateral, is managed on a customerby-customer basis rather than a portfolio basis.
no aggregated collateral information for the entire unimpaired non-mortgage retail lending portfolio is provided to key management personnel.

Included in these amounts are collateral balances in the form of cash provided in respect of reverse repurchase agreements amounting to 49 million 2012: 2 million.
Impaired secured lending The value of collateral is re-evaluated and its legal soundness re-assessed if there is observable evidence of distress of the borrower: this evaluation is used to determine potential loss allowances and managements strategy to try to either repair the business or recover the debt.
At 31 December 2013, impaired secured wholesale lending amounted to 9,845 million, net of an impairment allowance of 11,063 million 2012: 17,257 million, net of an impairment allowance of 15,193 million.
The fair value of the collateral held in respect of impaired secured wholesale lending was 6,915 million 2012: 9,414 million.
In determining the fair value of collateral, no specific amounts have been attributed to the costs of realisation.
For the purposes of determining the total collateral held by the Group in respect of impaired secured wholesale lending, the value of collateral for each loan has been limited to the principal amount of the outstanding advance in order to eliminate the effects of any  and to provide a clearer representation of the Groups exposure.
Impaired secured wholesale lending and associated collateral relates to lending to property companies and to customers in the financial, business and other services: transport, distribution and hotels: and construction industries.
Unimpaired secured lending unimpaired secured wholesale lending amounted to 69,108 million 2012: 74,485 million.
Wholesale lending decisions are predominantly based on an obligors ability to repay from normal business operations rather than reliance on the disposal of any security provided.
Collateral values are rigorously assessed at the time of loan origination.
The types of collateral taken and the frequency with which collateral is required at origination is dependent upon the size and structure of the borrower.
For exposures to corporate customers and other large institutions, the Group will often require the collateral to include a first charge over land and buildings owned and occupied by the business, a mortgage debenture over the companys undertaking and one or more of its assets, and keyman insurance.
The Group maintains policies setting out acceptable collateral, maximum loan-to-value ratios and other criteria to be considered when reviewing a loan application.
The decision as to whether or not collateral is required will be based upon the nature of the transaction and the credit worthiness of the customer.
Other than for project finance, object finance and income producing real estate where charges over the subject assets are a basic requirement, the provision of collateral will not determine the outcome of a credit application.
The fundamental business proposition must evidence the ability of the business to generate funds from normal business sources to repay debt.
The extent to which collateral values are actively managed will depend on the credit quality and other circumstances of the obligor.
Although lending decisions are predominantly based on expected cash flows, any collateral provided may impact the pricing and other terms of a loan or facility granted: this will have a financial impact on the amount of net interest income recognised and on internal loss-given-default estimates that contribute to the determination of asset quality.
For unimpaired secured wholesale lending, the Group reports assets gross of collateral and therefore discloses the maximum loss exposure.
The Group believes that this approach is appropriate as collateral values at origination and during a period of good performance may not be representative of the value of collateral if the obligor enters a distressed state.
unimpaired secured wholesale lending is predominantly managed on a cash flow basis.
On occasion, it may include an assessment of underlying collateral, although, for impaired lending, this will not always involve assessing it on a fair value basis.
no aggregated collateral information for the entire unimpaired secured wholesale lending portfolio is provided to key management personnel.
Trading and other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss excluding equity shares In respect of trading and other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, the fair value of collateral accepted under reverse repurchase transactions which are accounted for as collateralised loans that the Group is permitted by contract or custom to sell or repledge was 32,434 million 2012: 19,629 million.
Of this, 8,195 million was sold or repledged 2012: 15,640 million.
In addition, securities held as collateral in the form of stock borrowed amounted to 46,552 million 2012: 38,040 million.
Of this amount, 45,277 million 2012: 36,549 million had been resold or repledged as collateral for the Groups own transactions.
Independent auditors report 198 Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group Consolidated financial statements 204 338 339 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 212 Parent company financial statements 366 Notes to the parent company financial statements 369 1 44 69 123 377 Note 54: Financial risk management continued Derivative assets, after offsetting of amounts under master netting arrangements The Group reduces exposure to credit risk by using master netting agreements and by obtaining collateral in the form of cash or highly liquid securities.
In respect of the net derivative assets after offsetting of amounts under master netting arrangements of 13,646 million 2012: 18,399 million, cash collateral of 3,188 million 2012: 5,429 million was held.
Irrevocable loan commitments and other credit-related contingencies At 31 December 2013, the Group held irrevocable loan commitments and other credit-related contingencies of 59,172 million 2012: 55,629 million.
Collateral is held as security, in the event that lending is drawn down, on 19,123million 2012: 17,697 million of these balances.
lending decisions in respect of irrevocable loan commitments are based on the obligors ability to repay from normal business operations rather than reliance on the disposal of any security provided.
For wholesale commitments, it is the Groups practice to request collateral whose value is commensurate with the nature of the commitment.
For retail mortgage commitments, the majority are for mortgages with a loan-to-value ratio of less than 100 per cent.
Aggregated collateral information covering the entire balance of irrevocable loan commitments over which security will be taken is not provided to key management personnel.
D. Collateral pledged as security Repo and stock lending transactions The Group pledges assets primarily for repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions which are generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary for standard securitised borrowing contracts.
The fair value of collateral pledged in respect of repurchase transactions, accounted for as secured borrowings, where the secured party is permitted by contract or custom to repledge was 37,999 million 2012: 48,077 million.
In addition, the following financial assets on the balance sheet have been pledged as collateral as part of securities lending transactions: Assets pledged 2013 2012 m m Trading and other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 9,928 10,000 loans and advances to customers 14,927 11,603 Debt securities classified as loans and receivables 89 154 Available-for-sale financial assets 2,311 4,251 27,255 26,008 In addition to the assets detailed above, the Group also holds assets that are encumbered through the Groups asset-backed conduits and its securitisation and covered bond programmes.
Further details of these assets are provided in notes 21 and 22.
E. Collateral repossessed 2013 2012 m m Residential property 897 936 Other 5 6 902 942 In respect of retail portfolios, the Group does not take physical possession of properties or other assets held as collateral and uses external agents to realise the value as soon as practicable, generally at auction, to settle indebtedness.
Any surplus funds are returned to the borrower or are otherwise dealt with in accordance with appropriate insolvency regulations.
In certain circumstances the Group takes physical possession of assets held as collateral against wholesale lending.
In such cases, the assets are carried on the Groups balance sheet and are classified according to the Groups accounting policies.

Treatment of customers experiencing financial stress The Group operates a number of schemes to assist borrowers who are experiencing financial stress.
The material elements of these schemes are described in the Risk Management report on pages 137 and 138 and further details relating to those cases where the Group has granted a concession, whether temporarily or permanently, are set out below.
Retail customers Forbearance activities The Group classifies the treatments offered to retail customers who have experienced financial difficulty into the following categories: Reduced contractual monthly payment: a temporary account change to assist customers through periods of financial difficulty where arrears do not accrue at the original contractual payments, for example temporary interest only arrangements and short-term payment holidays granted in collections.
Any arrears existing at the commencement of the arrangement are retained: Reduced payment arrangements: a temporary arrangement for customers in financial distress where arrears accrue at the contractual payment, for example short-term arrangements to pay: Term extensions: a permanent account change for customers in financial distress where the overall term of the mortgage is extended resulting in a lower contractual monthly payment: and Repair: a permanent account change used to repair a customers position where they have emerged from financial difficulty, for example capitalisation of arrears.
Customers receiving support from uK Government sponsored programmes The Group participates in a number of uK Government sponsored programmes designed to support households, which are described on page 137.
Where these schemes provide borrowers with a state benefit that is used to service the loan, there is no change in the reported status of the loan which is managed and reported in accordance with its original terms.
The Group assesses whether a loan benefitting from a uK Government sponsored programme is impaired using the same accounting policies and practices as it does for loans not benefitting from such a programme.
There is no direct impact on the impairment status of a loan benefitting from the Mortgage Rescue schemes, as these schemes involve the purchase, and eventual sale, of the property.
The loans included within the Income Support for Mortgage Interest scheme may be impaired, in accordance with the normal definition of impairment.
The Income Support for Mortgage Interest scheme remains the most successful of the Government backed schemes.
It is the longest-running, is the most widely known and provides both the customer and the Group with an assurance as to the maintenance of at least two years worth of interest payments.
The Group estimates that customers representing approximately 2.6 billion of its mortgage exposures are receiving this benefit.
This includes those who are also receiving other treatments for financial difficulty.
Customers in financial difficulty receiving support under other schemes The Group measures the success of a forbearance scheme based upon the proportion of customers maintaining or improving their arrears position over the 12 months following the exit from a forbearance treatment.
For temporary treatments, 87 per cent of customers who have accepted temporary interest-only concessions and 75 per cent of customers accepting reduced payment arrangements have maintained or improved their arrears position.
For permanent treatments, 77 per cent of customers who have accepted capitalisations of arrears and 40 per cent of customers who have accepted term extensions have maintained or improved their arrears position.
Forbearance identification and classification The Group has applied revised forbearance definitions based upon principles developed through the British Bankers Association.
As a result of this, forbearance data for 2012 has been restated to reflect the new definitions.
The restated data for 2012 shows overall forbearance balances to be higher than previous financial statements as the balances now include accounts which are no longer on a forbearance treatment, but where the exposure is known to be, or may still be, in financial difficulty.
The Group classifies a retail account as forborne at the time a customer in financial difficulty is granted a concession.
Accounts are classified as forborne only for the period of time which the exposure is known to be, or may still be, in financial difficulty.
Where temporary forbearance is granted, exit criteria are applied to include accounts until they are known to no longer be in financial difficulty.
Details of the exit criteria are shown in the analysis below.
Where the treatment involves a permanent change to the contractual basis of the customers account such as a capitalisation of arrears or term extension, the Group classifies the balance as forborne for a period of 24 months, after which no distinction is made between these accounts and others where no change has been made.

Collective impairment assessment of retail secured loans subject to forbearance loans which are forborne are grouped with other assets with similar risk characteristics and assessed collectively for impairment as described below.
The loans are not considered as impaired loans unless they meet the Groups definition of an impaired asset.
The Groups approach is to ensure that provisioning models, supported by management judgement, appropriately reflect the underlying loss risk of exposures.
The Group uses sophisticated behavioural scoring to assess customers credit risk.
The underlying behavioural scorecards consider many different characteristics of customer behaviour, both static and dynamic, from internal sources and also from credit bureaux data, including characteristics that may identify when a customer has been in arrears on products held with other firms.
Hence, these models take a range of potential indicators of customer financial distress into account.
The performance of such models is monitored and challenged on an ongoing basis, in line with the Groups model governance policies.
The models are also regularly recalibrated to reflect up to date customer behaviour and market conditions.
Specifically, regular detailed analysis of modelled provision outputs is undertaken to demonstrate that the risk of forbearance or other similar activities is recognised, that the outcome period adequately captures the risk and that the underlying risk is appropriately reflected.
Where this is not the case, additional provisions are applied to capture the risk.

Collective impairment assessment of UK retail unsecured loans and advances subject to forbearance Credit risk provisioning for the uK retail unsecured portfolio is undertaken on a purely collective basis.
The approach used is based on segmented cash flow models, divided into two primary streams for loans judged to be impaired and those that are not.
Accounts subject to repayment plans and collections refinance loans are among those considered to be impaired.
For exposures that are judged to be impaired, provisions are determined through modelling the expected cure rates, write-off propensity and cash flows with segments explicitly relating to repayment plans and refinance loans treatments.
Payments of less than the monthly contractual amount are reflected in reduced cash flow forecasts when calculating the impairment allowance for these accounts.
The outputs of the models are monitored and challenged on an ongoing basis.
The models are run monthly meaning that current market conditions and customer processes are reflected in the output.
Where the risks identified are not captured in the underlying models, appropriate additional provisions are made.

Asset Finance retail lending Asset Finance operates a number of retail portfolios including Black Horse Motor Finance as well as a number of portfolios closed to new business and currently in run-off.
The reduction in the level of forborne loans in 2013 was driven by the continuing run-off and sale of non-core portfolios.
The table below includes both the open and closed retail portfolios in the Asset Finance business.

loans that have been renegotiated and or restructured for solely commercial reasons, where there is no financial difficulty would not be treated as forborne.
The Group does not believe the concept of forbearance attaches to the trading book where assets are marked to market daily.
The Group recognises that forbearance alone is not necessarily an indicator of impaired status but is a trigger for the review of the customers credit profile.
The Group grants forbearance when it believes that there is a realistic prospect of the customer continuing to be able to repay all facilities in full.
If there is any concern over future cash flows and the Group incurring a loss, then forborne loans will be classified as impaired in accordance with the Groups impairment policy.
Recovery can sometimes be through improvement in market or economic conditions, or the customer may benefit from access to alternative sources of liquidity such as an equity injection.
These can be especially relevant in real estate or other asset backed transactions where a fire sale of assets in a weak market may be unattractive.
Depending on circumstances and when operated within robust parameters and controls, the Group believes forbearance can help support the customer in the short to medium-term.
Therefore the Group expects to have unimpaired forborne assets within its portfolios, although as noted below, these are specifically controlled and managed.
unimpaired forborne assets are included in calculating the overall collective unimpaired provision, and which uses the historical observed default rate of the portfolio as a whole as part of its calculation.
Types of forbearance Forbearance treatments may include changes to: Contractual payment terms for example loan extensions, or changes to debt servicing terms, and non-payment contractual terms for example covenant amendments or waivers where the modifications enable default to be avoided.
The four main types of forbearance concessions to commercial customers in financial difficulty are set out below: Covenants: This includes temporary and permanent waivers, amendment or resetting of non-payment contractual covenants including lTV and interest cover.
The granting of this type of concession in itself would not result in the loan being classified as impaired: extensions Alterations: This includes extension and or alteration of repayment terms to a level outside of market or the Groups risk appetite due to the customers inability to make existing contractual repayment terms: amendments to an interest rate to a level considered outside of market or the Groups risk appetite, or other amendments such as changes to debt servicing arrangements: Forgiveness: This includes debt for equity swaps or partial debt forgiveness.
This type of forbearance will always give rise to impairment: and Multiple type of forbearance a mixture of the above three.
Where a concession is granted to a customer that is not in financial difficulty or the risk profile is considered within current risk appetite, the concession would not be considered to be an act of forbearance.
A number of options are available to the Group where a customer is facing financial difficulty, and each case is treated depending on its own specific circumstances.
The Groups strategy and offer of forbearance is largely dependent on the individual situation and early identification, control and monitoring are key in order to support the customer and protect the Group.
Concessions are often provided to help the customer with their day to day liquidity and working capital.

Impaired loans and advances exist only in Business Support: Global non Core: and, for smaller SMe customers, Customer Support.
unimpaired forborne loans and advances exist in the good book, in Business Support and in Global non Core.
All non-retail loans and advances in Commercial Banking are reviewed at least annually by the independent Risk Division.
As part of our long established Credit Risk Classification system, every loan and advance in the good book is categorised as either good or watchlist.
The watchlist is further categorised depending on the current and expected credit risk attaching to the customer and the transaction.
All watchlist names are reviewed by the Business and Risk at least once a month, and the classification is updated if required.
Any concession granted to a customer is reviewed and must be approved by the independent Risk Division.
If Risk Division determines that the customer is in financial difficulty, then any off-market concession granted is treated as forbearance and the loan reviewed monthly.
Forbearance does not arise if the customer is not in financial difficulty or if the risk profile of the customer following the concession is within the Groups current risk appetite.
Any event that causes concern over future payments from the customer is likely to result in the asset being assessed for impairment and, if required, an impairment allowance recognised.
If impairment is identified, the customer is immediately transferred to Business Support and the lending will be treated as an impaired asset.
If no impairment is identified, the Risk Division will determine if the customer should remain in the good book categorised as watchlist, or transfer to Business Support for more intensive monitoring.
All reviews performed in the good book, Business Support or Global non Core include analysis of latest financial information, a consideration of the market and sector the customer operates in, performance against plan and revised terms and conditions granted as part of the forbearance concession.
exit from forbearance classification A customer where forbearance has been granted will remain treated and recorded as forborne until it evidences acceptable performance over a period of time.
This period will depend on a number of factors such as whether the customer is trading in line with its revised plan, it is operating within the new terms and conditions including observation to revised covenants and contractual payments, its financial performance is stable or improving, and there are no undue concerns over its future performance.
As a minimum, this period is currently expected to be at least 12 months following a forbearance event during 2014, the minimum cure period will be reviewed again in conjunction with regulatory requirements.
However, notwithstanding this, the overriding requirement is that the financial difficulty previously seen has been removed, and the performance has stabilised.
Once a customer evidences acceptable performance over a period of time, the Group would expect that it could be returned to the mainstream good classification and they would no longer be considered forborne.
It is important to note that such a decision can be made only by the independent Risk Division.
Currently, the exception to this 12 month minimum period is where a permanent structural cure is made for example, this could be an injection of new collateral security or partial repayment of debt to restore an lTV back to within the covenant.
In this case, the customer may be removed from the forbearance category once the permanent cure has been made.

The Group carries out monthly stress testing of its liquidity position against a range of scenarios, including those prescribed by the PRA.
The Groups liquidity risk appetite is also calibrated against a number of stressed liquidity metrics.
The table below analyses assets and liabilities of the Group into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining contractual period at the balance sheet date: balances with no fixed maturity are included in the over 5 years category.
Certain balances, included in the table below on the basis of their residual maturity, are repayable on demand upon payment of a penalty.
The Groups assets and liabilities may be repaid or otherwise mature earlier or later than implied by their contractual terms and readers are, therefore, advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Groups liquidity position.
In particular, amounts in respect of customer deposits are usually contractually payable on demand or at short notice.
However, in practice, these deposits are not usually withdrawn on their contractual maturity.
The table below analyses financial instrument liabilities of the Group, excluding those arising from insurance and participating investment contracts, on an undiscounted future cash flow basis according to contractual maturity, into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date: balances with no fixed maturity are included in the over 5 years category.
The majority of the Groups financial guarantee contracts are callable on demand, were the guaranteed party to fail to meet its obligations.
It is, however, expected that most guarantees will expire unused.
The contractual nominal amounts of these guarantees totalled 8,591 million at 31 December 2013 2012: 9,520 million with 4,233 million expiring within one year: 837 million between one and three years: 2,039 million between three and five years: and 1,482 million over five years 2012: 4,865 million expiring within one year: 1,302 million between one and three years: 1,729 million between three and five years: and 1,624 million over five years.
The majority of the Groups non-participating investment contract liabilities are unit-linked.
These unit-linked products are invested in accordance with unit fund mandates.
Clauses are included in policyholder contracts to permit the deferral of sales, where necessary, so that linked assets can be realised without being a forced seller.
The principal amount for undated subordinated liabilities with no redemption option is included within the over five years column: interest of approximately 85 million 2012: 79 million per annum which is payable in respect of those instruments for as long as they remain in issue is not included beyond five years.
Further information on the Groups liquidity exposures is provided on pages 171 to 177.

The following tables set out the amounts and residual maturities of the Groups off balance sheet contingent liabilities and commitments.
Capital risk appetite is set by the Board, reflecting the Groups strategic plans, regulatory capital constraints and market expectations.
It includes a number of minimum capital ratios in normal and stressed conditions as well as a specific measure for the Insurance business, set by the Insurance Board, taking account of the need to maintain regulatory solvency including appropriate management buffers.
The Board and the Group Chief executive, assisted by the Group Asset and liability Committee and the Group Risk Committee, regularly review performance against the risk appetite.
A key metric is the Groups common equity tier 1 CeT1 capital ratio which the Group currently aims to maintain in excess of 10 per cent.
Additionally, a series of stress analyses is undertaken during the year to determine the adequacy of the Groups capital resources in adverse economic scenarios including those provided by the PRA.
Insurance risk Insurance risk is the risk of reductions in earnings, capital and or value, through financial or reputational loss, due to fluctuations in the timing, frequency and severity of insured underwritten events and to fluctuations in the timing and amount of claim settlements.
This includes fluctuations in profits due to customer behaviour.
The Groups appetite for solvency and earnings in insurance entities is reviewed and approved annually by the Board.
Insurance risks are measured using a variety of techniques including stress and scenario testing, and, where appropriate, stochastic modelling.
Ongoing monitoring is in place to track the progression of insurance risks.
This normally involves monitoring relevant experiences against expectations, as well as evaluating the effectiveness of controls put in place to manage insurance risk.

2 These OeICs Open-ended investment companies are mutual funds which are consolidated if the Group manages the funds and also has a majority beneficial interest.
The population of OeICs to be consolidated varies at each reporting date as external investors acquire and divest holdings in the various funds.
The consolidation of these funds is effected by the inclusion of the fund investments and a matching liability to the unitholders: and changes in funds consolidated represent a non-cash movement on the balance sheet.

and Measurement relating to the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities.
IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into two measurement categories, fair value and amortised cost, on the basis of the objectives of the entitys business model for managing its financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instruments and eliminates the available-for-sale financial asset and held-to-maturity investment categories in IAS 39.
The requirements for derecognition are broadly unchanged from IAS 39.
The standard also retains most of the IAS 39 requirements for financial liabilities except for those designated at fair value through profit or loss whereby that part of the fair value change attributable to the entitys own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income.
The hedge accounting requirements are more closely aligned with risk management practices and follow a more principle-based approach.
1 As at 5 March 2014, these pronouncements are awaiting eu endorsement.
2 IFRS 9 is the standard which will replace IAS 39.
Further changes to IFRS 9 are expected dealing with impairment of financial assets measured at amortised cost, which will be based on expected rather than incurred credit losses, and limited amendments to classification and measurement which include the introduction of a third measurement category, fair value through other comprehensive income.
until the standard is complete, it is not possible to determine the overall impact of the standard on the financial statements.
