THE EDINBURGH INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 45 18.
Financial Instruments Financial instruments The Companys financial instruments mainly comprise its investment portfolio as shown on page 10 and debentures as well as its cash, debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations such as sales and purchases awaiting settlement and accrued income.
The accounting policies in note 1 include criteria for the recognition and the basis of measurement applied for financial instruments.
Note 1 also includes the basis on which income and expenses arising from financial assets and liabilities are recognised and measured.
The main financial risks that the Company faces from its financial instruments are market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
These are set out below: Market risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk: Currency risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in foreign exchange rates: Interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in market interest rates: and Other price risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument for reasons other than changes in foreign exchange rates or market interest rates.
Liquidity risk arising from any difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Credit risk arising from financial loss for a company where the other party to a financial instrument fails to discharge an obligation.
Risk Management Policies and Procedures The Directors have delegated to the Manager the responsibility for the day-to-day investment activities and management of gearing of the Company as more fully described in the Report of the Directors.
As an investment trust the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long-term so as to fulfil its investment policy incorporating the Companys investment objective.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction of the profits available for dividends.
These policies are summarised below and have remained substantially unchanged for the two years under review.
Market Risk The Companys Manager assesses the Companys exposure when making each investment decision, and monitors the overall level of market risk for the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
The Board has meetings in each calendar quarter to assess risk and review investment performance, as disclosed in the Board Responsibilities on page 21.
The debentures provide structural gearing, which is used to enhance returns but also increases the Companys exposure to market risk and volatility.
Currency risk The majority of the Companys assets and all of its liabilities are denominated in sterling.
There is some exposure to Euro, US dollar and Swiss franc.
Management of the currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys direct exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the board on a regular basis.
Forward currency contracts can be used to reduce the Companys exposure to foreign currencies arising naturally from the Managers choice of securities.
All contracts are limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the assets denominated in currencies.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
46 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 18.
Financial Instruments continued Risk Management Policies and Procedures continued Management of the currency risk continued The Company may invest up to 20% of the portfolio in securities listed on non-UK stock exchanges.
At the year end holdings of non-UK securities total 255.9 million 2012: 208.8 million representing 19.1% 2012: 17.8% of the portfolio.
Currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items that have currency exposure at 31 March are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are priced in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
2013 2012 EURO USD CHF EURO USD CHF 000 000 000 000 000 000 Forward currency sales 24,499 19,012 Foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 24,499 19,012 Investments at fair value through profit or loss that are equities 25,532 108,030 122,323 19,244 96,447 93,089 Total net foreign currency exposure 1,033 108,030 122,323 232 96,447 93,089 The above may not be representative of the exposure to risk during the year, because the levels of foreign currency exposure may change significantly throughout the year.
Currency sensitivity In respect of the Companys direct foreign currency exposure to investments denominated in currencies, if sterling had weakened by 2.1% for the US dollar, 2.2% for the Swiss franc and 2.9% for the Euro during the year, the income statement capital return and net assets of the Company would have increased by 5.7 million 2012: 6.5 million.
Conversely, if sterling had strengthened by the same percentage for the currencies mentioned above, the capital return and net assets of the Company would have decreased by the same amount.
The exchange rate variances of 2.1% for US dollar, 2.2% for Swiss francs and 2.9% for Euro 2012: US dollar 2.1%, Swiss Franc 4.3% and Euro 2.5% have been determined based on market volatility in the year, using the standard deviation of sterlings fluctuation to the applicable currency.
This sensitivity takes no account of any impact on the market values of the Companys investments arising from the foreign currency mix of their respective revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities.
Interest rate risk Interest rate movements will affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits and money market funds, and the interest payable on variable rate borrowings.
When the Company has cash balances, they are held on variable rate bank accounts yielding rates of interest dependent on the base rate determined by the Custodian, The Bank of New York Mellon.
The Company has an uncommitted bank overdraft facility which it uses for settlement purposes.
This facility was largely unused during the year.
All of the Companys long term debt of 200 million of debenture stocks is fixed which exposes the Company to changes in market value in the event that the debt is repaid before maturity.
Details of the debenture stock interest is shown in note 12, with details of its market value and the affect on net asset value in note 16.
The Company can invest in fixed income securities although at the year end none were held 2012: nil.
THE EDINBURGH INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 47 Interest rate exposure At 31 March the exposure of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates giving cash flow interest rate risk when the interest rate is due to be re-set: and fixed interest rates giving fair value interest rate risk when the financial instrument is due for repayment.
2013 2012 BETWEEN MORE BETWEEN MORE ONE AND THAN WITHIN ONE AND THAN WITHIN FIVE FIVE ONE FIVE FIVE ONE YEAR YEARS YEARS TOTAL YEAR YEARS YEARS TOTAL 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Cash and money market funds 87 87 207 207 Exposure to fixed interest rates: Debentures, excluding unamortised discount and issue expenses 100,000 100,000 200,000 100,000 100,000 200,000 Total exposure to interest rates 87 100,000 100,000 199,913 207 100,000 100,000 199,793 No fixed interest investments were held at the year end.
Other price risk Other price risks i. e. changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of the equity investments, but it is the business of the Manager to manage the portfolio to achieve the best return that he can.
Management of the other price risk The Directors manage the market price risks inherent in the investment portfolio by meeting regularly to monitor on a formal basis the Managers compliance with the Companys stated objectives and policies, and to review investment performance.
The Companys portfolio is the result of the Managers investment process and need not be highly correlated with the Companys benchmark or the market in which the Company invests.
The value of the portfolio will not move in line with the market but will move as a result of the performance of the company shares within the portfolio.
If the value of the portfolio fell by 10% at the balance sheet date, the profit after tax for the year and the net assets of the Company would decrease by 134 million 2012: 118 million.
Conversely, if the value of the portfolio rose by 10%, the profit after tax and the net assets of the Company would increase by the same amounts.
Liquidity risk is minimised as the majority of the Companys investments constitute a diversified portfolio of readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet funding commitments as necessary.
In addition, the Company has an overdraft facility which it can use to provide short-term funding flexibility.

Counterparty risk is minimised by using only approved counterparties.
The Companys ability to operate in the short-term may be adversely affected if the Companys custodian suffers insolvency or other financial difficulties.
The Board reviews the custodians annual controls report and the Managers management of the relationship with the custodian.
Cash balances are limited to a maximum of 5 million with any one depository, with only approved depositories being used, and a maximum deposit of 75 million with Short-Term Investments Company Global Series plc, a triple-A rated money market fund.
Values of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The values of the financial assets and financial liabilities are carried in the balance sheet at their fair value investments, or the balance sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value amounts due from brokers, dividends receivable, accrued income, amounts due to brokers, accruals and cash or at amortised cost debentures.
The book cost and fair value of the debentures, based on the offer value at the balance sheet date, are as follows: BOOK FAIR BOOK FAIR VALUE VALUE VALUE VALUE 2013 2013 2012 2012 NUMBER 000 NUMBER 000 Debentures repayable between one and five years: 1 11 2% Debenture Stock 2014 100,000 112,469 100,000 120,341 Debentures repayable in more than five years: 3 7 4% Debenture Stock 2022 100,000 132,162 100,000 125,965 Discount on issue of debentures 2,385 2,636 197,615 244,631 197,364 246,306 Incorporating the fair value of the debentures results in the reduction of the net asset value per ordinary share to 559.01p 2012: 478.30p.
THE EDINBURGH INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 49 Fair Value of Hierarchy Disclosures All except three of the Companys portfolio of investments are in the Level 1 category as defined in FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
The three levels set out in FRS 29 follow.
Level 1 fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
Level 2 fair values based on valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1.
Level 3 fair values based on valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
Categorisation within the hierarchy is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of each relevant asset liability.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies note.
All except three of the Companys investments are Level 1 with one investment in Level 2 and two in Level 3.
The sole investment in Level 2 comprised the Companys holding of Barclays Bank Nuclear Power Notes 28 February 2019.
The two investments in Level 3 arose as a result of corporate events on securities already held: Eurovestech delisted from AIM and Proximagen CVRs arose as a partial cash alternative on the original Proximagen equity holding.
