Smith & Nephew ANNuAl report 2013 124 FiNANCiAl StAtemeNtS Notes to the Group accounts continued 15 Cash and borrowings continued 15.7 Finance leases ACCOUNTING POLICY Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The leased assets are measured initially at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised as property, plant or equipment and depreciated accordingly.
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction in the outstanding liability.
The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Future minimum lease payments under finance leases together with the present value of the minimum lease payments are as follows: 2013 2012 $ million $ million Within one year 3 3 After one and within two years 3 3 After two and within three years 3 3 After three and within four years 3 3 After four and within five years 3 3 After five years 3 6 Total minimum lease payments 18 21 Discounted by imputed interest 4 5 Present value of minimum lease payments 14 16 Present value of minimum lease payments can be split out as: $2m 2012 $2m due within one year, $9m 2012 $8m due between one to five years and $3m 2012 $6m due after five years.
16 Financial instruments and risk management ACCOUNTING POLICY Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value at subsequent balance sheet dates.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges of forecast third party and intercompany transactions are recognised in other comprehensive income until the associated asset or liability is recognised.
Amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement in the period in which the hedged transaction affects profit and loss.
Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset, the amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carrying value of the asset.
Currency swaps to match foreign currency net assets with foreign currency liabilities are fair valued at year-end.
Changes in the fair values of currency swaps that are designated and effective as net investment hedges are matched in other comprehensive income against changes in value of the related net assets.
Interest rate swaps transacted to fix interest rates on floating rate borrowings are accounted for as cash flow hedges and changes in the fair values resulting from changes in market interest rates are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit and loss.
Any ineffectiveness on hedging instruments and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement within other finance income costs as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is retained there until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement for the period.
Group StrAteGiC report CorporAte GoverNANCe FiNANCiAl StAtemeNtS AND other iNFormAtioN Smith & Nephew ANNuAl report 2013 FiNANCiAl StAtemeNtS 125 16.1 Foreign exchange exposures The Group operates in over 90 countries and as a consequence has transactional and translational foreign exchange exposure.
It is Group policy for operating units not to hold material unhedged monetary assets or liabilities other than in their functional currencies.
Foreign exchange variations affect trading results in two ways.
Firstly, on translation of overseas sales and profits into US Dollars and secondly, transactional exposures arising where some or all of the costs of sale are incurred in a different currency from the sale.
The principal transactional exposures arise as the proportion of costs in US Dollars, Sterling and Swiss Francs exceed the proportion of sales in each of these currencies and correspondingly the proportion of sales in Euros exceeds the proportion of costs in Euros.
The impact of currency movements on the cost of purchases is partly mitigated by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge forecast third party and intercompany trading cash flows for forecast foreign currency inventory purchases for up to one year.
When a commitment is entered into, forward foreign exchange contracts are normally used to increase the hedge to 100% of the exposure.
Cash flows relating to cash flow hedges are expected to occur within 12 months of inception and profits and losses on hedges are expected to enter into the determination of profit within cost of goods sold within a further 12-month period.
The principal currencies hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts are US Dollars, Euros and Sterling.
At 31 December 2013, the Group had contracted to exchange within one year the equivalent of $1.6bn 2012 $1.3bn.
Based on the Groups net borrowings as at 31 December 2013, if the US Dollar were to weaken against all currencies by 10%, the Groups net borrowings would decrease by $2m 2012 decrease by $8m as the Group held a higher amount of foreign denominated cash than foreign denominated borrowings.
In respect of borrowings held in a different currency to the relevant reporting entity, if the US Dollar were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, the Groups borrowings would increase by $4m 2012 decrease by $4m.
If the US Dollar were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, then the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2013 would have been $34m lower 2012 $23m.
Similarly, if the Euro were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, then the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2013 would have been $27m higher 2012 $30m.
Movements in the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts would be recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve.
A 10% strengthening of the US Dollar or Euro against all other currencies at 31 December 2013 would have had the equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
The Groups policy to hedge all actual foreign exchange exposures and the Groups forward foreign exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges.
The net impact of transaction related foreign exchange on the income statement from a movement in exchange rates on the value of forward foreign exchange contracts is not significant.
In addition, the movements in the fair value of other financial instruments used for hedging such as currency swaps for which hedge accounting is not applied, offset movements in the values of assets and liabilities and are recognised through the income statement.
16.2 Interest rate exposures The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on cash, borrowings and certain currency swaps which are all at floating rates.
When required the Group uses interest rate swaps to meet its objective of protecting borrowing costs within parameters set by the Board.
Interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges and, as such, changes in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve, with the fair value of the interest rate swaps recorded in the balance sheet.
The cash flows resulting from interest rate swaps match cash flows on the underlying borrowings so that there is no net cash flow from movements in market interest rates on the hedged items.
During 2013 and 2012 the Group was not exposed to significant interest rate risk.
As a result, interest rate swaps were not utilised in accordance with the Board approved policy.
Based on the Groups gross borrowings as at 31 December 2013, if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points in all currencies then the annual net interest charge would increase by $4m 2012 $5m.
A decrease in interest rates by 100 basis points in all currencies would have an equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above.
16.3 Credit risk exposures The Group limits exposure to credit risk on counterparties used for financial instruments through a system of internal credit limits which, with certain minor exceptions due to local market conditions, require counterparties to have a minimum A rating from one of the major ratings agencies.
The financial exposure of a counterparty is determined as the total of cash and deposits, plus the risk on derivative instruments, assessed as the fair value of the instrument plus a risk element based on the nominal value and the historic volatility of the market value of the instrument.
The Group does not anticipate non-performance of counterparties and believes it is not subject to material concentration of credit risk as the Group operates within a policy of counterparty limits designed to reduce exposure to any single counterparty.
The maximum credit risk exposure on derivatives at 31 December 2013 was $29m 2012 $14m, being the total debit fair values on forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps.
The maximum credit risk exposure on cash at bank at 31 December 2013 was $137m 2012 $178m.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is not material as the amounts are held in a wide number of banks in a number of different countries.
Credit risk on trade receivables is detailed in Note 13.

In 2013, the Group also had liabilities due for deferred acquisition consideration denominated in US Dollars and Brazilian Real totalling $21m 2012 $8m, 2011 $11m on which no interest was payable see Note 14.
There are no other significant interest bearing financial liabilities.
Floating rates on liabilities are typically based on the one or three-month LIBOR interest rate relevant to the currency concerned.
The weighted average interest rate on floating rate borrowings as at 31 December 2013 was 1% 2012 1%.

When measuring the fair value of an asset or liability, the Group uses market observable data as far as possible.
Fair values are categorised into different levels in the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable data unobservable inputs.
The Group recognises transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.
The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities, including their levels in the fair value hierarchy.
It does not include fair value information for financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value if the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is calculated by reference to quoted market forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of currency swaps is determined by reference to quoted market spot rates.
As a result, foreign forward exchange contracts and currency swaps are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.
As at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012, the fair value of derivatives is net of a credit valuation adjustment attributable to derivative counterparty default risk.
The changes in counterparty credit risk had no material effect on the hedge effectiveness for derivatives designated in hedge relationships and other financial instruments recognised at fair value.
The fair value of contingent consideration is estimated using a discounted cash flow model.
The valuation model considers the present value of expected payment, discounted using a risk-adjusted discount rate.
The expected payment is determined by considering the possible scenarios, which relate to the achievement of established milestones and targets, the amount to be paid under each scenario and the probability of each scenario.
As a result, contingent consideration is classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.
There were no transfers between level 1, 2 and 3 during 2013 and 2012.
For cash and cash equivalents, short-term loans and receivables, overdrafts and other short-term liabilities which have a maturity of less than three months the book values approximate the fair values because of their short-term nature.
Long-term borrowings are measured in the balance sheet at amortised cost.
As the Groups long-term borrowings are not quoted publicly and as market prices are not available their fair values are estimated by discounting future contractual cash flows to net present values at the current market interest rates available to the Group for similar financial instruments as at the year-end.
At 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012, the fair value of the Groups long-term borrowing was not materially different from amortised cost.
