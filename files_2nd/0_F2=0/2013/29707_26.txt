60 SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2013 Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements of the Company and the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, which comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, and International Accounting Standards and Standing Interpretations Committee interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Committee IASC that remain in effect, and to the extent that they have been adopted by the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for the Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC in January 2009 is consistent with the requirements of IFRS, the financial statements have been prepared on a basis compliant with the SORP.
The Group and Company financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds 000 except when otherwise indicated.
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors consider that for the foreseeable future the Group will continue to be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due.
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except for the adoption of new standards and interpretations effective 1 January 2013.
The nature and impact of each new standard amendment is described below: IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income Amendments to IAS 1 The amendments to IAS 1 introduce a grouping of items presented in other comprehensive income.
Items that could be reclassified orrecycled to profit or loss at a future point in time e. g. net gain on cash flow hedges now have to be presented separately from itemsthat will never be reclassified.
The amendment affected presentation only and had no impact on the Groups financial position orperformance.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements.
IFRS 13 does not change when an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under IFRS when fair value is required or permitted.
The application of IFRS 13 has not materially impacted the fair value measurements carried out by the Group.
IFRS 13 also requires specific disclosures on fair value, some of which replace existing disclosure requirements in other standards, including IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
Summary of new standards and interpretations not applied The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements: Effective date IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Not before 1 January 2017 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements 1 January 2014 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 1 January 2014 IAS 28 Amendment Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures 1 January 2014 IAS 32 Amendment Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 1 January 2014 The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application however it is recognised that additional disclosures within the financial statements will be required.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity soastoobtain benefits from its activities.
Financial statements of all Group companies are prepared for the same reporting period.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Presentation of income statement In order to better reflect the activities of an investment trust company and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the income statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the income statement.
In accordance with the Companys status as a UK investment company under Section 833 of the Companies Act 2006, net capital returns may not be distributed by way of a dividend.
Strategic report Corporate information Financial information Company information SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2013 61 1 Accounting policies continued Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the Groups contractual right to the cash flow from the asset expires or substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the contractual obligation is discharged, with gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
Investments Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value.
As the Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income or capital gains, such financial assets are designated as fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition.
Incidental costs on acquisition of such assets are expensed.
Financial assets designated as fair value through profit or loss are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction which would take place between market participants at the reporting date.
Quoted instruments are valued at either the bid price or the last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted.
In respect of unquoted instruments, or where the market for a financial instrument is not active, fair value is established by using recognised valuation methodologies, in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital IPEV Valuation Guidelines.
Gains and losses arising from investments, designated as investments held at fair value through profit or loss, are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on fair value through profit or loss investments are included within the changes in its fair value.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its risks associated with interest rate fluctuations and foreign exchange movements.
It is not the Groups policy to trade in derivative instruments.
Derivative instruments are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value.
Fair value is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
Unless designated as cash flow hedges, all changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are taken to the income statement.
Cash flow hedges For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the unrealised gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in equity and recorded in the statement of comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs.
Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred tothe initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain inequity untilthe forecast transaction occurs and are transferred to the income statement or to the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above.
If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to the income statement.
A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if all of the following conditions are met.
At the inception of the hedge there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and the entitys risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge: The hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, consistently with the originally documented risk management strategy for that particular hedging relationship: For cash flow hedges, a forecast transaction that is the subject of the hedge must be highly probable and must present an exposure tovariations in cash flows that could ultimately affect profit or loss: The effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured, i. e. the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk and the fair value of the hedging instrument can be reliably measured: The hedge is assessed on an ongoing basis and determined actually to have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which the hedge was designated.
Investments in subsidiaries In its separate financial statements the Company recognises its investment in subsidiaries at cost, unless they are investment vehicles, inwhich case they are included at fair value.
Subsidiaries recognised at cost are subject to an annual impairment review.
62 SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2013 Notes to the accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Investments in associates In accordance with the exemption within IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, the Company does not account for its investments in associates using the equity method.
Instead, the Company has elected to measure its investments in associates at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they occur.
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
Convertible loan notes Convertible loan notes are regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity component.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible loan notes and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in equity.
Issue costs are allocated proportionately to the liability and equity components.
The liability component is accounted for as a borrowing.
Bank borrowings and loan notes Interest-bearing bank loans and loan notes issued are recorded at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement account using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Own shares Own shares represent SVG Capital plc shares held in Employee Benefit Trusts EBT to meet the future requirements of the employee share-based payment plans.
The EBTs are accounted for as extensions of the parent company.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has beenapplied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The cost of equity-settled share-based payments with employees of the Group are measured at fair value at the date of grant and recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the employees become unconditionally entitled tothe award.
Fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate valuation model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any non-market vesting conditions.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period hasexpired and managements best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the consolidated income statement, with a corresponding entry inequity.
The cost of equity awards to employees of subsidiaries is added to the Companys investment in subsidiaries.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts received or receivable for services provided in the normal course of business.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is therate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Interest income is classified within operating activities in the cash flow statement.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment has been established andisclassified within operating activities in the cash flow statement.
Investment management and advisory fees are accrued over the period for which the service is provided.
Revenue that has been earned, but the receipt of which is contingent on the occurrence of a future event, such as investors receiving a return of capital, is only recognised when Management judges the realisation of that income to be virtually certain.
The Groups revenue and realised capital gains are derived primarily from distributions in respect of its holdings in fund investments.
Realised gains on capital distributions which arise from the realisation of investments within the funds, and on sale of investments are credited to the income statement and taken to the capital reserve.
Income distributions are credited to the income statement and taken to the revenue reserve.
Strategic report Corporate information Financial information Company information SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2013 63 1 Accounting policies continued Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership tothelessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The Group as lessee Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
The costs relating to defined benefit schemes are accounted for in the same way as for defined contribution schemes where the Group is unable to identify its share ofthe underlying performance and financial position of the plan with sufficient reliability for accounting purposes.
Such situations arise where the contributions payable by the Group are set in terms of the scheme as a whole and, as such, there is no consistent and reliable basis for allocating the Groups obligations, plan assets, or costs.
Foreign currencies The functional currency of the Company is pounds sterling, as this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of thetransactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated atthe rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement and are allocated either to revenue or capital, as appropriate.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted orsubstantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Investment trusts which have approval under Section 1158 Income and Corporation Tax Act 2010 are not liable for taxation on capitalgains.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities inthe financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using thebalance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred taxassets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from theinitial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, andinterests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable thatthe temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Property, plant and equipment Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost, including direct acquisition costs, less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost less estimated residual value of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Telecommunications and office equipment 10% 20% Leasehold improvements 10% Computer equipment 20% 33% The Group does not ordinarily provide for depreciation against art.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
64 SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2013 Notes to the accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments rather than for investment purposes.
Assets are classified as cash equivalents if they are readily convertible to cash and are not subject to significant changes in value.
The Company has classified short-term bank deposits, investments in money market funds and short-dated treasury bills as cash equivalents.
Deferred consideration The deferred consideration that is not contingent on future events is recognised as a receivable on the Companys balance sheet.
Amounts due within 12 months are recorded as current assets.
Amounts due in greater than 12 months are recorded as non-currentassets.
2 Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the Groups consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates andassumptions that affect the reported amounts of profits and net assets at the end of the reporting period.
However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that have a material impact on net assets in future periods.
The key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to net assets within the next financial year are discussed below.
Other areas of uncertainty and risk are discussed in note 29.
Fair value of financial instruments The Group primarily invests in private equity limited partnerships Funds that in turn invest in companies that are typically unquoted.
Valuing unquoted investments involves a significant degree of judgement.
Fair values of the Funds in which the Group invests is generally considered to be the Companys share of the Net Asset Value of the Fund, as determined by the general partner of such funds, adjusted as considered necessary by the Board, and approved by the Board.
Further details of the valuation techniques are given in note 14.
The Company values its investment portfolio in accordance with IPEV Valuation Guidelines which is considered to be industry standard.
However, amounts ultimately realised on disposal of an investee company can differ materially from the previous carrying value and therefore have a significant impact on the Groups profits and net assets.
Sale of investment management and advisory businesses Judgement has been applied with respect to the presentation of the results of the investment management and advisory services segment during the period.
The segment was made up of the results from SVG Advisers Limited SVGA, SVG Managers Limited SVGM, SVG Investment Managers Limited SVGIM, SVG Advisers Singapore Pte.
Limited, SVG Advisers Inc. and SVG North America Inc.. SVG Advisers Singapore Pte.
Limited, SVG Advisers Inc. and SVG North America Inc. have ceased to trade and SVGA, SVGM and SVGIM have been deconsolidated from the date these companies ceased to qualify as subsidiaries.
The Company retained significant influence over the affairs of SVGA and SVGM by retaining a 49.9% economic interest in the companies and equal representation on the respective boards.
The Board considers that it is still actively involved in the business of these companies and, therefore, the contribution from these businesses has not been presented as a discontinued operation.
The results of SVGIM are not considered by the Board to represent a separate major line of business, and have therefore also not been presented as a discontinued operation.

Strategic report Corporate information Financial information Company information SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2013 73 13 Investments continued During the prior year, the Company sold its direct holding in Permira Europe III PE III, however it retained 50% of its exposure through PE III to one of the underlying investments, the iglo Group iglo.
Deferred consideration due on the disposal of PE III amounted to 14.2 million at the balance sheet date.
A contract is in place giving the Company the rights to 50% of all future distributions received by the acquirer in relation to its holding in Permira Europe III.
The contract has been valued at 19.6 million.
The Board considers that the best indication of the fair value of the right to future distributions from iglo is the current valuation of iglo as calculated in accordance with the Companys accounting policies.
Significant interests in investment funds Details of investments in which the Company or Group has an interest of 10% or more of any class of share units are detailed in the list of investments on page 27.

14 Fair values Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction that would take place between market participants at the reporting date.
Fair value hierarchy IFRS 13 requires disclosures relating to fair value measurement using a three-level fair value hierarchy.
The level within which the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Assessing the significance of a particular input requires judgement, considering factors specific to the asset or liability.
Thefollowing table shows financial instruments recognised at fair value, analysed between those whose fair value is based on: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 : those involving inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly as prices or indirectly derived from prices Level 2 : and those with inputs for the instrument that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs Level 3.

Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are deemed to have occurred at the date of the event that caused the transfer.
Valuation techniques and process Investment valuations are updated on a quarterly basis following the completion of a detailed valuation process.
The valuations team ofthe Investment Adviser perform a review of the valuations to identify and understand any significant changes to valuation inputs.
Thevaluations are then discussed with the Investment Team of the Investment Adviser, to ensure valuation movements are in line with expectations based on the performance of the investment.
The Investment Teams expectations are established based on the results of their continuous investment monitoring process.
The valuations team hold quarterly meetings with the general partner of material Fund investments to understand and challenge, where appropriate, significant changes to valuation inputs.
The valuations are also subject to quality assurance procedures performed within the valuations team.
The valuations team verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the valuation computation to relevant documents and market information.
In addition, the accuracy of the computation is tested.
On a quarterly basis, after the checks above have been performed the valuations team presents the valuation results to the Board.
Thisincludes a discussion of the major assumptions used in the valuations, with an emphasis on the more significant investments andinvestments with fair value changes.
The valuations are reviewed and, if considered appropriate, approved by the Board.
Valuations consist of listed equities, unlisted managed funds and investments in associates at fair value through profit or loss.
Listed equities Quoted instruments are valued at either the bid price or the last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted.
When fair values of publicly traded equities are based on quoted market prices in an active market without any adjustments, the investments are included within Level 1 of the hierarchy.
Strategic report Corporate information Financial information Company information SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2013 75 14 Fair values continued Unlisted managed funds The Group primarily invests in private equity via limited partnerships or other fund structures.
Such vehicles are typically unquoted and in turn invest in unquoted securities.
The Groups investment portfolio is recognised in the balance sheet at fair value, in accordance with IPEV Valuation Guidelines and IFRS.
Fair value is based on the Companys share of the Net Asset Value ofthe Fund, as determined by the general partner of such funds.
Updated Net Asset Values are received for each Fund on a quarterly basis.
The Net Asset Value of a Fund is calculated after determining the fair value of a Funds investment in any investee companies.
This value is generally obtained by calculating the Enterprise Value EV of the company and then deducting financial instruments, such as external debt, ranking ahead of the Funds highest ranking instrument in the company.
The Groups participation in the remaining instruments is then calculated to assess the fair value of the Groups investment.
A common method of determining the EV is to apply a market-based multiple e. g. an average multiple based on a selection of comparable quoted companies to the maintainable earnings of the investee company.
This market-based approach presumes that the comparator companies are correctly valued by the market.
A discount is sometimes applied to market based multiples to adjust for points of difference between the comparators and the company being valued.
If the valuations team consider that an adjustment to the Net Asset Value is appropriate, the valuation is referred to the Pricing Committee of the Investment Adviser.
The Pricing Committee reviews, and if considered appropriate, approves the valuation teams pricing adjustment recommendation.
Adjustments to Net asset value may be considered, for example, where: There has been significant elapsed time between the Net Asset Value calculation date and the Companys balance sheet date There has been material movements in quoted prices between the Net Asset Value calculation date and the Companys balance sheetdate The Company has agreed a sale of its holding in a fund interest at a price other than Net Asset Value Net Asset Value not derived from the fair value of underlying portfolio companies.
Investment in associates at fair value through profit or loss The fair value of Groups investment is Aberdeen SVG is derived from a Discounted Cash Flow DCF calculation based on the expected future cash flows receivable from the associate, discounted at an estimate of the Companys weighted average cost of capital.
The Companys share of equity in Aberdeen SVG is subject to a put and call option which, when exercised, would result in the Company receiving between 20 million and 35 million in proceeds in exchange for its remaining holding in the business.
In addition, the Company will receive a prorated share of dividend income from Aberdeen SVG for the duration of its ownership.
Significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 valuations Unlisted managed funds fair value 1,056,273,000 As described above, in arriving at the fair value of the unlisted managed funds the key inputs are the Net Asset Values as determined by thegeneral partner of the funds and any approved pricing adjustments recommended by the valuations team.
The range of Net Asset Values for the 10 largest funds, which have an aggregate valuation of 96.3% of the unlisted managed funds portfolio, can be seen in note 30.
It is recognised that the valuations of these funds are sensitive to movements in the values of the underlying investee companies.
The10 largest underlying investee companies of the Management Buyout Funds include both quoted and unquoted companies.
At31December 2013, 58.8% of aggregate value of the 10 largest underlying investee companies was derived from quoted prices and 41.2% represented unquoted valuations.
Quoted companies are valued based on market prices.
IFRS and IPEV valuation guidelines stipulate that quoted price should be used to value these companies at the valuation date.
Therefore, provided the Net Asset Value calculation date and the Companys valuation date are aligned, the Board does not permit an adjustment to those valuations, unless there are significant restrictions applied to sale.
For unquoted investments, however, significant judgement is applied when calculating fair value.
The Board may consider adjustments to unquoted valuations as described above.
The range of possible adjustments could be broad and would vary based on the circumstances driving the adjustment.
In the past, the Board have adjusted valuation of unquoted companies by between 0% and 100% of the general partners proposed valuation.
For the purposes of sensitivity analysis, a 10% adjustment could be considered reasonable.
A 10% adjustment to the valuation of the unquoted constituents of the 10 largest underlying companies would result in an 2.8% movement in shareholders funds.
Investments in associates at fair value through profit or loss fair value 27,445,000 As described above the key inputs to the valuation of the investment in associate are the quantum of the future cash flows and the discount factor applied.
The Board has prepared the cash flows, which are based on dividends and the final payment under the option, using its best estimate at the reporting date and discounted these cash flows at 12%.
If the future dividends and option payment were to be 10% higher or lower over the remaining holding period, shareholders funds would increase or decrease by 0.2% accordingly.
If the discount factor were to be increased or decreased by 5%, shareholders funds would increase or decrease by 0.2% accordingly.

As a result of the Rights Issue and Placing, the Conversion Price was amended to 6.48 on 10 February 2009, in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of the convertible loan notes.
Following the Tender Offer completed in 2012 the Conversion Price was amended to 6.10.
The Tender Offer completed during the year was at a premium of less than 5% to the share price and therefore no amendment to the Conversion Price was required.
The convertible loan notes are convertible at the option of the convertible loan note holder.
They are not currently dilutive as the Conversion Price is above the Companys undiluted NAV per share.
As the convertible loan notes are subordinated to the Senior Notes and the loan facility, they are not counted as debt for the purposes of calculating the loan to value covenants for the Senior Notes and loan facility.

Capital management The Company allocates capital with the over-riding objective of maximising long term value for shareholders.
New investment opportunities must pass two hurdles.
The first is a level of return that enables SVG Capital plc to achieve its long term objective of 5.0% net outperformance of public markets.
The second is to be sufficiently attractive given the associated risk, relative to alternative uses of capital including deleveraging or returning capital to shareholders.
The Companys revolving credit facility limits the amount that may be returned to shareholders by way of share buy-backs or tenders to 20% of gross assets.

The fair value of equity-settled share options granted under both plans is estimated as at the date of grant using a stochastic model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The expected lives of the options under both plans are based on historical data and are not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
No other features of options granted under either plan were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.

The Group and Company diluted net asset values per share assume that share options and performance shares note 22 with a strike price lower than the undiluted net asset value per share are exercised at the balance sheet date.
This would result in the issue of 5,174,776 ordinary shares 31 December 2012: 8,634,675 for consideration of 942,000 December 2012: 617,000.
The convertible loan notes 2016 are exercisable at a strike price of 610p and were therefore not dilutive at 31 December 2012 or 2013.
Therefore, the calculation of the diluted net asset value per share of the Group is based on Group net assets attributable to equity shareholders of 1,220,825,000 31 December 2012: 1,073,588,000, Company net assets of 1,222,179,000 31 December 2012: 1,066,534,000 and on 237,292,216 31 December 2012: 274,409,709 ordinary shares in issue at the year end.

In addition, the Company holds money market instruments, cash and short-term deposits and various items such as debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations.
These financial instruments held by the Company are generally liquid.
The holding of securities, investing activities and associated financing undertaken pursuant to this objective involve certain inherent risks.
Events may occur that would result in either a reduction in the Groups net assets or a reduction of revenue profits available fordividend.
As an investment trust, the Company invests in securities for the long term.
The Company has not taken out any derivatives contracts to date, other than the interest rate swap and currency swap agreements referred to in note 20, which were executed to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates with respect to the Senior Notes in issue.
ASVGA entered into forward currency contracts, referred to in notes 19 and 20, which were used to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, since the majority of its fee income is euro-denominated but its ongoing costs are primarily sterling-denominated.
As disclosed in note 16 ASVGA left the Group on 31 May 2013.
Floating rate financial assets consist of cash at bank, short-term deposits and AAA-rated money market funds.
Allfinancial assets are included at fair value.
b Financial liabilities The Company had no 2012: 150.3 million nominal Senior Notes outstanding at the year end.
At 31 December 2012, the Company had a loan facility of 250 million which was split into two tranches.
Tranche A was a facility of 100 million with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and Unicredit Bank AG, which matured in January 2013.
The Company had 94.9 million nominal 2012: 92.8 million nominal of subordinated convertible loan notes in issue at the balance sheet date.
The level of borrowing will impact on the Groups performance by amplifying the effect of movements in the valuation of the investmentportfolio.
In addition to financial liabilities note 20, the Company also has uncalled fund commitments note 21 as at 31 December 2013 of 291.8 million 2012: 91.7 million, which are discussed below as part of borrowing and funding risks.
It should also be noted that fund investments and underlying investee companies may also utilise borrowings to varying degrees.
This is particularly the case with respect to CLO funds and structured private equity funds of funds, which are highly leveraged vehicles.

Gross settled derivatives are calculated based on the spot prices at the year end.
Financial liabilities maturity The maturity groupings are based on the remaining period from the end of the reporting period to the contractual maturity date.
When a counterparty has a choice of when the amount is paid, the liability is allocated to the earliest period in which the Group can be required to pay.
For loan facility drawdowns this will be within three months, although the amounts will be available to be re-drawn, subject to compliance with loan covenants.
For the purposes of this analysis it is assumed that outstanding loan amounts, if any, will remain drawn until the quarter-end prior to the expiry date of the facility, i. e. 30 September 2015.
Financial assets maturity Analysis of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss into maturity groupings is based on the long-term nature of these assets and, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is assumed that no distributions or realisations will occur within 12 months of the balance sheet date, although it is clearly possible that realisations will occur within that period.
Beyond that it is extremely difficult to judge the precise size or timing of such cash flows.
It is, however, a requirement under IFRS 7 to disclose such an analysis and therefore abreakdown is provided in the following table for illustrative purposes only.
It is emphasised that the analysis is provided purely to comply with accounting standards.
It is not a forecast and should not be construed as such.
It is based on broad assumptions, further details of which are provided below the table.
For other assets, the analysis into maturity groupings is based on the remaining period from the end of the reporting period to the contractual maturity date or if earlier, the expected date the assets will be realised.

In particular, it is very difficult to predict the quantum and timing of returns on the Groups long-term investment portfolio.
As already mentioned, it is important to note that the maturity analysis in respect of financial assets at fair value i. e. the investment portfolio is highly subjective and is not a forecast of the expected cash flows.
For the purposes of the maturity analysis it has been assumed that all financial assets will be realised at their year end carrying value.
The amounts receivable within three months are based on actual cash flows.
The residual balance has been allocated based on the current contractual maturities of the fund vehicle.
However in order to facilitate the orderly winding up of the investments, the terms of the funds may be extended beyond the contractual maturity date.
Similarly, underlying investments may be realised prior tothe contractual maturity date of the funds as investments are sold at timings deemed appropriate by the fund manager.
The Groups undrawn loan facility amounted to 207.5 million at 31 December 2013 and is subject to financial covenants as discussed in note 20.
92 SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2013 Notes to the accounts continued 29 Risk continued Uncalled fund commitments At 31 December 2013, the Group had uncalled fund commitments of 291.8 million, which are expected to be drawn over a number of years.
It should be noted that when these commitments are funded they will typically be used to make investments and therefore create an asset that would be expected to be realised for cash over the longer term.
The Groups uncalled commitments are more than covered by the year end cash balance of 210.0 million, and the 207.5 million loan facility maturing in December 2015.
Risks The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are considered to be commitment risk and valuation risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policy for managing these and other risks as summarised below.
The Directors consider that the risks faced by the Group are primarily those faced by the Company.
Borrowing and funding risks The nature of investing in buy-out and development capital funds entails making significant financial commitments, as shown in note 20.
At 31 December 2013, the Group had uncalled commitments of 291.8 million 2012: 91.7 million, compared to cash balances of 210.0 million 2012: 269.4 million and shareholders funds of 1,219.9 million 2012: 1,073.0 million.
The Company is a closed-ended investment trust and is therefore not subject to redemption requests from its investors.
TheCompanys shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
It is anticipated that over the longer term, and in normal circumstances, the Companys commitments to private equity funds and other financial liabilities will be financed by available cash resources and distributions received on the realisation of underlying investments within the fund portfolio.
To mitigate the risk that the timing of distributions being received does not match the timing of capital called for new investments, the Group has a 250 million loan facility, which was undrawn at31December 2013, that could be drawn on, subject to financial covenants as described in note 20, to meet fund commitments as theyfall due.
The Board monitors liquidity risk and, if considered appropriate, could renegotiate its lending arrangements or issue new securities.
The Groups investments are mainly illiquid but, in extremis, the Board could consider selective disposals of long-term investments, if required to meet commitments as they fall due.
In these circumstances it is possible, dependent on prevailing market conditions, that the realisation value of such assets could be at a significant discount to their previous carrying value.
The Company is in a relatively strong financial position but a residual risk remains that the Group could be unable to meet its future commitments in full.
If as a consequence of a failure to pay a call, the Company is treated as a defaulting investor to the relevant Fund, itwill suffer a resultant dilution in interest and possibly the compulsory sale of its interest.
A default on a fund commitment would also result in a cross-default on the Companys senior debt.
In December 2008 the Company agreed to reduce its commitment to Permira IV.
The total direct commitment by the Company to Permira IV was 2.4 billion, of which 57.1% has been called as at 31 December 2013.
The Company elected to cap its commitment at 60% of the total.
At 31 December 2013 the Company had an uncalled commitment to Permira IV of 69.8 million 2012: 77.0 million, which will only be called to finance follow-on investments and fees.
The terms of these arrangements require that future distributions from the realisation of portfolio companies receivable by those investors in Permira IV that elected to cap their commitments will be reduced by 25%, such benefit to accrue to the Limited Partners that did not elect to cap their uncalled commitments.
The Companys loan facility expires in December 2015 250.0 million and the convertible loan notes are repayable in 2016.
The Board manages liquidity risk by regularly and rigorously reviewing cash flow forecasts and available funding options.
Commitments to fund investments are reviewed by the Board.
Valuation market price risk The Companys exposure to valuation risk comprises mainly movements in the value of its underlying investments.
A breakdown of the Fund portfolio is given on page 27 and a detailed analysis of the 10 largest underlying companies is given on page 10.
In accordance withthe Companys accounting policies, set out on pages 60 to 64, all underlying investments are valued at fair value by the Directors inaccordance with the current International Private Equity and Venture Capital IPEV Valuation Guidelines.
The IPEV Guidelines contain detailed methodology setting out best practice with respect to valuing unquoted investments.
It should be noted that a large proportion of the Companys underlying investee companies are expected to be unquoted and therefore the valuation of such companies involves exercising judgement.
The Company does not ordinarily hedge against movements in the value of these investments.
Uncertainty arises as a result of future changes in the valuation of the Companys underlying investments, the majority of which are unquoted, and the effect changes in exchange rates may have in the sterling value of these investments.
Development-stage equity investments and early-stage equity investments, by their nature, involve uncertainty as to the ultimate value likely to be realised on the disposal of those investments, particularly as their unquoted nature means that a ready market may not exist for them.
As an indication of the valuation risk facing the Company, in 2013 the Group benefited from gains on its investment portfolio of 296.9 million 2012: gains of 146.3million.
Strategic report Corporate information Financial information Company information SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2013 93 29 Risk continued The Companys sensitivity to valuation risk will be affected by changes in the Companys levels of borrowing see note 20 and liquidity, asapproved by the Board.
It will also be affected by leverage in the funds in which we invest and the local currency denomination of such funds, which is considered separately under currency risk.
At 31 December 2013, a 10% movement in the valuation of the Groups aggregate investments designated as fair value through profit and loss would result in a 8.7% 2012: 9.5% change in Shareholders funds.
The Board manages valuation risk by reviewing and approving the valuation of the private equity fund portfolio.
Holdings risk In certain circumstances, the Company may wish to transfer its holdings in particular funds.
In a majority of the funds in which the Company will invest, the general partner, trustee or manager has the ultimate right, similar to that exercisable by a board of a private company, to refuse to register the transfer of an interest.
While the Company has no reason to believe that any request for the transfer of an interest would be refused, it is of course conceivable that the general partners, trustees or managers overriding fiduciary duty could result in it refusing to register a particular transfer proposed by the Company.
Concentration risk At present, the Company holds a significant proportion of its investments in private equity funds that are managed or advised by Permira.
At 31 December 2013, the value of the Top 10 largest underlying investee holdings represented 92.2% of the gross management buyout portfolio 31 December 2012: 91.4%.
The future performance of the Group in the short term will therefore be largely dependent on the future performance of the Permirafunds in which weinvest see note 30 for an indication of the Groups exposures.
Investors should also be aware that greater concentration of the investment portfolio presents a risk.
The performance of Permira funds depends to a significant extent upon the skills and experience of Permira and its personnel.
The continued service of these individuals is not guaranteed and there can be no assurance that key individuals can be replaced with equally skilled and experienced professionals by Permira.
Therefore, the departure ofone or several key investment professionals or partners at Permira may have an adverse effect on the performance of the Company and the value and trading price of the Ordinary Shares.
Each fund investment proposition is considered by the Board in accordance witha structured investment process.
This includes presentations from the manager of the proposed fund, extensive due diligence, consideration of the terms and conditions for investment in the fund, consideration of the Groups own cash flows and future commitments and a review of the effect of any such investment on portfolio concentration.
During 2012 the Companys shareholders passed a resolution to change the Companys Investment Objective to achieve wider assetdiversity and better flexibility in the management of the Companys cash flows.
Over time, the Company will evolve from aconcentrated, single manager investor to one that is more diversified, and will look to build on our Permira portfolio through commitments to a limited number of other leading private equity funds.
The Company may also make co-investments alongside funds.
Interest rate risk The Groups revenue will be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates since a large portion of its income ordinarily derives frommoney market instruments and bank deposit interest.
It also pays interest on its drawings on the loan facility that may be takenoutfrom time to time.
The Companys primary objective is to achieve capital returns from its investments and, as such, the main exposure to interest rate riskisindirect, through its impact on the valuation of the private equity funds, although it is not possible to quantify such effects.
Interestrates are one of the key determinants of economic growth.
At a more specific level, interest rates and credit spreads also have animportant role in the ability of private equity funds to secure profitable deals, as many transactions are partly financed by debt.
Theeffect of interest rate changes on the valuation of investments and debt forms part of valuation risk, which is considered separately.
At 31 December 2013, the Group held investments in AAA-rated money market funds valued at 172.6 million 2012: 179.8 million, earning interest at market rates.
The money market funds are redeemable on less than 24 hours notice.
Based on the money market funds held at 31 December 2013, a 0.25% increase in interest rates would generate additional annual interest income of 430,000 and adecrease in interest rates of 0.25% would lead to a reduction in annual interest income of 390,000.
Other floating rate financial assets comprised cash at bank or short-term deposits.
Based on the bank balances held at 31 December 2013, a 0.25% increase in interest rates would lead to an annual increase of 94,000 of interest income.
A decrease in interest rates of 0.25% would have no impact on annual interest income as the current interest earnings are negligible.
During the year, the Company repaid in full all outstanding Senior Notes.
Therefore, at 31 December 2013, the Group had no 2012: 150.3 million Senior Notes in issue and 94.9 million 2012: 92.8 million of convertible loan notes see note 20.
Interest rate risk on the Bonds is mitigated as they pay fixed rates of interest.
94 SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2013 Notes to the accounts continued 29 Risk continued Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group unless otherwise disclosed.
The Group is subject to credit risk on itscash and cash equivalents.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to cash and cash equivalents is represented by carrying value asat the balance sheet date.
The Groups cash and deposits are held with a variety of counterparties.
Cash equivalents at the year end comprised money market funds with a variety of counterparties, each fund having a credit rating ofAAA.
Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk directly since the majority of its assets and liabilities are denominated in foreign currency and their sterling value can be significantly affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
The Company does not normally hedge against foreign currency movements affecting the value of its investments, but takes account of this risk when making investment decisions.
TheGroup has a 250 million loan facility which, if drawn, would also act as a hedge against the currency risk on the value of its euro-denominated assets.
The Group had also issued Senior Notes of US$184.0 million, which were fully repaid during the year.
As described in note 20 the Company took out a currency swap to effectively convert $180.0 million of Senior Notes into a euro exposure, which acted as a partial hedge against the currency risk on the value of its euro-denominated assets.
The Group had no outstanding currency swap contracts at 31 December 2013, at 31 December 2012 a fair value asset of 2.4 million was recognised in respect of these.
The Group also entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate against movements in exchange rates.
These contracts were primarily to provide a cash flow hedge against euro-denominated investment management and advisory fees receivable by ASVGA and ASVGM in 2013.
Owing to ASVGA and ASVGM leaving the Group during the year, the total outstanding under such contracts at 31 December 2013 amounted to a sale of nil 2012: 33.5 million in exchange for nil 2012: 28.0 million.
A fair value gain of 0.1million 2012: loss of 0.9 million was taken to equity in respect of these contracts as a result of the appreciation of sterling against euro since the contracts were entered into.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the value of shareholders funds, the results of which are set out in the table below.
Hypothetical Hypothetical Equity value value shareholders 10% 10% funds depreciation appreciation million million million 31 December 2013 Equity shareholders funds 1,219.9 1,320.8 1,119.0 Change in shareholders funds effect on income 8.3% 8.3% 31 December 2012 Equity shareholders funds 1,073.0 1,161.5 984.4 Change in shareholders funds effect on income 8.2% 8.3% Capital risk management The objective of the Company is to provide shareholders with long-term growth in capital.
In pursuing this long-term objective, the Board has a responsibility for ensuring the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.
It must therefore maintain an appropriate capital structure through varying market conditions.
This involves the ability to: issue and buy-back share capital within limits set by the shareholders in general: and borrow monies in the short and long term.
Changes to ordinary share capital are set out in note 22.
Borrowings are set out in notes 19 and 20.
General risks associated with investment in private equity Investment in private equity involves a high degree of risk.
The Group invests in private equity through its exposure to buy-out and development capital funds.
Such investments are illiquid and as such may be difficult to realise, particularly within a short timeframe.
TheDirectors seek to maintain a diversified portfolio of investments to mitigate these risks, although the portfolio does remain concentrated with respect to private equity fund managers and also to vintage as explained in concentration risk on page 93.
Strategic report Corporate information Financial information Company information SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2013 95 29 Risk continued Default risk A funds documentation generally provides for certain penalties in the event that an investor in the fund fails to meet a call.
There istypically a grace period during which interest accrues on the unpaid amount.
If the default continues, the investor may become subject to various sanctions, including termination of the investors right to participate in future investments, loss of its entitlement to distributions or income but not its liability for losses or expenses, mandatory transfer or sale of its interest, continuing liability for the principal and interest in respect of the defaulted amount and partial or total forfeiture of the investors interest.
In addition, the general partner or manager may have other rights and remedies including legal remedies.
The investor may also remain liable for future calls in respect of the relevant fund as and when they are made.
There can be no assurance as to the price which may be achieved in any mandatory transfer or sale following a default on a call.
Certain funds give the general partner or manager the right to proceed directly to forfeiture proceedings following notice and continuation of default by an investor.
In the case of a forfeiture, the share of the fund held by the defaulting investor would generally be allocated among the general partner or manager and the remaining investors.
Inaddition, the investor may remain liable for the defaulted amount.
Consequently, any failure by SVG Capital to meet any call may have a material adverse effect on the value of SVG Capitals interest in a fund and or on the net asset value of SVG Capital and or on SVG Capitals ability to generate returns for its Shareholders.
In addition, a failure to meet a call may result in a cross-default under the Revolving Credit Facility which could result in a substantial loss.
If another investor or limited partner in a fund in which the Company holds an interest were to default on a call, this may result in the other investors including the Company in the fund in question becoming subject to individual calls of a larger amount but subject to each investors original capital commitment and, in addition, the fund in question may make fewer or smaller or more highly leveraged investments.
Any such occurrence may lead to a reduction in the diversification of the Companys interests in underlying portfolio companies, increase volatility, increase the Companys financing requirements and may have an adverse effect on the Companys business and prospects.
Investment holding period risk Investment in private equity requires a long-term commitment with no certainty of return.
Many of the investments made by the Group are illiquid holdings in buy-out and development capital funds and, in some cases, may not be capable of being realised in a timely manner or at all, dependent on prevailing market conditions.
The timing of cash distributions, if any, made by the buy-out and development capital funds is uncertain and unpredictable.
Prevailing market conditions may significantly influence a general partners ability to achieve exits.
Subdued market conditions may result in general partners delaying the sale of portfolio companies until conditions improve.
Moreover, certain exit routes may be more challenged in these conditions, such as the IPO route.
A fund managers ability to realise its interest incertain portfolio companies in whole or in part may be subject to contractual restrictions such as shareholder lock-up arrangements.
Itmay therefore be the case that the Company decides to pay calls with debt finance rather than relying upon receiving distributions from investments which it has made which may therefore increase the Companys borrowings and, in turn, risk and volatility for shareholders.
Disposals of a fund interest could have a long lead time since there is only a limited market for secondary sales of private equity investments.
Further, sales or other transfers of interests in buy-out anddevelopment capital funds sometimes require the written consent of the general partner of the fund, the granting of which is at its discretion.
Accordingly, the Group may not be able to sell its investments in buy-out and development capital funds attheir net asset value.
The Companys portfolio is concentrated with respect to private equity fund managers as explained previously and this may impact the ability to place a large holding of a single fund on the secondary market at any one time.
96 SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2013 Notes to the accounts continued 29 Risk continued Portfolio company risks Since the Company invests through private equity funds in portfolio companies, the risks experienced by the portfolio companies will closely affect the returns earned by the Company and the trading price and value of its Ordinary Shares.
The risks which the portfolio companies may experience, and the risks posed by an investment in such companies, include: these companies may be highly leveraged and subject to significant debt service obligations, stringent operating and financial covenants and a higher risk of default under financing and other contractual arrangements, which would lead to severe adverse consequences for the relevant portfolio company and the value of the Companys investment in such company if a default were tooccur: the valuations of highly leveraged companies are typically more sensitive to changes in value in public company comparable earnings multiples, declines in revenues, increases in expenses and interest rates and adverse economic, market and industry developments.
Therisk of loss associated with a highly leveraged company is generally far greater than for companies with comparatively less debt: they may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under their debt facilities, or to refinance debtfacilities when they fall due, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of their equity securities in which the Company is ultimately invested: they may require significant additional capital investment or operational or management support to improve their operations, financeexpansions or maintain their competitive positions.
Such investment and support may not be forthcoming: often, little public information exists about these companies and investors in these companies generally must rely on information obtained by the general partner, or other manager, of the relevant fund which holds the portfolio company: reliance is placed on the general partner as to the adequacy or accuracy of information provided during any due diligence exercise conducted prior to an investment being made.
The general partner, or relevant manager, of the fund in question may have made judgements concerning the materiality of contingent or actual risks or liabilities identified during due diligence that may not in practice turn out to have been accurate: the purchase agreements relating to the investment in question may contain only limited representations and warranties from therelevant vendors and these may be limited in, for example, time and amount.
Such contractual protection would typically not beaddressed to the Company directly and, in any case, there can be no assurance as to the ability of the relevant vendor to satisfy anyclaims which may be made under any such agreement: general operating risks arising from or being, amongst other matters, the cost of goods and services, difficulty in obtaining customers, losses arising from customer failure, market developments, competition risk, key man risk, foreign exchange risk, financing risks, anincrease in costs and the legal and regulatory framework within which the portfolio company operates: there are likely to be prior claims on the assets of portfolio companies from debt providers which would reduce the amounts earned by the equity holders including, indirectly, the Company: and lenders to portfolio companies may take actions which are adverse to the interests of the holders of equity interests in the portfolio company including, indirectly, the Company.
The value of the portfolio companies held by the funds in which the Company holds interests may be affected by uncertainties, such aspolitical developments, changes in government policies, regulations, laws, taxation, currency fluctuations, currency repatriation and other restrictions, in some of the countries in which the funds may invest.
The Company, directly or indirectly through the funds in which the Company holds interests, may also be exposed to these risks.
Passive investor with limited recourse The Company is generally a passive investor and has limited powers under the governing documents of the funds in which it holds interests.
The funds concerned are, within certain broad parameters, generally authorised to follow broad investment guidelines and, subject thereto, are able to invest in geographies, industries and investment opportunities at their discretion.
The Company does not review each proposed investment and is, subject to certain limited exceptions, unable to refuse to meet a call without suffering the consequences of a default.
There can be no assurance that the strategies adopted by Permira or other general partners or managers ofthe funds in which the Company holds interests will be successful or that the portfolio companies of such funds, or the Companys investments generally, will appreciate in value.
The Company also holds some investments in funds in respect of which associated undertakings are the general partner, manager and or adviser.
In these instances, fiduciary duties are owed by the associated undertakings to other investors which, together with the terms of the relevant fund management or advisory agreement, mean that the relevant members of the Group are unable to submit each proposed investment for review by the Company which will, therefore, remain a passive investor in respect of the relevant fund.
Strategic report Corporate information Financial information Company information SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2013 97 29 Risk continued The Company cannot make claims against general partners or managers of the funds in which the Company invests even in cases ofpoor performance except in very limited circumstances typically involving severe culpability on the part of the general partner or manager.
The Companys recourse in the event of poor performance of the funds concerned is highly restricted.
Removal of the general partner or manager of a fund generally requires a high level of investor participation and consent with the relevant threshold often being set so as to require the consent of holders of 75% of the capital committed to the fund in question.
The Company is unlikely tobeable to procure such participation and consent on its own and it may therefore be very difficult to remove a general partner or manager of a fund in which the Company invests such that the Company may potentially find itself locked into an under-performing fund.
The fund documentation relating to Permira IV contains no provision for the removal of the general partner or manager by vote of the limited partners save in circumstances involving severe culpability.
Even if those circumstances were to arise, which the Company considers to be unlikely, the consent of a special majority of limited partners would be required which the Company is unlikely to beable to procure on its own.
Once the Company has made a capital commitment to a fund, it may be difficult to terminate its participation or reduce its capital commitment even if the investment returns arising from that fund are poor or not competitive.
Outsourcing of investment advice Following the sale of 50.1% of ASVG to AAM, the Company now outsources all investment advice and associated services to an associated company.
As such, the Company does not have the same level of control over its investment advisers as it had prior to the sale.
The Company has a number of rights and protections under the terms of a shareholders agreement in respect of its holding in ASVG and has two appointees to the board of ASVG.
The Company is a key client of ASVG.
If the Company is dissatisfied with the performance of ASVG it can terminate the investment advisory agreement.
Regulatory risks The regulatory environment in which the Group operates is increasingly complex and the Group faces a number of regulatory risks.
Breaches of regulations such as the UK Listing Authoritys Listing Rules could lead to a number of detrimental outcomes and damage theGroups reputation.
Breaches of controls by service providers could also lead to reputational damage or loss.
Key regulatory risks havebeen identified and appropriate monitoring of such risks is undertaken regularly on behalf of the Board.
During the year three of the Companys subsidiaries ASVGA, SVGIM and ASVGM were authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.
As detailed in note 16 these companies were no longer part of the Group at the year end.
Certain other subsidiaries are regulated by foreign regulators.
There are a number of legislative initiatives to increase regulation of the alternative investments sector including private equity.
Suchlegislation has not been finalised, however there is a risk that such legislation, when enacted, could materially affect the business ofthe Company or its subsidiaries.
Taxation risk Any change in the taxation legislation or practice could affect the value of the Groups investments and as a result, its performance.
Abreach of Section 1158 of the United Kingdom Corporation Tax Act 2010 could result in the Group being subject to corporation tax on realised gains on the sale of portfolio investments which would have a material adverse effect on the net returns earned by SVG Capital.
However, the Group has strict controls in place to ensure that it complies with the requirements of Section 1158 and contracts with specialist tax advisers to provide advice on changes to tax regulation and practice.
However, there can be no guarantee in advance that the Company will satisfy the conditions for approval by HMRC as an investment trust under Section 1158 or that the Company will not become a close company, which would result in its being unable to qualify as an investment trust for tax purposes.
