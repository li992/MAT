Segmental information The Group has determined its operating segments based on the management information reviewed on a regular basis by the Companys board.
The Group considers the executive members of the Companys board to be the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The CODM currently considers the business to consist of broking businesses in EMEA, the Americas and Asia Pacific, a global electronic markets business active in fixed income interest rate derivatives and FX markets and a global post trade risk and information business.
Each of these five business areas are managed and reviewed by the CODM on a stand-alone basis and, as such, are considered segments.
The Group reviews the composition of the operating segments at the beginning of each fiscal year to determine whether they remain appropriate.
Any changes would result in restatement of the figures reported in the prior year for comparative purposes.
Revenue comprises commission from the Groups Global Broking business, brokerage or access fees from its Electronic Markets business and fees from the provision of post trade risk and information.
Global Broking Matched principal and stock lending business Certain Group companies are involved in a non-advisory capacity as principals in the matched purchase and sale of securities and other financial instruments between our customers.
Revenue is generated from the difference between the purchase and sale proceeds and is recognised in full at the time of the commitment by our customers to sell and purchase the security or financial instrument.
The revenue generated by the stock lending business is not material to the Group.
Agency business name give-up The Group acts in a non-advisory capacity to match buyers and sellers of financial instruments and raises invoices for the service provided.
The Group does not act as principal in name give-up transactions and only receives and transmits orders between counterparties.
Revenue is stated net of rebates and discounts, value added tax and other sales taxes and is recognised in full on the date of the trade.
Amounts receivable at the year end are reported as other trade receivables within trade and other receivables note 16.
For the shipbroking business, the Group acts in a non-advisory capacity to match buyers and sellers of services and recognises revenue, net of rebates and discounts, value added tax and other sales taxes when the Group has a contractual entitlement to commission, normally the point at which there is a completion of contractual terms between the principals of a transaction.
Execution on exchange business The Group also acts as a broker of exchange listed products, where the Group executes customer orders as principal and then novates the trade to the underlying customers respective clearing broker for settlement.
Revenue is generated from either the difference between the purchase and sale proceeds or by invoice, depending on the product, market and agreements in place with the customer and is recognised on the trade date.
Electronic Markets The Group acts as a broker for FX, interest rate derivatives, fixed income products and CDS through the Groups electronic platforms.
Revenue is generated from brokerage fees which are dependent on the customers global coverage and average trading volumes.
The Group also charges fees to use the electronic trading platform for access to liquidity in the FX or precious metal markets.
Post Trade Risk and Information The Group receives fees from the sale of financial information and provision of post trade risk and information to third parties.
These are stated net of value added tax, rebates and other sales taxes and recognised in revenue on an accruals basis to match the provision of the service.
The Group continues to disclose an operating segment for the broking business in Asia Pacific even though this segment does not meet the quantitative thresholds to be mandatory under IFRS8 Operating Segments.
This is to reflect the importance of the Asia Pacific region to the Group and the way the Group is managed.

Segmental information continued The Group did not earn more than 10% of its total revenue from any individual customer.
The Group earned revenue of 523m 2011 12 628m and 507m 2011 12 578m from entities in the UK and US respectively.
The remainder of 442m 2011 12 475m came from various entities outside the UK and US.
The amortisation and impairment arising from development expenditure recognised by the Group on a segment basis is as follows: EMEA Broking 7m 2011 12 7m, Americas Broking 2m 2011 12 5m, Asia Pacific Broking nil 2011 12 nil, Electronic Markets 11m 2011 12 16m and Post Trade Risk and Information 6m 2011 12 1m.

Earnings per share The Group presents basic and diluted EPS data for its ordinary shares.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for own shares held.
The Group also calculates adjusted EPS from the adjusted profit which is defined as profit from operations before the effect of acquisition and disposal costs and exceptional items.
The Group believes that this is the most appropriate measurement since it better reflects the businesss underlying earnings.
The Group is required to disclose basic and diluted EPS on the face of the consolidated income statement and has further analysed this to show the adjusted EPS.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue excludes the weighted average number of shares held as Treasury Shares of 18m 2011 12 11m and those owned by employee share trusts relating to employee share schemes on which dividends have been waived, being 6m shares 2011 12 4m.

The directors have proposed a final dividend of 15.4p per share for the year ended 31 March 2013.
This has not been recognised as a liability of the Group at the year end as it has not yet been approved by shareholders.
Based on the number of shares in issue at the year end, the total amount payable would be 99m.
The right to receive dividends has been waived in respect of the shares held in employee share trusts and no dividend is payable on Treasury Shares.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are significant items of a non-recurring nature and considered material in both size and nature.
These are disclosed separately to enable a full understanding of the Groups financial performance.
Transactions which may give rise to exceptional items are principally gains and losses on disposal of investments and other large gains and losses not attributable to the normal course of the Groups activities.
These are shown as exceptional items on the face of the consolidated income statement.

Contractual arrangements The Group places reliance on a number of key suppliers to carry out its business and has procedures to ensure that purchasing decisions balance cost against other factors including service quality, global reach and resilience.
The settlement of matched principal and exchange traded businesses requires access to clearing houses either directly or through third party providers of clearing and settlement services.
In North America the Group is a member of the FICC and NSCC through which it clears US Treasury products, agency, mortgage and equity trades for its customer base.
In Europe and Asia Pacific, with the exception of base metal clearing on LCH.
Clearnet Group Ltd, the majority of the Groups clearing activities are outsourced to third parties where ICAP seeks to partner with one of the leading clearing providers in each market.
ICAP plc Annual Report 2013 97 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 6.
Intangible assets arising on consolidation Intangible assets arising on consolidation include goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets such as customer relationships, brands and customer contracts that arose on business combinations since 1 April 2004.
The amortisation and any impairment is included in the consolidated income statement within the column acquisition and disposal costs.
The Group reviews the performance of the businesses and reassesses the likely period over which the acquired intangible asset is likely to continue to generate cash flows that exceed the carrying value.
As a result some businesses will have no impairment in a particular year while others will.
i Goodwill Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates and represents the cost of the acquisition in excess of the fair value of the Groups share of the net assets acquired.
Fair values are determined based on an assessment of the value of the individual assets and liabilities acquired, including reference to market prices, discounting expected future cash flows to present value or using replacement cost as appropriate.
Where the Group makes an acquisition and the balances are reported as provisional at the year end, the Group has a measurement period of up to 12 months from the date of acquisition to finalise the provisional amounts where new information becomes available about facts and circumstances that existed at the balance sheet date, which could impact the value of goodwill and intangible assets arising on consolidation.
The measurement period ends as soon as the information required is received.
Goodwill is initially recognised at cost and is subsequently held at cost less any provision for impairment.
Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested annually for impairment.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries and joint ventures is shown within non-current assets.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates is included within their carrying value.
On disposal of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the attributable goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal, except for goodwill written off to reserves prior to 1998, which remains eliminated.
ii Separately identifiable intangible assets The Group has recognised separately identified intangible assets on acquisitions where appropriate.
These generally include customer contracts and customer relationships.
Intangible assets acquired by the Group are stated initially at fair value and adjusted subsequently for amortisation and any impairment.
Amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation are recognised in the second column of the consolidated income statement.
Where an impairment has taken place, the asset is reviewed annually for any reversal of the impairment.
Any reversals of impairment are credited to the consolidated income statement.
All intangible assets have a finite life.
Amortisation of separately identifiable intangible assets is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Customer relationships 210 years Customer contracts Period of contract Other intangible assets Period of contract A deferred tax liability is recognised against the asset where the amortisation is non-tax deductible.
The liability unwinds over the same period as the asset is amortised.
iii Impairment Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indicator of impairment.
Goodwill and other intangible assets arising on consolidation are allocated to a cash-generating unit CGU at acquisition.
A CGU is the smallest segment on which it is practicable to report, each of which represents one of the Groups businesses.
Where the carrying value of the asset exceeds its value-in-use, an impairment charge is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement, and the asset is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
For goodwill, impairment charges previously recognised are not reversed and impaired intangible assets are reviewed annually for reversal of previously recognised impairment.
This process requires the exercise of significant judgement by management: if the estimates made prove to be incorrect or performance does not meet expectations which affect the amount and timing of future cash flows, goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired in future periods.

The other intangible assets at 31 March 2013 all represent customer relationships, and have remaining amortisation periods of three years EBS, four years Traiana and two years TriOptima.
As a result of the sale of a stake in Traiana during the year, the business was subject to a full external valuation which was in excess of the net book value.
For this reason, an annual impairment review of Traiana was not conducted.
Key assumptions Discount rates and growth rates The Groups long-term pre-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC remained at 11%.
For broking businesses in Asia Pacific and businesses outside the core interdealer broker franchise, such as ICAP Shipping, management has continued to add a premium to reflect local country risk based on the differential between local sovereign debt rates and the prevailing rates in the UK or the risk associated with the smaller scale of these businesses.
The premiums added to the Group WACC for each business are reviewed annually and, where these are deemed to be no longer necessary as businesses grow and integrate further into the Group these will be removed.
The long-term growth rates have been reviewed and the rates applied do not exceed the expected growth in the local economy GDP after the fifth year, or for businesses which operate on a global scale, the global GDP.

Intangible assets arising on consolidation continued b Impairment testing of intangible assets arising on consolidation continued Discount rates and growth rates continued The pre-tax discount rates and long-term growth rates used for impairment testing are as follows: Pre-tax Long-term discount rate growth rates % % Key budget assumptions 2013 2012 2013 2012 EBS Macro economic outlook New products and markets Technology 11 11 2 3 BrokerTec Macro economic outlook Regulation 11 11 3 3 Reset New products Market share 11 11 2 2 TriOptima Customer base Regulation 11 11 3 3 Impairment testing The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
The Group uses a five-year impairment model unless a longer period is justified.
With the exception of ICAP Shipping which uses a ten-year model due to its cyclical nature, all the Groups models are over five years.
The model uses pre-tax cash flow projections which extend forward to perpetuity using a terminal value calculation and which take account of the approved budget for the coming year and the following two-year forecast.
The forecast takes into account both the actions of the business and impacts associated with its external environment, such as regulatory reform.
Cash flows for years four and five rely on estimates of growth factors determined by the business.
The Group applies a suitable discount factor to the future cash flows based on its pre-tax WACC.
Long-term growth rates are used to forecast cash flows and do not exceed the expected growth in the local economy GDP after the fifth year, or for businesses which operate on a global scale, the global GDP.
As part of the impairment review, management considers current year performance against the budget and assumptions used in the prior year model.
Where results have varied, management has prepared an analysis to validate resulting differences.
Where applicable, management has looked to external support in the form of market activity reports to validate assumptions used in the models.
The value-in-use calculations are sensitive to changes in assumptions used in cash flow projections and, in particular, long-term growth rates.
Sensitivity analysis specific to each business has been performed on each of the base case models, considering possible changes to key assumptions used in the model.
While the models for BrokerTec, EBS, Reset and TriOptima showed no risk of impairment under the sensitivities performed, the headroom on the ICAP Shipping and Link models were either lower or more sensitive to changes in assumptions and are discussed further below.
Link ICAP acquired Link, a global equity derivatives broker, at the beginning of April 2008.
At the time of acquisition, Link held a strong market position as the leading global equity derivatives broker in a market which had expanded significantly over the previous five to seven years.
Since acquisition, the business has performed in line with the market, maintained its market leading position and remained profitable.
However, since the financial crisis broke, the equity derivatives market has contracted, with industry data showing no return to the growth levels expected on acquisition over the next five years.
These factors led to the impairment of the remaining goodwill by 23m to nil.
A separate impairment review of the intangible asset that represents the customer relationships acquired was also undertaken.
As a result of the contraction in the market along with a number of customers leaving the market altogether, these relationships are now considered to have limited prospects for future revenue generation.
These considerations led to the impairment of the intangible asset by 49m to a carrying value of 6m.
ICAP plc Annual Report 2013 10 1 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 6.
Intangible assets arising on consolidation continued b Impairment testing of intangible assets arising on consolidation continued ICAP Shipping Following the prior year impairment of 4m to the dry chartering operations of the business, market fundamentals continue to be challenging in this section of the business with little indication of prospects for improved freight rates over the coming period.
As a result, the remaining goodwill in the dry chartering business was impaired by 8m to nil.
Within the tanker wet operations of the shipping business, the outlook is more positive, with anticipated growth in demand from developing countries such as China and India.
The wet business is expected to remain profitable over the next three years and beyond, and the model for this business is relatively insensitive to changes in key assumptions as a result.
Ocean Tomo During the year, the use of the Ocean Tomo brand was discontinued.
As a result, the intangible asset relating to this brand has been impaired by 1m to nil.
Borrowings Long-term borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, being their issue proceeds net of transaction costs incurred.
At subsequent reporting dates long-term borrowings are held at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, with changes in value recognised through the consolidated income statement.
Transaction costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.

This bond was issued at par value and is presented on the balance sheet at amortised cost, net of fees of 1m.
Additionally, the Group has in issue $193m of guaranteed subordinated loan notes repayable in 2015 paying a coupon of Libor plus 1.95%.
The Group also has in issue 300m of five-year senior notes the Notes repayable in July 2014 with a coupon of 7.5%.
These Notes are shown net of both their original discount and fees of 1m 2011 12 1m directly attributable to the issue.
The carrying value of the Notes of 255m 2011 12 255m includes a fair value hedging adjustment to increase the carrying value by 3m 2011 12 5m increase relating to the mark-to-market of the interest portion of the Notes.
To enable the Group to manage the translational exposure which arises as a result of the Notes being denominated in euros and to meet its risk management objective of minimising both interest cost and the impact of interest volatility on its consolidated income statement, the Group entered into a number of cross-currency swaps to convert its obligations over the life of the Notes from euros to pound sterling at 1.16.
100m of the Notes have been swapped from a fixed euro-denominated coupon of 7.5% to a fixed pound sterling denominated coupon of 8.58% and the remaining 200m from a fixed euro-denominated coupon of 7.5% to a floating pound sterling denominated coupon of six month Libor plus 4.92%.
The fixed to fixed swaps have been accounted for as a cash flow hedge and at 31 March 2013 have a fair market value of 2m liability 2011 12 4m liability.
These swaps offset the effect of FX on the Notes, and so resulted in a nil charge 2011 12 nil being recognised in the consolidated income statement and a nil credit 2011 12 2m credit in other comprehensive income during the year.

Limited through which it borrowed JPY10bn.
The loan initially matured on 27 March 2013 at which time the maturity was extended to 27 September 2013.
The loan carries interest at a rate of six month Japanese yen Libor plus 0.8% resulting in a weighted average effective interest rate of 1.1%.
The Group has a $880m RCF incorporating up to a $200m swingline facility with a maturity date of 31 May 2014.
The drawings under the revolving credit facility as at 31 March 2013 were nil 2011 12 225m.
The facility carries a floating interest rate at Libor plus 2% with an additional 0.5% payable dependent on the debt to earnings ratio.
The weighted average effective interest rate for the year was 2.2% 2011 12 2.2%.
The Group continues to issue commercial paper under its 500m European Commercial Paper ECP programme, providing a diverse source of finance during the year for the Groups working capital and margin requirements.
At 31 March 2013 the Group had nil in issue 2011 12 21m.
The weighted average effective interest rate was 0.6% 2011 12 1.4%.
Bank overdrafts are for short-term funding and are repayable on demand, and are generally being repaid within a very short time period.
The Groups bank facilities contain a number of customary financial and operational covenants.
The Group remained in compliance with the terms of these covenants throughout the year ended 31 March 2013.
Under the terms of the Groups bank financings, the Company is required to remain as the ultimate holding company in the Group.
A change in ownership of the Company could result in the Groups three-year unsecured revolving credit facility becoming repayable.
The fair value of the short-term borrowings is not materially different from their book values.
c Liquidity risk management Group It is the Groups policy always to ensure that it has sufficient and appropriate financial resources to enable it to meet its financial obligations as they fall due, even under stressed conditions.
Under the terms of the investment firm consolidation waiver granted to ICAP by the Financial Services Authority, ICAP is precluded from undertaking proprietary trading, and consequently has limited exposure to liquidity risk when compared to a bank or other market risk taking financial institutions.

Of these, the most significant margin requirements arise in the US where, as part of its broking business, ICAP provides clearing services to customers and is required to deposit margin with the FICC and NSCC.
During the year to 31 March 2013, these deposits averaged $36m although following the introduction of a new clearing arrangement for US Treasuries at the start of February, balances have been significantly reduced in the last two months of the year.
Cash held at clearing houses, or a financial institution providing ICAP with access to a CCP, is disclosed as restricted funds in the financial statements see note 8 e. The Group has no other material margin requirements on a routine basis.
Trading entities of the Group use locally held highly liquid assets together with committed and uncommitted credit facilities to meet their forecast financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group has a centralised approach to the provision of contingency funding for its trading entities.
Through the GRACC, the board regularly reviews the liquidity demands of the Group and the financial resources available to meet these demands.
The GRACC ensures that the Group, in totality and by subsidiary, has sufficient liquidity available in order to provide constant access, even in periods of market turmoil, to an appropriate level of cash, other forms of marketable securities and committed funding lines to enable it to finance its ongoing operations, proposed acquisitions and other reasonable unanticipated events on cost-effective and attractive terms.
Therefore, to meets its liquidity requirements, the Group has maintained minimum core liquidity, in the form of cash and undrawn debt facilities, of $250m throughout the year.
At 31 March 2013, the Group had gross debt of 577m 2011 12 629m and cash and cash equivalents of 602m 2011 12 547m see note 8 c. It is the Groups policy only to hold cash necessary to meet local regulatory, commercial, settlement and short-term working capital requirements and for excess cash to be used to reduce gross debt.
Cash has increased from 31 March 2012 due to funds raised as a result of the issue of the retail bond and Japanese yen loan, the Groups cash generation and the fact that the RCF was undrawn.
The Group invests its cash balances in a range of capital protected instruments including money market deposits, AAA liquidity funds and government bonds with the objective of optimising the return, while having regard to counterparty credit risk and liquidity.
With the exception of some small, local cash management balances, surplus cash is invested with strong institutions which have an equivalent credit rating of A or better and are marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period.
Counterparty limits applied are reviewed by the GRACC in conjunction with the risk function.
At 31 March 2013, the Group had committed headroom under its core credit facilities of 580m 2011 12 324m.

As at 31 March 2013, the Groups long-term issuer default rating on senior debt was BBB by Fitch and Baa2 by Moodys.
On 30 January 2013, Moodys placed the Group on review for possible downgrade.
There has been no change in Fitchs rating during the year, which maintains a stable outlook.
Company The Companys policy is to ensure that it has constant access to an appropriate level of liquidity to enable it to finance its forecast ongoing operations, proposed acquisitions and other reasonable unanticipated events on cost-effective and attractive terms.
If the Company has any cash, it is loaned intra-group for further investment.
With the exception of the retail bond of 125m, all of the Companys financial liabilities are payable within three months.

Cash Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments which are subject to insignificant risk of change in fair value and are readily convertible into a known amount of cash with less than three months maturity.
The Group holds money, and occasionally financial instruments, on behalf of customers client monies in accordance with local regulatory rules.
Since the Group is not beneficially entitled to these amounts, they are excluded from the consolidated balance sheet along with the corresponding liabilities to customers.
Restricted funds are comprised of cash held with a CCP clearing house, or a financial institution providing ICAP with access to a CCP, and funds set aside for regulatory purposes, but excluding client money.
The funds represent cash for which the Group does not have immediate and direct access or for which regulatory requirements restrict the use of the cash.

The balance fluctuates based on business events around the year end and fell during the year by 13m to 37m.
Tax Tax on the profit for the year comprises both current and deferred tax as well as adjustments in respect of prior years.
Tax is charged or credited to the consolidated income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the tax is also included in other comprehensive income or directly within equity, respectively.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method, in respect of temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for reporting purposes and the amounts charged or credited for tax purposes.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rate of tax expected to apply when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and intangibles arising on consolidation, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
No provision is made in respect of any further tax liability that would arise on the distribution of retained earnings of overseas joint ventures and associates.
Deferred tax liabilities are offset against deferred tax assets within the same taxable entity or qualifying local tax group where there is both the legal right and the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Significant judgement is required in determining the Groups income tax liabilities.
In arriving at the current and deferred tax liability the Group has taken account of tax issues that are subject to ongoing discussions with the relevant tax authorities.
Calculations of these liabilities have been based on managements assessment of legal and professional advice, case law and other relevant guidance.
Where the expected tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were recorded initially, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax amounts in the period in which such determination is made.

Currency and interest rate risk management The Group uses various financial instruments as hedges to reduce exposure to FX and interest rate movements.
These can include forward FX contracts, currency options and cross currency swaps.
All derivative financial instruments are initially recognised on the balance sheet at their fair value, adjusted for transaction costs.
Where derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement, along with transaction costs.
Where they do qualify, gains and losses are recognised according to the nature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged.
Hedges are either classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
The fair values of the Groups derivative financial instruments are determined using appropriate valuation techniques from observable data, including discounted cash flow analysis, as no active markets with quoted prices exists for the instruments held by the Group.
The method of recognising the movements in the fair value of a derivative depends on whether the instrument has been designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the exposure being hedged.
To qualify for hedge accounting, the terms of the hedge must be documented clearly at inception and there must be an expectation that the derivative will be highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
Hedge effectiveness is tested throughout the life of the hedge and, if at any point it is concluded that the relationship can no longer be expected to remain highly effective in achieving its objective, the hedge relationship is terminated.
Fair value hedges: derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges when they hedge an exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability that is attributable to a particular risk that could affect the consolidated income statement.
The hedging instrument is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet, with changes in its fair value being taken through the consolidated income statement.
For periods in which the hedge is shown to be effective, the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item and is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Cash flow hedges: derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Groups exposure to changes in the cash flows attributable to a particular asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
Gains or losses on designated cash flow hedges are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, to the extent that they are determined to be effective.
Any remaining ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
On recognition of the hedged asset or liability, any gains or losses relating to the hedging instrument that had previously been recognised directly in other comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement of the fair value of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss in equity remains there and is recognised in the consolidated income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in other comprehensive income is transferred immediately to the consolidated income statement.
Net investment hedges: changes in the value of foreign denominated investments due to currency movements are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
The accounting treatment for a net investment hedging instrument, whether it is a derivative financial instrument or a recognised asset or liability on the balance sheet, is consistent with the aforementioned treatment for a cash flow hedge.
Gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are included in the consolidated income statement on the ultimate disposal of the foreign denominated investment.
The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
a Currency risk management Group The Group presents its consolidated financial statements in pound sterling and conducts business in a number of other currencies, principally the dollar and euro.
Consequently the Group is exposed to FX risk due to exchange rate movements which affect the Groups transactional revenue and the translation of the earnings and net assets of its non-pound sterling operations.
i Transactional exposures The Groups policy is for subsidiaries with pound sterling functional currency to hedge their main transactional exposures, which are the dollar and the euro, through a combination of forward FX contracts and options for up to two years forward.
A maximum of 100% of the forecast exposure is hedged for the first 12 months, 75% for the following six months and thereafter 25% up to a maximum of two years.
The Groups other transactional exposures are monitored and, where deemed appropriate, hedged for a period of up to 12 months forward.
ICAP plc Annual Report 2013 111 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 11.
Currency and interest rate risk management continued a Currency risk management continued Group continued The Group has contracts in place, designated as cash flow hedges under IAS39 where appropriate, with a total notional value of 75% of its forecast dollar transactional exposure for the year to 31 March 2014 at an average rate of $1.56.
Contracts with a total notional value of 75% of the Groups euro exposure for the year to 31 March 2014 are in place at an average rate of 1.21. ii Balance sheet translational exposures The Group is exposed to balance sheet translational exposures at the local entity level where the local consolidated balance sheet may contain monetary assets or liabilities denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency.
It is the Groups policy to hedge up to 100% of these exposures using a mix of foreign currency swaps and forward FX contracts and these are designated as hedges under IAS39 where appropriate.
Balance sheet translational exposures also arise on consolidation as a result of the retranslation of the balance sheet of the Groups nonpound sterling operations, principally dollar and euro, into pound sterling, the Groups presentational currency.
The Groups general policy is not to actively manage these exposures, as active management using instruments with a shorter tenure than the underlying net asset can give rise to a net cash outflow.
However, from time to time it will use forward FX contracts, cross currency swaps or non-pound sterling denominated borrowings to mitigate this exposure.
During the financial year ended 31 March 2013 the Group designated the subordinated loan notes, the dollar drawings on the RCF and an element of forward FX contracts swapping dollar receipts from drawing on the RCF into euros used to settle maturing ECP issuances, as a hedging instrument against the underlying dollar exposure.
As at 31 March 2013 this exposure was $1.0bn 2011 12 $1.3bn including intangible assets arising on consolidation, but before $0.3bn of hedging 2011 12 $0.6bn.
In accordance with IAS21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, the resulting translational exchange difference is included within the 49m exchange gain taken directly to reserves, as disclosed in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The Group does not have foreign operations whose functional currency is considered hyperinflationary and would therefore require adjusting to state all items in the measuring unit current at the reporting date.
The table below shows the actual impact on the Groups 2013 results of the movement during the year of the dollar and euro exchange rates in terms of transactional and translational exposure.

Currency and interest rate risk management continued a Currency risk management continued Group continued iv Derivative financial instruments It is the Groups policy to hedge a proportion of its transactional dollar and euro exposures with forward FX contracts.
Where these are designated and documented as hedging instruments in the context of IAS39 and are demonstrated to be effective, mark-to-market gains and losses are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and transferred to the consolidated income statement on recognition of the underlying item being hedged.

No amounts 2011 12 nil were recognised in the consolidated income statement in the year as a result of ineffective hedges.
Company i Balance sheet translational exposures The Company is exposed to balance sheet translational exposures where the balance sheet contains assets or liabilities denominated in a currency other than pound sterling.
While it is the Groups policy to hedge up to 100% of these exposures at Group level, at Company level these exposures can affect the Companys profit after tax.
At 31 March 2013, the Company had nil financial assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 2011 12 nil.
b Interest rate risk management Group The Group has an exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on both its cash positions and borrowings which it manages through a combination of pound sterling and dollar debt drawn on fixed and floating rate terms.
The Groups objective is to minimise interest cost and the impact of interest volatility on the Groups consolidated income statement.
In addition to debt, the Groups treasury policies also permit the use of derivatives including interest rate swaps, interest rate options, forward rate agreements and cross currency swaps to meet these objectives.
At 31 March 2013, after taking into account cross currency and FX swaps of the euro denominated five-year senior notes, the Group had 269m of cash, 171m of floating rate debt and 208m of fixed rate debt denominated in pound sterling, 245m of cash and 127m of floating rate debt denominated in dollars or currencies closely related to the dollar and 88m of cash and 71m of floating rate debt denominated in other currencies.
A 100 basis-points parallel increase in pound sterling Libor and Libid rates, which the Group considers to be an appropriate sensitivity measure, would increase profit after tax and other comprehensive income by 1m with a similar movement in dollar rates impacting profit after tax and other comprehensive income by 1m.
In the event that Libor and Libid rates diverge, by each additional 100 basis-points in pound sterling rate profit after tax and other comprehensive income would reduce by 3m.
An equal impact would result from the same movement in dollar rate.
The details of the interest bearing financial liabilities are disclosed in note 7.

Currency and interest rate risk management continued b Interest rate risk management continued Company Interest rate profile Since the 125m retail bond is at a fixed rate of interest, the Company is only exposed to interest rate movements as a result of issuance under its commercial paper programme and a loan from a subsidiary of 140m.
It is estimated that the impact of a 100 basis-points movement in interest rates would not have a significant impact on the profit after tax of the Company.
Financial assets The Company is owed 98m 2011 12 95m of non-interest bearing balances at the year end.
Financial liabilities The Company owes 429m 2011 12 68m of non-interest bearing loans to subsidiaries.

Intangible assets arising from development expenditure Development expenditure on software is recognised as an intangible asset in accordance with the provisions of IAS38 Intangible Assets.
Capitalised expenditure is recognised initially at fair value and is presented subsequently at cost less accumulated amortisation and provisions for impairment.
Amortisation of these assets is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic life of the asset of three to five years.
The Group reviews the useful economic lives of these assets on a regular basis.
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets arising from development expenditure is charged within operating expenses in profit before acquisition and disposal costs and exceptional items.
Amortisation is charged against assets from the date at which the asset becomes available for use.

These rates are determined on consideration of factors such as the expected rate of technological development and anticipated usage levels.
When a leasehold property becomes surplus to the Groups foreseeable business requirements, a provision is made on a discounted basis for the expected future net cost of the property.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the asset carrying amount and are included in the consolidated income statement.

Available-for-sale investments Available-for-sale financial assets are debt and equity non-derivative financial assets and are initially recognised at fair value.
Any subsequent changes in fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
When an investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, any cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised previously in other comprehensive income is transferred to the consolidated income statement.
These assets are generally expected to be held for the long term and are included in non-current assets.
Assets such as shares or seats in exchanges, cash-related instruments, and long-term equity investments that do not qualify as associates or joint ventures, are classified as available-for-sale.

Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value less any provision for recoverability.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments, are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of the future cash flows.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement within operating expenses.
When a trade receivable is determined to be uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against operating expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial instruments which have a fixed or determinable value.
They are recognised at cost, less any provisions for impairment in their value.
Fair value through profit or loss assets are designated as such where they meet the conditions of IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
They are recognised initially at fair value and any subsequent changes in fair value are recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.
These assets are usually held for short-term gain, or are financial instruments not designated as hedges.
The accounting policy for fair value hedges is included in note 11.
Matched principal transactions are those where the Group acts in a non-advisory capacity as principal in the commitment to purchase and sell securities and other financial instruments through two or more transactions between our customers.
Such trades have no contractual settlement date and are complete only when all sides of the transaction are settled, and therefore an aged analysis of matched principal trade receivables is not appropriate.
Substantially all matched principal receivables and payables settle within a short period of time, usually within three days of the trade date.
All amounts due to and payable by counterparties in respect of matched principal business are shown gross as matched principal trade receivables and matched principal trade payables note 17, except where a netting agreement, which is legally enforceable at all times, exists and the asset and liability are either settled net or simultaneously.
If, during the course of trading e. g. as a result of an error, any unmatched trades remain outstanding, the asset or liability is held within matched principal trade receivables or payables as appropriate and fair valued through the consolidated income statement until the trade is completed.
Deposits paid for securities borrowed represents the cash paid as collateral in a stock lending transaction.
The Group acts as an intermediary between our customers for collateralised stock lending transactions.
Such trades are complete only when both the collateral and stock for each side of the transaction are returned.
The gross amounts of collateral due to and receivable are disclosed in the balance sheet as deposits paid for securities borrowed and deposits received for securities loaned note 17.
The accounting policy for derivative financial instruments is included in the interest rate and currency risk management section note 11.
Financial instruments not held at fair value are impaired where there is objective evidence that the value may be impaired.
The amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the present value of any expected future cash flows, with any impairment being recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Subsequent recovery of amounts previously impaired are credited to the consolidated income statement.

During the year the Group introduced a new clearing arrangement for certain US matched principal transactions on a fully disclosed clearing basis, which provided the Group with the legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and settle on a net basis.
As such, certain matched principal trade receivables and payables note 17 were recorded on a net basis, which resulted in the significant downward movement from the 2012 position.
a Credit risk management The Group is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties in respect of its name give-up, matched principal, exchange traded and corporate treasury operations: the Group does not bear any significant concentration risk to either counterparties or markets.
The risk in respect of name give-up, post trade risk and information services businesses is limited to the collection of outstanding commission and transaction fees and this is managed proactively by the Groups credit control function: the exposure to credit loss is limited to the value of the receivable.
The matched principal business involves the Group acting as a counterparty on trades which are undertaken on a delivery versus payment basis.
The Group manages its credit risk in these transactions through appropriate policies and procedures in order to mitigate this risk including setting appropriate credit limits for all counterparts which are stringently monitored by the regional credit risk teams to restrict any potential loss through counterparty default.
The credit risk on core cash, cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments are monitored on a daily basis.
All financial institutions that are transacted with are approved by GRACC and internal limits are assigned to each one based on a combination of factors including external credit ratings.
The majority of cash and cash equivalents is deposited with financial institutions rated A or better by the major credit rating agencies.
81% of the Groups counterparty exposure at any given point throughout the year is to investment grade counterparts rated BBBBaa3 or above.
The Groups potential stressed counterparty credit risk calculated in the ICAAP is less than 5% of the total Group capital.

Share capital continued f Capital management ICAP maintains an efficient and strong capital base which maximises the return to its shareholders, while also maintaining flexibility and ensuring compliance with supervisory regulatory requirements.
The Group has a centralised approach to capital management.
The GRACC reviews the capital structure on a regular basis and, as part of this review, the committee considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
Based on the recommendations presented by the committee to the board, the Group balances its overall capital structure through the payment of dividends, new share issues and share buybacks, as well as taking on new debt or refinancing existing debt.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes borrowings note 7, cash and cash equivalents note 8 c and equity, including share capital, share premium, other reserves note 20 a and retained earnings.
At 31 March 2013, the Groups net cash was 25m 2011 12 net debt of 82m note 8 b. ICAPs global business is subject to consolidated supervision by the FCA under the terms of the CRD, in addition to a number of the Groups trading companies being subject to regulation in the jurisdiction in which they operate, principally by the FCA in the UK and the SEC FINRA in the US.
ICAP benefits from a BIPRU Investment Firm Consolidation waiver from the consolidated capital adequacy tests which has the effect of excluding goodwill from the capital computation and, in so doing, allows the Group to undertake acquisitions using debt rather than equity finance.
The terms of the waiver, which will fall due for renewal in April 2016, limits the Groups ability to incur market risk and, in effect, prohibits the Group from undertaking proprietary trading activities.
The Groups Pillar 1 regulatory capital headroom represents the difference between the capital resources of the Company, on a stand-alone basis, and the regulatory capital requirements of the Group calculated, in accordance with the requirements of the waiver, on an aggregate basis.
Pillar 1 headroom is approximately 0.9bn 2011 12 0.9bn and is relatively stable due to the low amount of market and credit risk in the Group, but may fluctuate due to the timing of dividends.
ICAP also evaluates at a Group and individual legal entity level the risks facing the business, to determine whether its capital is sufficient to cover any expected losses.
The Group uses a scenario-based model which utilises data provided by the business to assess the economic capital required to cover the expected risks.
The process followed at Group level is consistent with the CRD requirement for ICAPs FCA regulated entities to perform an ICAAP under Pillar 2.
The results for both are documented, updated and approved annually by the board and the UK regulated entity boards respectively.
As at 31 March 2013, the Group and each of its UK regulated entities had sufficient Pillar 1 capital to cover their identified risks.
All of the Groups regulated trading companies have complied with their regulatory capital requirements throughout the year.
The regulatory environment continues to change and, while it will impact how the markets work and who operates them, the Group does not expect, based on draft rules currently available, a material change to result in its capital structure.
In general, higher levels of market volatility result in increased demand for the Groups brokerage and post trade risk and information services.
From a regulatory capital perspective, however, the impact is significantly dampened by the fact that much of this incremental business occurs in markets which operate on a name give-up basis or are cleared through a central counterparty.
Therefore, we would expect any increase in activity to have limited impact on the Groups capital resource requirement and, as such, absent a material acquisition, loss of the waiver or a change in the basis of computation, existing capital resources are viewed as sufficient to both operate and grow the business.

Share awards Employee share schemes The Group awards share options and other share-based payments as part of employee incentive schemes.
The Group has applied IFRS2 Share-based payments for all such awards granted since 7 November 2002.
The fair value of services acquired is measured by the fair value of the shares or share options awarded at the time of granting and are charged to staff costs over the period the service is received on a straight-line basis.
A corresponding amount has been recognised in equity.
The fair value of share options awarded is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and takes into account various parameters, including the exercise price, current share price, risk free rate of return and the volatility of ICAPs share price.
The expected lives used in the fair value calculations are adjusted for the estimated effect of non-transferability and exercise restrictions.
A cancellation of a share award by the Group or an employee is treated consistently, resulting in an acceleration of the remaining charge within the consolidated income statement in the year of cancellation.
The total charge to the consolidated income statement in respect of employee share options in the year was 1m 2011 12 3m.
The fair value of options granted during the year was 7m 2011 12 8m.

Share awards continued Employee share schemes continued The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted.
Determining the value of a grant of equity instruments requires selecting an appropriate valuation model and estimating the required inputs to that model, including the expected life of the option, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them.
The following assumptions have been applied when calculating the fair value of the options granted in the year: Weighted Weighted Probability of average Expected average Average achieving market share dividend risk free Expected performance Vesting price volatility yield rate life conditions period pence % % % years % years 2012 SAYE 340.0 39 6.08 0.76 3.1 100 3 SEEPP UK 339.0 39 6.08 0.76 5.0 100 3 BSMP 339.0390.765.0 903 LTIP 339.0390.765.0 903 UCSOP 341.0396.080.767.0 1003 Estimated share volatility is a measure of the amount by which the Companys shares are expected to fluctuate during the life of an option.
The expected volatility is estimated based on the historic volatility of the share price over the past three years to the date of grant of the option.
On options where the employee receives a cash bonus in lieu of the dividend foregone the dividend yield is treated as nil and the fair value of the option is equal to the market value of the share.
i BSMP The BSMP is not approved by HMRC.
The BSMP is a long-term incentive plan where for years up to 2011 12 executive directors of the Company were required to waive 50% of their cash bonus in return for rights over the number of shares that could be acquired with the foregone bonus a basic award.
In 2012 13 the executive directors are required to use half of their cash bonus after tax to acquire investment shares.
A matching award of shares will also be granted with a value equal to half their pre-tax cash bonus.
The matching award will usually be released after three years if the executive director is still employed and has retained the investment shares purchased and to the extent the performance condition has been met.
BSMP awards promises were outstanding over 7,928,959 2011 12 6,567,521 ordinary shares.
These shares are exercisable between 2013 and 2020.
A credit of 1m 2011 12 1m charge has been taken to the consolidated income statement in respect of these options in the year, which includes a 2m credit relating to the 2010 and 2011 schemes as the performance conditions are not expected to be met.
ii Sharesave scheme SAYE The Save-As-You-Earn SAYE scheme is approved by HMRC.
The scheme enables directors and eligible employees to acquire options over ordinary shares of the Company at a discount of up to 20% of their market price using the proceeds of a related SAYE contract.
All UK employees who have worked for the minimum qualifying period on an invitation date are eligible to join the scheme.
Options granted under the SAYE scheme are not subject to performance conditions.
These options are all equity settled.
SAYE options were outstanding over 1,234,208 2011 12 2,460,915 ordinary shares for the 2010 and 2011 three-year grants at exercise prices of 288.0p and 379.0p per share respectively.

Acquisitions of subsidiaries The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of acquisition is measured at fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in the business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the costs of the acquisition are less than the fair value of the net assets acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.
Fees associated with an acquisition are expensed as incurred.
When the Group increases its investment in an entity resulting in an associate becoming a subsidiary, the intangibles related to the acquisition are valued and the element of those not previously recognised as a share of net assets are recorded as revaluation gains realised in the year in other comprehensive income.
A change of ownership that does not result in a loss of control is classified as an equity transaction, with the difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is recorded and the fair value of the consideration received recognised directly in equity.
Where the Group has issued a put option over shares held by a non-controlling interest, the Group derecognises the non-controlling interests and instead recognises a contingent deferred consideration liability for the estimated amount likely to be paid to the non-controlling interest on exercise of those options.
The residual amount, representing the difference between any consideration paid payable and the noncontrolling interests share of net assets, is recognised in equity.
Movements in the estimated liability after initial recognition are recognised within the consolidated income statement.
Where the Group has a call option over shares held by a non-controlling interest, the Group continues to recognise the non-controlling interest until it is certain that the option will be called.
At that point the accounting treatment is the same as for a put option.
a Acquisitions in the year During the year the Group acquired the following businesses, with the provisional numbers booked at 31 March 2013 disclosed below.
On 21 June 2012 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital in ICAP Securities and Derivatives Exchange Limited formerly Plus Stock Exchange plc Plus, the smaller company equity exchange based in the UK, for consideration of 0.5m.
The fair value of net identifiable assets and liabilities acquired on acquisition totalled 1.2m of net liabilities.
The difference between the fair value of consideration paid and net liabilities acquired of 1.7m represents goodwill relating to the acquisition.
Since acquisition the Group has consolidated 1m of loss after tax.
On 28 November 2012 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital in Global Research and Consulting Limited, known as ClientKnowledge, the leading optimisation firm specialising in FX, for consideration of 3.5m.
The fair value of net identifiable assets and liabilities acquired on acquisition totalled 0.1m of net assets.
The difference between the fair value of consideration paid and net liabilities acquired of 3.4m represents goodwill relating to the acquisition.
Since acquisition ClientKnowledge has been integrated into the EBS business.
b Contingent deferred consideration in respect of acquisitions A number of acquisitions made by the Group are satisfied in part by contingent deferred consideration.
The Group has re-estimated the amounts due where necessary, with any corresponding adjustments being made to goodwill for acquisition made prior to the adoption of IFRS3 revised Business Combinations.
For acquisitions made since the adoption of IFRS3 revised, any adjustments made to the contingent deferred consideration are made through the acquisition and disposals costs column of the consolidated income statement.
Included within contingent deferred consideration are amounts which are exercisable at certain dates in the future on put options written over shares held by non-controlling interests where the Group considers it highly likely that these options will be exercised.
At 31 March 2013 a deferred contingent consideration of 9m 2011 12 9m was outstanding.

Financial assets and liabilities continued b Fair value estimation The Groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value are financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, available-for-sale investments and derivative financial instruments.
Instruments included in level 1 are traded in active markets and valued at quoted market prices available in open markets.
The fair value of a financial instrument that is not traded in an active market is determined using a valuation technique, for example derivative financial instruments.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where available and rely as little as possible on entity specific items.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
If one or more of the significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.
Both level 2 and level 3 valuations require significant management judgements.
The following table presents the Groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value as at 31 March 2013.

During the year the lease on the Groups UK headquarters was extended to June 2019 with an option to extend for a further 30 months.
Contingent liabilities Group a Several government agencies in North America and Europe, including the US CFTC, the US Department of Justice, the FCA formerly the Financial Services Authority and the European Commission, continue to conduct investigations in to past submissions made by panel members to the bodies that set various interbank reference rates notably Libor.
The conclusions of enforcement action by certain regulators against three banks that were members of the relevant panels and therefore set Libor, have been publicly reported.
Such action included significant financial penalties and undertakings to improve the methodology by which Libor submissions are derived.
Neither ICAP, nor any of its subsidiaries, either were at the relevant time or are now members of the panels that submit data used to set Libor, nor does any ICAP broking company itself trade in any Libor-referencing product that it brokers.
However, certain subsidiaries of ICAP's Global Broking division are involved in broking cash deposits and the fixed price component of derivatives that refer to Libor between banks, including members of the relevant panels, and in the course of doing so may receive and communicate information to banks about Libor and Libor-related instruments and trading activity.
In certain of the enforcement actions taken against the banks, regulators have included allegations that certain employees of up to six interdealer brokers, which are not named, may have acted improperly with regard to Liborrelated information shared with banks.
One of the Groups Global Broking subsidiaries has been formally notified that it is the subject of an FCA investigation and, in addition, ICAP companies have been requested to provide regulators and other government agencies with a variety of information connected to the investigations referred to above.
ICAP is co-operating fully with such regulators and government agencies, including the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the US CFTC.
It is not practicable to predict the scope and ultimate outcomes of any investigations or to provide an estimate of any potential financial impact on the Group.
In addition, ICAP plc has recently been added as a named defendant to an existing civil litigation originally filed in April 2012 against certain yen Libor and euro-yen Tibor panel banks in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.
The complaint alleges the plaintiff was injured as a result of purported manipulation of yen Libor and or euro-yen Tibor by trading euro-yen Tibor futures contracts, one component of the underlying calculation of which refers to yen Libor or euro-yen Tibor.
It is not practicable to determine the final outcome of this litigation or to provide an estimate of any potential financial impact on the Group, but ICAP intends to defend it vigorously.
b From time to time the Group is engaged in litigation in relation to a variety of matters, and is also frequently required to provide information to regulators and other government agencies as part of informal and formal inquiries or market reviews.
It is not practicable to quantify the extent of any potential liabilities, but currently there are none expected to have a material adverse impact on the Groups consolidated results or net assets.
c in the normal course of business certain Group companies enter into guarantees and indemnities to cover clearing and settlement arrangements and or the use of third party services or software.
