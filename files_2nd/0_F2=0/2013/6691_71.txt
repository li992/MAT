A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 24% to 23% came into effect on 1 April 2013.
Finance Bill 2013 was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013 and given Royal Assent on 17 July 2013, giving effect to a 21% rate effective from 1 April 2014 and 20% rate effective from 1 April 2015.
As the 21% and 20% rates had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date they have no effect on current or deferred tax liabilities in these accounts.
However, as the 23% rate was substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, this rate has been applied to the deferred tax liabilities assets at the year end.
If the reduction to 20% had been enacted by 29 June 2013 the Groups deferred tax liability would have been reduced by a further 6.8m to 45.7m and the deferred tax asset would have been reduced by a further 1.4m to 9.6m.
