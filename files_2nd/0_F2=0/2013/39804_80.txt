124 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2013 21.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUES CATEGORIES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Financial assets in the Group comprise interest rate swaps, foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swap contracts which are categorised as derivatives designated as fair value through the income statement non-hedge and forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swap contracts designated as net investment hedges.
Financial assets also include trade and other receivables, finance lease receivables, available-for-sale investments and cash and cash equivalents, which are all classified as other financial assets.
Financial liabilities in the Group comprise interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts, and cross currency swap contracts which are categorised as fair value through the income statement non-hedge.
Financial liabilities also include secured bank loans and unsecured bond issues which are categorised as debt and initially recognised at fair value less costs and subsequently at amortised cost: and trade and other payables, provisions and current tax liabilities, which are classified as other financial liabilities.
The carrying values of these financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair value, with the exception of unsecured bond issues.
At 31 December 2013 the fair value of 1,691.9 million of unsecured bonds issued was 1,950.4 million 2012: 1,689.1 million compared with 1,992.0 million fair value.
Further, at 31 December 2012 the fair value of 41.0 million of secured bank debt was 41.1 million.
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: Forward foreign exchange contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
Interest rate swaps and currency swap contracts are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates and the appropriate exchange rate at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities traded on active liquid markets is determined with reference to the quoted market prices.
Unlisted investments, such as those classified as available-for-sale investments, are typically valued by the Fund Manager based on the amount at which the asset would be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arms length transaction.
The methodology used to estimate fair value will depend on the nature and facts and circumstances of the investment but will use one of the following bases: transaction value, earnings multiple, net assets, price of recent investment and sale price, where appropriate a marketability discount will be applied.
Financial guarantees are issued by the Company to support bank borrowings of 100 per cent owned subsidiary companies domiciled overseas.
The face value of these borrowings is already included in the Group balance sheet.
As the borrowing entity will have unencumbered directly owned property assets exceeding the value of the guaranteed borrowings, the probability of the Parent entity having to recognise any loss in respect to these guarantees is considered to be highly unlikely.
Hence no fair value liability has been ascribed to these guarantees in the accounts of the Parent entity.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS RECOGNISED IN THE BALANCE SHEET The Group and Company financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are available-for-sale investments, forward exchange and currency swap contracts and interest rate swaps as detailed in notes 17, 18 and 19.
All of these financial instruments would be classified as level 2 fair value measurements, as defined by IFRS 13, being those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
There were no transfers between categories in the current or prior year.
CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern and as such it aims to maintain a prudent mix between debt and equity financing.
The current capital structure of the Group consists of a mix of equity and debt.
Equity comprises issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the statement of changes in equity and notes 23 to 25.
Debt primarily comprises longterm debt issues and drawings against medium-term committed revolving credit facilities from banks as disclosed in note 20.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUES CONTINUED FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT The Group does not have any regular transactional foreign currency exposures as it does not have any regular business involving cross border currency flows.
However, it does have operations in Continental Europe which transact business denominated mostly in euros.
Hence there is currency exposure caused by translating the local trading performance and local net assets into sterling for each financial period and at each balance sheet date.
The Groups approach to managing balance sheet translation exposure is described in the Foreign Currency Translation Exposure section in the Financial Review on page 55.
The Groups balance sheet translation exposure including the impact of derivative financial instruments is summarised below: 2013 2012 EUROS US DOLLARS TOTAL EUROS US DOLLARS TOTAL m m m m m m GROUP Gross currency assets 1,248.3 25.2 1,273.5 1,651.6 27.4 1,679.0 Gross currency liabilities 978.6 17.2 995.8 1,387.9 17.7 1,405.6 NET EXPOSURE 269.7 8.0 277.7 263.7 9.7 273.4 COMPANY Gross currency assets 849.2 13.8 863.0 1,242.8 13.2 1,256.0 Gross currency liabilities 1,037.4 31.0 1,068.4 1,268.6 30.9 1,299.5 NET EXPOSURE 188.2 17.2 205.4 25.8 17.7 43.5 2013 gross currency liabilities include EUR225.8 million 188.2 million and USD28.6 million 17.2 million designated as net investment hedges.
2012 gross currency liabilities include EUR31.8 million 25.9 million and USD28.6 million 17.7 million designated as net investment hedges.
The remaining gross currency liabilities of the Group shown in the table above that are not designated as net investment hedges are either held directly in a euro or US dollar functional currency entity or passed down to such an entity from a sterling functional currency company through intercompany funding arrangements.
FOREIGN CURRENCY SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The Groups main currency exposure is the euro.
The blended sensitivity of the net assets of the Group to a 5 per cent change in the value of sterling against the relevant currencies is 13.2 million 2012: 13.6 million, with a sensitivity of 12.8 million against the euro 2012: 12.6 million and 0.4 million against the US dollar 2012: 1.0 million.
For the Company, the blended sensitivity is 10.7 million 2012: 2.0 million with a sensitivity of 9.9 million against the euro 2012: 1.2 million and 0.8 million against the US dollar 2012: 0.8 million.
FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CURRENCY SWAP CONTRACTS Some of the forward foreign exchange and currency swap contracts held by the Group are designated as net investment hedges of euro and US dollar denominated subsidiaries, where exchange differences are booked in reserves and recognised in the income statement when the operation is sold.
The remaining forward foreign exchange and currency swap contracts are effectively economic cash flow hedges, using the surplus cash in one currency to fund paying off debt in another currency.
These have not been designated as hedges and as a consequence their change in fair value is taken through the income statement.

The risk is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings.
The current Group policy states that 50 to 100 per cent of net borrowings should be at fixed rate provided by long-term debt issues attracting a fixed coupon or from floating rate bank borrowings converted into fixed rate or hedged via interest rate swaps, forwards, caps, collars or floors or options on these products.
Hedging activities require the approval of the Finance Committee and are evaluated and reported on regularly to ensure that the policy is being adhered to.
The Board reviews the policy on interest rate exposure annually with a view to establishing that it is still relevant in the prevailing and forecast economic environment.
INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 1 per cent increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 1 per cent higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 31 December 2013 would decrease increase by 6.8 million 2012: decrease increase by 6.0 million.
This is attributable to the Groups exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings and cash deposits.
Fixed rate debt issues are held at amortised cost and are not re-valued in the balance sheet to reflect interest rate movements.
INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to manage the interest rate risk of the Groups borrowings.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.

The interest rate swaps settle on either a three-month or six-month basis with the floating rate side based on the EURIBOR or sterling LIBOR rate for the relevant period.
The Group will settle or receive the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUES CONTINUED CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Potential customers are evaluated for creditworthiness and where necessary collateral is secured.
There is no concentration of credit risk within the lease portfolio to either business sector or individual company as the Group has a diverse customer base with no one customer accounting for more than 5 per cent of rental income.
Trade receivables which include unpaid rent and amounts receivable in respect of property disposals were approximately 1 per cent of total assets at 31 December 2013 and at 31 December 2012.
The Directors are of the opinion that the credit risk associated with unpaid rent is low.
In excess of 95 per cent of rent due is generally collected within 21 days of the due date.
AGEING OF PAST DUE BUT NOT IMPAIRED RECEIVABLES WERE AS FOLLOWS: 2013 2012 m m 030 days 4.4 9.0 3060 days 0.7 2.6 6090 days 0.5 2.1 90180 days 0.7 0.4 180 days 0.6 1.0 Past due but not impaired 6.9 15.1 Not due 14.2 26.3 TOTAL TRADE RECEIVABLES 21.1 41.4 No other receivables were considered impaired or overdue.
Investment in financial instruments is restricted to banks and short-term liquidity funds with a good credit rating.
Derivative financial instruments are transacted via International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA agreements with counterparties with a good investment grade credit rating.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread among approved counterparties.
LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by having a policy that requires that adequate cash and committed bank facilities remain available to cover and match all debt maturities, development spend, trade related and corporate cash flows forward over a rolling 18-month period.
This is achieved by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Liquidity risk management is discussed in more detail in the Liquidity Position and Going Concern sections in the Financial Review on pages 54 and 55.
