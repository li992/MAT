The Directors note that following the impairments recognised Bozymchak in 2013, the deficit between the Groups net asset value and its During the year ended 31 December 2012, Kazakhmys Mining market capitalisation remains significant.
This deficit is largely due recognised a $162 million impairment charge in respect of the to the fact that under accounting standards, the carrying value Bozymchak project in Kyrgyzstan.

Segment information Information provided to the Groups Board of Directors for the purposes of resource allocation and the assessment of segmental performance is prepared in accordance with the management and operational structure of the Group.
For management and operational purposes, the Group is organised into three separate businesses as shown below, according to the nature of their operations, endproducts and services rendered.
Each of these business units represents an operating segment in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating segments.
The operating segments of the Group are: Kazakhmys Mining The Kazakhmys Mining business is managed as one operating segment and comprises all entities and functions within the Group responsible for the exploration, evaluation, development, mining and processing of the Groups mineral resources and sale of the Groups metal products.
The segment consists of: the Groups main operating entity, Kazakhmys LLC, whose principal activity is the mining and processing of copper and other metals which are produced as by-products: the Groups smelting operations, Kazakhmys Smelting LLC, whose principal activity is the refining of copper and other metals which are produced as by-products by Kazakhmys LLC: the Groups UK trading function, Kazakhmys Sales Limited, which is responsible for the purchase of exported products from Kazakhmys LLC and subsequently applies an appropriate mark-up prior to onward sale to third parties.
The UK entity is a sales function on behalf of the Kazakhmys Mining business and consequently the assets and liabilities related to those trading operations, i. e. trade payables and trade receivables, are included within the Kazakhmys Mining operating segment: the Groups exploration companies which provide services for greenfield drilling on new projects and deposits, brownfield drilling on expansion projects and deposits at existing mines, and exploration work for potential new projects and deposits for the Mining segment: the Groups project companies, whose responsibility is the development of metal production related assets on behalf of the Mining segment including the evaluation and development of the Groups major mining projects: and the Groups technical and ancillary services which provide technical, logistics and other services principally to the Mining segment and which are managed as an extension of the Mining segment.
The financial and operating information used by the Board of Directors for the purpose of resource allocation to all these separate functions and entities is included within the Mining segment.
Kazakhmys Power Kazakhmys Power operates in Kazakhstan and consists of the Groups three captive power stations and the Ekibastuz GRES-1 coal-fired power station joint venture.
The principal activity of the Kazakhmys Power operating segment is the sale of electricity and coal to external customers and internally to the Kazakhmys Mining segment.
The captive power stations and the Groups 50% interest in the Ekibastuz GRES-1 coal-fired power station are managed by the same management team and produce discrete financial and operating information that is used by the Board of Directors for operational and resource allocation decisions.
On 5 December 2013 the Groups Board of Directors accepted an offer to sell the 50% interest in Ekibastuz GRES-1 and the Groups investment in Kaz Hydro.
The offer was approved by Kazakhmys shareholders on 7 January 2014 with completion dependent on certain conditions precedent.
As a result, Ekibastuz GRES-1and Kaz Hydro have been classified as assets held for sale with Ekibastuz GRES-1 classified as a discontinued operation at 5 December 2013.
The share of profits from Ekibastuz GRES-1 for the period ended 5 December 2013 is now recognised within discontinued operations in the consolidated income statement.
The consolidated income statement for the comparative period has been restated to conform to this presentation.
MKM MKM operates in Germany, where it manufactures copper and copper alloy semi-finished products.
The business was sold on 28 May 2013.
At 31 December 2012, MKM was classified as an asset held for sale and as a discontinued operation.
MKM faced different risks to the Groups other businesses, and produced different products.
It was therefore shown as a separate operating segment.
Managing and measuring operating segments The key performance measure of the operating segments is EBITDA excluding special items, which is defined as profit before interest, taxation, depreciation, depletion, amortisation, the non-cash component of the disability benefits obligation and mineral extraction tax, as adjusted for special items.
Special items are those items which are non-recurring or variable in nature and which do not impact the underlying trading performance of the business see note 6.
The Groups Treasury department monitors finance income and finance costs at the Group level on a net basis rather than on a gross basis at an operating segment level.
Inter-segment sales include power sales from Kazakhmys Power to Kazakhmys Mining from the Groups captive power stations, and coal sales from Kazakhmys Mining to Kazakhmys Power from the Borly coal mines.

3 The non-cash component of the Groups disability benefits obligation has been excluded from EBITDA as EBITDA, a key financial indicator, is a proxy for cash earnings from current trading performance.
The non-cash component of the disability benefits obligation is determined as the actuarial remeasurement charge recognised in the income statement less the actual cash payments disbursed during the year in respect of the disability benefits obligation.
4 Mineral extraction tax has been excluded from the key financial indicator of EBITDA.
The Directors believe that MET is a substitute for a tax on profits, hence its exclusion provides a more informed measure of the operational performance of the Group.
5 The share of EBITDA of the associate excludes MET and special items of the associate.

Year ended 31 December 2013 a Kazakhmys Mining Zhezkazgan Region cash generating unit CGU impairment review In light of the decline in the price of commodities produced by the Group and inflationary pressures on operating costs, the Group commenced an optimisation programme and asset review which has resulted in operating cost and capital expenditure savings.
The asset review has considered the results of the optimisation programme to date, and the potential for future savings, when assessing the future economic outlook for assets.
The prospects for the Zhezkazgan Region, a CGU within Kazakhmys Mining, are considered challenging.
The recoverable amount of the Zhezkazgan Region CGU is believed by management to be significantly lower than its carrying value such that an impairment charge of $575 million has been recognised, including $98 million of deferred taxes written off.
The impairment charge has reduced the carrying value of the Zhezkazgan CGU to nil.
The recoverable amount of the Zhezkazgan Region has been determined based on the fair value less costs to sell calculations using the cash flows expected to be generated from existing operations and certain development projects, in particular Zhomart II.
Cash flows are projected for periods up to the date that mining, refining and power generation is expected to cease based on managements current expectations.
For current operations, the completion dates are based on recent assessments of the reserves and resources available and annual ore extraction rates.
The key assumptions used in the recoverable amount calculations are: Recoverable amount of reserves and resources Economically recoverable reserves and resources are based on managements expectations and the technical studies and exploration and evaluation work undertaken by in-house and third party specialists.
Commodity prices Long-term commodity prices assumed fall within the range of external market analyst consensus.
Operating costs Variable operating costs have been included in the impairment test as a function of the related production volumes.
Fixed costs at the mines, concentrators and smelters are largely constant but reflect material changes in activity levels.
Discount rate A discount rate of 16% was used in the recoverable amount calculations, which represents the pre-tax rate that reflects the Groups current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash generating unit.
Timing of capital expenditure Management have estimated the timing of capital expenditure on the development projects based on the Groups current and future financing plans and the results of technical studies completed to date.
Inflation and exchange rates These are based on a combination of externally sourced forecasts and rates determined from information available in the market after considering long-term market expectations.
The calculation of the fair value less costs to sell of the Groups CGUs for the impairment review at 31 December 2013 provided a range of outcomes as the calculation is particularly sensitive to changes in commodity prices, operating cost inflation, capital expenditure and the discount rate used.
Any changes to the assumptions adopted in the calculation of the fair value less costs to sell, individually or in aggregate, would result in a different valuation being determined.
b Kazakhmys Mining impairment charges against property, plant and equipment The impairment charges recognised against property, plant and equipment include $325 million related to the impairment of the Zhezkazgan Region CGU, the impairment of certain production assets during the year, principally the Zhezkazgan smelter, Satpayev concentrator and associated assets of $115 million and a number of mid-sized projects that were suspended during the year as a result of the Groups asset review of $33 million.
In addition, following the suspension of the Berezovsky concentrator in the East Region in the second half of the year, an impairment charge of $8 million has been recognised.
124 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial St Financial Stat atements ements For more information see pages xx Lorem ipsum xx Lorem ipsum xx Lorem ipsum xx Lorem ipsum c Kazakhmys Mining impairment charges against mining assets Following the Groups asset review discussed above, the Zhezkazgan Region CGU was impaired resulting in charges of $139 million being recognised against mining assets.
In addition, certain mid-sized projects within Kazakhmys Mining have been suspended leading to impairments of $5 million being recognised against mining assets.
d Kazakhmys Mining inventories Included within the provisions against inventories is an impairment charge of $4 million relating to specialised consumable inventories at the suspended Zhezkazgan smelter and $7 million 2012: release of $1 million relating to general slow moving and obsolete inventory.
Only impairment charges or reversals recognised against ore, specific consumables and finished goods inventories are treated as special items see note 6. e Kazakhmys Mining other assets The impairment of other assets mainly relates to the allocation of the impairment charge recognised in respect of the Zhezkazgan Region CGU, as discussed in note 8 a, in accordance with IAS 36 on a proportionate basis.
This impairment charge is in addition to $20 million of other asset impairments recognised at 30 June 2013. f Kazakhmys Mining trade and other receivables Provisions against trade and other receivables include an amount of $12 million 2012: $4 million within Kazakhmys Mining in respect of trust activities.
Under the terms of its subsoil licences, Kazakhmys LLC is required to provide certain social services to the communities in which its mining activities operate.
These trust activities are provided by municipal authority companies under trust management agreements.
For most receivable balances due from municipal authorities full provision is recognised in light of their past payment histories.
Year ended 31 December 2012 g Kazakhmys Mining impairment charges against property, plant and equipment and mining assets During 2012, the Bozymchak gold copper development project, included in the Kazakhmys Mining Division, was subject to an impairment review due to difficulties experienced in operating in Kyrgyzstan.
The impairment review assumed a revised date for commercial production, additional capital costs and re-assessed the risks associated with the projects execution.
As a result, the Group recognised an impairment charge of $162 million against the mining assets and property, plant and equipment of the Bozymchak project.
The impairment charge reduced the carrying value of the Bozymchak project to its recoverable amount of $106 million, determined as its value-in-use on a discounted cash flow basis.
The charge of $162 million was recorded against tangible assets mining assets $71 million and property, plant and equipment $91 million with an associated deferred tax credit of $13 million.
The cash flow forecasts were discounted at a pre-tax rate of 16%.
The impairment charge against property, plant and equipment also includes $11 million relating to transportation infrastructure owned by the Group following a change in the intended use of the assets and a reassessment of their future cash flows.
In addition, during 2012 mining assets of $11 million were impaired which relate to the Kazakhmys Mining segment.
Of this total, $7 million relates to the write-down of the assets attributable to the Nikolayevsky mine which was suspended in August 2012 as it was no longer considered economically viable to operate this mine.
h Discontinued operations Within discontinued operations impairment charges were recognised to write down the carrying values of MKM and ENRC to their fair value less costs to sell.
MKM was impaired by $22 million 2012: $17 million and ENRC by $823 million 2012: $ 2,223 million written down to value-in-use see note 22.
Of the total impairment charges recognised at MKM in the years ended 31 December 2013 for the period until 28 May 2013 when it was disposed of and 31 December 2012 of $23 million 2012: $17 million, $1 million in both years relates to the impairment of receivables which are not treated as special items.
Disposal of subsidiaries and investment in associate Year ended 31 December 2013 a MKM On 28 May 2013, the Group completed the disposal of MKM for a total consideration of 42 million $55 million net of expected selling costs of 2 million $2 million.
At the date of disposal MKM had net assets of 41 million $54 million.
The total consideration of 42 million consists of 30 million $39 million which was received in May 2013 and 12 million $16 million which is deferred.
The total consideration was concluded after the receipt of a dividend from MKM of 10 million $13 million in April 2013.
The deferred component of the consideration is in the form of a secured vendor loan note that bears interest at 9% per annum over four years, expiring in 2017, with early repayment permitted.
The loss on disposal of $1 million was mainly attributable to the recycling of the foreign currency translation reserve of $2 million.
MKM was classified as an asset held for sale and a discontinued operation for the years ended 31 December 2013 until its disposal in May 2013 and 31 December 2012. b Investment in Associate ENRC On 24 June 2013 Eurasian Resources, acting on behalf of the ENRC Consortium comprising Mr Machkevitch, Mr Ibragimov, Mr Chodiev and the Government of Kazakhstan, announced a firm intention to make an offer for ENRC comprising $2.65 in cash plus approximately 0.23 Kazakhmys PLC shares per ENRC share.
The share component of the offer was fixed at Kazakhmys share price on 21 June 2013, resulting in an offer of approximately $1,206 million $1,194 million net of expenses.
On 8 November 2013, the transaction completed and the Group received total proceeds of $1,194 million, comprising $875 million in cash and 77,041,147 Kazakhmys PLC shares valued 4 at $319 million.
On completion the Group recognised a loss on disposal of its investment in ENRC of $528 million, principally representing the recycling of the Groups share of ENRCs transactions recognised directly in equity of $511 million.

For 2012, the UK statutory income tax rate for January to March 2012 was 26.0% and for April to December 2012 was 24.0%, giving a weighted average full year rate of 24.5%.
Corporate income tax CIT is calculated at 23.25% 2012: 24.5% of the assessable profit for the year for the Company and its UK subsidiaries, 20.0% for the operating subsidiaries in Kazakhstan 2012: 20.0% and 10.0% for the Groups Kyrgyzstan based subsidiary 2012: 10%.
MKM, which was included as part of discontinued operations, had a tax rate of 28.5% 2012: 28.5% which relates to German corporate income tax and trade tax.
Effective tax rate Tax charges are affected by the mix of profits and tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
The lower CIT rate in Kazakhstan will have the effect of lowering the Groups overall future effective tax rate below the current UK statutory corporate tax rate.
The impact of transfer pricing provisions and non-deductible items, including impairment losses, will increase the Groups overall future effective tax rate.
The following factors impact the Groups effective tax rate for the year ended 31 December 2013: Unrecognised tax losses The Group has incurred tax losses during the year, primarily related to certain subsoil use contracts, which are not expected to generate sufficient taxable profits for these losses to be utilised in the foreseeable future.
As a result, deferred tax assets of $27 million 2012: $16 million in respect of these losses have not been recognised.
com 129 Financial Statements Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2013 15.
Income taxes continued Impairment of deferred tax assets in respect of the Zhezkazgan Region The $98 million deferred tax asset in the Zhezkazgan Region primarily related to the employee benefits obligation.
Following the impairment review performed on the Zhezkazgan Region, it is not expected that sufficient taxable income will be generated to utilise these assets.
As a result, the deferred tax assets have been fully impaired.
Transfer pricing Notwithstanding recent changes to Kazakhstans transfer pricing legislation to closer align it with international trading practices, inconsistencies still arise between the transfer pricing requirements in Kazakhstan and the UK.
Consequently, certain of the Groups profits are taxed in both jurisdictions due to intercompany sales and purchase contracts that have been put in place within the Group which places upward pressure of $2 million 2012: $3 million on the Groups effective tax rate.
In addition, following confirmation from the tax authorities on the appropriateness of the Groups transfer pricing calculations on certain by-products, the previous provision of $18 million has been reversed.
This amount is shown as an overprovision in prior periods.
In addition, certain sales contracts entered into by Kazakhmys LLC with European and Russian customers included trading terms that are not fully acceptable under Kazakhstan transfer pricing legislation.
Consequently, a provision of $3 million has been recognised based on this anticipated exposure at 31 December 2013 2012: $3 million.
Other non-deductible expenses Included within non-deductible expenses are impairment charges and provisions recognised against various assets and other ongoing business expenses within Kazakhmys Mining of $50 million 2012: $53 million.
In addition, the impairment charges recognised against the Zhezkazgan Regions assets are not deductible and have a $95 million impact on the tax charge.
The reversal of the provision for environmental pollution charges see note 32 c and the related fines and penalties amounting to $38 million in aggregate was nontaxable and offset non-deductible expenses for the year ended 31 December 2012.
The following additional factor impacted the Groups effective tax rate for the year ended 31 December 2012 only: Excess profits taxation In 2012, following the Supreme Courts ruling, Kazakhmys LLC lodged a claim with the Ministry of Finance to seek reimbursement of past EPT payments amounting to $108 million for the periods up to and including 2008.
In the second half of 2012, the Ministry of Finance refunded $60 million which was set-off against the income tax and mineral extraction tax liabilities for the year ended 31 December 2012.
The remaining $48 million was challenged by the tax authorities who believe that this amount relates to periods beyond the Kazakhstan statute of limitations see note 37 b.
The reimbursement of $60 million in 2012 reduced the income tax and mineral tax payments for the year and lowered the Groups effective income tax rate.

Under Kazakhstan tax legislation, tax losses from loss making subsoil use contracts may not be offset against the taxable profits of profitable subsoil use contracts.
Kazakhmys LLC expects that certain subsoil use contracts will be in a tax loss making position for the foreseeable future and will have no taxable profits against which the losses can be offset.
Therefore, no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the tax losses associated with these subsoil use contracts.
Tax losses arising from subsoil use contracts that are expected to be profitable in the future have been recognised as deferred tax assets.
ii United Kingdom Certain companies in the UK have tax losses that can be carried forward and used against future taxable profits in these companies.
There is no time restriction over the utilisation of tax losses.
There is insufficient certainty that a taxable profit will arise in these companies against which the losses can be offset.
For these reasons, no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
d Unrecognised deferred tax liability The gross temporary differences in respect of the undistributed reserves of the Groups subsidiaries, as shown in their statutory accounts prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards, are as follows: $ million 2013 2012 Undistributed reserves of subsidiaries 5,675 6,477 The Group has not recognised all of the deferred tax liability in respect of the distributable reserves of its subsidiaries because it controls them and only part of the temporary differences are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.

The provision represents the discounted values of the estimated costs to decommission and reclaim the mines at the dates of depletion of each of the deposits.
The present value of the provision has been calculated using a discount rate of 8.2% 2012: 7.2% per year.
The liability becomes payable at the end of the useful life of each mine which ranges from one to 49 years.
Uncertainties in estimating these costs include potential changes in regulatory requirements, decommissioning and reclamation alternatives, and the levels of discount and inflation rates.
b Payments for licences for mining assets In accordance with its contracts for subsoil use, the Group is liable to repay the costs of geological information provided by the Government of Kazakhstan for licensed deposits.
The total amount payable by the Group is discounted to its present value using a discount rate of 8.2% 2012: 7.2%.
The uncertainties include estimating the amount of the payments and their timing.
The amounts are payable prior to 2019. c Other Other provisions are recorded where the Group has a legal or constructive obligation and a future outflow of resources is considered probable.

Consequently, the Directors believed that the likelihood of further liabilities or exposures existing in respect of EPC for the periods 2006 to 2008 was remote and the provision of $38 million was released in the year ended 31 December 2012.

Financial risk management The financial information disclosed in the tables relating to the year ended 31 December 2013 represents continuing operations only.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity price risk.
These risks arise from exposures that occur in the normal course of business and are managed by the Groups Treasury department in close cooperation with the Groups business divisions under oversight of a Treasury Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer.
The responsibilities of the Treasury Committee include the monitoring of financial risks, management of the Groups cash resources, debt funding programmes and capital structure, approval of treasury counterparties and relevant transaction limits, and oversight of all significant treasury activities undertaken by the Group.
The Treasury department operates as a service centre to the business divisions of the Group and not as a profit centre.
A Group Treasury Policy has been approved by the Board and is periodically updated to reflect developments in the financial markets and the financial exposures facing the Group.
The Treasury Policy covers specific areas of financial risk management, in particular, liquidity risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity price risk.
The Groups Treasury Committee and the Groups Internal Audit department monitor compliance with the Treasury Policy on a regular basis.
The Groups Treasury department prepares monthly treasury reports for senior management which monitor all major financial exposures and treasury activities undertaken by the Group.
In addition, a treasury report is prepared for each Board meeting which includes a summary of the credit markets and their impact on the implementation of the Groups strategy, progress on the Groups financing initiatives and the significant financial exposures faced by the Group.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise borrowings, cash and cash equivalents, current investments and derivatives used for risk management purposes.
The Groups borrowings, surplus liquidity and derivative financial instruments are controlled and managed centrally by the Groups Treasury department.
Liquidity retained within Kazakhstan is only held for working capital purposes.
The Groups accounting policies with regard to financial instruments are detailed in note 3. a Derivatives, financial instruments and risk management The Group periodically uses derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and exchange rates.
The Groups philosophy is generally not to hedge its core revenue streams.
In periods of significant market volatility or uncertainty, the Group may use derivative instruments as a means of reducing volatility and any negative impact on its operating cash flows.
Limits on the size and type of any derivative hedge transaction are laid down by the Board and subject to strict internal controls.
b Categories of financial assets and financial liabilities The carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities by categories are as follows: $ million Notes 2013 2012 1 Loans and receivables 23,26,27,28 2,584 1,892 2 Available for sale assets 23 19 16 3 Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost 30,32,33 3,669 2,971 1 Loans and receivables comprise long-term deposits within other non-current investments see note 23, trade and other receivables, current investments and cash and cash equivalents.
2 Available for sale assets comprise unlisted investments within other non-current investments see note 23.
3 Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost comprise borrowings, provision for cash payments payments for licences and trade and other payables excluding payments received in advance, other taxes payable and mineral extraction tax payable that are not regarded as financial instruments.
c Foreign exchange risk The Group has transactional currency exposures.
Such exposures arise from sales or purchases by an operating company in currencies other than that companys functional currency.
The functional currency of Kazakhmys Mining production entities and Kazakhmys Power is the Kazakhstan tenge, with Kazakhmys Services Ltd having a UK sterling functional currency, the Bozymchak project in Kyrgyzstan having a Kyrgyz som functional currency and the Company, the Groups financing and holding companies and also the sales entity of Kazakhmys Mining Kazakhmys Sales Ltd having a US dollar functional currency.
The currencies giving rise to this foreign currency risk are primarily the US dollar based revenues and certain costs, bank deposits and trade receivables of Kazakhmys LLC and certain intercompany funding balances that exist within the Group.
Where possible, the Group attempts to conduct its business, maintains its monetary assets and seeks to source corporate debt capital in US dollars so as to minimise its exposure to other currencies.
The Group retains surplus cash balances in US dollars for capital expenditure, acquisitions and returns to shareholders.
Working capital balances are maintained in a mix of US dollars and local currencies depending on short-term requirements of the business.
Whilst there is a strong correlation between many mining input costs and the US dollar, a significant portion of the mining business operating costs are denominated in local currencies, particularly the Kazakhstan tenge.
Rates of exchange for these currencies relative to the US dollar could fluctuate significantly and may materially impact the profitability of the underlying operations and the net assets of the Group.
The Group generally does not enter into hedging positions in respect of its exposure to foreign currency risk.
From time to time, acquisitions and capital investments may expose the Group to movements in other currencies and the Group will consider hedging such exposures on a case by case basis.
144 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial St Financial Stat atements ements For more information see pages xx Lorem ipsum xx Lorem ipsum xx Lorem ipsum xx Lorem ipsum During 2013, to protect the Group from currency risks arising on the CDB Aktogay CNY denominated debt, the Group has entered into a CNY USD cross currency swap.
This derivative instrument provides a hedge against any movement in the CNY exchange rate against the US dollar and also swaps the interest basis from a CNY interest rate into a USD LIBOR interest basis.
i Foreign currency exposure by company profile The analysis in the table below of the net monetary assets and liabilities including intercompany amounts indicates the Groups exposure to currencies other than the functional currency of a company.
These exposures represent the transactional exposures that may give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
As at 31 December 2013 and 2012 these exposures were as follows: $ million US dollar UK sterling Euro KZT Other 2013 Company n a 2 Kazakhmys LLC 386 4 n a 1 Other trading companies 369 n a 2 Non-trading or holding companies 105 6 8 1,272 57 122 4 4 1,272 60 $ million US dollar UK sterling Euro KZT Other 2012 Company n a 3 Kazakhmys LLC 186 22 n a 6 Other trading companies 190 n a 1 Non-trading or holding companies 88 2 24 798 84 1 2 798 5 ii Foreign currency exposure by balance sheet account profile The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk based on gross amounts is shown below: $ million US dollar UK sterling Euro KZT Other Total 2013 Trade and other receivables 449 1 1,269 1,717 Current investments 50 50 Cash and cash equivalents 68 6 9 6 3 92 Provisions for cash payments 34 34 Borrowings 268 57 325 Trade and other payables 143 2 4 3 6 158 122 4 4 1,272 60 1,342 $ million US dollar UK sterling Euro KZT Other Total 2012 Trade and other receivables 271 1 1,581 1 1,854 Current investments 38 38 Cash and cash equivalents 50 2 24 10 7 93 Provisions for cash payments 38 38 Borrowings 187 736 923 Trade and other payables 50 3 23 57 3 136 84 1 2 798 5 888 iii Foreign currency sensitivity analysis In accordance with IFRS 7, the impact of foreign currencies has been determined based on the balances of financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2013.
This sensitivity does not represent the income statement impact that would be expected from a movement in exchange rates over the course of a period of time.
In addition, the analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
A 10% strengthening of the US dollar against the following currencies at 31 December would have increased equity and profit after tax by the amounts shown below.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2012: Impact on profit $ million 2013 2012 KZT 126 80 Euro UK sterling 4 RMB www.
com 145 Financial Statements Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2013 36.
Financial risk management continued A 10% weakening of the US dollar against the above currencies at 31 December would have had an equal but opposite effect on the above currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
d Commodity price risk The Groups mining revenues and earnings are directly impacted by fluctuations in the prices of the commodities it produces.
The Groups principal commodities copper, zinc, gold and silver are priced via reference to global metal exchanges, upon which pricing is derived from global demand and supply and influenced by macroeconomic considerations and financial investment cash flows.
The pricing of the Groups principal commodities may also include a pre-determined margin or discount depending on the terms of sales contracts.
Commodity prices, particularly those derived from global metal exchanges, may fluctuate significantly and may have a material impact on the Groups financial results.
Management closely monitors the impact of fluctuations in commodity prices on the business and uses conservative pricing assumptions and sensitivity analysis for its forecasting and investment appraisals.
The Power business positions the Group as a net generator in the Kazakhstan power market.
The Kazakh power market has a predominance of large industrial electricity users focused on the natural resource sector, and consequently, electricity demand tends to broadly follow the commodity cycle.
The Group sells its power to a mix of wholesale and industrial customers through directly negotiated bilateral contracts.
In April 2009, to encourage investment in the power sector, the Government introduced a framework to raise tariff ceilings for domestic electricity sales for the years 2009 to 2015.
The ceiling prices will be set by the Ministry of Industry and New Technologies on an annual basis, and are subject to the generator meeting capital investment commitments.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the impact of commodity prices has been determined based on the balances of financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2013.
This sensitivity does not represent the income statement impact that would be expected from a movement in commodity prices over the course of a period of time.
A 10% increase decrease in commodity prices after the period end would have no impact on loss profit after tax 2012: $nil.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular costs, remain constant and was performed on the same basis as 2012. e Interest rate risk The Group has financial assets and liabilities which are exposed to changes in market interest rates.
Changes in interest rates primarily impact borrowings by changing their future cash flows floating rate debt or their fair value fixed rate debt and deposits.
The Groups interest rate management policy is generally to borrow and invest at floating rates of interest.
In some circumstances, an element of fixed rate funding may be considered appropriate.
A limited amount of fixed rate hedging using interest rate swaps may be undertaken during periods where the Groups exposure to movements in short-term interest rates is more significant, or in periods when interest rates are perceived to be below long-term historical levels.
The Group had no outstanding interest rate swaps as at 31 December 2013 and 2012.
At 31 December 2013 and 2012 all borrowings were at floating rates.
The exposure of the Groups financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is as follows: At 31 December 2013 Noninterest $ million Floating rate Fixed rate bearing Total Financial assets Non-current investments 9 19 28 Trade and other receivables 235 235 Current investments 625 625 Cash and cash equivalents 494 1,155 66 1,715 Total financial assets 494 1,789 320 2,603 Financial liabilities Provisions for cash payments 36 36 Borrowings 3,111 3,111 1 Trade and other payables 522 522 Total financial liabilities 3,111 36 522 3,669 146 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial St Financial Stat atements ements For more information see pages xx Lorem ipsum xx Lorem ipsum xx Lorem ipsum xx Lorem ipsum At 31 December 2012 Non-interest $ million Floating rate Fixed rate bearing Total Financial assets Non-current investments 9 16 25 Trade and other receivables 122 122 Current investments 515 515 Cash and cash equivalents 461 715 70 1,246 Total financial assets 461 1,239 208 1,908 Financial liabilities Provisions for cash payments 40 40 Borrowings 2,468 2,468 1 Trade and other payables 463 463 Total financial liabilities 2,468 40 463 2,971 1 Trade and other payables exclude payments received in advance, other taxes payable and mineral extraction tax payable that are not regarded as financial instruments.
The interest charged on floating rate financial liabilities is based on the relevant benchmark rate such as LIBOR.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the impact of interest rates has been determined based on the balances of financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2013.
This sensitivity does not represent the income statement impact that would be expected from a movement in interest rates or outstanding borrowings over the course of a period of time.
The effect on profit after tax of a 1% movement in US$ LIBOR rates, based on the year-end net debt position and with all other variables held constant, is estimated to be $20 million 2012: $15 million.
f Credit risk Exposure to credit risk arises as a result of transactions in the Groups ordinary course of business and is applicable to all financial assets and commitments due from third parties.
The Group has adopted policies and procedures to control and monitor the distribution of these exposures to minimise the risk of loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties.
The maximum exposure with respect to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset on the balance sheet.
Credit risk relating to trade receivables Given the number and geographical spread of the Groups ultimate customers and the solvency of major trade debtors, credit risk is believed to be limited in respect of trade receivables.
The Group regularly monitors its exposure to bad debts in order to minimise this exposure.
Customer credit risk is managed by each division but is subject to Group oversight to ensure that each divisions customer credit risk management system operates in a prudent and responsible manner.
Credit evaluations are performed for all major customers and credit limits are established based on internal or external rating criteria.
The credit quality of the Groups significant customers is monitored on an ongoing basis, and receivables that are neither past due nor impaired are considered of good credit quality.
Letters of credit are obtained where customer credit quality is not considered strong enough for open credit.
There were no material impairments of trade receivables during the year ended 31 December 2013 or 2012.
The solvency of the debtor and their ability to repay the receivables were considered in assessing the impairment of such assets.
Within Kazakhmys Mining, cash is received prior to delivery and transfer of title of the goods for sales to European customers.
Sales to Chinese customers are made under letters of credit which are obtained prior to delivery and transfer of title of the goods.
Payment from European and Chinese customers is subject to provisional pricing and then final pricing adjustments.
Kazakhmys Mining is therefore exposed to the residual final pricing adjustment for each sales transaction although such amounts are not considered material in the context of the Groups overall revenues.
Kazakhmys Mining also provides certain social services to municipal authorities in the communities in which it operates as part of its contractual obligations under its subsoil licences.
For most receivable balances due from municipal authorities, full provision is recognised in light of past payment history.
Kazakhmys Power receives cash upfront or has short payment terms depending on the nature of the customer.
As at 31 December 2013, 10 2012: 10 customers accounted for 87% 2012: 56% of the trade and other receivables balance of Kazakhmys Mining.
By 24 February 2014, 100% 20 March 2013: 99.85% of year-end balances due from these customers had been received in full.

Credit risk arising from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Groups Treasury Committee in accordance with a Board approved Treasury Policy.
The Groups cash management policies emphasise security and liquidity ahead of investment return.
Investment of cash and deposits are made only with approved counterparties of high credit worthiness and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty.
Exposures are measured against maximum credit limits assigned to each approved counterparty to ensure credit risk is effectively managed.
The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate any financial loss through potential counterparty failure.
In order to manage counterparty and liquidity risk, surplus funds within the Group are held predominantly in the UK and funds remaining in Kazakhstan are utilised mainly for working capital purposes.
The Group must maintain a level of cash and deposits in Kazakhstan with local branches of international financial institutions and well established local Kazakhstan banks.
The surplus funds in the UK are held primarily with major European and US financial institutions with minimum ratings of Standard & Poors Aand Moodys A3 and AAA rated liquidity funds.
These limits are reviewed on a regular basis to take account of developments in financial markets and updated accordingly.
No material exposure is considered to exist by virtue of the possible non-performance of the counterparties to derivative financial instruments.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December was: $ million 2013 2012 Non-current investments 28 25 Trade and other receivables 235 122 Current investments 625 515 Cash and cash equivalents 1,715 1,246 2,603 1,908 g Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between availability of funding and maximising investment return on its liquid resources through the use of liquid cash investments and debt facilities of varying maturities.
Management regularly reviews the funding requirements of the Group in selecting appropriate maturities for its liquid cash investments.
The Group maintains back-up liquidity for debt maturing within 12 months by way of committed revolving credit facilities totalling $100 million and by maintaining cash on the balance sheet see note 30.
The Groups policy is to centralise debt and surplus cash balances to the maximum extent possible.
148 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial St Financial Stat atements ements For more information see pages xx Lorem ipsum xx Lorem ipsum xx Lorem ipsum xx Lorem ipsum Maturity of financial assets and liabilities The table below analyses the Groups financial assets and liabilities, which will be settled on a gross basis, into relevant maturity groups based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.
2 Borrowings include expected future interest payments based on contracted margins and prevailing LIBOR rates at the balance sheet date.
3 Trade and other payables exclude payments received in advance, other taxes payable and mineral extraction tax payable that are not regarded as financial instruments.
h Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Set out below is a comparison by class of the carrying amounts and fair value of the Groups financial instruments that are carried in the financial statements.
2013 2012 Carrying Carrying $ million value Fair value value Fair value Non-current investments 28 28 25 25 Trade and other receivables 235 235 122 122 Current investments 625 625 515 515 Cash and cash equivalents 1,715 1,715 1,246 1,246 Provisions for cash payments 36 36 40 40 Borrowings 3,111 3,133 2,468 2,456 1 Trade and other payables 522 522 463 463 1,066 1,088 1,063 1,051 1 Trade and other payables exclude payments received in advance, other taxes payable and mineral extraction tax payable that are not regarded as financial instruments.
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: cash and cash equivalents, current investments, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and dividends payable approximate to their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments: provisions for cash payments are discounted back to their present value: and the fair value of borrowings is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt of similar maturities.

Financial risk management continued i Capital management The over-riding objectives of the Groups capital management policy are to safeguard and support the business as a going concern through the commodity cycle, to maximise returns to shareholders either through dividends or share buy-backs and benefits to other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure in order to reduce the Groups cost of capital.
At 31 December 2013, total capital employed which comprises equity holders funds, non-controlling interests and borrowings of the Group amounted to $7,332 million, compared to $8,733 million at 31 December 2012.
Total capital employed is the measure of capital that is used by the Directors in managing capital.
At 31 December 2013, the Group is in a net debt position from continuing operations of $771 million 2012: $707 million.
The Group does not have a target debt equity ratio, but has determined a maximum debt capacity based on a ratio of long-term normalised EBITDA which the Board believes establishes a sustainable level of gearing through the commodity cycle.
This ratio is reviewed in conjunction with market conditions and prevailing commodity prices in order to ensure an efficient capital structure that is balanced against the risks of carrying excessive leverage.
The Group manages net debt to ensure that it does not exceed two times normalised EBITDA through the commodity cycle, where normalised EBITDA excludes special items.
Included within the debt facilities are financial covenants related to maximum borrowing levels of the Group determined by reference to net debt to EBITDA and debt to equity ratios, minimum tangible net worth of individual Group entities and consolidated gross assets to gross liabilities ratios, for which compliance certificates are produced.
All financial covenants were fully complied with during the year and up to the date of approval of the financial statements.
There are no covenants under negotiation at present.
Commitments and contingencies a Legal claims In the ordinary course of business, the Group is subject to legal actions and complaints.
The Directors believe that the ultimate liability, if any, arising from such actions or complaints will not have a materially adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Group.
As of 31 December 2013 and 2012, the Group was not involved in any significant legal proceedings, including arbitration, which may crystallise a financial loss for the Group.
b Kazakhstan taxation contingencies i Inherent uncertainties in interpreting tax legislation The Group is subject to uncertainties relating to the determination of its tax liabilities.
Kazakhstan tax legislation and practice are in a state of continuous development and, therefore, are subject to varying interpretations and changes which may be applied retrospectively.
The Directors interpretation of tax legislation as applied to the transactions and activities of the Group may not coincide with that of the tax authorities.
As a result, the tax authorities may challenge transactions and the Group may be assessed with additional taxes, penalties and fines which could have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial performance or position.
ii Kazakhmys Mining tax audits During 2010 and 2011, a tax audit for the years 2006 to 2008 was undertaken at Kazakhmys LLC whose scope included corporate income tax, environmental taxes and other taxes charged to the income statement.
The tax audit was completed and a final assessment issued in October 2011, which resulted in a claim against Kazakhmys LLC in excess of the amounts previously paid.
The Directors have recognised a provision for the amounts that represent the Directors best estimate of the probable cash payments that will be required to settle these claims.
The risk exists that the ultimate settlement will exceed the Directors estimation.
The tax computations for the years ended 31 December 2009, 2010 and 2011 remain open for inspection during a future tax audit.
Consequently, the tax figures recorded in the financial statements for these years may be subject to change.
iii Kazakhmys Mining transfer pricing In June 2010, amendments to Kazakhstans transfer pricing legislation were passed into law and were made largely retrospective from 1 January 2009.
The new legislation clarified certain areas of interpretation, including the use of LME and LBMA prices as the basis of market prices, quotation periods to be used for the sale and purchase of traded commodities and the acceptability of discounts with reference to LME LBMA prices when transacting in traded commodities.
Notwithstanding these amendments, the Directors have recognised a provision for the amounts that represent the Directors best estimate of the probable cash payments that will be required to settle any residual transfer pricing exposures based on the Directors interpretation of the new transfer pricing legislation including the impact of the amendments passed into law in June 2010 and the prevailing status of discussions with the tax authorities.
The risk remains that the tax authorities may take a different position with regards to the interpretation of the new transfer pricing legislation, and amendments thereof, and the outcome of discussions with the Kazakhstan tax authorities may be materially different from the Directors expectations.
iv Kazakhmys Mining excess profits tax In October 2011, the Supreme Court of Kazakhstan ruled in favour of Kazakhmys LLC in relation to past disputes over the interpretation of the EPT legislation.
As part of this ruling, the Supreme Court also found that Kazakhmys LLC should not have been an EPT payer in the periods up to and including 2008.
Kazakhmys LLC subsequently submitted a claim for $108 million to the Ministry of Finance.
By 31 December 2012, $60 million had been reimbursed by set-off against the 2012 tax year income tax and mineral extraction tax liabilities and was recognised in the consolidated financial statements as a special item.
The remaining $48 million of the $108 million claim was challenged by the Ministry of Finance, who believe that this amount relates to periods beyond the Kazakhstan statute of limitations, and was not reimbursed.
As a result, notwithstanding the previous ruling of the Supreme Court and the merits of Kazakhmys LLCs case against the Ministry of Finance, in light of the ongoing legal actions being taken by Kazakhmys LLC against the tax authorities, 150 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial St Financial Stat atements ements For more information see pages xx Lorem ipsum xx Lorem ipsum xx Lorem ipsum xx Lorem ipsum the Directors believed that there was sufficient uncertainty over the recoverability of this amount such that an asset was not recognised in the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2012.
In 2013, the Ministry of Finance continued its legal action over the remaining $48 million of the $108 million claim, with their appeal reaching the Supreme Court.
In October 2013, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Kazakhmys LLC confirming Kazakhmys LLCs right to receive the remaining $48 million of the past EPT payments.
In November 2013 the tax authorities lodged a formal appeal with the Attorney General of Kazakhstan against the Supreme Courts ruling.
As the outcome and timing of any decision in respect of this appeal and the recoverability of the $48 million remains sufficiently uncertain a credit has not been recognised for this amount in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2013. v Period for additional tax assessments The tax authorities in Kazakhstan are able to raise additional tax assessments for five years after the end of the relevant tax period in respect of all taxes, except for excess profits tax.
In respect of excess profits tax, they are able to raise additional tax assessments for five years after the expiration of the terms of the relevant subsoil contract.
vi Possible additional tax liabilities The Directors believe that the Group is in substantial compliance with the tax laws promulgated in Kazakhstan and any contractual terms entered into that relate to tax which affect its operations and that, consequently, no additional material tax liabilities will arise.
However, due to the reasons set out above, the risk remains that the relevant tax authorities may take a differing position with regard to the interpretation of contractual provisions or tax law.
The resulting effect of this matter is that additional tax liabilities may arise.
However, due to the range of uncertainties described above in assessing any potential additional tax liabilities, it is not practical for the Directors to estimate the financial effect in terms of the amount of additional tax liabilities, if any, together with any associated penalties and charges for which the Group may be liable.
c Environmental contingencies Environmental regulations in Kazakhstan are continually evolving and new emissions legislation is expected to be introduced in the near future.
The outcome of environmental regulations under proposal or any future environmental legislation cannot be reliably estimated at present.
As obligations are determined, they will be provided for in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
The Directors believe that there are no significant liabilities under current legislation not accrued for in the Groups consolidated financial statements, however recognise that the environmental regulators in Kazakhstan may take a differing position with regard to the interpretation of environmental legislation.
The resulting effect is that additional environmental liabilities may arise, however due to the range of uncertainties, it is not practical for the Directors to estimate any further potential exposures.
The provision that has been made for costs associated with restoration and abandonment of mine sites upon depletion of deposits see note 32, is based upon the estimation of the Groups specialists.
Where events occur that change the level of estimated future costs for these activities, the provision will be adjusted accordingly.
d Use of subsoil and exploration rights In Kazakhstan, all subsoil reserves belong to the State, with the Ministry of Industry and New Technologies the Ministry granting exploration and production rights to third party bodies.
Subsoil and exploration rights are not granted in perpetuity, and any renewal must be agreed before the expiration of the relevant contract or licence.
These rights may be terminated by the Ministry if the Group does not satisfy its contractual obligations.
The current subsoil rights will expire at varying dates up to 2062. e Capital expenditure commitments The Group has capital expenditure commitments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment as well as commitments under its mining subsoil agreements.
