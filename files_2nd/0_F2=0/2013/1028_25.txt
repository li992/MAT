Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the following periods expected life up to grant date: other share-based schemes three years and SAYE three and five years for three and five year contracts respectively.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Cash-settled share-based payment arrangements The Group does not operate separate cash-settled share-based payment arrangements: however, the employers NIC liability arising on the outstanding awards is treated as such an arrangement for accounting purposes.
The employers NIC liability on the outstanding awards at 30 April 2013 was 2,870,000 2012: 1,787,000, which is fully provided for in the accounts.
The Group recognised the following total expense in relation to both equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payment arrangements during the year.
Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.

The tax rate used for tax on profit on ordinary activities is 23.92% 2012: 25.84%, being the standard rate for UK corporation tax, as the Groups head office is in the UK.
As a result of changed tax rates in the UK and overseas, the tax charge for the year was increased by 41,000 2012: 178,000.
Some components of the Groups overseas profits are likely to be taxed at an effective rate that is higher than the UK rate.
Other components, due to the availability of losses brought forward in certain countries, are likely to be taxed at a lower rate.

Impairment tests The carrying amount of goodwill for each CGU, the basis of determination and key assumptions for the goodwill impairment calculations are as follows: Wireless Wireless Propsim Nemo Travel Carrying amount of goodwill 000 5,876 49,701 6,200 Basis on which the CGUs recoverable amount has been determined Value in use Value in use Value in use Key assumptions: Discount rate % 13.0 11.6 11.0 Includes a risk factor of 2.0 0.6 Long-term growth rate after five years % 0.0 0.0 0.0 Period over which cash flows are projected years 5 5 5 The discount rate is based on the weighted average cost of capital WACC for the Group as adjusted for risk.
The WACC is derived by taking the results from calculations using the Capital Asset Pricing Model, using data from leading market data providers, which gives an average value of 11% 2012: 9%.
The risk adjustments relate to managements view of the sensitivity to market and operational risks within the relevant business segments and are based on past experience.
The period over which the cash flows are projected is set at five years.
The cash flow projections are based on the approved budgets for the next financial year, the Groups three-year strategic plan for years two and three and an extrapolation using reduced growth rates in years four and five.
The long-term growth rate has been set at zero for each CGU.
Management is sensitive to the technology risk within the software industry and does not deem it appropriate to forecast growth for products more than five years into the future.
Anite plc 88 Annual report and accounts 2013 Business overview Governance Financial statements Notes to the accounts continued 13 Goodwill continued Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions Wireless Nemo Management has based its determination of the units recoverable amount on the key assumptions listed above.
At 30 April 2013, the recoverable amount of Wireless Nemo exceeded its carrying amount by 16.0m.
A 1% perpetual reduction in the operating cash flows would reduce its recoverable amount by 0.8m, whilst a 1% increase in the discount rate would reduce its recoverable amount by 7.0m.
Wireless Propsim Management has based its determination of the units recoverable amount on the key assumptions listed above.
At 30 April 2013, the recoverable amount of Wireless Propsim exceeded its carrying amount by 9.3m.
A 1% perpetual reduction in the operating cash flows would reduce its recoverable amount by 0.3m, whilst a 1% increase in the discount rate would reduce its recoverable amount by 2.4m.
14 Acquisitions On 31 January 2013, Anite plc acquired 100% control of the Propsim Channel Emulation product set from Elektrobit Corporation, comprising a range of radio channel emulation fader hardware and software products, associated R&D capability, sales and marketing capacity and fulfilment resources.
As a result of the acquisition, Anite plc expects to be able to expand into performance testing, a market that is adjacent to Anites core test markets and also opens up a new opportunity in network infrastructure testing.
The business has been fully integrated into Anites existing Handset Testing division.
The initial accounting is incomplete as there is still uncertainty over the accrued purchase price adjustment, which will affect the disclosed value of goodwill.
All other measurement period adjustments are as disclosed in the table below.
Goodwill represents the potential for operational synergies in the future production of testing platforms, of which 1,981,000 is deductible for income tax purposes.
The accrued purchase price adjustment represents managements assessment of the fair value of the liability to the vendor subject to a negotiated settlement.

If the acquisition of the Propsim business had been completed on the first day of the financial year, its contribution to revenue and operating profit excluding amortisation of acquired intangible assets and financing costs for the 12 months to 30 April 2013 would have been 13.1m and 1.6m respectively.
These figures are determined using the vendors methodology for allocating shared corporate costs and may not be directly comparable to the results of the post-acquisition period.
Acquisition and integration costs of 1,154,000 have been expensed in the consolidated income statement of Anite plc during the period under the heading restructuring costs.

The Groups policy is to ensure that all credit trade customers are subject to credit verification procedures, and, where appropriate, parent guarantee and letters of credit, especially for overseas customers, are used so that the Group is exposed to a minimum level of bad debts.
In addition, the majority of trade receivables in the Handset Testing division are covered by credit insurance which provides cover for non-payment of debts.
The credit risk for trade receivables by business segments is as follows: In Travel, the top four customers represent 8% 2012: 9% of the Groups trade receivables.
In Wireless, the top four customers represent 25% 2012: 26% of the Groups trade receivables.
Overall, the Group has no customer that accounted for 9% or more of the accounts receivable at 30 April 2013 2012: 9% and therefore there is no significant concentration of credit risk since the risk is spread over a large number of unrelated counterparties.
The average credit period for trade receivables is 71 days 2012: 59 days.
In the United Kingdom trade receivables are typically on 30 days credit terms whilst, in certain cases, a schedule of payments or extended payments have been agreed.
In other geographical areas, especially Europe, trade receivables can be based on longer credit terms of up to 90 days before the debt falls due for payment.
Interest may be charged on any outstanding balance that is 30 days overdue.
At 30 April 2013 and 2012, the trade receivables were non-interest bearing.
The Group has provided for all debts that, individually, are deemed doubtful at their estimated irrecoverable amount.
With the exception of debts for which the revenue has yet to be recognised or where the monies are received prior to the reporting date, the Group applies a collective assessment of impairment for debts with similar credit risk characteristics.
These characteristics are determined on the basis of the Groups historical loss experience within the industry and provide, in varying percentages, for debts that are overdue the agreed payment terms.
The reason for the policy is because overdue receivables carry an increased risk of not being recoverable.
The table below shows the movements in the provision for impairment of trade receivables: 2013 2012 000 000 At 1 May 983 1,255 Provision acquired 67 Charge for the year through income statement 10 327 Released in the year 519 561 Utilised for bad debt written off 15 38 At 30 April 526 983 Anite plc 93 Annual report and accounts 2013 Business overview Governance Financial statements 19 Trade and other receivables continued The ageing of the individually impaired trade receivables is as follows: 2013 2012 000 000 One to two months overdue Two to three months overdue 7 290 More than three months overdue 519 693 526 983 Ageing of trade receivables excluding those that have been impaired : 2013 2012 000 000 Neither past due nor impaired 19,126 19,932 Past due but not impaired Less than one month overdue 9,504 1,613 One to two months overdue 4,227 793 Two to three months overdue 1,563 435 More than three months overdue 2,993 1,473 37,413 24,246 The neither past due nor impaired and the past due but not impaired balances are due from customers with good credit ratings.

The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market risk primarily exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currency risks, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
e Market risk interest rate The Group finances its operations and acquisitions through a mixture of retained reserves and bank facilities.
The Group seeks to minimise overall net interest expense and, where there are surplus funds, to obtain a fair market rate of return.
The Group operates a cash-pooling arrangement for all its UK operating companies and endeavours to balance liquidity requirements with achieving a market rate of return on cash through the use of short-term money market deposits or other term deposits.
The financial assets and liabilities that are interest-bearing and expose the Group to interest rate risk are as follows.
i Cash and cash equivalents note 21.
The weighted average floating interest rate for these financial assets which were based on Sterling market rates, was 0.46% 2012: 1.56%.
During the period that the Group had outstanding bank borrowings, the weighted average floating interest rate for bank borrowings was 2.28% 2012: 1.43%.
Sterling denominated borrowings are linked to Sterling LIBOR and Euro denominated borrowings are linked EURIBOR, in each case plus a margin.
The margin varies between 1.35% and 1.85% dependent on the level of borrowing, but during the period that the Group had outstanding bank borrowings, the margin remained constant at 1.85% 2012: 0.60%.
The contractual interest rate on the overdrawn balance is based on 2.5% per annum over the banks base rate for its Sterling accounts and 1% per annum over the banks relevant short-term offered rate for any other currency accounts.
Anite plc 97 Annual report and accounts 2013 Business overview Governance Financial statements 25 Financial risk management continued Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis below has been determined, based on the exposure to interest rates for both financial assets and liabilities as listed above at the balance sheet date.
With all other variables held constant, the table below demonstrates the sensitivity to a 0.5% change in interest rates applied to the major currencies of net variable rate assets liabilities.
0.5% is the sensitivity rate that represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates in the next 12 months.

Where possible, currency receivables and payables are matched, creating a natural hedge.
Any surplus cross-border transactional exposure is identified and a proportion is hedged using appropriate derivative instruments.
The proportion of forecast cash flows that will be hedged is reviewed regularly in the light of experience.
The policy is that any surplus foreign currency is converted into Sterling at the earliest opportunity.
The Group has overseas subsidiaries whose revenue and expenses are denominated in their local currencies.
Currently the Group hedges its investments in overseas subsidiaries through natural hedges and does not use derivative financial instruments.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group has Euro-denominated investments in Wireless-Nemo and Wireless-Propsim that are partly hedged through foreign currency borrowings, consequently any foreign exchange movements will create a gain or loss on the value of the investment.
With all other variables held constant, the effect of a 10% appreciation and depreciation of the Euro against Sterling applied to the investment will be either a gain of 11.0m 2012: 7.8m or a loss of 9.0m 2012: 6.4m in other reserves, respectively.
The sensitivity analysis below is based on a 10% appreciation depreciation of the Euro and US Dollar against Sterling, applied to the net monetary assets or liabilities of the Group at the balance sheet date that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit involved.
-denominated US$ 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 000 000 000 000 000 000 Monetary assets 1,284 361 13,228 9,817 6,399 2,030 Monetary liabilities 19 18 3,822 6,498 15,224 165 Net monetary assets 1,265 343 9,406 3,319 8,825 1,865 Anite plc 98 Annual report and accounts 2013 Business overview Governance Financial statements Notes to the accounts continued 25 Financial risk management continued currency impact US$ currency impact currency impact 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 000 000 000 000 000 000 Profit before tax gain loss 10% appreciation 141 38 1,045 369 981 207 10% depreciation 115 31 855 302 802 170 g Other price risks The Group has a limited exposure to commodity price risks through its reliance on precious metals used in the manufacture of hardware components.
In managements opinion, this does not represent a material area of risk to the Group due to the high gross margins and therefore no steps have been taken to hedge the exposure.
h Forward foreign exchange contracts Anites strategy is to hedge a proportion of the forecast future cash flows for a period of up to three months in Wireless and twelve months in Travel, creating a cash flow movement to offset the translational movement.
The proportion of forecast cash flows that will be hedged is reviewed periodically in the light of experience.
At 30 April 2013 the Group had the following outstanding contracts 2012: 92,000 : WeightedTotal contract Total fair Total fair average value value value Maturity date Note fixed rate 000 $000 000 Forward contracts to sell US Dollars and receive Euro Up to June 2013 20 1.2984 5,121 6,650 30 i Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Group.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is as follows: 2013 2012 Note 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents 21 16,658 16,947 Derivative financial instruments 20 30 92 Accrued income 19 5,639 4,245 Trade receivables 19 37,413 24,246 59,740 45,530 The credit risk on cash and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties to these assets are highly rated financial institutions.
In addition, the Group has further mitigated this risk by spreading cash deposits over a range of financial institutions, with no more than 10m being deposited with any one counterparty.
The Groups policy to mitigate potential credit risks and the concentration of credit risks of trade receivables is detailed in note 19 Trade and other receivables.
j Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain a balance and continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of internally generated cash resources, bank overdrafts and other bank facilities.
At the balance sheet date, the Group holds cash and cash equivalents of 16.7m and has net debt of 0.9m having drawn down 17.6m of its 20m facility.
The Groups UK overdraft facility was renewed during the year at 5m net, 2012: 5m net.
The net amount drawn down under this facility at 30 April 2013 and 2012 was nil.
Anite plc 99 Annual report and accounts 2013 Business overview Governance Financial statements 25 Financial risk management continued The Group has a five-year facility with Lloyds TSB Bank plc and Barclays Bank PLC, maturing in October 2016.
This facility consists of a revolving credit facility of 20m, of which 17.6m is drawn 2012: nil and total undrawn facilities including the overdraft facility were 7.4m 2012: 25m.
The revolving credit facility incurs commitment fees at market rates.
This facility is available to be drawn to support the general corporate purposes for the Group including working capital requirements.

The unutilised reliefs may be carried forward for various periods.
The gross temporary differences relating to these unprovided deferred tax assets are as follows.

No provision is required since the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of these differences and either it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future or no tax is payable on the reversal.
