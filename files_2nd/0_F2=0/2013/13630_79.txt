24. pensiOn schemes i Defined benefit pension schemes The Group operates two defined benefit pension arrangements one in the UK called the Rotork Pension and Life Assurance Scheme UK Scheme and one in the USA called the Rotork Controls Inc. Pension Plan.
The Schemes provide benefits based on final salary and length of service on retirement, leaving service or death.
The UK Scheme is subject to the Statutory Funding Objective under the Pensions Act 2004.
A valuation of the Scheme is carried out at least once every three years to determine whether the Statutory Funding Objective is met.
As part of the process the Company must agree with the trustees of the Scheme the contributions to be paid to address any shortfall against the Statutory Funding Objective and contributions to pay for future accrual of benefits.
The UK Scheme is managed by a Trustee, with directors appointed in part by the Group and part from elections by members of the Scheme.
The Trustee has responsibility for obtaining valuations of the fund, administering benefit payments and investing the Schemes assets.
The Trustee delegates some of these functions to their professional advisers where appropriate.
The US Pension Plan is subject to the ERISA funding requirements.
A valuation of the Plan is valued yearly to ensure the Funding Objective is met under ERISA by contributing at least the Minimum Required Contribution.
As part of this process the Company must contribute to the Plan enough contributions to ensure at least the Minimum Contribution is deposited in the Trust to pay for the accrual of benefits.
The two defined benefit pension arrangements expose the Group to a number of risks: Investment risk.
The Schemes hold investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile market values and while these assets are expected to provide real returns over the long-term the short-term volatility can cause additional funding to be required if a deficit emerges.
The Schemes liabilities are assessed using market yields on high quality corporate bonds to discount the liabilities.
As the Scheme holds assets such as equities the value of the assets and liabilities may not move in the same way.
A significant proportion of the benefits under the Schemes are linked to inflation.
Although the Schemes assets are expected to provide a good hedge against inflation over the long term, movements over the short-term could lead to deficits emerging.
In the event that members live longer than assumed a deficit will emerge in the Scheme.
There were no plan amendments, curtailments or settlements during the period.

For the life expectancy sensitivity we have increased decreased the mortality rates by a factor of 10%.
Broadly speaking this decreases increases the assumed life expectancy by 1 year.
The sensitivity analysis shown above was determined using the same method as per the calculation of liabilities for the balance sheet disclosures, but using assumptions adjusted as detailed above.
Effect of the Schemes on Groups future cashflows The Group is required to agree a Schedule of Contributions with the Trustees of the UK Scheme following a valuation which must be carried out at least once every three years.
The next valuation of the Scheme will have an effective date of 31 March 2016.
In the event that the valuation reveals a larger deficit than expected the Group may be required to increase contributions above those set out in the existing Schedule of Contributions.
Conversely, if the position is better than expected contributions may be reduced.
The Group estimates that cash contributions to the Groups defined benefit pension schemes during 2014 will be 3,381,000 for regular payments and additional payments of 5,200,000 in relation to past service 2012: 2,450,000.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 21 years.
ii Other pension plans The Group makes a contribution to a number of defined contribution plans around the world to provide benefits for employees upon retirement.
Total expense relating to these plans in the year was 2,884,000 2012: 2,558,000.
