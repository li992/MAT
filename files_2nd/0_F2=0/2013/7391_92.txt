29. financial Policies for risk management anD tHeir oBJectives credit and concentration of risk the groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, and investments.
the groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
the amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts, chargebacks, without recourse discounts, and other allowances.
a provision for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
the credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
in line with local market practice, customers in the mena region are offered relatively long payment terms compared to customers in europe and the us.
During the year ended 31 December 2013, the groups largest three customers in the mena region represented 11.9% of group revenue, 7.4% in saudi arabia, 2.8% in algeria and 1.7% in tunisia.
at 31 December 2013, the amount of receivables due from customers based in saudi arabia was $100 million 2012: $60 million, in algeria was $74 million 2012: $41 million, and in tunisia was $5 million 2012: $6 million.
During the year ended 31 December 2013, three key us wholesalers represented 33.3% of group revenue 2012: 16.8%.
the amount of receivables due from us customers at 31 December 2013 was $76 million 2012: $59 million.
the group manages this risk through the implementation of stringent credit policies, procedures and certain credit insurance agreements.
trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise.
credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the customer, based on a number of qualitative and quantitative factors related to the credit worthiness of a particular customer.
the group isexposed to a variety of customers ranging from government-backed agencies and large private wholesalers to privately-owned pharmacies, andthe underlying local economic risks vary across the group.
typical credit terms in the us range from 3090 days, in europe 30120 days, andin mena 180360 days.
Where appropriate, the group endeavours to minimise risk by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters ofcredit and insurance.
market risk the groups objective is to reduce, where it is deemed appropriate to do so, fluctuations in earnings and cash flow associated with changes ininterest rates and foreign currency rates.
the group is exposed to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
management actively monitors theseexposures to manage the volatility relating to these exposures by entering into a variety of derivative financial instruments.
capital risk management the group manages its capital and monitors its liquidity to have reasonable assurance that the group will be able to continue as a going concern and deliver its growth strategy objectives, whilst reducing its cost of capital and maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation ofthe debt and equity mix.
the group regularly reviews the capital structure by considering the level of available capital and the short to mediumterm strategic plans concerning future capital spend, as well as the need to meet dividends, banking covenants and borrowing ratios.
the group defines capital as equity plus net funds, which include bank overdrafts and loans note 23, obligations under finance leases note28, long-term financial debts note 27, net of cash and cash equivalents note 22 and collateralised and restricted cash note 21.
During the year, the group continued its strategy of obtaining debt financing at both the group level and at the operating entities level.

in order to monitor the available net funds, management reviews financial capital reports on a monthly basis in addition to the continuous review by the group treasury function.
at 31 December 2013, the groups gearing debt equity was 43% 2012: 69%.
the increase in retained earnings, coupled with prepayments of long-term loans totalling $78 million, contributed to the decrease in the gearing ratio.
Foreign exchange risk the group uses the us dollar as its presentation currency and is, therefore, exposed to foreign exchange movements primarily in the euro, algerian dinar, sudanese pound, Japanese yen, egyptian pound, tunisian dinar and moroccan dirham.
consequently, where possible, thegroupenters into various contracts, which change in value as foreign exchange rates change, to hedge against the risk of movement  assets and liabilities.
Due to the lack of open currency markets, the algerian dinar, the sudanese pound and the egyptianpound cannot be hedged.
Where possible, the group uses financing facilities denominated in local currencies to mitigate the risks.
the Jordanian dinar and saudi riyal have no impact on the consolidated income statement as those currencies are pegged against the us dollar.
Interest rate risk the group manages its exposure to interest rate risk by changing the proportion of debt that is floating by entering into interest rate swap agreements.
using these derivative financial instruments has not had a material impact on the groups financial position as at 31 December 2013, or the groups results of operations for the year then ended.

Based on the composition of the groups debt portfolio as at 31 December 2013, a 1% increase decrease in interest rates would result in an additional $2 million 2012: $3 million in interest expense income being incurred per year.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities the fair value of financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
management classifies items that are recognised at fair value based on the level of inputs used in their fair value determination as described below: Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: inputs that are observable for the asset or liability Level 3: inputs that are not based on observable market data the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value: cash and cash equivalents due to the short-term maturities of these financial instruments and given that generally they have negligible credit risk, management considers the carrying amounts to be not significantly different from their fair values: short-term loans and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments: long-term loans the majority of the loans are variable rate and re-price in response to any changes in market rates and so management considers thecarrying amount to be not significantly different from their fair market value.
for fixed-rate loan exposures, fair value is estimated by discounting thefuture cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities of such loans: over-the-counter otc derivative contracts may include forward, swap, and option contracts relating to interest rates or foreign currencies and are valued based on level 2 market prices and prevailing exchange rates at the balance sheet date: receivables and payables due to the short-term maturities of these financial instruments, the fair values of receivables and payables are estimated tobeequal to the respective carrying amounts: and lease obligations are valued at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
