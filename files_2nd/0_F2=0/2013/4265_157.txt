28 Integration and Restructuring A charge of $24.5 million has been recorded in relation to integration and restructuring programmes during the period ended 27 December 2013.
At the end of 2013, the Group announced that it is to discontinue development of its camera-on-a-chip COACH platform, with the loss of up to 200 employees by the end of the second quarter 2014.
Accordingly, a charge of $6.5 million, relating to anticipated severance payments, has been recognised within integration and restructuring expenses.
At 27 December 2013, a provision of $6.3 million was held in respect of severance payments for employees affected by this announcement.
A further provision of $0.5 million was held in respect of a re-organisation of the Groups internal departmental structure.
It is expected that both of these provisions will be utilized in 2014.
Further components of the charge recognised during 2013 include severance charges, onerous leases, building costs and consultancy and legal fees, as the Group consolidated its System on a Chip SoC development centres and office locations, as well as continuing to optimize its legal entity structure.
Also included within integration and restructuring are costs incurred as part of ongoing contractual commitments with Samsung, as a result of the disposal of development operations in handset location and handset connectivity in 2012.
During 2012 the Group continued with the restructuring programmes that were announced in 2011 following the Zoran acquisition and discontinued investment in DTV and silicon tuners.
Integration and restructuring costs of approximately $25.2 million were incurred during the period ended 28 December 2012, of which the main components were severance charges, onerous leases, and consultancy and legal costs.
An additional $2.3 million of restructuring charges was recorded as a result of the impairment of licences following the disposal of handset development operations to Samsung.
In addition, the Group charged $12.4 million to the restructuring provisions set up in 2011 as the majority of employees affected by these programmes left the Group during the period ended 28 December 2012 see note 22.
A provision of $0.9 million was held at 28 December 2012, of which $0.2m remains at 27 December 2013.
It is expected that the remainder of this provision will be utilized in 2014.
In 2011, a charge of $33.7 million was recorded in relation to integration and restructuring programmes, which predominantly arose due to the acquisition of Zoran.
The main components were $21.7 million of severance costs, $9.6 million of consultancy and legal costs and $1.9 million of fixed asset impairments.
