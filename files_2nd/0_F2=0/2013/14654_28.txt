STRATEGIC REPORT SPIRENT COMMUNICATIONS PLC GOVERNANCE ANNUAL REPORT 2013 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
Corporate information The Groups consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 were authorised for issue by the Board of directors on 27 February 2014.
Spirent Communications plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The Companys Ordinary Shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
As required by the European Unions EU IAS Regulation and the Companies Act 2006, the Group has prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the EU and issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
The Company has elected to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards.
These are presented on pages 122 to 135 and the accounting policies in respect of the Company are set out on pages 123 to 126.
Summary of significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except unless otherwise indicated.
The Group has prepared its financial statements under IFRSs.
The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below and the accounting policies adopted are consistent with those applied in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 other than in relation to IAS 19 Employee Benefits discussed below.
Change to segmental reporting IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires operating segments to be determined based on the Groups internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker has been determined, in Spirents case, to be the Chief Executive Officer, as he is primarily responsible for the allocation of resources to segments and the assessment of the performance of segments.
A review of the Groups organisational structure, which was completed in 2013, has resulted in a change to the segmental information provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker and this has required a change to Spirents segmental reporting structure.
Spirent is now reporting three operating segments: Networks & Applications: Wireless & Service Experience: and Service Assurance.
Previously Networks & Applications and Wireless & Service Experience were reported as one segment, Performance Analysis.
Comparatives have been restated accordingly.
New accounting standards The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been adopted by the Group with no significant impact on its consolidated results or financial position other than in relation to IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
International Accounting Standards IAS IFRS IAS 1 Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income IAS 1 Amendments to IAS 1 Clarification of the Requirements for Comparative Information IAS 16 Amendments to IAS 16 Classification of Servicing Equipment IAS 19 Employee Benefits IAS 32 Amendments to IAS 32 Tax Effect of Distribution to Holders of Equity Instruments IAS 36 Amendments to IAS 36 Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets IFRS 1 Amendments to IFRS 1 Borrowing Costs IFRS 1 Amendments to IFRS 1 Government Loans IFRS 7 Amendments to IFRS 7 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement Annual Improvements 20092011 Cycle IAS 19 Employee Benefits With effect from 1 January 2013 the Group has implemented the amendments to the accounting standard IAS 19 Employee Benefits in relation to its United Kingdom defined benefit pension plans.
Comparative numbers have been restated accordingly.
87 SPIRENT COMMUNICATIONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Under the revised accounting standard, the principal change is that the expected returns on defined benefit pension plan assets are not recognised in profit or loss.
Instead, interest on the net defined benefit pension obligation is recognised in profit or loss, calculated using the discount rate used to measure the pension obligation.
For Spirent this change has caused net interest income on the defined benefit pension plans, under the previous standard, to become a net finance cost, under the revised standard.
In addition, certain administrative expenses of running the plans are expensed to operating costs, having been deducted from the return on assets under the previous standard.
Plan asset administration costs are recognised as re-measurement adjustments in other comprehensive income.
The implementation of IAS 19 has had no effect on the prior year consolidated balance sheet or consolidated cash flow statement.

The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company, using consistent accounting policies.
Results of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
All intra Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries, representing the excess of cost over the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, is capitalised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is subject to an annual review for impairment.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored by management.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Separately identifiable intangible assets such as patent fees, licence fees, trademarks and customer lists and relationships are capitalised on the balance sheet only when the value can be measured reliably, or the intangible asset is purchased as part of the acquisition of a business.
Such intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight line basis.
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Product development Research expenditure is recognised in the year in which it is incurred.
Intangible assets arising on the Groups various product development projects are recognised only if the recognition criteria of IAS 38 Intangible Assets are met.
88 STRATEGIC REPORT SPIRENT COMMUNICATIONS PLC GOVERNANCE ANNUAL REPORT 2013 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Product development costs are expensed as incurred until the technological feasibility of the product under development has been established.
Technological feasibility in Spirents circumstances occurs when a working model is completed.
For software development technological feasibility is not established until the process of developing the software is complete.
After technological feasibility is established, additional costs are capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life.
At 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 no amounts have met the recognition criteria.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment.
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of all other assets over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis at rates which take into account commercial conditions at their location.
Usual asset lives are as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Plant and machinery 3 to 8 years Fixtures, fittings and equipment Building installations 20 years or lease period if less Fittings and equipment 3 to 8 years Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years Business systems software 4 years The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Impairment of assets Intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment at each reporting date where there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are assessed at least annually.
When an impairment test is performed, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of the net present value of the expected cash flows value in use of the relevant cash-generating unit or asset and the fair value less cost to sell.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Where an impairment loss has been recognised against an asset, it may be reversed in future periods where there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised, but only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.
Such a reversal is recognised in the income statement.
This does not apply for goodwill, for which an impairment loss must not be reversed in any circumstances.
Leases Operating leases are leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset and are not finance leases.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value, after provisions for obsolescence.
Cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition, being the full manufacturing cost on a first-in-first-out basis, including all attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity.
Provisions Provisions are recorded when the Group has a present, legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, for which it is probable that the Group will be required to settle by an outflow of resources and for which a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision shall be the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.
89 SPIRENT COMMUNICATIONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Foreign currencies The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the Groups presentation currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the rates ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
All exchange differences are taken to the consolidated income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are measured in terms of historical costs using the exchange rate at the date of the initial transaction.
The functional currencies of the Groups operations are principally US dollar, sterling or euro.
On consolidation the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated into the Groups presentation currency at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The results of foreign operations are translated into US dollars using average rates for the period.
The exchange differences arising on retranslation are classified as a separate component of equity, the translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as part of the profit or loss on disposal should an operation be disposed of.
The Group has elected to apply the exemption in IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards which allows the cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations to be deemed to be zero at the date of transition to IFRSs, being 1 January 2003.
Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are stated at original invoiced amount less an appropriate allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Such allowances are based on an assessment of debtor ageing, past experience or known customer exposures.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits which usually have an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above.
There are no bank overdrafts.
Trade payables Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at the original invoiced amount.
Equity instruments Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Spirent Communications plc Ordinary Shares held by the Group are classified in equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost and included as a deduction from retained earnings.
Consideration received for the sale of such treasury shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to retained earnings.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage exposures arising on receipts and payments in foreign currencies relating to firm commitments.
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the contract is entered into, and are subsequently re-measured to fair value at each reported balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The Group has not adopted the hedge accounting rules.
Consequently all gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are taken to the income statement.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts.
Retirement benefits The Group operates two funded defined benefit pension plans which are in the United Kingdom, all other pension plans are defined contribution in nature.
For the defined contribution plans the amount charged to the income statement is the employers contributions paid or payable during the year.
90 STRATEGIC REPORT SPIRENT COMMUNICATIONS PLC GOVERNANCE ANNUAL REPORT 2013 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued For defined benefit pension plans full actuarial valuations are carried out every three years using the projected unit credit method, and updates are performed at each balance sheet date.
Re-measurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of changes to the asset ceiling if relevant and the return on plan assets excluding interest, is reflected immediately in the balance sheet liability or asset with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Re-measurement recognised in other comprehensive income will not be reclassified to profit or loss.
Past service cost is recognised in profit or loss in the period of plan amendment.
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit pension liability or asset, taking account of any changes in the net defined benefit pension liability during the period as a result of contribution and benefit payments.
Defined benefit pension costs are categorised as: service cost including current service cost, past service cost and gains and losses on curtailments or settlements : net interest expense or income: and re-measurement.
The Group presents the first two components of defined benefit pension costs in profit or loss.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group, the revenue can be reliably measured and when the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership.
In addition, revenue is only recognised when collectability is probable.
For the sale of services, revenue is recognised in accounting periods in which the service is rendered.
Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognised over the period of performance on a straight line basis.
Revenue from product sales of hardware and software is recognised at the time of delivery and acceptance and when there are no significant vendor obligations remaining.
It is not until acceptance has occurred that the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer.
Terms of acceptance are dependent upon the specific contractual arrangement agreed with the customer.
Contractual arrangements are accounted for as two or more separate transactions only where the commercial substance is that the individual components operate independently of each other, because they are capable of being provided separately from one another and it is possible to attribute reliable fair values to every component.
To the extent that a separate component comprises a product sale of hardware or software, revenue is recognised as described above.
Revenue is recognised on other components as the Group fulfils its contractual obligations and to the extent that it has earned the right to consideration.
Employee benefits When an employee has rendered services to the Group during an accounting period, short term benefits expected to be paid in exchange for those services are recognised in the same accounting period.
Share-based payment The Group operates various equity-settled share-based compensation plans and accounts for these awards in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
The fair value of these awards is recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period together with a corresponding change in equity.
The fair value is measured using the Hull-White trinomial model by reference to the share price, and taking into account the terms and conditions of the award, excluding non-market vesting conditions, at the date the awards were granted.
The charge is reassessed at each balance sheet date to reflect the expected and actual levels of vesting, due to achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions.
Awards where vesting is conditional upon satisfying a market condition or non-vesting condition are treated as vesting irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition has been satisified.
The Group has an employee share trust for the granting of certain share incentives to employees.
Shares in the Group held by the employee share trust are treated as treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.
Tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable for previous years.
91 SPIRENT COMMUNICATIONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions: where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill taxable temporary differences only or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Dividends paid The interim dividend is included in the financial statements in the period in which it is paid, and the final dividend in the period it is approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.
Critical accounting assumptions and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect items reported.
Such estimates and assumptions are based on managements best knowledge of current facts, circumstances and future events, actual results may differ, possibly significantly, from those estimates.
The areas requiring a high degree of judgement or where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are discussed below.
Goodwill impairment The Group tests annually by cash-generating unit whether goodwill has suffered impairment and more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the current carrying value may not be recoverable.
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use calculations which require the use of estimates and assumptions.
These are described in note 15.
Defined benefit pension plans The pension cost and the defined benefit pension obligation of the Groups defined benefit pension plans are based on a number of selected assumptions, these include the discount rate, inflation rate, salary growth and longevity.
Differences arising from actual experience or future changes in assumptions will be reflected in future periods.
The effect of changing these assumptions is described in note 11.
Revenue recognition For revenue recognition purposes contractual arrangements are accounted for as two or more separate transactions only where the commercial substance is that the individual components operate independently of each other, because they are capable of being provided separately from one another and it is possible to attribute reliable fair values to every component.
Management exercises a degree of judgement in setting the criteria used for determining when revenue which involves several elements should be recognised and the fair values allocated to each element.
Income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in a number of tax jurisdictions and judgement is applied in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes.
There are many transactions for which the final tax determinability is uncertain.
For example liabilities are recognised for anticipated tax audit issues based on whether additional taxes are likely to be due based on the facts and circumstances known at the time the financial statements are prepared.
Where the final outcome differs from the amounts that were initially recorded the differences will be recorded in the future period in which the determination is made.
Deferred taxes The extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognised is based on current forecasts and estimates prepared by management.
A change to these forecasts and estimates could result in a different recognition outcome.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are disclosed in note 23.

Operating segments The Groups organisational structure is based on differences in the products and services offered by each segment and information regularly reviewed by the Groups Chief Executive Officer, its chief operating decision maker, is presented on this basis.
The Groups operating segments follow this structure.
As explained in note 2 the Group has amended its operating segments for 2013 and comparative information has been restated.
The Groups continuing reportable operating segments are Networks & Applications, Wireless & Service Experience and Service Assurance.
Its Systems segment was sold during 2012 and is disclosed as a discontinued operation.
The Group evaluates segment operating profit before exceptional items, acquisition related costs, acquired intangible asset amortisation and share-based payment.
Finance income and finance costs are not allocated to the reportable segments.
Corporate is not an operating segment and costs are separately reported and not allocated to the reportable segments.
Information on segment assets and segment liabilities is not regularly provided to the Groups Chief Executive Officer and is therefore not disclosed below.
The principal activities of each of the continuing reportable operating segments are as follows: Networks & Applications develops innovative solutions for functional and performance testing of next-generation networks and applications that simulate real-world conditions in the lab, before a commercial launch.
Wireless & Service Experience develops innovative solutions for functional and performance testing of next-generation mobile wireless and satellite positioning devices in the lab before a commercial launch, and measurement of the mobile experience on live networks.
Service Assurance provides solutions to allow service providers to diagnose, troubleshoot and determine how to resolve issues with networks and systems within the live network and to monitor live network performance.

Pensions Defined benefit plans i Characteristics and risks associated with the Plans The Group sponsors two funded defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom: the Spirent Communications plc Staff Pension & Life Assurance Plan Staff Plan and the Spirent Communications plc Retirement Cash & Life Assurance Plan Cash Plan.
These plans are funded and have full UK HM Revenue & Customs HMRC tax-exempt approval.
Both schemes are administered by a trustee board which is comprised of representatives from the employer, member nominated trustees and an independent trustee.
The trustee board operates in accordance with the Trust Deed and Rules of each Plan and acts in the interests of all of its members.
The Staff Plan is the Groups most significant plan, and it provides its members with retirement benefits based on their final salary and length of service.
The Staff Plan was closed to new entrants on 1 October 2002.
The Cash Plan is primarily a defined contribution arrangement, although there are some legacy defined benefits that have been valued for the purpose of these accounts in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
Members who left service before 1992 are entitled to a cash lump sum on retirement that is based on their salary and length of service.
Members of the Old Section are entitled to defined contribution benefits, but with an underpin based on salary and length of service.
There is also a United Kingdom unfunded plan, which consists of a contractual obligation for the Group to top up certain former employees benefits whose salaries exceeded the statutory earnings cap.
As with a vast majority of similar arrangements in the United Kingdom, the Group ultimately underwrites the risks relating to the defined benefit plans.
These risks include investment risks and demographic risks, such as the risks of members living longer than expected.
The plans hold a large proportion of their assets in equity and property investments.
Strong future equity returns would be expected to reduce the Groups future cash contributions and vice versa.
Expected contributions to the defined benefit plans in 2014 are $4.8 million.
This includes the contributions agreed with the funded plans trustees in accordance with UK legislation.

Pensions continued f The key financial assumptions The assumptions used for both plans using a weighted average were as follows: 2013 2012 % % Inflation RPI 3.3 2.9 Inflation CPI 2.2 2.2 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.1 2.9 Rate of increase for pensions in payment pre 2001 service 3.6 3.6 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2001 to 5 April 2005 service 3.1 2.8 Rate of increase for pensions post 5 April 2005 service 2.2 1.9 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.2 2.2 Rate used to discount plan liabilities 4.5 4.3 The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are such that a member currently aged 65 2012 aged 65 will live on average for a further 23.5 years 2012 23.3 years if they are male and for a further 25.6 years 2012 25.5 years if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2033 2012 in 2032 at age 65 2012 age 65 the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 24.3 years 2012 24.2 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 26.7 years 2012 26.6 years after retirement if they are female.
iii Amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows The approximate impact to the past service liabilities of changing these main assumptions is as follows: Reducing the discount rate by 0.1 per cent per annum would increase past service liabilities by $4.0 million.
Increasing RPI inflation by 0.1 per cent would increase the plans liabilities by $1.7 million.
Increasing the life expectancy of a member by one year by modifying the standard mortality tables using an appropriate scaling factor would increase past service liabilities by $10.8 million.
There will also be an impact on the future service cost but given the small active population in these plans this is likely to be insignificant.
The sensitivity figures have been calculated to show the movement in the defined benefit obligation for each assumption change in isolation, and assuming no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date and may not be representative of the actual change as the changes in assumptions may not occur in isolation.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 15 years 2012 16 years.
Defined contribution plans United Kingdom The Group maintains defined contribution pension plans for employees in the United Kingdom.
Employer contributions into these plans for 2013 were $1.4 million 2012 $1.3 million.
United States The Group maintains a defined contribution pension plan for employees of its United States subsidiaries.
This plan, also known as a 401 k Plan, allows employees to defer a percentage of their salary for retirement.
The investment choices offered by the plan are a selection of diversified mutual funds offering a broad mix of investment return potential with varying levels of risk.
In aggregate, the Groups contributions to the US plan totalled $3.3 million for 2013 2012 $3.4 million.
Total assets in the defined contribution plan at the end of 2013 were $204.6 million 2012 $167.0 million.
There were no defined benefit plans in the United States in 2013 or 2012.
Other jurisdictions Outside the United Kingdom and the United States employees are provided with pension arrangements determined in accordance with approved local practice and regulations.
These arrangements are defined contribution plans.
Total employer contributions for 2013 in respect of these plans amounted to $0.9 million 2012 $0.8 million.
Total employer contributions to defined contribution plans were $5.6 million 2012 $5.5 million.

Intangible assets continued Following the change to the Groups reportable segments described in note 2, goodwill has been reallocated to the following CGUs: Networks & Applications, an operating segment: Wireless & Positioning, product lines within the Wireless & Service Experience operating segment: Service Experience, a product line within the Wireless & Service Experience operating segment.
Goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2013 2012 $ million $ million Networks & Applications 86.0 Wireless & Positioning 52.1 Service Experience 30.9 Performance Analysis 170.1 169.0 170.1 This reallocation was based on the relative values for the Networks & Applications and for the Wireless & Positioning CGUs.
For the Service Experience CGU goodwill has been based on historical cost due to the recent nature of this acquisition.
Acquired intangible assets, being customer list, current technology, database and brand names, are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives which are between two and a half and seven years and the charge is included within administration expenses in the income statement.
Licences are amortised over their useful lives or term, being three to five years, and are expensed within cost of sales or selling costs.
The remaining amortisation periods of the acquired intangible asset balances arising in relation to customer list and current technology are six and four years, respectively.
Annual impairment test The cash flows are derived from the most recent financial budgets for the next financial year, as approved by the Board, and the Groups three year strategic plan.
Cash flows for years four and five are then extrapolated based on long range plans.
The key factor in the cash flow forecasts is the ability to forecast revenue.
Cash flows in subsequent years have been extrapolated using a 2.75 per cent growth rate 2012 2.75 per cent which management estimates to be the approximate average long term growth rate for the industries in which these units operate.
The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 13.8 per cent for all CGUs 2012 14.5 per cent.
The recoverable amount of each CGU was calculated on a value in use basis, and was in excess of its carrying value and consequently no impairment has been recognised.
Key assumptions for the annual impairment test The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations were: revenue growth rates.
growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the five year period covered by managements projections.
Projections are denominated in the same currency as the denomination of the goodwill balance to eliminate the effect of fluctuating exchange rates.
Revenue growth rates used in managements projections are based on managements estimate of growth in the markets served and take into account historic levels of growth, expected future developments in products and technology and macro-economic conditions.
The cash flows used in the impairment review have been approved by the Board.
Gross margins and operating expenses are based on historical values adjusted for the effect of revenue growth and recent acquisitions.
105 SPIRENT COMMUNICATIONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 15.
Intangible assets continued The discount rate applied to the cash flows is based on Spirents weighted average cost of capital by taking the risk free rate for ten year government bonds and making an adjustment to reflect both the increased risk of investing in equities and the systematic risk of the specific cash-generating unit.
In making this adjustment, inputs required are the equity market risk premium and the risk adjustment, beta, applied to reflect the risk of Spirent relative to the market as a whole.
Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions The directors believe that no reasonable possible change in any of the key assumptions used in isolation would cause the carrying value of the Networks & Applications, Wireless & Positioning and Service Experience CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount.

Restructuring provisions relate to severance costs which are expected to be utilised within one year.
Other provisions are mainly environmental provisions related to property disposed of and dilapidation provisions.
The Group expects these provisions to be utilised in less than one year.
Financial instruments and financial risk management The main purpose of the Groups financial instruments, other than trade receivables, trade payables and provisions, is to fund the Groups liquidity requirements.
All of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are categorised as loans and receivables and these are shown in the following table: 2013 2012 $ million $ million Loans and Loans and receivables receivables at amortised at amortised cost cost Non-current cash on deposit note 21 0.1 0.4 Non-current trade and other receivables note 20 3.9 4.2 Cash and cash equivalents note 21 216.2 248.6 Current trade and other receivables note 20 93.8 88.3 Financial assets 314.0 341.5 Non-current other payables and accruals note 24 2.6 2.8 Current trade payables and accruals note 22 56.5 52.1 Share buyback obligation note 22 18.2 8.1 Provisions note 25 6.5 5.0 Financial liabilities 83.8 68.0 The Group enters into derivative transactions, forward foreign currency exchange contracts, for the management of the Groups foreign currency exposures when deemed appropriate.
These derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value, however the fair values at 31 December 2013 and 2012 were immaterial to these accounts.
The key objective of the Groups treasury department is to manage the financial risks of the business and to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to the Group.
All treasury activity operates within a formal control framework.
The Board has approved treasury policies and guidelines and periodically reviews treasury activities.
Additionally, it is the Groups policy that speculative treasury transactions are expressly forbidden.
a Market risk The main types of market risk that affect the Group are interest rate risk and exchange rate risk.
Interest rate risk The Group has no external debt and has limited exposure to interest rate risk.
The Groups excess funds are principally held in the United Kingdom and the United States and invested in on demand or short term bank deposits.
It therefore has some exposure to interest rate risk arising on changes in sterling and US dollar interest rates.
Cash and cash equivalents, long term cash on deposit and forward foreign currency exchange contracts are the Groups financial instruments which are exposed to interest rate risk.
110 STRATEGIC REPORT SPIRENT COMMUNICATIONS PLC GOVERNANCE ANNUAL REPORT 2013 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 26.
Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Short term bank deposits all mature within three months.
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts all mature within three months.
The financial instruments bear the following interest rates: Effective Effective interest rate 2013 interest rate 2012 % $ million % $ million Fixed rate Fixed deposits 0.27 44.1 0.42 44.1 Floating rate Cash at bank and in hand 172.1 204.5 Interest rates on financial instruments classified as fixed rate are fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
All fixed rate deposits mature within three months after which date they will be exposed to floating rates of interest.
In addition, $0.1 million 2012 $0.4 million was held in a blocked trust account and was earning interest of 0.44 per cent at 31 December 2013 2012 0.44 per cent.
The maturity of the deposit is three months, at maturity the interest rate will be reset.
This cash must be retained in the blocked trust account in accordance with the terms of the undertakings made at the time of the cancellation of the share premium account and capital redemption reserve the Cancellation in 2004.
The funds must remain in this account until creditors which existed at the date of the Cancellation have been repaid and therefore the maturity of this account is uncertain.
Interest receivable for the year was $0.9 million note 8 2012 $0.8 million and is under the effective interest method.
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above table are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
A movement of 25 basis points in interest rates based on levels of investment at 31 December 2013 would increase or reduce interest income and equity by $0.5 million 2012 $0.5 million.
Exchange rate risk Currency exposures arise from trading transactions undertaken by the Group in foreign currencies and on the translation of the operating results and net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
The Group has the majority of its operations in the United States and presents its consolidated financial statements in US dollars.
The Companys functional currency is sterling and its share capital is denominated in pounds sterling, the Group also has operations in Europe and Asia and therefore its results and assets and liabilities are affected on translation by movements in exchange rates in relation to the US dollar.
The Group does not enter into instruments to hedge the translation exposure of the operating results or net assets of its overseas subsidiaries since these are considered accounting and not cash exposures.
The Group is not exposed to significant transactional foreign currency risk at 31 December 2013, nor at 31 December 2012, because the majority of its businesses do not enter into non-functional currency transactions.
Where such transactions do occur the Group typically enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts as appropriate.
Group treasury, by means of forward foreign currency exchange contracts, carries out the transaction hedging activity in relation to normal trading activity.
At 31 December 2013 the Group has hedged the majority of its financial assets and liabilities in relation to trading which are denominated in non-functional currencies.
However, the Group holds cash balances in non-functional currencies which are exposed to US dollar to sterling exchange rates.
At 31 December 2013 these balances amounted to $1.1 million 2012 $0.9 million.
A 10 per cent appreciation or depreciation of sterling against the US dollar would increase or reduce profit before tax by $0.1 million 2012 $0.1 million based on the balance at the reporting dates.
b Credit risk Investment counterparties are subject to pre-approval by the Board with pre-approved limits set for each bank to avoid any concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum credit exposure at the balance sheet date under financial instruments in relation to cash and bank deposits is equal to the carrying value of $216.3 million 2012 $249.0 million.
111 SPIRENT COMMUNICATIONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 26.
Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for uncollectable amounts where appropriate.
Trade receivable exposures are managed in the business units where they arise.
Allowance is made for bad and doubtful debts based on managements assessment of the risk taking into account ageing profile, experience and circumstance.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk attributable to its trade receivables as the exposure is spread over a large number of customers with no one customer accounting for more than 10 per cent of total Group revenue.
The maximum credit exposure at the balance sheet date in relation to trade receivables is equal to the carrying value of $90.0 million 2012 $86.0 million.
The composition of trade receivables at 31 December is as follows: 2013 2012 $ million $ million Neither impaired nor past due 59.9 58.8 Past due but not impaired: Less than 30 days overdue 15.5 14.1 30 to 60 days 5.1 5.2 Over 60 days 9.5 7.9 Trade receivables 90.0 86.0 The Group closely monitors amounts due from customers and performs activities such as credit checks and review of payment history and has put in place appropriate credit approval limits.
Based on these procedures management assessed the quality of those receivables that are past due but not impaired as low risk.
The movement on the receivables provision during the year is given in note 20.
The value of impaired trade receivables is $1.0 million 2012 $0.8 million.
For all other financial assets the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount.
c Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to ensure that there are sufficient sources of funding to meet projected requirements.
Its operations are financed through cash and cash equivalents held centrally and cash generated from operations.
At 31 December 2013 the Group had cash and cash equivalents of $216.2 million 2012 $248.6 million of which $170.9 million 2012 $164.5 million is available on demand and $45.3 million 2012 $84.1 million of which is on one months notice or matures within three months.
During 2013 the Group generated $67.4 million of cash from operating activities 2012 $105.1 million and considers that with current cash resources, no debt and positive cash flow from its operating activities it has adequate resources available to it to remain in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Group has entered into forward foreign currency exchange contracts all of which mature within three months.
The gross settlement amounts of these contracts are as follows: 2013 2012 $ million $ million Sale of US dollars against sterling 3.5 3.6 The Group is debt free and does not have loans payable.
Financial liabilities are trade and other payables, the majority of which are all due to be settled within one year, and provisions note 25.
The Group does not have any other material financial contractual commitments.
d Fair value of financial instruments The carrying value of all financial assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value although the amounts at 31 December 2013 and 2012 were immaterial.
The fair value of currency derivatives is determined by reference to forward foreign currency exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles, and is therefore determined to be a level 2 financial instrument as its value is based on observable market inputs.

Financial instruments and financial risk management continued e Capital management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Groups capital is its total shareholders funds.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions.
During 2013 and 2012 the Company has been operating an on market share repurchase programme.
In 2013 the Company repurchased 29.2 million of its Ordinary Shares at a cost of $55.5 million 2012 13.4 million at a cost of $30.8 million.
The Group intends to continue to repurchase shares on a one-off basis as it deems appropriate.
Spirents policy on the payment of dividends to shareholders is to maintain a sustainable, progressive dividend.
Operating lease commitments At 31 December, the Group had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: 2013 2012 $ million $ million Within one year 8.2 7.9 In the second to fifth years 12.3 9.9 Over five years 3.2 0.3 23.7 18.1 The Group leases certain land and buildings under non-cancellable operating lease agreements with a variety of terms.
The Group also leases certain plant and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.

During 2013 and 2012 no Ordinary Shares were transferred from the Spirent Sharesave Trust SST to satisfy options exercised under the UK all employee share schemes and in 2013 1.4 million Ordinary Shares were transferred from the Spirent Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT to satisfy options exercised under the Spirent Stock Incentive Plan and 2005 Employee Incentive Plan 2012 5.6 million Ordinary Shares.
There has been no material increase in the issued Ordinary Share capital, whether by exercise of share incentives or otherwise, between 31 December 2013 and 27 February 2014, the date on which these financial statements have been signed.
113 SPIRENT COMMUNICATIONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 28.
Equity continued b Equity and reserves The nature and purpose of each reserve within equity is as follows: i Share premium account: this reserve records the consideration premium for shares issued at a value that exceeds their nominal value: ii Capital redemption reserve: this reserve arises in relation to share capital cancellation: iii Other reserves: share capital, share premium account and capital redemption reserve are translated into US dollars at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date and the resultant exchange differences are included in other reserves: and iv Translation reserve: this reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries.
Investment in own Ordinary Shares At 31 December 2013, the ESOT held 0.9 million Ordinary Shares 2012 2.3 million Ordinary Shares to satisfy awards under various share incentive plans.
At 31 December 2013, the SST held 0.5 million Ordinary Shares 2012 0.5 million Ordinary Shares to satisfy awards made to United Kingdom based employees under an all employee share scheme.
The market value of own Ordinary Shares held in trust, being in total 1.4 million Ordinary Shares 2012 2.8 million Ordinary Shares, at 31 December 2013 was $2.5 million 2012 $6.9 million.
Cancellation of share premium account and capital redemption reserve On 24 November 2004, Spirent Communications plc was granted an order of the High Court for the approval of the cancellation of the share premium account and capital redemption reserve the Cancellation which stood at that date at $1,321.1 million 702.7 million and $1.3 million 0.7 million, respectively.
The Cancellation created a reserve in the financial statements of the Company which was applied to eliminate the deficit in distributable reserves.
The balance of this reserve, created after the deficit in distributable reserves had been eliminated, was transferred to a special non-distributable reserve.
During 2006 the Company transferred funds equal to the aggregate amount due to any creditors of Spirent Communications plc, who were creditors on 24 November 2004, and who still remained creditors, to a blocked trust account.
Placing these funds in a blocked trust account in accordance with the undertakings made at the time of the Cancellation allowed the special reserve to be released to distributable reserves.
Capital redemption reserve During 2013 the Company cancelled 29.2 million Ordinary Shares 2012 13.4 million Ordinary Shares that had been the subject of the on market share repurchase programme, and transferred $1.5 million 2012 $0.7 million to the capital redemption reserve.

Under the EIP, the Company is able to grant share options, including HMRC-approved options, share-settled stock appreciation rights SARs and Performance shares.
No price is payable on the grant of an award.
In normal circumstances, EIP awards vest three years following the date of grant provided the relevant performance conditions have been met.
For share options and SARs, the performance conditions relate to the Companys earnings per share EPS.
For Performance share awards made prior to 2011, performance conditions related to Total Shareholder Return TSR.
For awards made since 2011, performance conditions relate to the Companys EPS and TSR.
115 SPIRENT COMMUNICATIONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 29.
Employee share plans continued Further information on the performance conditions for EIP share incentives is set out in the Report on directors remuneration on pages 58 to 76.
Options and SARs granted under the EIP expire on the tenth anniversary of their grant unless they have previously lapsed or been exercised.
Spirent Stock Incentive Plan SSIP The SSIP is now closed for new awards and has been replaced by the EIP referred to above.
The SSIP was introduced in 2000.
This discretionary plan was primarily targeted at US employees with grants normally determined by reference to the seniority and contribution of the individual, together with the performance of the relevant business and prevailing local market practice.
Grants were also permitted to selected newly hired and promoted employees on a monthly basis.
Under the SSIP, the Company was able to grant share options and share-settled SARs.
No price was payable on the grant of an award.
Most awards made pursuant to the SSIP vest over four years, provided that the participant remains in employment.
Vesting is not normally subject to a performance condition and awards become 25 per cent exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of grant and thereafter in equal tranches on a monthly basis over a further 36 months.
Any award not exercised by the seventh anniversary of the date of grant will lapse.
The vesting of some SSIP awards were subject to the Company meeting EPS growth targets over the vesting periods.
All outstanding awards have now passed their EPS performance conditions and remain exercisable until they expire on the seventh anniversary of their respective grant dates.
SARs granted under the EIP and SSIP will deliver the appreciation value ie the increase in market value of an Ordinary Share over the base price of the SAR in the form of Ordinary Shares.
This SARs approach helps the Company manage its dilution headroom more efficiently as only the SAR gain needs to be funded.
Using a SARs approach, it is not possible to determine the precise level of dilution until the SARs are exercised.
At 31 December 2013, 2.8 million EIP SARs and 0.1 million SSIP SARs with an average base price of 127 pence and 60 pence respectively were outstanding 2012 1.7 million EIP SARs and 1.8 million SSIP SARs with an average base price of 118 pence and 50 pence respectively.
During 2013, 1.6 million EIP and SSIP SARs were exercised resulting in the transfer of 1.1 million Ordinary Shares 2012 3.9 million Ordinary Shares were issued or transferred on the exercise of 5.6 million EIP and SSIP SARs.
1995 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The ESOS is now closed for new grants and has been replaced by the EIP referred to above.
Under the ESOS awards of share options, including HMRC-approved options, were on a discretionary basis.
No price was payable on the grant of an option and no options were granted at a discount to the market price.
The normal exercise period for options granted under the ESOS is between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
Options awarded under the ESOS were subject to the achievement of an EPS performance condition before they could be exercised.
All outstanding options have now passed their EPS performance conditions and remain exercisable until they expire on the tenth anniversary of their respective grant dates.
All Employee plans UK Employee Share Purchase Plan UK ESPP The UK ESPP, which is an HMRC-approved share incentive plan, was approved by shareholders in 2005 and is available to all UK employees.
The UK ESPP offers three ways to provide Ordinary Shares to employees: free shares, partnership shares and matching shares.
The UK ESPP operates in conjunction with a trust, which holds the shares on behalf of participants.
In November 2010, the Company commenced making invitations to all UK employees to acquire partnership shares on market using deductions from payroll.
US Employee Stock Purchase Plan US ESPP The US ESPP was initially approved by shareholders in 2000, with amendments being approved by shareholders in 2005 and 2011.
The US ESPP enables the Company to invite all US employees to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company on market using deductions from payroll.
In November 2010, the Company commenced making six-monthly invitations to employees.
The US ESPP also enables the Company to grant eligible US employees the right to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company using the proceeds of a savings contract.
If such a grant were made, when joining the US ESPP, participants would enter into a 12 month contract to save up to 15 per cent of base salary subject to an individual limit of $1,000 per month.
No grants of this nature have been made since 2003.

Employee share plans continued Global All Employee Share Purchase Plan GAESPP The GAESPP was initially approved by shareholders in 2001 with amendments being approved by shareholders in 2005 and 2011.
The GAESPP enables the Company to invite employees in countries other than the US or UK to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company on market using deductions from payroll.
In September 2011, the first such invitation was made to all employees in Canada, Hong Kong, France and Germany and subsequent invitations have been made in 2012.
The GAESPP can also be operated on similar terms to the US ESPP above, with participants entering into a 12 month contract to save up to 15 per cent of base salary subject to an individual limit.
2005 Sharesave Scheme The 2005 Sharesave Scheme was approved by shareholders in 2005 and was introduced following the expiry of the Savings Related Share Option Scheme.
The scheme is an HMRC-approved Save-As-You-Earn scheme open to all UK employees, subject to a qualifying service period.
No price is payable on the grant of an option.
The option exercise price is calculated by reference to the middle market closing price of an Ordinary Share on the business day prior to the beginning of the invitation period, discounted by up to 20 per cent at the Boards discretion.
Options are normally exercisable within six months of the third, fifth or seventh anniversary of the contract commencement date as elected by the option holder at the start of the contract.
No invitations have yet been made under this scheme.
Share-based payment The total credit charge for the year relating to employee share-based payment plans is as follows: 2013 2012 $ million $ million 2005 Employee Incentive Plan 1.2 1.6 All schemes are equity-settled.
3.3 million share incentives were granted during 2013 2012 2.0 million.
The fair value of share incentives has been estimated as at the date of grant using the Hull-White trinomial model.
The following table gives the assumptions made in arriving at the share-based payment charge and the fair value: 2013 2012 Weighted average share price pence 129.1 153.2 Weighted average exercise price pence 73.3 59.3 Weighted average fair value pence 59.0 78.1 Expected volatility % 33 35 Option life years Performance shares 3 3 Options and SARs 10 10 Suboptimal exercise factor 1.5 1.5 Risk free rate % 1.6 1.52.4 Dividend yield % 1.3 1.6 The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous two years which management considers to be the period which is likely to be most representative of future volatility.
The risk free rate is calculated by reference to UK government bonds.

The addition of DAX positions Spirent well to help service providers with the unprecedented challenges they face when developing and managing new services in mobile and wireline network environments of rapidly increasing complexity.
This acquisition will enable us to strengthen our Service Assurance portfolio, expanding Spirents addressable market in the live network.
On 20 February 2014 Spirent completed the acquisition of 58 per cent of the share capital of Testing Technologies IST GmbH Testing Tech which was in private ownership, for a cash consideration of Euro 2.0 million.
The company develops and markets standardised and customerspecific software-based testing tools which support the development of mission-critical products and workflow steps.
Testing Tech also participates in the connected vehicle market which will facilitate Spirents progress in this market.
The minority stake of 42 per cent of the share capital is the subject of a put and call option which expires on 31 March 2016.
The consideration is based on the 2015 performance of Testing Tech and set at a minimum amount of Euro 1.4 million.
Testing Tech will be reported within our Wireless and Service Experience division.
As both acquisitions have only very recently completed neither the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired, nor the consideration, have yet been determined.
