72 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
Prior period restatement With effect from 1 January 2013, the Group has adopted IAS 19 Employee Benefits revised in respect of accounting for defined benefit pension obligations.
This has resulted in a prior period adjustment for the year ended 31 December 2012.
There was no adjustment to the opening Statement of Financial Position at 31 December 2011.
The main change is that expected returns on plan assets are no longer recognised in profit or loss.
Expected returns are replaced by recording interest income or expense in profit or loss, which is calculated using the discount rate used to measure the pension obligation.
The impact of the prior period adjustment on the 2012 Income Statement, and the impact on the 2013 Income Statement from the adoption of IAS 19 Employee Benefits revised, is shown below: 2013 2012 m m Operating expenses 0.1 0.1 Finance revenue 12.1 10.7 Finance costs 11.0 10.3 Tax income 0.3 0.1 Decrease in profit for the year, after adopting IAS 19 Employee Benefits revised 0.9 0.4 Compared with the originally reported profit.
There is a movement through Other Comprehensive Income OCI which is equal and opposite to the movement in the Income Statement.
Hence there is no overall change in the net assets of the Group from the adoption of IAS 19 Employee Benefits revised and, therefore, there is no adjustment to the Statement of Financial Position at 31 December 2012.
The Group has also adopted IAS 1 Presentation of Items in Other Comprehensive Income Amendments to IAS 1 for the year beginning 1 January 2013.
This amendment has changed the grouping of how items are presented in OCI.
Items which may be subsequently reclassified or recycled to profit or loss in the future are now presented separately from items that will never be subsequently reclassified.
The amendments do not change the nature of items that are recognised in OCI, nor do they impact the determination of whether items in OCI are subsequently reclassified through profit or loss in future periods.
The impact of the prior period adjustment on earnings per share is disclosed in note 11.
Operating segments From a management perspective, the Group has three operating units and therefore presents three operating segments for segment reporting purposes: F&C: F&C REIT: and Thames River Capital TRC.
While there are different sources of revenue and distinct distribution channels operating across segments, and assets under management can be categorised by client type and asset class, the Directors do not consider these to constitute separate operating segments within the meaning of IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
Management monitors the results of its three operating segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
Segment revenue, operating expenses, finance revenue and profit loss for the year include transactions between operating segments, which are eliminated on consolidation.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those of the Group.
ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2013 | 73 2.
Revenues from two external clients each represented 10% or more of the Groups total revenues in the prior year.
In the year ended 31 December 2013 the Group had no single client contributing as much as 10% of total revenues for the year, but the revenues for the largest clients which did so in the comparative period have been disclosed for information purposes.

Includes nil 31 December 2012: 0.6m of exceptional employment expenses as included in note 7 a ii.
The above table includes 6.3m 2012: 15.8m of exceptional expenses.
The monthly average number of employees and members including Executive Directors of the Group during 2013 was 725 2012: 852.
F&C Asset Management plc had no employees during either year.
Exceptional income and expenditure a Other exceptional operating expenses The Group has classified the following operating expenses as exceptional: 2013 2012 Notes m m TRC Commutation expenses i 2.7 1.6 Exceptional employment expenses ii 2.4 8.2 Exceptional outsourcing expenses iii 1.6 3.3 TRC Management Retention Plan expense iv 1.2 6.2 Exceptional premises expenses v 0.3 1.3 F&C Partners litigation expense vi 1.3 8.2 21.9 i TRC Commutation expenses The Divisional Members of TRC Investment Teams entered into put and call options at the time of the TRC acquisition, which, if exercised, would typically transfer up to 20% of their entitlement to management fee profits to the F&C Group.
Under IFRS, the share element of the consideration payable under these Commutation arrangements requires to be accounted for as a share-based payment.
The expense of 2.7m recognised in 2013 comprises a 1.0m charge for the Investment Teams where options have been exercised and a further charge of 1.7m for the remaining call option which was expected to be exercised by F&C in April 2014.
Given the capital nature of these arrangements, the Directors consider it appropriate to treat the total Commutation expense as exceptional in nature and exclude it from the measurement of underlying earnings for each financial year.
78 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 7.
Exceptional income and expenditure continued ii Exceptional employment expenses During the year ended 31 December 2013 a further 2.4m 2012: 8.2m of non-recurring redundancy and related staff costs were incurred in order to achieve the staff cost savings identified as part of the strategic review.
The Directors consider these non-recurring employment expenses to be exceptional in nature and have therefore excluded them from the measurement of underlying earnings.
iii Exceptional outsourcing expenses During 2013, a further 1.2m of advisory and consultancy costs were incurred in completing the project to outsource certain of the Groups back and middle office investment operations to State Street.
In addition, 0.4m of non-recurring costs were incurred as part of implementing strategic changes.
The Directors consider these project costs to be exceptional in nature, and have therefore excluded this expense from the measurement of underlying earnings for each financial year.
iv TRC Management Retention Plan expense As a condition of the acquisition of TRC, the Group established a Management Retention Plan MRP to retain and incentivise certain TRC personnel.
The MRP expense including NIC recognised in the Income Statement for the year ended 31 December 2013 is 1.2m 2012: 6.2m.
Details of this share-based payment arrangement are given in note 26 d. Given the quantum and nature of this award, the Directors consider it appropriate to treat the associated expense as exceptional and exclude it from the measurement of underlying earnings for each financial year.
v Exceptional premises expenses As part of the Groups cost-saving initiatives, several actions have been taken in respect of a number of premises to reduce the recurring level of property costs.
A net cost of 0.3m has been incurred during 2013 2012: a net cost of 1.3m, comprising restructuring costs of 0.7m offset by a 0.4m release of excess onerous property provisions recognised in previous periods, following the successful reassignment and termination of lease arrangements.
vi F&C Partners litigation expense The F&C Partners litigation was settled in 2012, resulting in a net expense of 1.3m being recognised in the Income Statement for that year.
Details of the movement in the associated provision during 2012 are given in note 24.
Given the nature of this expense and the quantum of costs previously incurred, the Directors considered it appropriate to treat this expense as exceptional in nature and excluded it from the measurement of underlying earnings for 2012. b F&C REIT put option fair value loss gain 2013 2012 m m F&C REIT put option fair value loss gain 3.0 11.5 The fair value of the F&C REIT put option liability, as disclosed in note 28, reflects the value of the portion of the F&C REIT business which is currently owned by the non-controlling interest partners and which is the subject of options.
The 3.0m increase in the fair value of the option liability during 2013 has been recognised as a loss in the Income Statement 2012: gain of 11.5m.
The Directors consider the put option liability movements to be of a capital nature, and have therefore excluded the associated loss or gain from the measurement of underlying earnings for each financial year.

A 3% reduction in the UK Corporation Tax rate was substantively enacted during the year to take effect in 2014 and 2015.
The effect of these tax rate changes enacted has been to decrease the net deferred tax assets of the Group by 1.3m, comprising a 1.1m charge through the Income Statement and a 0.2m charge to equity reflecting the deferred tax that is expected to reverse through equity.
The 3% reduction in the UK Corporation Tax rate will lead to a Group statutory Corporation Tax rate of 21.50% for 2014 and 20.25% for 2015.
No additional rate changes have been substantively enacted since the reporting date.
ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2013 | 81 11.
Earnings per share Basic earnings loss per share amounts are calculated by dividing the earnings loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings loss per share amounts are calculated by dividing the earnings loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential Ordinary Shares into Ordinary Shares at the reporting date.
In the opinion of the Directors the underlying earnings, as quantified in the Reconciliation of earnings loss table below, more accurately reflect the underlying earnings performance of the Group.
The impact of the prior period adjustment for the adoption of IAS 19 Employee Benefits revised, as explained in note 1, on the 2012 profit loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent and on the basic and diluted earnings loss per share is as follows: 2012 Profit loss attributable to equity holders of the parent Gross Tax Net Basic EPS Diluted EPS m m m pp As originally reported 5.1 5.2 0.1 0.01 0.01 Prior period adjustment 0.5 0.1 0.4 0.07 0.07 As restated 5.6 5.3 0.3 0.06 0.06 2012 2013 as restated Reconciliation of earnings loss per Ordinary Share p p Basic earnings loss per Ordinary Share 1.52 0.06 Amortisation and impairment of intangibles 5.25 5.25 TRC Commutation expenses 0.48 0.30 Exceptional employment expenses 0.32 1.13 Exceptional outsourcing expenses 0.22 0.47 TRC Management Retention Plan expense 0.11 1.02 Exceptional premises expenses 0.06 0.21 F&C Partners litigation expense 0.19 F&C REIT put option fair value loss gain 0.54 2.16 Deferred Tax Corporation Tax rate change 0.34 0.36 Underlying earnings per Ordinary Share 8.84 6.71 Foreign exchange gains losses included within underlying earnings per share 0.06 0.28 Underlying earnings per Ordinary Share excluding foreign exchange gains and losses 8.78 6.99 As restated for the adoption of IAS 19 Employee Benefits revised, as disclosed in note 1.

Where the Group has incurred a basic loss per Ordinary Share, no dilution arises despite the dilutive potential weighted average number of Ordinary Shares being greater than the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares used to determine the basic loss per share.
As a result, the reported basic and diluted loss per Ordinary Share are the same in 2012.
All amounts disclosed in the table above are stated net of any attributable tax, as presented in the following Reconciliation of earnings loss table.

Earnings per share continued Potential future dilution The following share-based payment arrangements could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future, but were not included in the above calculation of diluted earnings per share because they were either anti-dilutive for the years presented or had not met the relevant performance criteria at the reporting date: Long-Term Remuneration Plan Restricted Awards Details of the estimated vesting percentages used for accounting purposes are disclosed in note 26 a ii.
F&C REIT variable NCI SBP This earn-out arrangement gives the F&C REIT NCI partners the opportunity to increase their ownership of F&C REIT from 30% to 40% before 31 December 2014.
At 31 December 2013, the Directors do not expect any of the ownership percentage to transfer.
Any transfer would potentially dilute the profits attributable to the equity holders of the parent.
However, the principle of this incentive arrangement is that the incremental profits which would become attributable to NCI as a result of achieving the performance criteria are funded from the increased level of absolute profits generated by F&C REIT for the year in which vesting arises, rather than diluting the current level of profits attributable to equity holders of the parent.
There can be no guarantee that, subsequent to vesting, the higher level of profits which met the vesting criteria would be sustainable.
Details of this arrangement are disclosed in note 26 b. TRC Management Incentive Plan Details of this plan are disclosed in note 26 e. 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme At 31 December 2013 all options outstanding have vested.
These options have an exercise price of 240.83p and are anti-dilutive as the option prices are above the average share price for the year.
Details of this Scheme are disclosed in note 26 i.

This brings full-year dividends for 2013 to 3.0p per share, which is the same as that paid in respect of 2012.
The entitlement of Employee Benefit Trusts to receive dividends on some of their holdings of F&C shares has been waived by the Trustees.

ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2013 | 85 14.
Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Goodwill Goodwill has arisen from various business combinations and, reflecting the Groups reportable operating segments disclosed in note 2, is represented by three cash-generating units CGUs, as follows: 31 December 31 December 2013 2012 m m F&C 467.2 467.2 F&C REIT 127.9 127.9 Thames River Capital 16.8 16.8 611.9 611.9 Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually at individual CGU level, or when indicators of potential impairment are identified.
The carrying value of goodwill attributable to each CGU was tested for impairment as at 31 December 2013, as described below: to date, none of the CGUs has suffered any impairment of goodwill.
Investment management contracts management contracts Management contracts predominantly relate to contracts arising from business acquisitions.
Management contracts are amortised over their expected useful lives and are tested for impairment only when indicators of potential impairment are identified.
Such an indicator was identified in 2013 in the REIT property contracts and, as a result of the impairment review undertaken, an impairment charge of 1.4m has been recognised in the year, and a change made to the relevant assets estimated useful life, which is reflected in the table below.
Further details are disclosed later in this note.
The foreign exchange gains recognised in the year arise from the relative strengthening of the Euro over the course of 2013, increasing the value of Euro-denominated contracts, primarily F&C insurance contracts, in Sterling terms.
The categories of management contracts, their carrying amounts at the year end, remaining amortisation periods and estimated useful lives are as follows: 31 December 2013 31 December 2012 Remaining Estimated Remaining Estimated Net book amortisation useful Net book amortisation useful values period life values period life m years years m years years F&C OEICs RSAI retail contracts 0.8 0 0.78 10 1.9 0 1.78 10 F&C insurance contracts 11.6 0.78 10 25.8 1.78 10 F&C institutional contracts 1.3 0.78 10 3.0 1.78 10 F&C investment trust contracts 5.4 2.5 10 7.5 3.5 10 F&C advisory and sub-advisory contracts 3.9 0.78 10 8.8 1.78 10 Private equity fund of funds 0.7 11 20 0.8 12 20 REIT property contracts 15.6 3.5 8.83 27.1 2.67 7 Thames River Capital contracts 3.8 0.67 4 9.6 1.67 4 43.1 84.5 Royal Sun Alliance Insurance RSAI.
Impairment testing of goodwill The recoverable amount of the CGUs has been determined on their value in use including terminal value at each respective testing date for 2012 and 2013.
The value in use is calculated by discounting the cash flow projections based on the latest annual financial budget, and managements forecasts.
A Euro Sterling exchange rate of1.17 1, which was assumed for the purposes of the 2014 budget 2013 budget: 1.23 1, has been kept constant for determining future cash flows.
A long-term growth rate is used to extrapolate the cash flows, reflecting the nature of the Groups business and the Boards current view that there is no reason to believe that the CGUs will not continue in operation in perpetuity.
The key assumptions adopted in these calculations for each operating segment are as follows: 31 December 2013 31 December 2012 F&C F&C REIT TRC F&C F&C REIT TRC Discount rate 7.95% 7.95% 9.95% 9.15% 9.15% 11.15% Long-term market growth rate 5.45% 4.30% 6.05% 5.35% 4.45% 5.65% Inflation rate 4.20% 4.20% 4.20% 3.80% 3.80% 3.80% The costs included in year one of the projections reflect those included in the budget for the respective year.
86 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 14.
Goodwill and other intangible assets continued The discount rate is based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital to estimate a market relevant rate, calculated as at the year end, and takes into account the relative risks associated with the Groups various revenue streams included in the respective operating segments.
The same discount rate has been applied to the F&C and F&C REIT CGUs, reflecting the fact that the Board considers that the risk profiles are similar across those segments, with a degree of commonality in their client base.
Indeed, were it not for the distinct internal governance arrangements and separate management structures in place, the F&C REIT business would form part of a larger F&C CGU.
The discount rates disclosed above are the post-tax rates which have been applied in the projections: the pre-tax discount rates are 9.40% and 11.75% for F&C F&C REIT and TRC respectively 2012: 11.10% and 13.40% respectively.
All discount rates shown subsequently within this note are stated after tax.
Revenues are based on the budget for each operating segment, and managements net business flow forecasts for the subsequent four years.
Thereafter, revenues have been grown in line with the Groups long-term view of market growth, consistent with that experienced historically, in the long-term, across the markets in which assets are invested.
The different rates reflect the composite mix of assets held in each operating segment for each period.
Net new business revenues are included at the levels assumed in the 2014 budget and managements forecasts up to 2018 with no further net new business included thereafter.
Additional costs associated with the increased revenues have been included in the projections, primarily to reflect variable remuneration costs.
Projected operating costs for the first year are driven by the budgeted profit margins for each operating segment for 2014.
Thereafter, both existing budgeted costs and, as noted above, further costs added associated with net new business revenue forecasts have been grown at inflation rates to accord with anticipated future salary and other cost increases.
Values in use are compared to the carrying values of goodwill, attributable management contracts and other intangible assets net of associated deferred tax provisions, and property, plant and equipment in order to ascertain whether any impairment exists.
As this annual impairment review of goodwill indicated surpluses in all segments, no impairment has been recognised in the year in respect of goodwill 2012: nil.
The key assumptions noted in the above table are those to which the calculated values in use are most sensitive.
In order to assess the sensitivity of the key assumptions on the carrying values of goodwill, an analysis was conducted to ascertain the change that would be required to derive values in use which approximated to the carrying values of goodwill, and beyond which impairment would arise.
The absolute levels, on a standalone basis, of the key assumptions which most closely resulted in a match in the values in use to the carrying values of goodwill were as follows: 31 December 2013 31 December 2012 F&C F&C REIT TRC F&C F&C REIT TRC Discount rate 20.01% 11.49% 39.10% 18.28% 11.37% 28.81% Long-term market growth rate 0.81% 1.33% 8.91% 1.01% 2.16% 2.37% Inflation rate 7.92% 6.93% 12.75% 7.75% 6.21% 9.74% Per cent achievement of new business targets 0.00% 24.90% 0.00% 0.00% 30.93% 0.00% Impairment testing of intangible assets with finite lives During 2013, the Umbrella Agreement with Trafalgar Overseas Limited Trafalgar was renegotiated and renewed.
This agreement, signed on the acquisition of REIT in 2008, entitled F&C REIT to a fixed annual fee of 8.5m per annum for five years from September 2008, which will no longer be payable.
The loss of this revenue was considered to be an indicator of potential impairment of the REIT management contracts intangible asset.
In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, a full impairment review of this asset was undertaken as at 31 December 2013.
The review has resulted in the following impairment loss being recognised in the year: 31 December 2013 31 December 2012 F&C F&C REIT TRC F&C F&C REIT TRC m m m m m m REIT property contracts 1.4 No indicators of potential impairment existed in 2012 and therefore no impairment reviews of management contracts were undertaken in respect of that year.
The recoverable amount of the asset has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections based on the latest annual financial budget, and managements forecasts for the period of the revised estimated useful life.
ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2013 | 87 14.
Goodwill and other intangible assets continued The original estimate of the useful life of the intangible asset was seven years from the date of acquisition on 1 September 2008.
The useful life of the related management contracts has been reassessed.
Following consideration of the developments with Trafalgar in 2013, which included the negotiation of a renewed Umbrella Agreement, the contractual arrangements and typical lifespans of relevant underlying portfolios, and other relevant factors, management assessed the estimated useful life of the asset to be 3 years from 31 December 2013.
The revised useful life represents a change in accounting estimate and reduces the annual rate of amortisation from 1 January 2014 over the remaining life of the asset.
The annual amortisation charge will decrease by 4.9m compared to the charge had the impaired asset continued to be amortised over its original estimated useful life.
Accumulated impairment losses on management contracts at the year end are as follows: 31 December 31 December 2013 2012 CGU m m F&C 218.3 218.3 F&C REIT 1.4 Thames River Capital 219.7 218.3 15.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they cannot be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group, and they have arisen in companies that have not reported taxable profits for some time.
Financial instruments a Analysis of assets and liabilities at the reporting date Financial investments held in relation to the activities of the Groups insurance subsidiary have been classified as fair value through profit or loss within current assets.
Stocks of units and shares are held in relation to fund management activities and are classified as held for trading within current assets.
Financial investments included within non-current assets are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value or at amortised cost if fair value cannot be measured reliably.
Other loans and receivables included within non-current assets are carried at amortised cost.

From F&Cs perspective, the risks and rewards of managing these assets were the same as other assets under management, as the financial risks and rewards attributable to the assets invested fell to be borne by, or to the benefit of, the Groups clients.
Hence, while a number of financial instruments were recognised in the Statement of Financial Position in respect of this subsidiary, the key risk to the Group was the impact on the level of management fees which were earned from this entity and which were directly affected by the underlying value of policyholder assets.
Following a decision in 2012 to close the managed pension fund product, almost all client assets had been withdrawn by 31 December 2013, with the majority of these being reinvested within other F&C products.
As a result, there are no investments in respect of unit-linked contracts and limited unit-linked assets and policyholder cash as at 31 December 2013.
The amounts included in the Statement of Financial Position in respect of assets and liabilities held within unit-linked funds are as follows: 31 December 31 December 2013 2012 m m Fair value through profit or loss: Financial investments 134.2 Loans and receivables: Deferred acquisition costs 0.1 Trade and other receivables 0.1 0.3 Cash and cash equivalents 2.3 Total unit-linked assets less liabilities 0.1 136.9 Excludes 0.9m of non-linked policyholders cash 31 December 2012: 2.2m.

Fair value measurement i Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by category of valuation technique: Level 1: Quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: Techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.

The Level 1 assets are quoted prices in active markets.
These are listed funds or equities and assets with daily quoted prices.
The Level 2 assets are generally funds which are either pooled liquidity funds, offshore mutual funds or funds not quoted on a daily basis.
The investment contract liabilities are derived from the valuation of unit-linked assets.
The interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost.
The Level 3 assets are valuations of direct and carried interest holdings in private equity and property funds.
The F&C REIT put option liabilities as detailed in note 28 are externally valued at each reporting date by a valuation of the F&C REIT business using the techniques detailed below.
In the Directors opinion, there is no discernable difference between the carrying amount and fair values of cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables and payables, and other current liabilities, due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
Valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments: Listed securities and stock of units and shares The fair value of listed investments is based on quoted bid market prices at the reporting date without any deduction for transaction costs.
The fair value of the stock of units and shares is based on the daily market prices at the reporting date.
Unquoted investments The fair value of the unquoted investments has been estimated using International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines or property valuation techniques and in accordance with the underlying limited partnership agreements.
The Directors believe that the estimated fair values resulting from the valuation technique applied to unquoted shares which are recorded in the Statement of Financial Position, and the related realised fair value gains recorded in the Income Statement, are reasonable and the most appropriate at the reporting date.
ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2013 | 93 19.
Fair value measurement continued Where discounted cash flow techniques are used, estimated future cash flows are based on managements best estimates and the discount rate is a market-related rate for a similar instrument at the reporting date.
Where other pricing models are used, inputs are based on marketrelated data at the reporting date.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings The fair value of the Subordinated Notes and Guaranteed Loan Notes is based on a quoted market price at the reporting date.
Put options The fair value is based on an external valuation of the F&C REIT business, as detailed in note 28.

Sensitivities for level 3 While the Group believes that its estimates of fair value are appropriate, the use of different assumptions could lead to different measurements of fair value.
In respect of level 3 financial liabilities of the F&C REIT put options, changing one or more of the significant unobservable inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions, holding the other inputs constant, would have the following effects: Profit or loss Increase Decrease m m Risk adjusted recurring discount rate 1% movement to discount rate 5.3 4.3 Recurring fixed EBITDA multiple 1.0 x movement to multiple 3.3 3.3 Market EBITDA 10% movement to weighting 2.1 2.1 ii Fair value comparisons Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of all the Groups financial instruments.

This includes a number of vacant or sub-let properties which were either previously occupied or are partially occupied by the Group.
Provision has been made for the residual lease commitments where significant, after taking into account existing and expected sub-tenant contractual arrangements.
The remaining terms are for up to seven years.
Assumptions have been made as to whether each leasehold property may be sub-let or assigned in the future.
All leases are for minimum guaranteed rentals.
The provision is subject to uncertainties over time, including market rent reviews and break options within the lease arrangements.
In addition, exposure could exist if an existing tenant defaulted or went into liquidation or administration.
NIC on share schemes The provision for national insurance contributions NIC on share schemes represents the potential employers NIC liabilities in respect of a number of share-based payment schemes operated by the Group.
The provision is subject to uncertainties in respect of the extent to which performance conditions are met, movements in the Companys share price, the extent to which awards are forfeited and, where eligible, the timing of when employees choose to exercise options.
The current element of the provision for NIC on share schemes relates to awards which are expected to vest within one year.
At 31 December 2013, 2.6m 31 December 2012: 2.5m of financial investments were held by the Group to partially fund the NIC liability on the Deferred Investment Plan and Deferred Investment Option Plan.
This is disclosed in note 18 a i 2.
ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2013 | 99 24.
Provisions continued Long-term sickness The Group has long-term sickness insurance arrangements which cover the cost of absence from work of all current employees.
However, the cost of employees who became long-term absentees prior to these arrangements being established are self-insured by the Group.
The provision represents the expected present value of income protection payments due to these individuals.
This provision has been quantified on the assumption that all employees currently on long-term sick leave do not return to the employment of the Group.
The discount rate and salary growth assumptions used in each year are identical to those used for the purposes of determining UK defined benefit pension obligations.
Guaranteed product The provision for the guaranteed product represented the actuarially assessed cost of meeting potential obligations under certain investment products which have a guaranteed payout in the event of death of the investor.
The underlying investment plan was closed to new investors during 2004 and insurance arrangements are now in place to cover any exposure to the Group.
The remaining provision of 0.4m was therefore released during 2012.
Long-term service award This provision represents the obligation in respect of long-term service benefits to which some employees are entitled, including incremental holiday entitlement and long-term service awards.
F&C Partners litigation In June 2012, following a successful outcome from the Court of Appeal regarding the level of costs and interest to be borne by F&C in respect of the F&C Partners litigation, a full and final payment of 0.65m was paid to the founder partners.
As a result, the excess provision of 1.35m was released during the year ended 31 December 2012.
Further details of this litigation were disclosed in the Annual Report and Financial Statements for previous reporting periods.
Pension benefits The Group operates defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and participates in one in Portugal.
The plans provide benefits calculated on a final salary basis.
The UK scheme is closed to new entrants.
All new UK employees are eligible to benefit from defined contribution arrangements, which provide greater certainty over the future cost to the Group.
A former Chairman of the Group, Mr R W Jenkins, has a pension entitlement which commenced in January 2011 and is adjusted in line with the Retail Price Index on 1 January in each year.
The annual entitlement as at 1 January 2013 was 134,000.
The Group has not earmarked any assets to date with respect to this liability.
The Groups defined benefit pension plans are based on final salary payments and benefits are adjusted in line with the plans rules e. g. in line with price inflation in the UK once in payment during retirement.
The level of benefits provided depends on the members length of service and salary at retirement date.
The defined benefit pension plans require contributions to be made to separately administered funds.
These defined benefit pension plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.
Further details are set out under g below.
The net pension deficit is recognised under non-current liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position and is stated gross of the related deferred tax asset.
The results of the latest full actuarial valuations were updated at 31 December 2013 by qualified independent actuaries.

Pension benefits continued iv Sensitivities An estimate of the sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the schemes liabilities are set out below: Assumption Change in assumption Estimated impact on scheme liabilities Inflation Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 1.7% Salary increases Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 0.0% Pension increases Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 1.4% Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decrease increase by 2.2% Life expectancy Increase decrease by 1 year Increase decrease by 2.3% The salary increase sensitivity is shown as nil as the UK Pension Plan has a limit on pensionable salary increases of 2.0% per annum.
Given the current level of assumed future inflation, there is no effect from a 0.1% change in future salary increases.
Plans in other jurisdictions are affected by changes in their respective salary increase assumptions but the consolidated effect rounds to nil.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared using a similar method to the benefit obligation with one assumption varied in isolation.
There have been no changes to the methods used to prepare the sensitivity analysis since the previous reporting period.
The assumptions used have changed in line with those used to calculate the benefit obligation.

The FCAM Plans assets, which are managed by F&C and other external investment managers, are held under the control of the Trustees and are used to secure benefits for the members of the FCAM Plan and their dependants in accordance with the Trust Deed and Rules.
The Plan is subject to the UK Statutory Funding Objective regime, overseen by the Pensions Regulator, which is a form of minimum funding requirement for the purposes of IAS 19 Employee benefits revised.
Trustee Board of the FCAM Plan The appointment of Trustees is determined by the FCAM Plans trust documentation.
The Trustee Board currently consists of three employerappointed Trustees, three member-selected Trustees and an independent Trustee who is currently the Chairman of the Trustee Board.
Of the current employer-appointed and member-selected Trustees, four are employees of F&C and active members of the FCAM Plan, one is a deferred member and one is retired and receiving a pension from the FCAM Plan.
Relationship between F&C and the Trustees of the FCAM Plan The FCAM Plans assets are held in a separate Trustee-administered fund to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
The Trustees of the FCAM Plan are required to act in the best interests of the FCAM Plans beneficiaries.
ii Other pension schemes F&C Portugal Certain employees in Portugal participate in the multi-employer scheme, Fundo fide Pensoes do Grupo Banco Comercial Portugus.
The assets and liabilities of the scheme are separately identifiable.
There are no Trustees, and F&C Portugal manages the assets relating to the F&C members of the scheme.
The pension plan has two parts: the Basic Plan and the Complementary Plan.
The Complementary Plan provides an old age pension as well as death and disability benefits.
From 1 January 2011, this scheme has been integrated into the Social Security system and part of the employees occupational pension benefits is funded through the Social Security system from that date.
With effect from 1 January 2012, F&C Portugal decided to terminate the old age pension benefit provided to members from the Complementary Plan, and paid the value of the accrued benefits to the members or to individual policies for the members.
F&C Netherlands The Plan in The Netherlands is financed via an insurance contract.
There are no Trustees, but the Works Council participates in negotiations in respect of potential changes to the Plan.
ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2013 | 105 25.
Pension benefits continued F&C Ireland The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme in Ireland.
There are currently two Trustees of this plan, both of whom are former employees of F&C.
f Future funding requirements FCAM Plan A revised schedule of contributions was agreed in January 2011, under which the Group agreed to pay a minimum of 17.0% of pensionable salaries plus 3.0m per annum in respect of deficit recovery contributions, 0.5m per annum in respect of administrative expenses and any additional amounts required as a result of the asset underperformance guarantee.
Further, to the extent that the Group repays any amount of its fixed or floating rate notes after 1 January 2011, then the Group shall pay, within one month of that repayment, a special contribution to reduce the deficit determined in the valuation at 31 March 2010 in the same proportion as the aggregate reduction in fixed or floating rate notes.
If there is more than one such reduction, then the special contributions necessary shall be computed taking into account the aggregate percentage reduction in fixed or floating rate notes since 1 January 2011 and the amount of any previous such special contribution paid.
For the avoidance of doubt, a repayment does not include a repayment of the notes from the issue of a capital instrument specified for that purpose.
The minimum estimated contribution expected to be paid into the Plan during 2014 is 5.2m 2013: 5.3m.
As the FCAM Plan is a closed scheme, under the projected unit method the current service cost will tend to increase as a percentage of pensionable salaries as the average age of members increases.
RW Jenkins obligation The benefits in respect of Mr Jenkins are paid directly by the Company.
The expected amount in 2014 is 135,000.
Non-UK schemes The figures in the table below assume that future contributions will continue to be paid to the non-UK schemes at the level paid in 2013, with appropriate increases for future changes in salary assumptions.
Contributions to defined benefit schemes Amounts paid into the Groups defined benefit schemes in the past two years and expected future payments over the next five years are as follows: Contributions paid m 2012 8.1 2013 6.2 Expected future contributions m 2014 7.5 2015 5.2 2016 5.1 2017 5.0 2018 2.7 g Risk management i FCAM Plan Market investment risk The Trustees set general investment policy but delegate the responsibility for the selection of specific investments other than investments in respect of members voluntary contributions to the investment manager.
The Trustees regularly monitor the FCAM Plans investments.
The Trustees seek advice from their investment advisor and believe they have sufficient skills and expertise to make investment decisions based on this advice.
The Trustees have set performance and risk targets for the investment managers.
The performance objectives are long term, and the Trustees monitor the investment managers on a regular basis in order to ensure that the Plan is on track to meet its long-term objectives.
If the assets of the Plan do not perform as expected, the Company may have to make additional contributions to make up the shortfall.
The results of an asset-liability review undertaken alongside the 31 March 2010 actuarial valuation of the Plan have been used to assist the Trustees and the Group in managing volatility in the underlying investment performance and the risk of a significant increase in the FCAM Plans deficit by providing information used to determine the FCAM Plans investment strategy.
106 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 25.
Pension benefits continued During the year, the Trustees, with the agreement of F&C, decided to further diversify the FCAM Plans investment strategy by introducing an allocation to a further private equity fund.
The Liability Driven Investment LDI holdings were updated to include exposure to F&Cs dynamic LDI funds.
Interest rate and inflation risk The liabilities of the Plan are calculated with respect to the yields available on interest rate swaps.
In addition, a large part of the benefits under the Plan is linked to price inflation.
Hence, if interest rates fall, or inflation expectations rise without a corresponding increase in the value of the Plan assets, a shortfall will arise and the Company may have to make additional contributions in order to rectify this.
The Trustees have implemented a LDI strategy in order to hedge the interest and inflation risk.
The LDI pools are intended to help provide a degree of matching to the liabilities of the FCAM Plan.
Each pool has leveraged exposure of varying amounts to inflation and interest rates.
The pools are valued using the market values of the underlying securities.
The equity-linked bond funds also provide a degree of matching to the liabilities but, in addition, retain an exposure to equity market movements through the use of equity futures.
Longevity risk If members live longer than anticipated, the value of the FCAM Plans liabilities will increase.
The current assumptions include an allowance for life expectancy to increase over time: however, it is possible that rates of improvement could be faster than assumed.
The corresponding increase in liabilities could lead to an increase in the contributions required to fund the FCAM Plan.
Currency risk In order to increase the diversification of the equity portfolio, the FCAM Plan invests in overseas assets.
However, the FCAM Plans liabilities are denominated entirely in Sterling and, therefore, there is a risk that the appreciation of Sterling against other currencies will reduce the return from overseas assets.
Operational risk The investment managers do not directly hold any of the FCAM Plans securities: these are held by an external custodian.
The assets are ringfenced from F&Cs creditors and are therefore transferable.
ii Non-UK schemes The plan in The Netherlands is financed via an insurance contract.
The value of the plan assets is the value of the reserve which the insurance company holds to match guaranteed pension liabilities.
These reserves are, in effect, fixed interest instruments, and so provide a reasonable match to pension liabilities.
The plan in Portugal is part of an industry-wide banking sector plan.
Each participant company holds a share of the assets, which are invested using the same asset allocation as the overall plan assets.
F&C Portugal is the asset manager for the overall scheme.
At 31 December 2013, the assets of both the F&C Portugal and F&C Ireland plans were invested in diversified portfolios that consisted primarily of debt and equity securities.

Details of option pricing models and key assumptions used to obtain the fair value of services received, or the fair value of the equity instruments granted, have been disclosed only for awards granted during the year ended 31 December 2013.
Details of awards granted in previous accounting periods are disclosed in the previous years Financial Statements.
The fair value of services received in return for awards granted is measured by reference to the fair value of share awards granted.
The cash-settled element of the awards is based on dividends payable on the shares during the vesting period, being notionally re-invested in F&C Asset Management plc shares.
Once the share awards vest, the value of the notional shares is paid to the employee in cash.
The value of dividend payments has been separated from the equity-settled awards as these are settled in cash.

Share-based payments continued The cumulative expense for each award is trued-up during the vesting period and at the end of the vesting period, after allowing for actual forfeitures and, where applicable, the extent to which the performance criteria have been met.
The weighted average share price during 2013 was 0.99 2012: 0.82.
The weighted average share price at exercise date during 2013 was 0.96 2012: 0.80.

ii Restricted Share Awards 2010, 2011 and 2013 Awards Ordinary Shares that are the subject of a Restricted Share Award under the LTRP will vest dependent upon achieving four specified performance conditions and conditions of continued service being met.
The performance conditions applied to the LTRP are determined by the Board, are measured over a three or four-year performance period, and comprise the following: 25% of the award comprises an underlying EPS condition: 25% of the award comprises a Total Shareholder Return TSR condition: 25% of the award comprises an Investment Performance condition: and 25% of the award comprises a Net New Business condition.
To the extent that any element of the award has not vested in accordance with the performance criteria detailed below it expires immediately.
1 The EPS element 2013 award The 2013 share awards under the LTRP are subject to specific underlying EPS conditions and conditions of continued service being met.

b F&C REIT variable non-controlling interests SBP In accordance with the F&C REIT Partnership Agreement, the F&C REIT non-controlling partners Kendray Properties Limited, Leo No and Ivor Smith have the potential to increase their stake in F&C REIT Asset Management LLP F&C REIT collectively from 30% to 40%.
A variable NCI entitlement exists as an incentive to achieve increased levels of profit including realisation of future performance fees in return for a potential increased stake in the business.
This variable NCI entitlement is therefore accounted for under IFRS 2: Share-based Payment.
The fair value of the award at date of acquisition reflected the value assessed as part of the acquisition valuation.
The fair value of the award is reassessed at each reporting date and this fair value is spread over the relevant vesting period.
The non-controlling partners have the potential to increase their stake in F&C REIT by 3.33% for every year in which the EBITDA performance target of 45.0m is achieved, up to a maximum of 10%.
The performance criterion could be achieved in any year of the six calendar years ending 31 December 2014.
At 31 December 2013 the Directors continued to assess that the performance target is unlikely to be achieved in the final performance measurement year.
c F&C REIT Long-Term Remuneration Plan F&C REIT LTRP There are two elements to the Plan which was introduced to incentivise F&C REIT employees: i Deferred Awards with no performance conditions: and ii Restricted Awards with performance conditions.
Participants are awarded notional units in the F&C REIT Asset Management LLP Group F&C REIT, each equal to 0.00005% of the market value of F&C REIT.
The market value of F&C REIT is determined annually by an independent valuation.
The Deferred Awards vest at the end of a predetermined period from grant date normally three years, subject to the continued employment of the participant.
On vesting, the awards are settled by a cash payment based on the market value of each unit at the end of the vesting period, together with a pro-rated share of distributions made during the vesting period.
No Restricted Awards have been granted under the performance element of this Plan before 31 December 2013.
The number of F&C REIT LTRP Deferred Awards is as follows: 2013 2012 Units Units Outstanding at 1 January 46,812.74 43,608.24 Granted during the year 10,886.52 19,569.54 Exercised during the year 12,119.23 15,890.98 Forfeited during the year 474.06 Outstanding at 31 December 45,580.03 46,812.74 No awards were exercisable at 31 December 2013 or 31 December 2012.

d Thames River Capital Management Retention Plan TRC MRP The TRC MRP was one of the two new share plans established at the date of the TRC acquisition to retain and incentivise key professionals within the TRC Group.
Awards of deferred shares vested three years after completion of the acquisition, subject to continued employment within the F&C Group or membership of one of the two TRC LLPs.
The TRC MRP awards were not subject to any performance criteria.
The TRC MRP included good and bad leaver provisions.
The number of TRC MRP awards is as follows: 2013 2012 No.
Outstanding at 1 January 19,183,301 21,312,209 Exercised during the year 19,183,301 Expired during the year 2,128,908 Outstanding at 31 December 19,183,301 Exercisable at 31 December 11,423,917 The awards vested on 1 September 2013.
The awards exercisable at 31 December 2012 related to good leavers.
e Thames River Capital Management Incentive Plan TRC MIP The TRC MIP is the second of two plans established at the date of the TRC acquisition to further incentivise TRC employees and members of the two TRC LLPs in the six-year period from the date of acquisition Completion on 1 September 2010.
Awards under the TRC MIP vest upon achievements of specified financial targets as follows: 12.5% of the shares subject to awards vest on the date falling 30 months following Completion provided that the Run-rate EBITDA of the TRC Group as at 31 December 2011 is 15.0m or more.
If the Run-rate EBITDA is 12.5m or less, none of this tranche of shares vests and the number of the shares that vest increases on a linear basis if the Run-rate EBITDA falls between the two thresholds: 12.5% of the shares subject to awards vest on the third anniversary of Completion provided that the Run-rate EBITDA of the TRC Group as at 30 June 2012 is 17.0m or more.
If the Run-rate EBITDA is 15.0m or less, none of this tranche of shares vests and the number of the shares that vest increases on a linear basis if the Run-rate EBITDA falls between the two thresholds: and the remaining 75.0% of the shares subject to awards will vest in two equal instalments on each of the fifth and sixth anniversaries of Completion provided that the cumulative EBITDA of the TRC Group for the four-year period to 31 March 2014 is equal to 100.0m or more.
If the cumulative EBITDA is equal to 60.0m or less, none of this tranche of shares will vest and the number of the shares that vest will increase on a linear basis if the Run-rate EBITDA falls between these two thresholds.
The first two specified financial targets were not achieved and the associated 25% of awards expired.
Vesting of the remaining 75% of awards is also subject to continued employment within the F&C Group or membership of the relevant LLP as the case may be.
The terms of the TRC MIP include good and bad leaver provisions, change of control provisions and a cash-settled element.
In addition, participants in the TRC MIP will receive an additional cash payment up to a maximum aggregate amount of 3.0m, payable at the time that shares are delivered and in proportion to the number of shares which vest.
The Directors believe that the remaining financial target will not be achieved.

f Thames River Capital Commutation arrangements TRC Commutation arrangements The Divisional Members of Investment Teams have entered into put and call options which, if exercised, will transfer value to F&C by way of variation of the entitlements to the allocation of management fee profits as defined in the underlying legal agreements and capital profits in the respective LLP.
The exercise of these options will increase TRC UKs share of the management fee profits of the respective Investment Teams by up to 20%.
These options were exercisable: 18 months after Completion: At the option of the Investment Teams, TRC UK would purchase an additional 10% of the management fee profits of each Investment Team.
The option for Investment Teams to exercise this put option was conditional on that teams respective net fund flows being positive for the twelve months preceding the option exercise period.
36 months after Completion: FCAM has a call option to purchase, through TRC UK, typically, an additional 20% of the management fee profits of each of the Investment Teams.
The level of 20% is reduced by the percentage of any profits which have already been commuted at an earlier date.
The 18 36 months options to acquire such management fee profits may be deferred for a period of twelve months if the F&C EBITDA Multiple, which is one of the components used to quantify the Commutation consideration, is less than five.
The Commutation consideration may be satisfied in two tranches, at F&Cs sole discretion, by: The allotment and issue at the relevant Commutation completion date to each Divisional Member of such number of F&C shares as shall have a value equal to 50% of the consideration, or the payment to the Divisional Members of 50% of the consideration in cash at the relevant Commutation completion date: and The allotment and issue at the relevant Commutation completion date to a Nominee of such number of F&C shares as shall have a value equal to 50% of the consideration Deferred Commutation Shares, or in certain circumstances the payment of 50% of the consideration in cash on the date falling 24 months after the relevant Commutation completion date.
Deferred Commutation Shares shall be released by the Nominee 24 months after the Commutation completion date, provided the Member continues to provide services to the respective LLP or has ceased to do so in certain good leaver circumstances.
The members of the LLPs are considered to be providing services to the Group and as a result, the share element of the Commutation consideration is required to be accounted for as a share-based payment.
It is the intention of the Directors to settle these awards in equity and therefore they have been treated as equity-settled awards.
The maximum payable under Commutation arrangements is 81.4m and F&C has authority to issue a maximum of 122,511,485 shares to settle the consideration payable on exercise of the options.
The options are re-measured at intrinsic value at each reporting date and the total expense is spread over the respective vesting period.
The options are considered to have non-market performance conditions if the options are not exercised, then there is no charge to the Income Statement.
114 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 26.
Share-based payments continued Three TRC Investment Teams exercised their put options during the year ended 31 December 2012.
These exercises transferred a further entitlement of the management fee profits typically 10% to the F&C Group.
F&C settled these awards through the issue of FCAM shares.

However, at 31 December 2013, 4.9 million 31 December 2012: 3.8 million shares relate to the options potentially exercisable by the Group.
One F&C option exercise date in respect of Commutation arrangements was deferred until April 2014, on agreement of both parties, from the original exercise date of 1 September 2013.
There was no incremental fair value resulting from the modification, as the awards are measured at intrinsic value.
The other Commutation options expired on 1 September 2013 as the Company chose not to exercise its options.
The remaining shares could vest at dates up to 1 September 2016. g Deferred Share Awards The Group has made some Deferred Share Awards which are not subject to ongoing performance conditions, but have a time-vesting period.
The number of share awards is as follows: 2013 2012 No.

The remaining award vested on 1 April 2014. h Purchased Equity Plan PEP The PEP operated in conjunction with the discretionary bonus scheme and was intended to encourage shareholding by management and employees of the Group by providing for the compulsory purchase of FCAM plc shares using annual bonus above a threshold level.
At the Boards discretion, eligible employees who were awarded in a financial year an aggregate bonus in excess of a threshold level, typically 100,000, were required to defer one-third of the element exceeding the threshold into shares comprising either a range of investment products managed by the Group or the Companys shares for three years.
This Compulsory PEP is subject to forfeiture in the event that the employee leaves the Group for any reason other than as a good leaver in the three-year retention period.
The number of Compulsory PEP share awards is as follows: 2013 2012 No.

Share-based payments continued i 2002 Executive Share Option Schemes 2002 ESOS IFRS 2: Share-based Payment is only applied to grants of shares, share options or other equity instruments that were granted after 7 November 2002 and had not vested before 1 January 2005 i. e. the effective date of IFRS 2.
The 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme granted options before 7 November 2002 and was not therefore subject to the full effects of IFRS 2 in terms of recognising an expense in the Income Statement.
The standard does, however, require certain disclosures to be made in respect of this scheme.

The NCI partners have the right to require F&C to acquire all or part of their membership interests in F&C REIT at a valuation determined by an independent valuer, subject to an overall cap on F&Cs liability of 100.0m.
Ivor Smiths option was capable of being exercised on 1 September 2011 and Leo Nos option becomes exercisable on 1 September 2015, being the seventh anniversary of the REIT acquisition.
While Kendray Properties Limited does not have any direct right to require F&C to acquire its holding in F&C REIT, under the terms of the Partnership Agreement, Kendray cannot hold a greater interest in F&C REIT than the aggregate of Leo Nos and Ivor Smiths interests or the holder of their beneficial interests and is therefore effectively required to transfer an element of its holding such that this requirement is achieved.
The consideration for such a transfer would be fair value.
Hence, in determining the gross liability of the option, Kendray Properties Limiteds entire holding in F&C REIT has been included.
The increase in the fair value of the F&C REIT put option liabilities of 3.0m during 2013 2012: 11.5m reduction has been recognised in the Income Statement as detailed in note 7 b.
An external valuation of the F&C REIT business is performed at each reporting date to enable a fair value to be placed on the F&C REIT put option liabilities.
Details of the valuation of the F&C REIT put option are disclosed in note 19 on page 93.

Reserves The analysis of movements in reserves is disclosed within the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity on page 60.
Nature and purpose of reserves: Share premium account The share premium account is used to record the issue of share capital in excess of par value.
Capital redemption reserve The Capital redemption reserve is used to maintain the capital of the Company when shares are bought back and subsequently cancelled without Court Approval.
Merger reserve The merger reserve is used to record share premium on shares issued by way of consideration in respect of acquisitions.
The element of the merger reserve which relates to intangible assets is considered to be realised in line with the associated amortisation and impairment charges to the Income Statement.
A transfer is made from the merger reserve to retained earnings to recognise the extent to which the merger reserve has been realised, thereby offsetting the corresponding element of the intangible amortisation and any impairment charge.
Other reserves: Foreign currency translation reserve The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations and non-Sterling denominated intangible assets.
Fair value reserve This reserve records fair value changes on available for sale investments until the investments are derecognised.
Acquisition reserve The acquisition reserve was created on the initial recognition of the F&C REIT NCI put option liabilities.

Contingent liabilities Ongoing business operations In the normal course of its business, the Group is subject to matters of litigation or dispute.

Financial risk management Overview The Group has exposure to a number of business risks.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the Groups risk management arrangements, but has delegated the implementation and operation of the Board policies to management.
The Groups risk management policies and the risk management framework for identifying, monitoring and managing risks across the Group, including strategic and operational risks, are outlined in the Directors Report on Corporate Governance on page 31 and the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group, together with actions taken to mitigate these risks are outlined on pages 11 and 12 of the Strategic Report.
The Directors consider it appropriate to differentiate between those financial risks which directly impact the Group and those which indirectly impact the Group due to the risks borne by our clients and the consequential impact on the Groups assets under management and revenues.
The Groups direct or indirect exposure to financial instruments arises from the following financial risks: Credit risk: Liquidity risk: and Market risk, which comprises: Market price risk Foreign currency risk Interest rate risk This note presents information on the Groups direct or indirect exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing these risks and the management of the Groups capital.
Note 36 provides numerical analysis of the Groups financial instrument exposure to such risks, including relevant sensitivity analysis, at the reporting date.
Indirect earnings risk through client assets As an active fund manager, the Group is responsible for managing assets in accordance with the mandates specified by our clients.
The assets managed by the Group are, to varying degrees, subject to the financial risks outlined above.
While these risks could result in financial loss or gain through a change in asset value, these risks and rewards are fully borne by, or fall to the benefit of, our clients.
However, as the majority of the Groups revenues are quantified as a percentage of assets under management generally on a quarterly, monthly or daily basis, the Groups income is impacted by movements in client assets which are caused by the exposure to financial risks.
As a result of the direct link of revenues to the value of client assets, the Groups interests are aligned to those of our clients.
A key risk to our business is that of poor investment performance, which could lead to the subsequent loss of client mandates.
A key role of the heads of F&Cs investment functions is to monitor the fund performance achieved by our investment professionals.
Where it is considered necessary, actions are taken to change process or personnel with a view to attaining top quartile performance.
The Group has the ability to earn performance fees from a number of our clients based on absolute performance or where out-performance of the benchmark or set objective is achieved.
These arrangements reinforce the alignment of the Groups interests with those of our clients.
Direct earnings and capital risk exposure The Group has direct exposure to the following risks in respect of financial instruments on the Statement of Financial Position: Credit risk the risk of financial loss to the Group if a client or counterparty to a financial instrument is unable to pay, in full, amounts when due, and arises principally from the Groups cash and cash equivalents and trade debtors and accrued income.
Liquidity risk the risk of the Group failing to maintain adequate levels of financial resources to enable it to meet its financial obligations as they fall due, or can only do so at a significantly increased cost.
Market price risk the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will change due to movements in market prices, other than foreign exchange rates or interest rates.
Foreign currency risk the Group is exposed to foreign currency risk from the Sterling value of cash flows arising from transactions denominated in a foreign currency.
Foreign currency risk arises from translating balances denominated in a currency other than Sterling and therefore the Sterling value of those balances could vary adversely.
Interest rate risk the Group is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through the variable-rate interest received on cash deposits and through borrowing at fixed rates.
A fuller analysis follows of the financial risks associated with the Groups financial instruments, together with the objectives, policies and processes to manage the Groups exposure to those risks.
ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2013 | 121 35.
Financial risk management continued Unit-linked assets and liabilities The financial risk management disclosures specifically exclude policyholders unit-linked assets and liabilities relating to F&C Managed Pension Funds Limited F&C MPF as there is no direct exposure to the Group from the associated financial instruments.
In addition, following the decision to close the underlying product associated with this business, there are no material related assets or liabilities as at 31 December 2013.
Financial investments Recognising that the Groups revenue stream has significant financial exposure to fluctuations in assets managed on behalf of clients, a key principle of the Group Treasury Policy set by the Board is to restrict investment of the Groups assets to low risk deposits or money-market instruments where the risk of capital loss is low, thereby seeking to protect the Groups capital.
Advance Board approval is required for any investment or financial instrument which does not follow this general principle.
Financial investments classified as available for sale, as detailed in note 15, primarily reflect the value of certain of the Groups legacy private equity investments.
These represent carried interest entitlement which arises from the Groups historical ownership of private equity businesses.
The Board does not seek to manage any of the financial risks associated with these investments and recognises that uncertainty exists as to the quantum and timing of future distributions which may arise from these investments, although generally it is expected that the level of future cash flows arising from these assets will diminish over time.
Other financial investments, classified as fair value through profit or loss, as detailed in note 18 a i 2, primarily comprise assets held in connection with current or historical employee remuneration arrangements.
The NIC hedge economically hedges the Groups exposure to movements in future national insurance contributions obligations in respect of legacy employee share plans.
Stock of units and shares The Group operates and manages a number of OEICs whose funds, into which retail and institutional investors can invest, have a wide range of investment objectives.
The Group holds a stock of units and shares in these OEIC funds in order to facilitate the creation and redemption of units by investors.
The Groups risk management policy limits the aggregate value of the units held by the Group to 2.5m, thereby capping the maximum financial risk exposure associated with these assets.
Trade debtors and accrued income Trade debtors and accrued income represent amounts recognised within net revenue in the Income Statement, but which have not been settled in cash.
The nature of F&Cs business is such that asset management fees accrue based on daily, month-end or quarter-end asset values which, once known, are billed to clients and are due to be settled in line with individual contractual terms.
As a result, the aggregate value of debtors and accrued income can typically represent up to four months of revenue at any point in time.
Before the Group takes on new clients, it undertakes the required Know Your Client procedures.
As the Group manages assets on behalf of clients and management fees are typically charged to and paid from the underlying funds managed by the Group, there is a relatively low risk of default on management fees.
The Group does not hold any credit insurance.
Due to the scale of some of F&Cs larger clients, the Group is exposed to a concentration of credit risk from large clients or groups of connected clients, arising from the timing difference between the recognition of income and the receipt of management fees outlined above.
Very few clients have an external credit rating.
Within F&C REIT, the Groups property asset management business, certain contractual arrangements provide for settlement of asset management fees on realisation of the property portfolio, to the extent that surplus liquid resources are not available in the fund.
As at 31 December 2013 some 2.9m of debtors are in this category.
In addition, a further receivable of 13.3m exists for which the cash will be settled from the realisation of property assets, although the Group also has collateral over separate assets with a view to mitigating any default exposure.
Further details are given on page 125.
Where management fees are denominated in a currency other than Sterling, the Group is exposed to currency risk.
The Board recognises that the Group has significant exposure to Euro-denominated cash flows, although, following the loss of some of the Achmea own risk assets, this exposure has reduced.
At this point in time the Board has not chosen to enter into any medium or long-term forward exchange contracts.
OEIC and unit trust debtors OEIC and unit trust debtors include trustee debtors and debtors due from investors in respect of the purchase of units and shares in openended funds.
Typically, the Group recognises OEIC and unit trust creditors of a similar magnitude at any point in time.
In operating and managing OEICs, the Group seeks to match the purchase and sale of investments to align to the receipt or payment of funds from or to investors.
However, if these obligations are not matched then there is a requirement for the Group to fund any shortfall from its corporate cash resources.
The risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered small due to the short settlement period involved.
In the event that investors default on sums due, then the Group is entitled to reimbursement of costs from the investor.
122 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 35.
Financial risk management continued Cash and cash equivalents F&C adopts a low risk approach to treasury management and seeks to ensure that its capital is preserved and financial risks are managed appropriately.
The Group treasury operations are managed by the Finance function within parameters defined by the Board.
The regulatory capital and treasury positions of the Group are reported to the Board on a regular basis.
The Groups cash and cash equivalent assets are exposed to a number of financial risks in the normal course of its business.
The policy adopted is designed to manage risk and recognises that treasury management operations are specifically not treated as a profit centre.
The key aspects of this policy and its implementation are detailed below: Funds on deposit will only be placed on a short-term basis maximum term 90 days to help maximise regulatory capital and limit any liquidity risk.
Deposits may only be placed with counterparties approved by the Group Credit and Counterparty Approval Committee, and the Board has set a 25.0m limit for the maximum exposure to any single counterparty.
The Committees primary focus is to assess the credit position of counterparties prior to placing any assets with them and to monitor credit risk thereafter.
Exposure to cash and cash equivalent balances held in foreign currency is managed to reduce the risk of adverse movements in exchange rates, where possible, by the repatriation of surplus foreign currency into Sterling.
This is achieved in practice via the regular settlement of the Groups transfer pricing arrangements and through the payment of dividends from foreign subsidiaries, having regard to any restrictions in respect of their respective legal, regulatory and working capital requirements.
Cash and deposit balances can be exposed to interest rate movements.
The Group utilises the experience and skills of its professional dealing team to obtain the best interest rates, ensuring the expected maturity dates of deposits are aligned to the Groups working capital requirements.
Any exception to the treasury policy requires the prior approval of the Board.
Defined benefit pension deficit The Groups defined benefit pension deficit represents the discounted value of future pension obligations in excess of plan assets, details of which are given in note 25.
The Group has exposure to movements in the market value of the plan assets, which are held across a number of asset classes.
The value of defined benefit pension obligations is quantified and discounted using corporate bond rates.
Movements in these rates can have a significant impact on the pension liabilities and hence the quantum of the Groups pension deficit.
Details of the asset and liability risk management framework in respect of the Groups primary defined benefit pension plan are given on pages 105 and 106.
Management of capital The Companys Ordinary Shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The Board monitors significant movements in the composition of its shareholder base.
In the ordinary course of business the only movements in the absolute number of shares in issue would be through the issue of shares to satisfy obligations under share-based payment arrangements.
Some 25.9 million shares were issued in 2013, the majority of which related to the vesting of retention awards which were put in place in 2010 when the TRC business was acquired.
The Directors give careful consideration to the appropriate funding structure for financing all acquisitions, which historically have included both equity and debt-funded transactions.
Dividends are only declared by the Board after due consideration of a number of key items, including the financial results and the outlook of the financial position of the Company and of the Group.
Specifically, as part of the recent Strategic Review, the Board has sought to improve dividend cover and to repurchase debt from cash generation.
Cognisant of these matters, the Board declared an unchanged total dividend of 3.0 pence per share for 2013.
While some debt was repurchased in 2012, no loan notes were repurchased during 2013, primarily due to the higher market price prevailing throughout 2013.
The overall objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity over the short and medium-term to meet the needs of the business.
This includes liquidity to cover, among other things, capital expenditure, servicing debt and equity capital as well as working capital to fund the Groups day-to-day operational requirements.
Working capital Working capital is monitored on a daily basis to ensure that settlement terms of all forthcoming liabilities can be met.
This activity includes timely collection of debtors and monitoring of cash on deposit, having regard to regulatory capital requirements, as outlined below.
The Groups Finance function includes a Treasury team which manages the cash flow requirements of the Group while seeking to maximise the amount of cash on deposit.
ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2013 | 123 35.
Financial risk management continued At 31 December 2013, the Group had some 142m of Guaranteed Fixed Rate Loan Notes which mature in December 2016 together with some 116m of Fixed Floating Rate Subordinated Notes in issue.
The earliest repayment date for these Subordinated Notes is 2016, but this can be extended at the option of the Group to 2026.
In addition, the Group has the option to defer interest payments on this subordinated debt, but if it elects to do so then no dividend can be paid to Ordinary Shareholders until the cumulative amount of any unpaid interest due on the subordinated debt is settled in full.
No such interest payments have been deferred.
The Board Reserved List prohibits the use of derivatives including futures, options and forward contracts, in respect of the Groups net assets, without prior Board approval, recognising the general principle of seeking to minimise capital loss.
Regulatory capital requirements During 2013 the Group was required to maintain a minimum level of capital in accordance with the Capital Requirements Directive CRD prescribed for investment firms in the UK by the Financial Conduct Authority FCA.
CRD IV applies to the Group from 1 January 2014 and establishes an EU-prescribed Capital Requirements Regulation, which is directly binding on firms, and a revised Capital Requirements Directive, which is transcribed into national law for investment firms by the relevant national regulatory authority.
This introduces, for relevant firms, new capital requirement ratios, as well as making certain other changes to the calculation of capital requirements.
The Group has a waiver, granted by the Financial Services Authority now the FCA, from meeting any minimum capital requirements under the consolidated supervision rules of the CRD.
The waiver is grandfathered under CRD IV rules and shall continue in force and effect until the expiry date of April 2016.
At 31 December 2013, there were 12 regulated companies in the Group, of which 9 are registered in the United Kingdom and are subject to regulation by the FCA.
This includes F&C MPF which, being a regulated insurance firm as opposed to an investment firm, is dual regulated by the FCA and the Prudential Regulation Authority and not part of the consolidation Group for regulatory capital reporting purposes.
Overseas regulated companies, registered in The Netherlands, Portugal and Hong Kong are subject to regulatory capital requirements set out by their respective local regulatory authority, as embedded within the legislation of those jurisdictions.
CRD rules set out the measurement of Capital Resources and Capital Resources Requirements CRR to determine the regulatory capital surplus or deficit.
This CRR is referred to as the Pillar 1 capital requirements under CRD.
For the UK-regulated investment firms, the CRR is the higher of: the sum of the credit risk capital requirement and the market risk capital requirement: and the fixed overhead requirement.
Credit risk represents the risk of a party being unable to meet its obligations to a firm and is calculated using risk-weighted percentages applied to the various exposure amounts.
The market risk for F&C represents the risk of loss from fluctuations in exchange rates and is calculated as a percentage of the total of the long or short positions, denominated in foreign currencies, whichever is the greater.
The fixed overhead requirement is calculated as a quarter of a firms relevant fixed annual expenditure in the previous years audited Financial Statements.
The regulated companies are required to submit financial returns to the FCA, or the local regulatory authority for overseas companies, setting out the calculation of the regulatory capital surplus or deficit.
The Groups regulated companies are required to submit financial returns monthly, quarterly or semi-annually, and during 2013 the Group was required to submit a consolidated return semi-annually.
However, under CRD IV rules the Group is no longer required to submit a consolidated capital adequacy return as long as the waiver from meeting minimum capital requirements under consolidated supervision rules remains in force.
The CRD requires the Group to conduct an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, referred to as Pillar 2 capital requirements.
The objective of this process is to ensure that firms have adequate capital to enable them to manage risks not deemed to be adequately covered under the Pillar 1 minimum requirements.
This is a forward-looking exercise which includes stress-testing key risks, considering how the company would cope with a significant market downturn, for example, and an assessment of the Groups ability to mitigate the risks.
The requirement to undertake an ICAAP continues under CRD IV rules.
All of the Groups regulated entities maintained surpluses of regulatory capital throughout 2012 and 2013 and are expected to hold sufficient regulatory capital to meet relevant regulatory requirements under CRD IV rules.

The extent of risks arising from financial instruments Note 35 presents details of the Groups direct or indirect exposure to financial risks arising from financial instruments and the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the management of the Groups capital.
This note provides numerical analyses of the Groups direct exposure to such financial risk, including relevant sensitivity analysis, at each reporting date.
The disclosures in this note exclude any policyholder unit-linked assets and liabilities in respect of F&C MPF, as the risks and rewards rest primarily with the policyholders.
a Credit risk i Maximum exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The maximum exposure of each class of financial asset is shown in the total column in the following table.
The accrued income balance is higher than the average monthly balance during the year.

Collateral The Group has obtained collateral over receivables in the F&C REIT property segment.
The underlying unimpaired receivable which has the associated collateral at 31 December 2013 is 13.3m.
This amount has been guaranteed by a related company and, with effect from 3 September 2013, interest is chargeable on any balance which remains unpaid six months after its original due date.
The guarantee is a continuing security over the entire amount receivable.
The collateral takes the form of two portfolios of properties, one in the UK and one overseas.
It is expected that the receivables will be settled from the realisation of certain properties held within the portfolios.
The fair value of both portfolios, at 31 December 2013, amounts to an aggregate of 52.5m.

This analysis measures the change in fair value of the Groups financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis, which is for illustrative purposes only, is prepared based on financial instruments at the reporting dates.
The sensitivity assumes changes in certain market conditions.
These assumptions may differ materially from the actual outturn due to the inherent uncertainties in global financial markets.
In practice, market risks rarely change in isolation and are likely to be interdependent.
The methods and assumptions used are the same for both reporting periods.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared based on the impact that a set percentage increase or decrease in the market conditions would have on the profit or loss and on total equity.
Changes in exchange rates assume an instantaneous increase or decrease of 10.0% in foreign currency to Sterling rates at the reporting date, with all other variables remaining constant.
ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2013 | 129 36.
The extent of risks arising from financial instruments continued The estimated changes in fair values of investments assume a 10.0% increase or decrease in the fair values of investments at the reporting date, with all other variables remaining constant.
Changes in market interest rates assume an increase or decrease of 1.0% in the rate applied to average cash balances in the year.

Events after the reporting period a Proposed acquisition of F&C by Bank of Montreal On 28 January 2014, F&C Asset Management plc F&C and the Bank of Montreal BMO announced that agreement had been reached for BMO Global Asset Management Europe Limited BMO Europe, a wholly owned subsidiary of BMO, to acquire the entire issued and to be issued Ordinary Share capital of F&C for an aggregate consideration of approximately 708m.
F&C shareholders will receive 120p per share and will also be entitled to retain an ordinary course dividend of 2p per share which was declared on 28 January 2014.
The proposed acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of certain regulatory and other conditions.
The acquisition will be effected by means of a Court sanctioned scheme of arrangement, full details of which, together with the terms and conditions of the transaction, are contained in the Scheme Circular.
A copy of this document is available via the link on the front page of the Groups website: www.
The Scheme was approved by shareholders on 25 March 2014.
In addition to the regulatory conditions referred to above, the Scheme is also subject to sanction by the Court prior to it becoming effective.
Once the Scheme becomes effective, BMO Europe will acquire 100% of the share capital of F&C and F&C will, therefore, become a wholly-owned subsidiary of BMO Europe.
Subject to the fulfilment of the conditions, the acquisition is currently expected to complete on or around 7 May 2014.
However, if the Scheme does not become effective on or before 31 August 2014 or such later date if any as BMO and F&C may agree, it will lapse and the acquisition will not proceed unless the Takeover Panel otherwise consents.
While the proposed acquisition has not materially impacted the Group results for 2013 or the financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2013, it will impact the results of subsequent periods.
In particular, the Scheme document highlights that the aggregate fees and expenses which are expected to be incurred by F&C in connection with the acquisition are estimated to amount to between 7.9m and 9.1m excluding applicable VAT.
A significant element of these costs is conditional upon completion of the acquisition: however, certain costs will be incurred irrespective of whether the transaction completes or not.
In addition, the aggregate cost of share awards and the profile of the associated accounting charge will be influenced by the combination of the increase in the F&C share price since the date of the announcement of the proposed acquisition and its impact on share awards vesting in 2014, and the proposed replacement of certain existing F&C share awards with new BMO awards.
b Friends Life notice to withdraw assets under management At 31 December 2013, the Group managed 16.2bn of Strategic Partner assets on behalf of Friends Life.
The associated long-term contracts were due to expire during 2014.
However, on 18 March 2014 F&C was informed by Friends Life that they have selected a new investment manager in respect of 12.2bn of multi-asset and equity mandates currently managed by F&C and that they intend to transfer a further 2.3bn of sterling fixed income assets to Friends Life Investments, their in-house asset manager.
The Group has received notice of termination or an indication to serve notice in respect of these assets and anticipates that they will be withdrawn by the end of 2014.
The annualised revenues associated with the assets which are to be withdrawn are approximately 16m.

d TRC Commutation arrangements Note 26 f on pages 113 and 114 outlines the agreement reached by F&C to defer the potential exercise of the remaining option for F&C to purchase additional profit entitlement until April 2014.
As at 31 December 2013, the accounting assumption was that the remaining option would be exercised by the issue of shares.
However, as a consequence of the announcement of the proposed acquisition of F&C by Bank of Montreal, F&C is prohibited from issuing new shares to satisfy the Commutation arrangements, without shareholder approval unless the consent of the Takeover Panel is obtained.
The rules of these arrangements do, however, allow for cash settlement.
On 4 April 2014 a Commutation Settlement Agreement was signed whereby the Commutation consideration of 5.25m is settled in cash rather than shares, as previously assumed under these arrangements which have been accounted for as equity-settled share awards.
50% of this consideration is deferred for a period of 24 months.
No adjustment has been made to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
As at 31 December 2013, the balance within equity in relation to this Commutation arrangement was 4.0m.
Upon settlement in cash, the balance of 1.25m will be charged to the Income Statement and the remaining 24-month vesting period.
