Additional Information Development Pipeline as at 31 December 2013 Throughout the development process, we strive to obtain patent protection consistent with our patent process as described in the Intellectual Property section from page 72.
However, until marketing approval in individual countries is obtained, it is not possible to accurately predict the maximum period of product protection available from any such patents.
While the most significant uncertainties for development pipeline products progressing to launch are meeting development targets and obtaining regulatory marketing approvals as detailed in the Risk section from page 199, the date and language of any actual marketing approval will crucially determine the length of Patent Term Extension and the full range, if any, of pending patents that will protect the marketed product.
Further details of possible periods of patent, RDP and related IP protections which may protect pipeline products once marketed are included from page 198.
