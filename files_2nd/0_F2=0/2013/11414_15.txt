Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
Current taxation Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.
It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of reversal of the temporary differences is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Recognition, therefore, involves judgement regarding the prudent forecasting of future taxable profits of the business and in applying an appropriate risk adjustment factor.
The final outcome of some of these items may give rise to material profit and loss and or cash flow variances.
At the balance sheet date management has forecast that the Group would generate future taxable profits against which existing tax losses could be relieved.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current taxation assets against current taxation liabilities and it is the intention to settle these on a net basis.

A deferred tax asset of 7.9 million 2012: 7.9 million has been recognised in respect of 39.6 million 2012: 34.4 million of such losses, the recovery of which is supported by the expected level of future profits of the Group.
The recognition of the deferred tax asset is based on forecasted operating results calculated in approved business plans and a review of tax planning opportunities.
Management have concluded that there is sufficient evidence for the recognition of the deferred tax asset of 7.9 million.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining losses on the basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain given the unpredictability of future profit streams.
All tax losses, both recognised and unrecognised, can be carried forward indefinitely.

After corporation tax relief, the timing of tax deductions in respect of expenditure incurred on these assets differs to the amortisation profile of the assets giving rise to the deferred tax liability.
This liability will be unwound over the useful lives of the assets.
2.3 Loss per share Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding ordinary shares held pursuant to the Groups JSOS which are accounted for as treasury shares.
Diluted loss per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential shares.
The Company has two categories of potentially dilutive shares, namely share options and shares held pursuant to the JSOS.
There was no difference in the weighted average number of shares used for the calculation of basic and diluted loss per share as the effect of all potentially dilutive shares outstanding was anti-dilutive.
Basic and diluted loss per share has been calculated as follows: 52 weeks 53 weeks ended ended 1 December 2 December 2013 2012 Number of shares Number of shares million million Issued shares at the beginning of the period, excluding treasury shares 578.3 522.1 Effect of share options exercised in the period 1.4 0.3 Effect of treasury shares disposed of in the period 0.3 Effect of shares issued in the period 0.9 Weighted average number of shares at the end of the period 580.0 523.3 m m Loss attributable to the owners of the Company 12.5 2.4 pence pence Basic and diluted loss per share 2.16 0.46 The only transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares between the reporting date and the date of these financial statements were the exercise of 383,645 share options under the company ESOS scheme and 819,358 share options under the SAYE1 scheme.
com Stock Code: OCDO Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Section 3 Assets and liabilities 3.1 Intangible assets Accounting policies Intangible assets Intangible assets comprise internally generated assets relating mainly to computer software and other intangible assets relating mainly to externally acquired computer software and assets.
These are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any recognised impairment loss.
Other intangible assets such as externally acquired computer software and software licences are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives of three to seven years.
Costs relating to the development of computer software for internal use are capitalised once all the development phase recognition criteria of IAS 38 Intangible Assets are met.
When the software is available for its intended use, these costs are amortised in equal annual amounts over the estimated useful life of the software.
Amortisation and impairment of computer software or licences are charged to administrative expenses in the period in which they arise.
For the Groups impairment policy on non-financial assets see Note 3.2.
Amortisation on other non-current assets is calculated on a straight line basis from the date on which they are brought into use, charged to administrative expenses and is calculated based on the useful lives indicated below: Internally generated assets 3-5 years, or the lease term if shorter Other intangible assets 3-7 years, or the lease term if shorter Amortisation periods and methods are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate.
1 Intangible assets Cost capitalisation Internally generated assets, where it is clear that the ability to develop the assets is technically feasible and will be completed and that the asset will generate economic benefit, are capitalised as an intangible asset.
Amounts capitalised include the total cost of any external products or services and labour costs directly attributable to development.
Management judgement is involved in determining the appropriate internal costs to capitalise and the amounts involved.
This includes reviewing expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Other development costs that do not meet the above criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Estimation of useful life The charge in respect of periodic amortisation is derived by estimating an assets expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life.
Increasing an assets expected life or its residual value would result in a reduced amortisation charge in the income statement.
The useful life is determined by management at the time the software is acquired and brought into use and is regularly reviewed for appropriateness.
For computer software licences, the useful life represents managements view of the expected period over which the Group will receive benefits from the software.

com Stock Code: OCDO Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3.2 Property, plant and equipment Accounting policies Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment excluding land are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset, any costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use and major spares.
Depreciation is provided at rates estimated to write off the cost of the relevant assets less their estimated residual values by equal annual amounts over their expected useful lives.
Residual values and expected useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
Land is held at cost and not depreciated.
Depreciation on other non-current assets is charged to distribution costs and administrative expenses and is calculated based on the useful lives indicated below: Freehold buildings and leasehold properties 25 years, or the lease term if shorter Fixtures and fittings 5-10 years Plant and machinery 3-20 years Motor vehicles 2-7 years Capital work-in-progress is not depreciated until it is available for use.
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds with the assets carrying amount and are recognised within operating profit.
Property, plant and equipment represents 45% of the total asset base of the Group in 2013 2012: 63%.
Therefore, the estimates and assumptions made to determine the carrying value of property, plant and equipment and related depreciation are important to the Groups financial position and performance.
For more information on the Groups policy on capitalisation of borrowings costs, see Note 4.3.
Estimation of useful life The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived by estimating an assets expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life.
Increasing an assets expected life or its residual value would result in a reduced depreciation charge in the income statement.
The useful lives of the Groups assets are determined by management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed at least annually for appropriateness.
The lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events which may impact their useful life, such as changes in technology.
Impairment of non-financial assets An annual impairment review is performed and assets which do not have indefinite useful lives are subject to an annual depreciation or amortisation charge.
Assets that are subject to an annual amortisation or depreciation charge are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less cost to sell and value in use.
For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash generating units.
Non-financial assets that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at the end of each reporting period.
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Given the Groups current operating structure the lowest level at which cash flows can reasonably be assessed is for the Group as a whole.
The Group prepares detailed forward projections which are constantly updated and refined.
Based on these projections the Board does not consider that any further impairment of assets is required, other than that recognised in the income statement.

The fair values of all other financial assets and liabilities have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing market interest rates.
2 Credit risk The Groups exposures to credit risk arise from holdings of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables excluding prepayments and derivative assets.
Exposure to credit risk The carrying value of these financial assets, as set out in Note 4.5.
1, represents the maximum credit exposure.
No collateral is held as security against these assets.
Cash and cash equivalents The Groups exposure to credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is managed by investing in banks and financial institutions with strong credit ratings and by regular review of counterparty risk.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables at the period end comprise mainly monies due from suppliers, which are considered of a good credit quality, as well as VAT receivable and prepayments.
The Group provides for doubtful receivables in respect of monies due from suppliers.
The Group has very low retail credit risk due to transactions being principally of a high volume, low value and short maturity.
The Group has effective controls over this area.
The Group has allowed for doubtful receivables in respect of consumer sales by reviewing the ageing profile and, based on prior experience, assessing the recoverability of overdue balances.

4 Market risk Currency risk The Group has foreign currency exposure in relation to its foreign currency trade payables and a portion of its cash and cash equivalents.
Foreign currency trade payables arise principally on purchases of plant and equipment.
Euro bank accounts are maintained in order to minimise the Groups exposure to fluctuations in the Euro relating to current and future purchases of plant and equipment.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into to hedge future purchases of plant and equipment in Euro.
The Groups exposure to currency risk is based on the following amounts: 1 December 2 December 2013 2012 m m Cash and cash equivalents EUR 0.6 7.8 Cash and cash equivalents PLN 0.1 Trade payables at period end EUR 3.4 10.6 Derivative liability asset forward foreign exchange contracts EUR 0.2 0.1 2.9 2.9 The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates on its euro-related financial instruments: 1 December 2013 2 December 2012 Increase Increase Increase Increase decrease in decrease in decrease in decrease in income equity income equity m m m m 10% appreciation of the euro 0.4 1.8 0.3 1.8 10% depreciation of the euro 0.4 1.8 0.3 1.8 A movement of the euro, as indicated, against sterling at 1 December 2013 would have increased decreased equity and profit or loss by the amounts detailed above.
This analysis is based on foreign currency exchange rate variances that the Group considered to be reasonably possible at the end of the period.
The analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.

4 Market risk continued Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its floating rate interest bearing borrowings and floating rate cash and cash equivalents.
The Groups interest rate risk policy seeks to minimise finance charges and volatility by structuring the interest rate profile into a diversified portfolio of fixed rate and floating rate financial assets and liabilities.
Interest rate risk on significant floating rate interest bearing borrowings is managed using interest rate swaps.
At the balance sheet date the interest rate profile of the Groups interest bearing financial instruments was: 1 December 2 December 2013 2012 m m Fixed rate instruments Financial assets 76.4 65.8 Financial liabilities 41.1 53.3 Variable rate instruments Financial assets 34.0 23.8 Financial liabilities 120.2 91.5 Sensitivity analysis An increase of 100 basis points 1.0% in interest rates would increase equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown below.
A rate of 100 basis points was deemed appropriate, considering the current short-term interest rate outlook.
The calculation applies the increase to average floating rate interest bearing borrowings and cash and cash equivalents existing during the period.
This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant and considers the effect on financial instruments with variable interest rates.

The eligible remuneration in the form of share-based payments, whereby employees employees to whom options are granted and the terms of such options will render services in exchange for rights over shares equity-settled be determined by the Directors of Ocado or the trustees.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees who are eligible to participate in the ESOS are all Ocados Executive is measured where appropriate, with reference to the fair value at the Directors and employees, including the employees of the Companys date on which they are granted.

The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the years in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
At each reporting date, the cumulative expense recognised for equitysettled transactions reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that, in the opinion of the Directors, 22965.04 10 March 2014 10:21 AM Proof 3 150 www.

Any performance target must generally be measured over a period of at least three years.
There are currently no options granted which are subject to performance targets that have not yet been met.
The vesting period for the ESOS is three years.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant or the employee leaves the Group, the options expire subject to a limited number of exceptions.

Prior to the Admission, the market value of the Companys shares was derived based on the market value of similar companies and by taking into account transactions with shareholders during the relevant period.
The Share Valuation Office of HMRC has confirmed in correspondence that in respect of options granted prior to Admission, the exercise price was not less that the market value of the Companys shares at each option grant date.
For exercises during the period, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 2.92 2012: 0.98.
In determining the fair value of the share options granted during the period, the BlackScholes Option Pricing Model was used with the following inputs: 1 December 2 December 2013 2012 Weighted average share price 1.71 1.00 Weighted average exercise price 1.71 1.00 Expected volatility 0.25 0.25 Weighted expected life - years 3.00 3.00 Risk-free interest rate 3.5% 3.5% Expected dividend yield 0.0% 0.0% Given the immaturity of the Companys share history, the expected volatility was determined by considering the historic performance of the shares of a bucket of companies similar to and including the Company.

For JSOS3 there are two tranches, each with their own the increase if any in the value of a number of ordinary shares in the hurdle price.
For JSOS2, the price was in a range of 7.1% to 10.8%, and for JSOS3, the price was in a range of 1.47% to 1.70% of the share price at date of issue.
When an Interest vests, the EBT Trustee will transfer Shares to the Participant of equal value to the Participants Interest or the Shares will be sold and the EBT Trustee will account to the Participant for the balance, i. e. the difference between the sale proceeds less expenses and the hurdle price.
Vesting conditions The vesting of the Interests granted to Participants is subject to a time vesting condition, as detailed above.
The fair value of the Interests awarded under the JSOS was determined using the BlackScholes Option Pricing Model.
As per IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, market based vesting conditions and the share price target conditions in the JSOS have been taken into account in establishing the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
Other non-market or performance related conditions were not taken into account in establishing the fair value of equity instruments granted: instead, these non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments included in the measurement of the transaction amount so that, ultimately the amount recognised for services received as consideration for the equity instruments granted is based on the number of equity instruments that will eventually vest.
In determining the fair value of the Interests granted, the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model was used with the following inputs: JSOS1 Tranche 1 Tranche 2 Tranche 3 Tranche 4 Weighted average share price 1.35 1.35 1.35 1.35 Weighted average exercise price 1.73 1.91 2.08 2.28 Expected volatility 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 Weighted expected life years 0.91 1.91 2.91 3.91 Risk-free interest rate 3.5% 3.5% 3.5% 3.5% Expected dividend yield 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 22965.04 10 March 2014 10:21 AM Proof 3 Ocado Group plc Annual Report for the 52 weeks ended 1 December 2013 153 Our Financials Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 4.7.

com Stock Code: OCDO Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 4.8 Capital management The Boards objective is to maintain an appropriate balance of debt and equity financing to enable the Group to continue as a going concern, to sustain future development of the business and to maximise returns to shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders.
The Board closely manages trading capital, defined as net assets plus net debt.
Net debt is calculated as total debt obligations under finance leases and borrowings as shown in the balance sheet, less cash and cash equivalents.
The Groups net assets at the end of the period were 202.4 million 2012: 205.7 million and it had net debt of 50.9 million 2012: 55.2 million.
The main areas of capital management revolve around working capital management and compliance with externally imposed financial covenants.
Throughout the period, the Group has complied with all covenants imposed by lenders.
All financial covenants under the 100 million credit facility were removed upon repayment of the facility.
In addition, a key aspect of Capital Management was the strategic operating agreement with Morrisons discussed below and in note 5.4 and 5.5.
The components of working capital management include monitoring inventory turn, age of inventory, age of receivables, receivables days, payables days, balance sheet reforecasting, period projected loss, weekly cash flow forecasts and daily cash balances.
Major investment decisions are based on reviewing the expected future cash flows and all major capital expenditure requires approval by the Board.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the period.
Given the Groups commitment to expand the business and the investment required to complete CFC2, the declaration and payment of a dividend is not part of the short-term capital management strategy of the Group.
At the balance sheet date, the Groups undrawn facilities and cash and cash equivalents are as follows: 1 December 2 December 2013 2012 Notes m m Total facilities available 173.4 193.0 Facilities drawn down 4.1.
