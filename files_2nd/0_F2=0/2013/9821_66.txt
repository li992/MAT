EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS CONTINUED Reorganisation and non-core estate disposal costs During the current period the Group restructured both its pub estate and its operating segments.
An exceptional charge of 10.8 million, including the net loss on disposal of non-core properties, was recognised during the period in respect of this.
Write-off of cellar equipment As part of a review of its fixed asset register the Group identified various items of cellar equipment which it assessed were no longer in use by the business and which would not have been utilised in the current period.
These assets were subsequently written off with the charge and depreciation for the period shown as an exceptional item.
Rank refunds In previous periods the Group received refunds totalling 5.9 million from HM Revenue & Customs HMRC.
This followed Tribunal Court of Appeal hearings involving The Rank Group Plc Rank, which concluded that there had been a breach of fiscal neutrality in the treatment of gaming machine income as liable to UK VAT.
HMRC issued protective assessments to recover the repayments pending the result of further Court hearings.
On 30 October 2013 the Court of Appeal found in favour of HMRC and as such it is likely that the Group will be required to repay the refunds of 5.9 million plus interest of 0.5 million thereon.
A provision for these amounts has therefore been recognised in the period.
Movement in fair value of interest rate swaps The Groups interest rate swaps are revalued to fair value at each balance sheet date.
The movement in fair value of interest rate swaps which are not designated as part of a hedge relationship, and the ineffective portion of the movement in fair value of interest rate swaps which are accounted for as hedging instruments are both recognised in the income statement.
The net gain of 3.5 million 2012: 2.9 million is shown as an exceptional item.
Impact of taxation The current tax credit relating to the above exceptional items amounts to 1.8 million 2012: 3.0 million.
The deferred tax credit relating to the above exceptional items amounts to 2.3 million 2012: 38.0 million.
In addition, 3.1 million 2012: 2.1 million has been credited as exceptional in relation to the change in corporation tax rate note 7.
Prior period exceptional items At 1 July 2012 the Groups freehold and leasehold properties were revalued by independent chartered surveyors on an open market value basis.
The resulting revaluation adjustments were taken to the revaluation reserve or income statement as appropriate.
The amount recognised in the income statement comprised: 2012 m Impairment of other intangible assets note 11 0.8 Impairment of property, plant and equipment note 12 214.5 Reversal of impairment of property, plant and equipment note 12 1.9 Impairment of assets held for sale note 15 1.2 Valuation fees 0.5 215.1 During the prior period the Group entered into a new bank facility.
As such the unamortised finance costs relating to the previous facility were written off.
During the prior period the Group recognised the interest on outstanding tax liabilities in respect of a number of tax issues under negotiation with HMRC.
The Group held an interest rate swap of 20.0 million which was designated as a cash flow hedge of the forecast floating rate interest payments arising on the first 20.0 million of borrowings under the Groups previous bank facility.
As the Group entered into a new bank facility in the prior period, these forecast transactions were no longer expected to occur.
Therefore the cumulative hedging loss of 0.8 million that had been reported in equity was transferred to the income statement.
On 22 March 2012 the Group entered into four new fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps of 35.0 million each.
In total, these swaps were equal and opposite to the two existing floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps of 70.0 million each, which the Group entered into in order to fix the interest rate payable on the Groups unsecured bank borrowings.
The total fair value of the four new swaps at inception was 15.1 million.
On 22 March 2012 the Group also entered into two new floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps of 60.0 million each.
Going forward these swaps will fix the interest rate on the Groups unsecured bank borrowings.
In total, the fair value of these two new swaps at inception was 18.9 million.
Further details in respect of these swaps are given in note 20.
