This arose on the buy out of 9.11% of the non-controlling interest in the principal mining operations of the Group in 2004.
Goodwill in relation to the Akanani CGU was fully impaired in 2012.
The recoverable amounts of each of the CGUs goodwill has been determined using the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
In determining the recoverable amounts for the Marikana and Akanani CGUs the key assumptions have been set out in the Groups impairment policy see note 1.

Additions to exploration and evaluation assets include $4 million of capitalised interest 2012 $nil.
The Groups approach to assessing the intangible assets, including exploration and evaluation assets, for impairment is set out in the accounting policies see note 1.
In 2012 we completed a pre-feasibility study on the Akanani exploration and evaluation asset.
This study provided an update on the results of the original concept study undertaken at the time of acquisition.
Based on the results of this pre-feasibility study we impaired the asset by $602 million.
The impairment charge was applied first to reduce goodwill to nil, with the rest allocated to reduce the exploration and evaluation asset.
The Group has no indefinite life intangible assets other than goodwill see note 10. www.
