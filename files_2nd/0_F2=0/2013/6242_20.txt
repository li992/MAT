Strategy and KPIs continued 3 Explore Extend the growth pipeline We conducted a highly targeted yet extensive What we said we would do in 2013 exploration programme in 2013 on 25 properties, Allocate continuous funding across prioritising the most promising prospects and metal price cycles projects within our current concession areas.
US$279.6 million budgeted for exploration Notwithstanding the stricter resource estimation criteria and lower metal prices, our total silver and gold resources increased in the year.
Of particular note is the increase at San Julin, which underscores the prole of that project Advance prospects and projects along and its potential to become a new mining district the exploration pipeline from early stage for us, while good mineralisation at anumber of to drilling to advanced other sites in Sonora, Durango and Guanajuato At Las Casas, prepare a pilot stope to verify the geological model andgeotechnical characteristics: conduct a scoping study warrant continued drilling in 2014.
At Centauro Deep, conclude construction of the pumping station, continue exploration activities to increase the resource base Evaluate the Mega Centauro expansion project At Juanicipio, continue the exploration programme in accordance withthe recommendations of the pre-feasibility study At Saucito II, submit the feasibility study for Board approval in 1Q 2013: begin construction in 2H 2013 for the expansion of the Saucito mine Convert resources to reserves KPIs Total resources attributable Quanties measured, indicated and inferred resources at all our assets: an indicator of the Groups growth potential and ability to discover and develop new ore bodies.
Strategy in action We continuously invest in exploration across price cycles, with US$225.0 million budgeted for 2014.
As part of our district consolidation strategy, over 65% of these funds will be allocated to areas of inuence around our operating mines, near development projects, and within advanced exploration sites.
