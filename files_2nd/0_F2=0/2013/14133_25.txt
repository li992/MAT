This has changed the statutory accounts that form the basis for those companies corporation tax computations.
The most significant impact of this change is that certain amounts that had been taxed in previous years will now be recognised as profits and taxed in future periods.
Therefore, to prevent such items being taxed twice, the tax already paid on such items is repayable.
The impact of this change was an exceptional credit of 40.5 million to current tax and an exceptional charge of 38.8 million to deferred tax.
Current tax credits have arisen due to adjustments to prior year tax computations.
In 2013 these primarily related to an industry agreement over the treatment of infrastructure income.
The exceptional deferred tax credit arises from the reduction in the rate at which the temporary differences are expected to reverse from 24% to 23%.
On 20 March 2013 the Government announced that the main rate of corporation tax in the UK would reduce to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013 with subsequent reductions per annum to reach 20% by 1 April 2015.

Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 97 Group financial statements Notes to the group financial statements 15 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the Severn Trent Employee Share Ownership Trust whichare treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the companys shares during the year.
Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations are calculated on the basis of profit from continuing operations attributable to the equity holders of the company.
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data: Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 2013 2012 m m profit for the period attributable to the equity holders of the company 227.5 171.8 Number of shares 2013 2012 m m Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic earnings per share 237.7 237.0 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares share options and LTIPs 1.1 1.2 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted earnings per share 238.8 238.2 Adjusted earnings per share 2013 2012 pence pence Adjusted basic earnings per share 98.9 88.9 Adjusted diluted earnings per share 98.4 88.5 Adjusted earnings per share gures are presented for continuing operations.
These exclude the effects of deferred tax, losses onnancial instruments and exceptional items in both 2013 and 2012.
The directors consider that the adjusted gures provide ausefuladditional indicator of performance.
The denominators used in the calculations of adjusted basic and diluted earnings pershare are the same as those used in the unadjusted gures set out above.
Adjustments to earnings The adjustments to earnings that are made in calculating adjusted earnings per share are as follows: 2013 2012 m m Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 227.5 171.8 Adjustments for exceptional items before tax 5.8 50.9 current tax related to exceptional items at 24% 2012: 26% 0.5 1.5 losses on financial instruments 45.3 67.7 deferred tax excluding exceptional charge 4.7 9.1 exceptional tax 38.4 69.1 Earnings for the purpose of adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share 235.0 210.7 98 Group financial statements Notes to the group financial statements 16 Goodwill 2013 2012 m m Cost At 1 April 67.8 68.3 Exchange adjustments 1.4 0.5 At 31 March 69.2 67.8 Impairment At 1 April 22.9 Amounts written off 4.6 22.9 At 31 March 27.5 22.9 Net book value At 31 March 41.7 44.9 Goodwill impairment tests Goodwill is allocated to the groups cash-generating units CGUs identied according to country of operation and business segment.
All of the groups goodwill is in the Severn Trent Services segment.
A summary of the goodwill allocation by CGU is presented below: 2013 2012 m m Water Purication US 27.1 26.3 Contract Operations 12.3 11.7 Services Italy 2.3 2.2 Services Spain 4.7 41.7 44.9 The group has reviewed the carrying value of goodwill for impairment in accordance with the policy stated in note 2 m. The value in use calculations use cash ow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a veyearperiod.
The key assumption underlying these budgets is revenue growth.
Management of each CGU determines assumptions based on past experience, current market trends and expectations of future developments.
Cash ows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using an estimated nominal growth rate stated below.
The growth rate does not exceed the long term average growth rate for the economy in which the CGU operates.
The assumptions used in relation to growth rates beyond the five year period and discount rates were: Nominal growth rate Discount rate 2013 2012 2013 2012 % % % % Water Purication US 3.5 3.5 6.2 5.8 Contract Operations 3.5 3.5 6.5 5.9 Services Italy 2.5 3.0 8.2 11.0 Services Spain 2.5 3.1 8.8 8.9 The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.
The discount rates used arepre-tax and reect specic risks relating to the CGU.
As a result of the impairment review, the group has fully impaired the goodwill in Services Spain by 4.6 million.
This follows thefurther deterioration of the economic outlook in Spain.
Changes in the growth rate outside the five year period or in the discount rate applied to the cash ows may cause a CGUs carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount.
However, in the opinion of the directors, the changes in growth rate or discount rate that would be required to reduce the recoverable amounts of Water Purication US and Contract Operations below their carrying value are not reasonably possible and therefore sensitivity analysis has only been provided for Services Italy.

106 Group financial statements Notes to the group financial statements 27 Retirement benefit schemes continued a Dened benefit pension schemes continued iii Background The group operates a number of dened benefit pension schemes in the UK, covering the majority of UK employees.
The dened benefit pension schemes are funded to cover future salary and pension increases and their assets are held in separate funds administered by trustees.
The trustees are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneciaries.
A formal actuarial valuation of each scheme is carried out on behalf of the trustees at triennial intervals by an independent professionally qualied actuary.
Under the dened benefit pension schemes, members are entitled to retirement benets calculated as a proportion varying between 1 30 and 1 80 for each year of service of their salary for the final year of employment with the group or, ifhigher, the average of the highest three consecutive years salary in the last 10 years of employment.
The dened benefit pension schemes will close to future accrual on 31 March 2015.
A new dened contribution pension scheme has been established and members of the dened benefit pension schemes will then become members of the new dened contribution pension scheme.
The existing dened contribution pension scheme will also be replaced by the new pension arrangements with effect from 1 April 2015.
From 1 April 2012 new employees have been automatically enrolled into this scheme and those employees who were not members of a Severn Trent scheme were automatically enrolled into this scheme from 1 April 2013.
The final salary sections of the pension schemes are closed to new entrants and the age prole of scheme participants isexpectedto rise and hence service costs are also expected to rise until the schemes are closed to future accrual.
The schemes typically expose the company to actuarial risks such as market risk, interest rate risk and longevity risk.
The UK dened benefit pension schemes and the date of their last formal actuarial valuation are as follows: Date of last formal actuarial valuation Severn Trent Pension scheme STPS 31 March 2010 Severn Trent Mirror Image Pension Scheme 31 March 2010 The STPS is the largest of the groups UK dened benefit schemes.
The group has an obligation to pay pensions to a number of former employees, whose benets would otherwise have been restricted by the Finance Act 1989 earnings cap.
Provision for such benets amounting to 9.3 million 2012: 8.6 million isincludedas an unfunded scheme within the retirement benefit obligation.
iv Actuarial assumptions The major assumptions used in the valuation of the STPS also the approximate weighted average of assumptions used for the valuations of all group schemes were as follows: 2013 2012 % % Price ination 3.2 3.1 Salary increases 3.0 3.6 Pension increases in payment 3.2 3.1 Pension increases in deferment 3.2 3.1 Discount rate 4.4 4.9 Long term rate of return on: Equities 6.6 6.8 Gilts 3.1 3.3 Corporate bonds 4.3 4.9 Property 5.5 5.8 Hedge funds 6.0 6.3 Cash 3.1 3.3 The assumption for price ination is derived from the difference between the yields on longer term xed rate gilts and on index-linked gilts.
The discount rate is set by reference to AA rated sterling 18 year corporate bonds.
The expected rate of return on scheme assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the period for returns overthelife of the benefit obligation.
For gilts and corporate bonds the expected rates of return are based on market yields.
Forequities, property and hedge funds, a risk premium has been added to the gilt rate.
The mortality assumptions are based on those used in the triennial valuation of the STPS as at 31 March 2010 updated by a furtherinvestigation carried out in connection with the 2013 valuation, which indicated that members life expectancy had not beenas high as the previous investigation had predicted.
Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 107 Group financial statements Notes to the group financial statements 27 Retirement benefit schemes continued a Dened benefit pension schemes continued iv Actuarial assumptions continued The mortality assumptions adopted at the year end and the life expectancies at age 65 implied by the assumptions are as follows: 2013 2012 Mortality table used men SAPS S1NMA L SAPS S1NMA L women S1NFA L S1NFA L Mortality table compared with standard table men 116% 110% women 92% 78% Future improvement per annum 1.0% 0.5% Remaining life expectancy for members currently aged 65 years men 21.5 21.2 women 24.6 25.1 Remaining life expectancy at age 65 for members currently aged 45 years men 22.7 21.8 women 26.2 25.9 The calculation of the scheme liabilities is sensitive to the actuarial assumptions and in particular to the assumptions relating to discount rate, price ination and mortality.
The following table summarises the estimated impact on scheme liabilities and servicecost resulting from changes to key actuarial assumptions whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decrease increase by 38.0 million Price ination Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 35.0 million Mortality Increase in life expectancy by 1 year Increase by 55.0 million In reality, interrelationships exist between the assumptions, particularly between the discount rate and price ination.
Theaboveanalysis does not take into account the effect of these interrelationships.
v Effect on future cash ows Contribution rates are set in consultation with the trustees for each scheme and each participating employer.
The average duration of the benefit obligation at the end of the year is 18 years 2012: 18 years.
The expected cash ows payablefrom the schemes are presented in the graph below.
The triennial valuations for both schemes for the year ending 31 March 2013 is in progress.
Pending completion of this valuation, future lump sum deficit contributions will include a payment of 10.0 million per annum in cash and a further 8.2 million per annum through an asset backed funding arrangement.

The infrastructure reserve arose on the groups transition to IFRS from restating Severn Trent Water Limiteds infrastructure assets to fair value asdeemed cost.
In the current year Severn Trent Water Limited has adopted the new accounting standard FRS 101, which uses therecognition and measurement criteria of IFRS.
The infrastructure reserve has now been recognised in Severn Trent Water Limited.
During the year Severn Trent Water Limited used its infrastructure reserve to issue bonus shares, which were subsequently cancelled.
These transactions result in a transfer from the infrastructure reserve to retained earnings in these financial statements.
The translation reserve arises from exchange differences on translation of the results and financial position of foreign subsidiaries aswell as foreign exchange differences arising from hedges of net investment.
The hedging reserve arises from gains or losses on interest rate swaps taken directly to equity under the hedge accounting provisions of IAS 39 and the transition rules of IFRS 1.
32 Financial instruments a Capital management The groups principal objectives in managing capital are: F to access a broad range of sources of finance to obtain both the quantum required and lowest cost compatible with the need forcontinued availability: F to maintain an investment grade credit rating: and F to maintain a exible and sustainable balance sheet structure.
The group seeks to achieve a balance of long term funding or commitment of funds across a range of funding sources at the best possible economic cost.
The group does not have a specic gearing target but seeks to maintain gearing at a level consistent with its capital management objectives described above.
The groups dividend policy is a key tool in achieving its capital management objectives.
This policy is reviewed and updated in linewith Severn Trent Waters five year price control cycle and takes into account, inter alia, the planned investment programme, theappropriate gearing level achieving a balance between an efficient cost of capital and retaining an investment grade credit rating and delivering an attractive and sustainable return to shareholders.

 are used to hedge exposure to changes in exchange rates and interest rates.
 derivative financial instruments are not held for trading.
i Market risk The principal market risk that the group is exposed to is uctuations in interest rates.
Interest rate risk The groups income and operating cash ows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The groups interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to cashowinterest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at xed rates expose the group to fair value interest rate risk.
The groups policy istomaintain 45% to 90% of its net debt in xed rate instruments.
At 31 March 2013 76.8% of the groups net debt was at xedrates 2012: 74.0%.
The group manages its cash ow interest rate risk by using oating to xed interest rate swaps.
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from oating rates to xed rates.
Under the terms of the interest rate swaps, the group agrees with other parties to exchange, mainly semi-annually, the difference between xed contract and oating rate interest ratescalculated by reference to the agreed notional principal amounts.
The group has entered into a series of long dated interest rate swaps to hedge future interest payments.
Economically these act to x the interest cost of debt within the group which is denominated as oating rate, but do not achieve hedge accounting under the strict criteria of IAS 39.
This has led to a 25.2 million charge 2012: charge of 80.3 million in the income statement.
Some of the groups debt is index-linked, that is its cost is linked to changes in the Retail Price Index RPI.
This debt provides an economic hedge for Severn Trent Waters revenues and Regulatory Capital Value that are also RPI linked under its regulatory regime.

However, since substantially all of the groups profits and net assets arise from SevernTrent Water, which has very limited and indirect exposure to changes in exchange rates, the sensitivity of the groups resultsto changes in exchange rates is not material.
The groups net debt includes foreign currency borrowings, primarily denominated in yen and euros.
The groups policy is to managethe exchange risk arising from foreign currency borrowings by entering into cross currency swaps or forward contracts withexternal parties.

Euro US dollar Japanese yen Czech krona 2013 m $m bn CZKm Borrowings by currency 721.6 50.0 24.5 620.0 Cross currency swaps hedge accounted 19.9 50.0 14.5 620.0 Cross currency swaps not hedge accounted 700.0 10.0 1.7 Cash 3.9 38.1 Net currency exposure 2.2 38.1 Euro US dollar Japanese yen Czech krona 2012 m $m bn CZKm Borrowings by currency 720.6 50.0 30.0 1,970.0 Cross currency swaps hedge accounted 19.9 50.0 20.0 1,970.0 Cross currency swaps not hedge accounted 700.0 10.0 0.7 Cash 5.3 22.1 Net currency exposure 4.6 22.1 The euro and US dollar net cash balances relate to operations in which the euro or US dollar is the functional currency.
Monetary assets and liabilities by currency, excluding functional currency Certain of the groups subsidiaries enter into transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the operation.
Exchangerisks relating to such operations are not material but are managed centrally by Group Treasury through forward exchangecontracts to buy or sell currency.
ii Credit risk Operationally the group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
It has policies in place to ensure that sales of products aremade to customers with an appropriate credit history, other than in Severn Trent Water Limited, whose operating licence obligesitto supply domestic customers even in cases where bills are not paid.
Amounts provided against accounts receivable andmovements on the provision during the year are disclosed in note 22.
For nancing purposes, derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high credit quality financial institutions.
Thegroup has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
Credit risk analysis At 31 March the aggregate credit limits of authorised counterparties and the amounts held on short term deposits were as follows: Credit limit Amount deposited 2013 2012 2013 2012 m m m m AAA 20.0 20.0 1.3 0.1 Double A range 150.0 150.0 82.0 111.1 Single A range 625.0 450.0 272.4 146.5 795.0 620.0 355.7 257.7 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 115 Group financial statements Notes to the group financial statements 32 Financial instruments continued e Financial risk factors continued ii Credit risk continued Credit risk analysis continued The fair values of derivative assets analysed by credit ratings of counterparties were as follows: Derivative assets 2013 2012 Rating m m Double A range 29.7 44.6 Single A range 101.4 118.0 131.1 162.6 iii Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity management implies maintaining sufficient cash balances and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Group Treasury manages liquidity and exibility in funding by monitoring forecast and actual cash ows and the maturity prole of financial assets and liabilities, and by keeping committed credit lines available.
At the balance sheet date the group had committed undrawn borrowing facilities expiring as follows: 2013 2012 m m Within one year 1-2 years 2-5 years 500.0 500.0 After more than five years 100.0 500.0 600.0 Non-derivative financial instruments analysed by maturity date The following tables detail the groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative net financial liabilities.

The principal is revalued at xed intervals and is linked to movements in the Retail Price Index.
Interest payments are made biannually based on the revalued principal.
The principal repayment equals the revalued amount at maturity.
The calculations above are based on forward ination rates at the balancesheet date.
The group has bank loans which may become repayable in certain circumstances following a change in control of Severn Trent Plc.
The carrying value at 31 March 2013 of bank loans subject to such conditions was 617.3 million.
Derivative financial instruments analysed by maturity date The following table details the groups liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments.
The tables are based on the undiscounted net cash inows outows on the derivative financial instruments that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross inows outows on those derivatives that require gross settlement.
When the amount payable or receivable is not xed, theamount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest and foreign currency rates derived from the forward curves existing at the balance sheet date.
Actual amounts may be signicantly different from those indicated below.

Hedgeaccounting is adopted for such instruments where the criteria set out in IAS 39 are met.
i Fair value hedges The group raises debt denominated in currencies other than sterling principally yen and euro.
Cross currency swaps are entered into at the time that the debt is drawn down to swap the proceeds into sterling debt bearing interest based on LIBOR in order to mitigate the groups exposure to exchange rate uctuations.
The terms of the receivable leg of the swap closely match the terms ofthe underlying debt hence the swaps are expected to be effective hedges.
At the year end the amounts of cross currency swaps designated as fair value hedges were as follows: Notional principal amount Fair value 2013 2012 2013 2012 m m m m US dollar 27.0 27.0 8.7 7.6 Euro 11.4 11.4 9.3 7.8 Yen 71.4 98.4 35.3 59.0 Czech krona 14.7 47.2 7.0 20.8 124.5 184.0 60.3 95.2 ii Cash ow hedges The group has entered into interest rate swaps under which it has agreed to exchange the difference between xed and oating interest rate amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on future cash ow exposures arising from issued variable rate debt.
The group also entered into a number of interest rate contracts with future start dates during the AMP5 regulatory period.
Such contracts enable the group to mitigate therisk of changing interest rates on debt which is highly probable to be issued over the AMP5 period to fund Severn Trent Waters capital programme and have been accounted for as cash ow hedges.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the balance sheet date is determined by discounting the future cash ows using the yield curve prevailing at the balance sheet date and the credit risk inherent in the contract.
The interest rate swaps primarily settle net on a biannual basis.
The oating rate on the interest rate swaps is six month LIBOR.

The vesting period commences before the grant date.
Performanceinthe vesting period prior to the grant date is taken into account in determining the fair value of the award.
The fair value of the LTIP awards made during the year was calculated using the Black-Scholes method with the principal assumptions set out below: Assumptions 2013 2012 Expected volatility Severn Trent Plc 18% 27% Expected dividend yield 4.3% 4.7% Expected volatility is measured over a historical period, prior to grant, commensurate with the expected term of the awards.
Volatility has been calculated based on historical share price movements over the three years prior to the date of the grant.
The risk free rate is derived from yields at the grant date of gilts of similar duration to the LTIP awards.
The dividend yield is calculated using the expected dividend for the year divided by the share price at the date of grant.
Details of the basis of the LTIP schemes are set out in the remuneration report on pages 67 and 68. b Employee Sharesave Scheme Under the terms of the Sharesave Scheme, the board may grant the right to purchase ordinary shares in the company to those employees who have entered into an HMRC approved Save As You Earn contract for a period of three or five years.

Matching shares may be awarded at a maximum ratio of one matching share for every one deferred share and are subject to a three year vesting period.
During the year matching shares were awarded at a ratio of 0.5:1.
Matching shares are subject to total shareholder return over three years measured relative to the companies ranked 51-150 bymarket capitalisation in the FTSE Index excluding investment trusts.
This replicates the LTIP performance condition for the July2010 award.
The number of shares subject to an award will increase to reect dividends paid through the performance period on the basis of such notional dividends being reinvested at the then prevailing share price.
Awards will normally vest as soon as the Remuneration Committee determines that the performance conditions have been met provided that the participant remains in employment at the end of the performance period.
