Ofcom Statement on BTs Current Cost Financial Statements 2013 Introduction Current Cost Accounting valuation of assets BTs reporting obligations arise out of market reviews conducted by Ofcom and SMP service BT has revised the basis for deriving its CCA valuation of its copper and duct assets.
As Conditions OA1 to OA34 and Directions 1 to 6. explained in Section 2.1, BT has changed its valuation methodology from an absolute basis to an approach based on actual spend, indexed using RPI.
The 2011 12 comparatives have Under SMP services Condition OA6 c, BT is required to publish with the audited regulatory been restated on this new basis.
According to BT, the change in methodology resulted in a financial statements RFS any written statement made by Ofcom and provided to BT net 65m increase in duct and copper assets for that year.
commenting on the data in, the notes to or the presentation of any or all of the RFS and or the Accounting Documents.
A review of the reporting framework The RFS are produced by BT and follow the principles and methodologies as set out in BTs We are now conducting a review of the regulatory reporting framework to ensure that it is Primary and Secondary Accounting Documents.
These documents are published alongside fit for purpose.
Following our consultation published in September 2012 we are now the RFS.
They have not been reviewed by Ofcom.
preparing for a second consultation for later this year.
Notwithstanding this, Ofcom believes that we can be helpful to users of the RFS by drawing As part of this review, we will consider the appropriate future roles for Ofcom and for BT in attention to several important aspects of BTs 2012 13 RFS.
Primarily, we consider that determining the basis of preparation of the RFS, including the choice of allocation rules and users of the RFS should be aware of changes in the way BT allocates its costs and assets.
Changes in allocation methodologies During 2012 13, BT changed some of the methodologies it uses to prepare its RFS.
As described in Section 2.1, the effect of some of these changes is material.
Under SMP services Condition OA9, BT is required to include prior year comparatives in its RFS prepared on a basis that is consistent with the current year figures, unless there are reasons for not doing so.
Where BT does not include prior year comparatives, it has to set out the particulars of the departure, the reasons for it and its effect.
As set out in Section 2.1, BT has restated the prior year comparatives in these Statements to reflect some, but not all, of its methodology changes.
Where BT has restated the prior year comparatives, it sets out the effect at a market level, in Section 2.1.
In Section 2.1, BT also identifies a number of changes where it considers the restatement of comparative information for the year ended 31 March 2012 is either not practicable or not material.
One of the changes that BT has not reflected in its restated comparatives relates to the changes that are described by BT in Section 2.1 as reflecting the new organisational structure following the merger of BT Innovate & Design and BT Operate to create BT Technology, Service & Operations.
BT has explained to us that, although the impact of this change is material, it is unable to restate the 2011 12 accounts for the reasons given in Section 2.1.
We have written to BT requesting that it prepares a separate report setting out the reasons for, and effects of, all material methodology changes, in more detail.
We intend that a version of this report should be published on BTs website alongside its RFS, in September.
