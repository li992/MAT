com 106 ACCOUNTS Notes to the Company financial statements continued 9 Net pension asset The Company participates in both a funded defined benefit scheme and a funded defined contribution scheme.
Defined contribution scheme Pension costs for the defined contribution scheme, at rates specified in the schemes rules, are as follows: millions 2012 13 2011 12 Charge to operating profit 2 1 From July 2012 an enhanced defined contribution scheme has been offered to all Company employees.
Eligible Company employees will be automatically enrolled into the defined contribution scheme from 31 March 2013.
Defined benefit scheme Kingfisher plc is one of a number of Group companies that participate in the Kingfisher Pension Scheme, and therefore the Company has accounted for its share of the scheme assets and liabilities.
The valuation of the scheme has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2010 and has been updated to 2 February 2013.
During the year, and following consultation with the active members, the UK final salary pension scheme was closed to future benefit accrual with effect from 30 June 2012.
The scheme had been closed to new entrants in 2004.
The closure to future accrual resulted in an exceptional non-cash curtailment gain of 1m, representing the one-off reduction in accounting liabilities as benefits are no longer linked to future salary increases other than in line with inflation.
Furthermore, it resulted in a full provision against the net surplus being recognised at the curtailment date.
This exceptional non-cash asset restriction loss of 6m reflects the requirements under UK accounting standards, which restrict the amount of surplus that can be recognised following the closure to future accrual of benefits.
In the prior year the Company entered into the second phase of an arrangement with the scheme Trustee to address an element of the scheme deficit.
Further details on this arrangement are given in note 27 of the consolidated financial statements.
As part of this arrangement, the Company made a contribution of 106m to the scheme and subsequently recharged the other participating Group entities based on their share of pensionable payroll, resulting in a net cash contribution of 3m.

The assumptions are based on the conditions at the time and changes in these assumptions can lead to significant movements in the estimated obligation.
The discount rate is based on the yield on the iBoxx over 15 year AA-rated Sterling corporate bond index adjusted for the difference in term between iBoxx and scheme liabilities.
The overall expected rate of return on scheme assets reflects market expectations at the valuation date of long term asset returns and the mix of assets in the scheme.

The base mortality assumptions have been derived by adjusting standard mortality tables SAPS tables projected forward to 2010 with the medium cohort improvement factors for males and with the standard improvement factors for females.
In addition, allowance has been made for future increases in life expectancy.
For males, the allowance is in line with medium cohort improvements subject to a minimum rate of improvement of 1% pa, and for females, the allowance is in line with the average of the standard series and long cohort improvements, subject to a minimum of 1% pa.
These improvements take into account trends observed within the scheme over the past decade and general population trends.
The assumptions for life expectancy of the scheme members are as follows: Years 2012 13 2011 12 Age to which current pensioners are expected to live 60 now Male 86.4 86.4 Female 87.1 87.1 Age to which future pensioners are expected to live 60 in 15 years time Male 87.1 87.1 Female 88.7 88.7 10 Called up share capital Number of ordinary Ordinary shares share capital millions millions At 29 January 2012 2,369 372 New shares issued under share schemes 3 1 At 2 February 2013 2,372 373 At 30 January 2011 2,364 371 New shares issued under share schemes 5 1 At 28 January 2012 2,369 372 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 13 Business review Governance Accounts 109 11 Reserves Share premium Other Profit and loss millions account reserves account Total At 29 January 2012 2,199 711 1,467 4,377 Profit for the year 8 8 Actuarial losses on defined benefit pension scheme 2 2 Share-based compensation 7 7 Capital contributions given relating to share-based payments 71 71 New shares issued under share schemes 5 5 Own shares issued under share schemes 6 6 Dividends 221 221 At 2 February 2013 2,204 711 1,336 4,251 The other reserves represent the premium on the issue of convertible loan stock in 1993 and the merger reserve relating to the acquisition of Darty.

Restricted Awards are granted as one-off compensatory awards granted under the rules of the KISS.
They are nil cost options, as with the KISS, but do not accrue dividends until after they are exercised.
Vesting dates may vary according to individual grants.
Certain employees, excluding directors, have been granted contingent share awards under the Kingfisher Retention Share Scheme.
The Store Management Incentive Share Scheme provided provisional awards to store managers in 2009 with vesting dates of April 2011 and April 2012.
There are performance conditions based on store standards and an award will lapse if these are not maintained throughout the performance period.
These awards do not accrue dividends during the vesting period.
Under the UK Sharesave scheme, eligible UK employees have been invited to enter into HMRC approved savings contracts for a period of three or five years, whereby shares may be acquired with repayments under the contract.
The option price is the average market price over three days prior to an offer to subscribe, discounted by 20%.
Options are exercisable within a six month period from the conclusion of a three or five year period.
The International Sharesave scheme, which operates along similar lines to the UK Sharesave scheme, includes eligible employees in certain overseas locations.
The last grant of options under the Executive, International Executive and Phantom Share Option Schemes was made in April 2003.
Under these schemes, participants received a bi-annual grant of options based on their position in the Group.
These options are normally exercisable from the third anniversary of the date of the grant up to the tenth anniversary, except where the performance condition has not been met, in which case this date is deferred accordingly.
The performance conditions for all options have now been met.
On the exercise of Phantom Share Options, participants receive in cash the increase in value of the allocated number of shares in the Company.
The rules of all schemes include provision for the early exercise of options in certain circumstances.
Under FRS 20, Share-based payment, the Company recognises a charge for share options granted after 7 November 2002.
The Company has not repeated the disclosures required by FRS 20 as these are already included in note 30 of the Kingfisher plc consolidated financial statements.
