Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.
All gures rounded to reect the relative accuracy of the estimates.
Gold, silver, lead and zinc assays were capped where appropriate.
Mineral resources are reported at variable metal equivalent cut-off grades based on metal price assumptions and appropriate metallurgical recoveries.
2 Mineral resources quoted reect the Fresnillo plcs attributable 56% ownership of Minera Penmont.
3 Approximately 7% of the Noche Buenas total mineral resources shown in the above table are contained in mineral claims owned by a Fresnillo plc subsidiary.
4 Includes Fresnillo Proao, Saucito, Cinega and Herradura Vein deposits.
5 Includes the open pit portion of Herradura, Soledad-Dipolos and Noche Buena deposits.
6 Herradura mineral resources are reported at a single cut-off of 0.30 gpt Au for all material.
Ores reserves are reported at multiple cut-offs based on material type designated during reserve calculations.
Cut-off grade calculations assume variable metallurgical recoveries.
The cut-off grades for Cinegas mineral resources vary between the following range: 1.48 to 2.05 gpt Au equivalent.
Metal price assumptions considered for the calculation of metal equivalent grades are: Gold US$ oz 1,250, Silver US$ oz 19.50, Lead US$ lb 0.99 andZinc US$ lb 0.88.
