LOM Life of Mine years is based on scheduled Probable Reserves including Indicated and some Inferred Resources considered for Life of Mine planning.
Reported Diamond Reserves Resources are based on a Bottom Cut Off BCO which refers to the bottom screen size aperture and varies between 1.00mm and 3.00mm nominal square mesh.
Unless stated otherwise tonnage is quoted as dry metric tonnes.
Estimates of Diamond Reserve tonnes reflect the tonnage to be treated.
Recovered Grade is quoted as carats per hundred metric tonnes cpht.
Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to some Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will necessarily be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Resource after continued exploration.
1 Snap Lake: The increase in reserves is due to reclassification of a portion of Inferred Resources to Indicated Resources based on additional information from mining and underground drilling.
The decrease in LOM is due to the mining rate increasing and a re-assessment of the economic outline of the ore body that resulted in the exclusion of blocks which are no longer economic.
Indicated Resources are continuously developed from information gained from underground footwall drilling ahead of the mining face, resulting in an at least 18-month rolling Probable Reserve.
Reserve development beyond 18 months is considered impractical due to technical and cost considerations.
2 Victor: The decrease is primarily due to production as well as refinement of the geological model.
The Stockpile Resource estimates at a 1.50 mm BCO of 25 k 0.2 Mt at 13.2 cpht Indicated Resource are excluded from the table.
Tango Extension Pipe is reported as part of the Victor Resource and comprises 3.0M in 13.4 Mt at a grade of 22.9 cpht BCO is 1.50mm.
3 Gahcho Ku: The increase in resources is due to completion of a deep drilling campaign at the Tuzo pipe.
The project approval is subject to the successful conclusion of permitting and regulatory approvals.

1 Venetia: The LOM is stated as 31 years which reflects the full duration of the current Venetia consolidated OP and UG Life of Mine Plan.
2 Venetia OP : The Life of Mine plan includes the K01, K02 and K03 pipes.
The 2014 mine plan includes a significant portion of Inferred Resources.
The Old Recovery Tailings Resource estimate at a 1.00 mm BCO of 2.5 M 0.1 Mt at 3844.6 cpht Inferred Resource is excluded from the table.
3 Venetia UG : The reserves decrease due to a change in the mine design for the K02 pipe which transfers material to the open pit portion of the mine.

5 Voorspoed: The change is due to production.
The Mining License was approved on 10 October 2006 and construction commenced in the same month after the mine being dormant for nine decades.
Mining is entirely based on Inferred Resources due to the uncertainty associated with current geoscientific knowledge.
Some studies to improve resource confidence were completed late in 2013.
6 Kimberley Mines: Kimberley Mines Central Treatment Plant CTP was initially established to treat ore from both tailings resources and underground mines.
Subsequent to the conclusion of the sale of the underground operations to Petra Diamonds in May 2010, only tailings resources are being treated.
The Stockpile estimates at a 1.15mm BCO of 37 k 299 kt at 12.4 cpht Inferred Resource are excluded from the table.

In Botswana the mines are owned in equal share by fide Beers Socit Anonyme and the Government of the Republic of Botswana through the Debswana Diamond Company joint venture.
1 Damtshaa: The increase in the Life of Mine is due to the inclusion of additional Inferred Resources in the mine plan.
Higher grade Inferred Resources from the BK 12 Kimberlite are mined for the first five years before including Probable Reserves from BK 9.
The BK 9 and BK 12 Stockpile Inferred Resource estimates at a 1.65mm BCO of 0.3 M 1.9 Mt at13.4 cpht are excluded from the table.
2 Jwaneng: The decrease is primarily due to production.
The 2013 Life of Mine Plan includes the Cut 8 estimates of 96 Mt of ore to be treated containing an estimated 113 M North, Centre and South pipes excluding the 4th pipe which is mined as part of waste stripping and stockpiled.
Scheduled Inferred Resources below 401m included in the Cut 8 estimates constitute 77% 86.7 M of the estimated carats.
The Jwaneng Resource Extension Project JREP is expected to increase the resource confidence at depth and upgrade a significant portion of Inferred Resources to Indicated.
The DK 2 Stockpile estimates at a 1.47mm BCO, consisting of 1.1 M 0.8 Mt at 138.6 cpht Indicated Resources and 4.4 M 10.0 Mt at 43.7 cpht Inferred Resources are excluded from the table.
3 Letlhakane: The decrease in the Kimberlite resources is due to depletion.
Higher anticipated plant recoveries result in the slightly higher TMR reserve grade than resource grade.
DK 1 and DK 2 Stockpile estimates at a 1.65mm BCO of 0.6 M 3.5 Mt at 16.9 cpht Inferred Resource are excluded from the table.
4 Orapa: The decrease in treated tonnes is due to production.
The decrease in LOM tonnes reflects the temporary exclusion of Cut 3 pending further studies incorporating additional information from the Orapa Resource Extension Program OREP which is expected to increase resource confidence at depth resulting in an upgrade of a large portion of Inferred Resources to Indicated.
The increase in saleable carats is due to reduced plant losses improved plant factors and mine design changes.
The AK 1 Stockpile estimates at a1.65mm BCO of 6.2 M 13.6 Mt at 45.7 cpht Inferred Resource are excluded from the table.

In addition, NDBH holds 100% ownership of the operating companies, Namdeb Diamond Corporation Pty Ltd and fide Beers Marine Namibia Pty Ltd.
Mining method: OC Open Cast, MM Marine Mining.
Recovered Grade is quoted as carats per hundred metric tonnes cpht or as carats per square meter cpm.
1 Elizabeth Bay: The decrease is primarily due to production.
2 Mining Area 1: The increase in treated tonnes is due to inclusion of lower grade material included in the 2013 Life of Mine Plan as a result of geological contact changes and a resource model update.
The decrease in grade and carats is due to depletion of high grade material, the inclusion of the lower grade material and the exclusion of high grade material currently situated under mine infrastructure.
Incremental Inferred Resource development is dependent on beach accretion for drilling and sampling.
Beach accretion is a process through which an existing beach is built seaward to extend into areas previously submerged by sea water.
The accretion is accomplished by sand build-up derived from current mining and dredging activities.
The Overburden Stockpile estimates at a 2.00mm BCO of 33 k 9,227 kt at 0.36 cpht Inferred Resource, the DMS and Recovery Tailings Resource estimates at a 2.00mm BCO of 751 k 64,427 kt at 1.17 cpht Inferred Resource are excluded from the table.
3 Orange River: The mining transition from Daberas to Sendelingsdrif will be completed within the next three years.
4 Atlantic 1: The increase in reserve carats is due to new information allowing conversion of additional resources to reserves and a faster mining rate which allows a lowering of the cut-off grade.
Due to the high costs associated with resource development, Indicated Resources are developed on an annual basis, resulting in a 24 month rolling reserve.
5 Bogenfels: Bottom screen cut off details for Inferred Resource estimates are as follows: 1.40 mm BCO: 510 k 7,910 kt at 6.47 cpht : 2.00 mm BCO: 230 k 3,040 kt at 7.50 cpht.
