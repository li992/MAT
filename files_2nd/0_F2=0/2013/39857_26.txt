Notes to the financial statements 95 For the year ended 30 September 2013 1.
GENEral iNFOrmaTiON GENEral iNFOrmaTiON The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 30 September 2013 comprise the results of the Company, its subsidiaries and joint venture and were approved by the Board for issue on 27 November 2013.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 10 to 13.
The Company is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The address of the registered office is given on page 55.
Basis OF PrEParaTiON These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, IFRIC interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of investment properties and the measurement of derivative financial instruments at fair value through the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Accounting policies have been applied consistently in all periods presented in these financial statements.
The Company has not presented its own Statement of Comprehensive Income, as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Company made a profit of 75.0 million 2012: 0.1 million in the year.
GOiNG CONCErN The Group adopts the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements as explained on page 58.
CriTiCal JudGEmENTs, assumPTiONs aNd EsTimaTEs The Groups significant accounting policies are stated in note 2.
Not all of these significant accounting policies require the directors to make difficult, subjective or complex judgements or estimates.
However the directors consider the valuation of investment property to be critical because of the level of complexity, judgement or estimation involved and its impact on the financial statements.
These judgements involve assumptions or estimates in respect of future events.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The Group uses the valuations performed by its external valuers, DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited and Knight Frank LLP, as the basis for the fair value of its investment properties.
The valuation of the Groups property portfolio is inherently subjective due to, among other factors, the individual nature of each property, its location and the expected future rental income.
As a result, the valuations the Group places on its property portfolio are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate, particularly in periods of volatility or low transaction flow in the commercial property market.
The investment property valuations contain a number of assumptions upon which DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited and Knight Frank LLP have based their valuations: these are detailed in the Basis of Valuation on pages 50 to 51.
These assumptions are in accordance with the RICS Valuation Standards.
However, if any assumptions made by the external valuers prove to be incorrect, this may mean that the value of the Groups properties differs from their valuation reported in the financial statements, which could have a material effect on the Groups financial condition.
2. aCCOuNTiNG POliCiEs NEW aCCOuNTiNG sTaNdards aNd iNTErPrETaTiONs a The following amendment to a standard is mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 october 2012: sTaNdard Or iNTErPrETaTiON EFFECTivE FrOm IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements on oCI 1 July 2012 No material changes to accounting policies arose as a result of this amendment.

Under IFRS 11, joint ventures must be accounted for on an equity basis.
This will result in the Group recognising a single line item for the investment and its share of the joint ventures profit or loss.
This change will not affect the Groups reported net assets nor profit after tax.
IFRS 13 Fair value measurement 1 January 2013 Under IFRS 13 the Groups derivative financial instruments will be subject to a credit value adjustment CVA.
The CVA takes into account the credit worthiness of the respective counterparties.
The impact will be to increase decrease reported net assets if the fair value is in a liability asset position and increase decrease profit after tax.
Basis OF CONsOlidaTiON The consolidated financial statements incorporate the audited financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, together with the Groups share of the results of its joint venture, made up to the Balance Sheet date.
suBsidiariEs Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists where the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to direct the financial and operating activities of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
The accounting policies of the subsidiaries are consistent with those adopted by the Group.
In the Companys Balance Sheet, investments in subsidiaries are included at cost less any provision in respect of permanent impairment loss.
JOiNT vENTurEs Joint ventures are those entities over which the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the proportional consolidation method permitted under IAS 31 Interests in joint ventures.
The Groups Balance Sheet includes its share of the assets and liabilities of the joint venture entity and the Groups Statement of Comprehensive Income includes its share of the entitys income and expenditure.
The profit or loss arising on transactions with the joint venture entity are recognised only to the extent of that attributable to the interest of the other joint venture party unless any loss represents a permanent impairment loss, in which case it is provided in full.
In the Companys Balance Sheet, investments in joint ventures are stated at cost less any provisions for permanent impairment loss.
Amounts capitalised comprise costs incurred which are directly attributable to the formation of a specific joint venture entity.
aCQuisiTiONs Where properties are acquired through corporate acquisitions and there are no significant assets other than investment property and liabilities, and without a business being acquired, the acquisition is treated as an asset acquisition.
In all other cases, the acquisition is treated as a business combination.
iNvEsTmENT PrOPErTiEs Investment properties are properties owned or leased by the Group which are held to generate rental income or long-term capital appreciation or both.
All of the Groups leases to its tenants fall within the definition of operating leases, as the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the Group as lessor.
Investment properties are initially recognised on acquisition at cost, including related acquisition costs, and are revalued annually to reflect fair value.
Fair value is determined either by external professional valuers or by the directors in the case of properties sold shortly after the period end.
The fair value, as determined by the valuers, is reduced for any unamortised lease incentives held at the Balance Sheet date.
In the case of investment properties which are leasehold interests, such leases are accounted for as head leases and recognised as an asset and an obligation to pay future minimum lease payments.
The investment property asset is held in the Balance Sheet at fair value, gross of the head lease liability.
Lease payments are allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant period rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Gains or losses arising on the revaluation of investment properties are included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the accounting period in which they arise.
Depreciation is not provided in respect of investment properties.
Additions to properties include costs of a capital nature only.
Expenditure is classified as capital when it results in identifiable future economic benefits which are expected to accrue to the Group.
All other property expenditure is written-off in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as incurred.
Amounts received by way of compensation for dilapidations from tenants vacating properties are credited against the cost of reinstatement works.
Where the Group has no intention of carrying out such works, the amounts received are credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Purchases and sales of investment properties are recognised in the financial statements on the date at which there is a legally binding and unconditional contract.
dErivaTivE FiNaNCial iNsTrumENTs Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently measured at fair value based on market prices, estimated future cash flows and forward interest rates.
movements in fair value are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income within net finance costs.
Amounts payable or receivable under such arrangements are included within finance costs or income, recognised on an accruals basis.

Expenses and discounts relating to the issue of long-term debt are deducted from the proceeds and written-off in the Statement of Comprehensive Income over the life of the debt instrument using an effective yield method.
Any premium arising on the issue of long-term debt is added to the proceeds and credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income over the life of the debt instrument using an effective interest method.
The costs of arranging long and medium-term bank facilities are written-off in the Statement of Comprehensive Income at a rate which results in a constant charge over the unexpired term of the facilities.
TradE rECEivaBlEs aNd PayaBlEs Trade receivables and trade payables are recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost.
In the case of trade receivables a provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Cash aNd Cash EQuivalENTs Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and on-demand bank deposits.
Where such deposits can be offset against any amounts owing to the same bank in accordance with its loan agreement, and in the event of settlement the Group intends to settle as a net liability, they are deducted from that loan liability.
OrdiNary sharEs ordinary shares are classified as equity when there is no obligation to transfer cash or other assets.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from retained earnings.
rEvENuE Revenue comprises rents receivable from tenants under operating leases, recognised on an accruals basis, and recoverable expenses incurred on behalf of tenants.
Rents are recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Value added tax is excluded from all amounts.
Income arising as a result of rent reviews is recognised when agreement of new terms is reasonably certain.
Premiums receivable from tenants to surrender their lease obligations are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, unless they arise in connection with a capital project in which case they are deducted from project costs.
The cost of any incentives given to lessees to enter into leases is spread over the period from the lease commencement date, to the earlier of its expiry date or to the date of the first break, on a straight-line basis.
Lease incentives are usually in the form of rent-free periods.
PrOPErTy CharGEs Irrecoverable operating costs attributable to properties are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income when they arise.
Premiums payable to tenants in connection with the surrender of their lease obligations are recognised immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, unless they arise in connection with a capital project in which case they are capitalised.
EmPlOyEE BENEFiTs i Share based remuneration The cost of granting share options and other share based remuneration to employees is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income based on the fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value of the net asset value non-market based vesting condition is calculated when the options are granted using the modified binomial option pricing model.
At the end of each reporting period, the directors review their estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on actual and forecast net asset values.
The impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The fair value of the total shareholder return market based vesting condition is calculated when the options are granted using the monte Carlo simulation option pricing model, using various assumptions as set out in note 32.
The fair value is charged on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
No adjustment is made to the original estimate for market based conditions after the date of grant regardless of whether the options vest or not.
The amount charged in the Statement of Comprehensive Income is credited to the share based payments reserve.
Following the exercise of share options, the charges previously recognised in respect of these options are released from the share based payments reserve to retained earnings.
ii Pension contributions Payments to defined contribution plans are charged as an expense to the Statement of Comprehensive Income as they fall due.
lEasEs i The Group as lessor Operating leases - all of the Groups leases to its tenants fall within the definition of operating leases, as substantially all the risk and rewards of ownership are retained by the Group.
long leaseholds - where the Group grants residential long leasehold interests to tenants, as substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the tenant, the property is not recognised as an investment property.
ii The Group as a lessee Operating leases - the lease under which the Group occupies office accommodation for its own administration is accounted for as an operating lease, with rents payable charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
head leases - where the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group they are accounted for as head leases.
Head leases are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the lower of fair value of the property and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The present value of future ground rents is added to the carrying value of the leasehold investment property and to long-term liabilities.
on payment of ground rent all of the costs are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income, principally as interest payable, and the balance reduces the liability: an equal reduction to the assets valuation is charged in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Shaftesbury annual report 2013 financial statements 98 Notes to the financial statements continued 2. aCCOuNTiNG POliCiEs continued CurrENT aNd dEFErrEd COrPOraTiON TaX The tax expense or credit in a given year comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the corporation tax payable on taxable income for the current year adjusted for prior years under or over provisions.
Deferred tax is provided in respect of all temporary timing differences between the values at which assets and liabilities are recorded in the financial statements and their base cost for corporation tax purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income unless the items to which it relates have been accounted for in equity, in which case the related deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
In the case of deferred tax in relation to investment property revaluation surpluses, the base cost used is historical book cost and ignores any allowances or deductions which may be available to reduce the actual tax liability which would crystallise in the event of a disposal of the asset.
The Group expects to recover the value of its investment property assets through future rental income streams.
Deferred tax liabilities or assets are calculated using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax balance is realised.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
3. sEGmENTal iNFOrmaTiON The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Board, which is responsible for reviewing the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance and the allocation of resources.
The Groups properties, which are all located in Londons West End, are managed as a single portfolio.
Its properties, which are of similar type, are combined into villages.
All of the villages are geographically close to each other and have similar economic features and risks.
For the purposes of IFRS 8, each village is considered to be a separate operating segment.
However, in view of the similar characteristics of each village, and the reporting of all investment, income and expenditure to the Board at an overall Group level, the aggregation criteria set out in IFRS 8 have been applied to give one reportable operating segment.
The Board assesses the performance of the reportable operating segment using measures of net property income and investment property valuation.
All financial information provided to the Board is prepared on a basis consistent with these financial statements and, as the Group has only one reportable segment, the measures used in assessing the business are set out in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.

The extent to which the fair value deficit will crystallise will depend on the course of interest rates over the life of the swaps.

22. maNaGEmENT OF FiNaNCial risk CrEdiT risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on their contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group reviews the creditworthiness of potential tenants prior to entering into contractual arrangements.
Where appropriate, tenants are required to provide cash rental deposits to mitigate the potential loss in the event of default.
Deposits held are referred to in note 17.
The Group has a large and diverse tenant base so that tenant credit risk is widely spread.
Provision is made in full where recovery of financial assets is, in the opinion of the directors, uncertain.
The carrying amount of financial assets, net of provisions for impairment, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The Groups bankers are set out on page 55.
The Group tends to hold minimal cash balances, utilising overdraft and loan facilities for its day-to-day cash requirements.
Where cash deposits are held, they are placed with one of the Groups existing facility providers.
liQuidiTy risk The Board keeps under review the Groups funding requirements, available facilities and covenant compliance to ensure it has sufficient funds available to meet its existing commitments and to extend its portfolio through investment and acquisition of additional properties.
The Groups policies regarding finance and its current financial position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 38 to 40. markET risk market risk arises from the Groups use of interest bearing financial instruments, and is the risk that future cash flows from financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in interest rates and credit costs.
The Groups policy is to minimise market risk through long-term fixed rate debt, long-term committed bank facilities and the use of long-term interest rate swaps on a large portion of its floating rate bank debt.
As described in the Strategic Report on pages 38 to 40, the Board keeps under review the Groups market risk, particularly in light of expectations of future interest rate movements.
Details of the Groups interest and hedging arrangements are set out in note 20. iNTErEsT raTE sENsiTiviTy The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates on its unhedged LIBoR-linked borrowings and a change in the long-term interest rates against which the fair value of swaps is calculated at the Balance Sheet date.

The type and maturity of the Groups borrowings is set out in note 20 and the Groups equity structure is set out in the Statement of Changes in Shareholders Equity.
The Group regularly reviews its covenant compliance as discussed in the Strategic Report on page 40.
The Groups capital management objectives are to continue as a going concern and to provide enhanced shareholder returns whilst maintaining an appropriate risk reward balance to accommodate changing financial and operating market cycles.
