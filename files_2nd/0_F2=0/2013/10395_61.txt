Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution schemes The group operates a number of defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for qualifying employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the group in funds controlled by the scheme providers.

Defined benefit schemes Group defined benefit scheme The group operates a defined benefit pension scheme called the MITIE Group PLC Pension Scheme where MITIE Group PLC is the principal employer.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from the group.
Contributions to the scheme are charged to the income statement so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives with the group.
Under the scheme, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits varying between 0% and 66% of final salary on attainment of a retirement age of 65.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.
The scheme is a funded scheme.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the group schemes assets and the present value of their defined benefit obligations was carried out as at 1 April 2011 by Chris Vaughan-Williams, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries, from Aon Hewitt Limited.
The next triennial valuation is due as at 1 April 2014.
Other defined benefit schemes Grouped together under Other schemes are a number of schemes to which the group makes contributions under Admitted Body status to our customers defined benefit schemes in respect of certain TUPE employees, and no schemes 2012: one scheme in which the group is a participating employer.
These valuations are updated by the actuaries at each balance sheet date.
The present values of the defined benefit obligations, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
For the Admitted Body Schemes, which are all part of the Local Government Pension Scheme, the group will only participate for a finite period up to the end of the contracts.
The group is required to pay regular contributions as decided by the relevant Scheme Actuaries and detailed in the schemes Schedule of Contributions.
In a number of cases contributions payable by the employer are capped and any excess is recovered from the body that the employees transferred from.
In addition, in certain cases, at the end of the contract the group will be required to pay any deficit as determined by the Scheme Actuary that is remaining for its notional section of the scheme.
