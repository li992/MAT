on current forecasts and estimates prepared by management.
A change to these forecasts and estimates could result in a Dividends different recognition outcome.
Final dividends proposed by the Board and unpaid at the year end are not recognised in the financial statements until they have been approved by the shareholders at the AGM.
Interim dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.
Critical accounting estimates and assumptions The preparation of financial statements requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect items reported.
Such estimates and assumptions are based on managements best knowledge of current facts, circumstances and future events.
Actual results may differ, possibly significantly, from those estimates.
The areas requiring a high degree of judgement or where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are discussed below.
Goodwill impairment The Group tests annually by cash-generating unit whether goodwill has suffered impairment and more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the current carrying value may not be recoverable.
The recoverable amounts of cashgenerating units have been determined based on value in use calculations, which require the use of estimates and assumptions in respect of future cash flows and discount rates.
Recoverability of debtors and inventory Where the recoverability of debtors or inventory is deemed to be in doubt, the Group makes appropriate provisions against the balance.
These provisions are applied consistently across all operating entities, based on standard Group-wide accounting procedures, and have been applied on the same basis as in prior years.

ii Interest rate risk At 31 December 2013, if interest rates on Euro denominated borrowings at that date had been 0.5% higher lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 1.1 million 2012: 0.7 million lower higher, mainly as a result of higher lower interest expense on floating rate borrowings.
b Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of BBB are accepted.
If customers are independently rated, these ratings are used.
Otherwise, if there is no independent rating, risk control assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors.
Individual risk limits are set based on internal or external ratings in accordance with limits set by the Board.
The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored.
The value of financial instruments held represents the maximum exposure that the Group has to them.
No collateral is held for this type of credit risk.
See Note 9 for further disclosure on financial instruments.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period, and management does not expect any material losses from nonperformance by these counterparties.

Categorisation within the fair value hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset or liability as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation inputs that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is largely determined by comparison between forward market prices and the contract price and therefore these contracts are categorised as Level 2.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including current and non-current borrowings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.
Total capital is calculated as equity as shown in the consolidated balance sheet plus net debt.
During 2013, the Groups strategy was to maintain the gearing ratio below 40%.
The gearing ratios at 31 December 2013 and 2012 were as follows: 2013 2012 Note 000 000 Total borrowings 17 230,566 220,598 Less: cash and cash equivalents 14 80,039 50,138 Net debt 150,527 170,460 Total equity 341,304 318,473 Total capital 491,831 488,933 Gearing ratio 31% 35% The decrease in the gearing ratio during 2013 resulted primarily from the additional cash received from the primary offer of shares.

The full fair value of a derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the item is more than 12 months and, as a current asset or liability, if the maturity of the item is less than 12 months.
Fair value is determined by reference to observable market data.
The total carrying amount of the asset or liability represents the fair value amount the Group would be required to pay receive at the balance sheet date to from the holder of the obligation and is charged credited to the Group income statement.
a Forward foreign exchange contracts The notional principal amounts of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2013 were 15,641,000 31 December 2012: 9,150,000. b Interest rate swaps The notional principal amounts of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 December 2013 were 220,000,000 31 December 2012: 220,000,000.

All issued shares are fully paid by cash consideration and all carry equal voting rights.
Proceeds from the issue of new shares are 35,075,000.
The share premium of 33,281,000 is shown net of fees of 1,794,000, with the final net proceeds from the primary issue of shares, after deducting further fees which are charged to the income statement, being 29,479,000.
In 2013, the movement in the currency translation reserve is predominantly due to the movement in the Japanese Yen against the Euro and the impact of this on the revaluation of the assets and liabilities on consolidation, relating to HellermannTyton Co, Japan.
The preference shares were redeemed by the Company resulting in the creation of the capital redemption reserve, which is non-distributable.
Other reserves in 2012 comprise capital contributions from the previous shareholders.
The balance in 2013 arises on the Group restructuring.

Interest on the notes is payable quarterly in arrears on 15 March, 15 June, 15 September and 15 December each year, and at a rate of 5.125% above three-month Euribor.
The notes will mature on 15 December 2017.
Cross currency interest rate swaps have been taken out to hedge the currency fluctuations and interest costs see Note 12.
In December 2013, the decision was made to refinance the Groups borrowings, which was completed on 26 February 2014.
The secured notes will be fully repaid within 30 days of this date and replaced with new bank borrowings at a lower rate of interest.
As at 31 December 2013 therefore, the secured notes have been recorded at their full repayment value together with an early repayment fee of 1%.
Transaction costs of 11,031,000 had been capitalised in relation to the secured notes as at 31 December 2012: as a consequence of the expected refinance, these amounts have been expensed in 2013 within finance costs.
Secured notes currently bear the following interest rate: 2013 2012 000 Interest 000 Interest Total secured notes 220,000 5.308% 220,000 5.308% Less: transaction costs 11,031 Early repayment fee 1% 2,200 222,200 208,969 Revolving credit facility The Group has an undrawn revolving credit facility of 80 million 31 December 2012: 80 million, which expires beyond one year.
If the facility is drawn down, a leverage covenant will apply.
No draw down was made during the year.
As at 31 December 2012, transaction costs of 3,740,000 were capitalised in relation to the instrument.
This revolving credit facility will be redeemed in March 2014 as part of the Groups refinancing and as such the capitalised transaction costs have been fully expensed in the year.
The secured notes and undrawn revolving credit facility are secured by the land and buildings, inventory and trade receivables of the Group.
Parent Company loan, mandatory redeemable preference shares and ordinary Class A-II shares On 2 April 2013, upon admission to the London Stock Exchange, the Parent Company loan, ordinary Class A-II shares and mandatory redeemable preference shares were exchanged for new shares in the Company as part of the reorganisation of the Group.

In the Directors opinion, after taking legal advice, the outcome of these legal claims will not give rise to any significant loss beyond the amounts provided at 31 December 2013.

The compensation cost recognised in the Groups income statement in relation to share based payment plans is set out in the table below: Expense recognised for the year 2013 2012 000 000 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan 1,479 Global Share Plan free shares 165 Global Share Plan matching shares 1 1,645 Movements in the number of share options outstanding for the 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP are as follows: Options 2013 2012 000 000 At 1 January Granted 3,868 Forfeited Exercised Expired At 31 December 3,868 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan Share options under the 2013 LTIP were issued to certain key management in three phases during the year, with those employees being granted nil-cost share options restricted stock units in the US dependent on meeting certain performance criteria.
50% of the shares are valued using the Black-Scholes model and the remaining 50% are valued based on the Monte Carlo model.
Details of these can be found in the Directors remuneration report on page 43.
These shares vest in three years from the date of grant.
Global Share Plan The Global Share Plan GSP offers three ways to provide shares to employees: free shares: shares purchased using contributions from employees: and free matching shares.
The free shares and matching shares are at a cost to the Group, and are described in more detail in the Directors remuneration report on pages 3536, and in summary below.
Employee free shares Free shares were awarded to the majority of employees in the Group who had been employed for at least 12 months at the grant date, in two phases during the year, and these shares vest in three years from the date of grant.
Matching shares A share matching scheme was established for certain Group employees in December 2013, with the intention to extend this to the remaining eligible employees in the Group in early 2014.
For shares purchased by the employee on a monthly basis, the Company will match those shares up to a maximum annual amount.
Fair value and assumptions The fair value of the awards under the 2013 LTIP and the GSP is estimated at the grant date using either a Black-Scholes valuation or a Monte Carlo simulation, depending on the performance conditions that must be met for the award to vest.
For the element of the share options based on earnings per share EPS growth or continuous employment, the Black-Scholes model has been used, and for the element of the share options based on the Companys total shareholder return TSR, a Monte Carlo simulation has been used.

An estimated share price volatility rate of 31% has been used for grants in the period.
This is based on the historic volatility of a comparator group of 20 FTSE 350 All Share companies, as there is no share price history available for the Group before April 2013.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds over three years as determined by the Bank of England, and the rate applied during the year was 0.3% to 0.9% depending on the grant date.
The fair value of the share options for the matching share scheme is estimated as the share price at grant date.
The fair values are calculated in Sterling as the shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange, and translated into Euro at the relevant exchange rates.

For HellermannTyton Japan, the official retirement age is 60.
For employees retiring from HellermannTyton Japan at 60 years of age, there is a choice in respect of their pensions.
They can elect to receive a lump sum payment or choose to have the pension paid to them in instalments spread over five to ten years.
Where employees choose to receive the money in instalments, these are paid quarterly from the pension fund over the specified duration minimum five years, maximum ten years.
As there are no options for pensions to be paid out over more than ten years or conversely paid out over less than four years, except in the case of a lump sum payment, life expectancy is not factored into the calculations.
