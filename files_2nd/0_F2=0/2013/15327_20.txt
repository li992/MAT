Accounting policies and basis ofpreparation continued Accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying theGroups accounting policies.
Estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are continually reviewed and revised as necessary.
Whilst every effort is made to ensure that such estimates and assumptions are reasonable, by their nature they are uncertain, and as such changes in estimates and assumptions may have amaterial impact.
The areas involving the most sensitive estimates and assumptions that are significant to the financial statements are set out in more detail in the related notes: tax note 7 : exceptional items note 9 : impairment of goodwill note 11 : capitalisation and useful economic lives of assets notes 11 and 12 : impairment of assets notes 11 and 12 : and trade receivables note 16.

Thesewereforgiven in the year ended 31 March 2012.
Share-based payments Accounting policy The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a dividend discount or Binomial model for share-based payments with internal, non-market performance criteria for example, EPS targets and a Black Scholes or Monte Carlo model for those with external, market performance criteria for example, TSR targets.
For schemes with non-market performance criteria, the number of options expected to vest is recalculated at each balance sheet date, based on expectations of performance against target and of leavers prior to vesting.
Themovement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in reserves.
For schemes with market performance criteria, the number of options expected to vest is adjusted only for expectations of leavers prior to vesting.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in reserves.
If a scheme is cancelled, any remaining part of the fair value of the scheme is expensed immediately.
If a scheme is forfeited, no further expense is recognised and any charges previously recognised are reversed.

Share-based payments continued Accounting policy continued Charges arise on loans that are provided to employees to fund the purchase of shares in the Group as part of long term incentive plans.
To the extent to which the loans are not, in certain circumstances, repayable, the cost of such loans is expensed over the course of the relevant incentive plans.
Charges are also recognised on loans provided to employees to settle personal tax liabilities: to the extent to which the loans are not, in certain circumstances, repayable, the cost of such loans is expensed on grant.
In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment no cost has been recognised in respect of the options granted before November 2002.
Group share schemes The Groups share schemes are the All Employee Share Option Award 2012, the Discretionary Share Option Plan DSOP and Save-As-You-Earn Scheme SAYE.
In addition, the Group has a number of legacy CPW schemes.
In order to aid the user of the accounts, the dilutive effect on EPS of each of the Group schemes and legacy CPW schemes has been presented.
This has been calculated using an average share price for the financial year of 1.98 2012: 1.36.
For the CPW legacy schemes, with no IFRS 2 charge in current or prior year, the disclosures are limited to the dilutive effect on EPS and the number of options outstanding at the end of the year.

v TTG VES and CPW TTG VES The TTG VES enables participants to share in up to 7% of any increase in the value of the Group over an opening valuation representing invested capital at 1 April 2009, adjusted as relevant for changes in invested capital since that date.
The incremental value is measured after a minimum annual rate of return of 7% on this invested capital.
The Group advanced loans to participants to enable them to purchase A shares in TalkTalk Group Limited, the holding company of the Groups operating business.
The CPW TTG VES enables participants to share in 2.24% ofany increase in the value of the Group over an opening valuation representing invested capital at 1 April 2009, adjusted for the change in the Groups opening share price since 1 April 2009.
In line with the TTG VES, the invested capital is adjusted for changes in invested capital since 1 April 2009 and the incremental value is measured after a minimum annual rate of return of 7%.
For the vesting in September 2013, this is capped attheSeptember 2012 amount.
The Groups opening share price for this purpose represents an allocation of the share price of CPW at that rate, based on the market capitalisation of the Group and Carphone Warehouse Group PLC in the five days following demerger.
CPW advanced loans to participants to enable them to purchase C shares in TalkTalk Group Limited, the holding company of the Groups operating businesses.

Share-based payments continued TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC schemes continued v TTG VES and CPW TTG VES continued The Group has an obligation to acquire the A and C shares if performance conditions are met, to provide to participants the share of value described above.
The fair value of the schemes, which has performance targets based on the growth of the market capitalisation ofthe Group, was estimated at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo model to initially value the A shares and then a Black Scholes model to calculate the option value.
The model combines the valuation price of a share at the date of grant with the probability of meeting performance criteria, based on the expected value of the Group atthe date of grant discounted for the lack of marketability of the shares.
On 17 September 2012, the Groups Remuneration Committee determined that the relevant performance conditions of these VES schemes including the 5% TSR requirement had been satisfied, meaning the VES participants were entitled to exercise 60% of their VES options.
The remaining 40% will vest in September 2013 subject to ongoing performance conditions being met.
The participants options were acquired by the Company for new ordinary shares in the Company and cash resulting in a cash outflow of 35m.
The net issue of 17 million shares in the Company was at a price of 1.86 per share being the average closing price of the Companys shares on 18 and 19September 2012.
The settlement of the schemes resulted in a net movement in reserves of 31m, being the recognition of share premium of 32m and a 63m debit in retained earnings and other reserves.
The 63m debit to reserves represents a total cash outflow of 35m and the value of new PLC shares issued of 32m net of the repayment of the associated VES loans, interest and a reduction in the Groups liability to settle the schemes.
Finance costs Finance costs are analysed as follows: 2013 2012 m m Interest on bank loans and overdrafts 14 14 Facility fees and similar charges 4 3 Unwinding of discount on provisions 1 1 19 18 During the prior year the Group refinanced its revolving credit facility and paid 7m in respect of facility fees.
This is being amortised over the expected life of the loan and is included within facility fees and similar charges above.
Taxation Accounting policy Current tax, including UK corporation tax and overseas tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base.
Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets represent tax recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, and the carry-forward of unused tax losses and credits.
Deferred tax is determined using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except where it relates to an item recognised directly in reserves, in which case it is recognised directly in reserves.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legal right to do so in the relevant jurisdictions.
Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policy The extent to which tax losses can be utilised depends on the extent to which taxable profits are generated in the relevant jurisdictions for the foreseeable future, on the tax legislation then in force, and as such the value of associated deferred tax assets is uncertain.

Accordingly the tax assets and liabilities recognised at 31 March 2013 take account of this change.
This has resulted in a tax charge to the income statement as the value of the Groups tax assets have been reduced.
The Government intends to enact further reductions in the main tax rate, down to 21% effective from 1April 2014 and to 20% from 1 April 2015.
As these tax rates were not substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, the rate reduction is not reflected in these financial statements.
The asset also reflects the annual recognition of a further tranche of the tax losses acquired with Tiscali UK Limited, including Video Networks Limited, based on the Groups rolling forecast.
This is in line with the Group's agreement with HMRC, reached in the previous year, following which the immediate increase in the deferred tax asset of 45m was recognised as an exceptional credit note 9.
At 31 March 2013, the Group had unused tax losses of 759m 2012: 873m available for offset against future taxable profits.
A deferred tax asset of 40m 2012: 56m has been recognised in respect of 172m 2012: 232m of such losses, based on expectations of recovery in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 587m 2012: 641m as there is insufficient evidence that there will be suitable taxable profits against which these losses can be recovered.
Alllosses may be carried forward indefinitely.

Dividends Accounting policy Dividend income is recognised when payment has been received.
Final dividend distributions are recognised as aliability in the financial statements in the year in which they are approved by the relevant shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised in the year in which they are paid.
The following dividends were paid by the Group to its shareholders: 2013 2012 m m Ordinary dividends Final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2011 of 3.9p per ordinary share 35 Interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2012 of 2.6p per ordinary share 23 Final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2012 of 6.4p per ordinary share 56 Interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2013 of 3.45p per ordinary share 31 Total ordinary dividends 87 58 The proposed final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2013 is 6.95p per ordinary share on approximately 892million shares 62m, which was approved by the Board on 15 May 2013 and has not been included as a liability asat 31March 2013.
The Group ESOT has waived its rights to receive dividends in the current and prior year and this is reflected in the analysis above.
Reconciliation of Headline information to Statutory information Accounting policy Headline results are stated before the amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional items.
Exceptional items are those that are considered to be one-off, non-recurring in nature and so material that the Directors believe that they require separate disclosure to avoid distortion of underlying performance and should be separately presented on the face of the income statement.

Reconciliation of Headline information to Statutory information continued Accounting policy continued a Operating efficiencies Phase III Making TalkTalk Simpler During the year ended 31 March 2013, the Group has continued a review of operating structure to drive process and efficiency improvements over the medium term.
The initiatives that form part of the Groups Making TalkTalk Simpler programme implemented in the year were: a restructuring of the systems and processes in TalkTalk Business to remove duplication and better align the sales and service model for future growth: and a review and consolidation of the outsourcing partners and rebalancing of the Groups on-shore footprint.
This has resulted inredundancy, dual running, property and project management costs.
The total charge incurred in the year ended31 March 2013 was 7m 2012: nil.
A total taxation credit of 2m in respect of this item has been recognised in the year ended 31 March 2013 2012: nil.
b Operating efficiencies Phase II Consumer contact centre rationalisation On 24 April 2012, the Group announced the second stage of its contact centre rationalisation.
This resulted in consolidating and outsourcing operations in Preston and Northampton.
Costs were incurred in respect of redundancy, dual running and consultancy.
The total charge incurred in the year ended 31 March 2013 was 11m 2012: nil.
On 7 September 2011, the Group announced the closure of the Groups contact centre in Waterford, Ireland, which resulted in redundancy, consultancy and onerous property lease costs.
The total charge incurred in theyear ended 31 March 2012 was 14m.
A total taxation credit of 3m in respect of this item has been recognised in the year ended 31 March 2013 2012: 3m.
c Operating efficiencies Phase I Back office restructuring On 26 January 2011 a major restructure of the Group was announced to integrate technology and IT capabilities and consolidate back office functions.
The reorganisation principally resulted in a reduction in headcount and required project management and consulting costs to deliver these benefits.
The programme also resulted in onerous contract and dual running costs relating to a number of technology contracts where services previously provided externally are now being provided in-house.
The total charge incurred in the year ended 31 March 2013 was nil 2012: 11m.
A total taxation credit of nil in respect of this item has been recognised in the year ended 31 March 2013 2012: 3m.
d Wholesale Ethernet services overcharges In December 2012, Ofcom determined that BT had overcharged the Group for certain wholesale Ethernet services.
Accordingly, BT was required to make repayments to the Group for these overcharges.
A total of 27m has been recognised as an exceptional credit in the year ended 31 March 2013 note 27.
A total taxation charge in respect of this item of 6m has been recognised in the year ended 31 March 2013 2012: nil.
e Other In April 2013, Ofcom fined the Group 750,000 as a result of a contravention of certain provisions of TheCommunication Act 2003 relating to abandoned and silent calls.

Goodwill and other intangible assets a Goodwill Accounting policy Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, is recognised initially as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
On disposal of a subsidiary undertaking, the relevant goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or lossondisposal.
Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policy The Group has two Cash Generating Units CGUs Consumer and TalkTalk Business.
For the purpose of impairment testing, at the acquisition date, goodwill is allocated to each of the CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition.
The Groups shared costs and assets relating mainly to infrastructure and central overheads areallocated across the two CGUs based on the relative future cash flows that those shared costs support.
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires estimation of the recoverable amount which is determined byestimating the value in use of the CGUs to which the goodwill has been allocated.
Impairment of goodwill Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired: this review is performed at a CGU level.
The recoverable amount is determined by assessing the future cash flows of the CGU to which the goodwill relates.
The future cash flows of the Group are taken from the Board or Management approved five year plan and extrapolated out to 20 years based on the UKs long term growth rate.
This is discounted by the CGUs weighted average cost of capital pre-tax to give the net present value of that CGU.
Where the net present value of future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
Any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Sensitivity analysis is performed using reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions.
2013 2012 m m Opening cost and net book value 480 471 Acquisition of subsidiaries note 13 9 Disposal note 13 1 Closing cost and net book value 479 480 The goodwill acquired in business combinations is allocated at acquisition to the CGUs that are expected tobenefit from that business combination.

Goodwill and other intangible assets continued b Other intangible assets Impairment of goodwill continued Impairment review The key assumptions used in the Groups goodwill impairment review are as follows: Long term growth rates Long term revenue growth rates applied are based on the growth rate for the UK per the OECD.
The rate applied in the current year was 1.1% 2012: 1.8%.
Discount rate The underlying discount rate for each CGU is based on the UK ten year gilt rate adjusted for an equity risk premium and the systematic risk of the CGU.
The average pre-tax rate for both CGUs used to discount the forecast cash flows is 8.1% 2012: 8.2%.
The assumptions used in the calculation of the CGUs discount rate arebenchmarked to externally available data.
The same discount rate has been applied to both CGUs due tothe similarity of risk factors and geographical location.
Capital expenditure Forecast capital expenditure is based on senior management expectations of future required support of the network and current run rate of expenditure.
Customer factors The key assumptions for the forecast cash flows of each of the CGUs are based on expected customer growth rates, ARPU, direct costs, including acquisition costs and change in product mix.
The value assigned to each ofthese assumptions has been determined based on the extrapolation of historical trends in the Group and external information on expected trends of future market developments.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed for each key assumption and the Directors have not identified any reasonably possible material changes in the key assumptions that would cause the carrying value of goodwill toexceed the recoverable amount.
Accounting policy Operating intangibles Operating intangibles include internal infrastructure and design costs incurred in the development of software forinternal use.
Internally generated software is recognised as an intangible asset only if it can be separately identified, it is probable that the asset will generate future economic benefits, and the development cost can bemeasured reliably.
Where these conditions are not met, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
Operating intangibles are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives of up to eight years.
Acquisition intangibles Acquired intangible assets such as customer bases and other intangible assets acquired through a business combination are capitalised separately from goodwill and amortised over their expected useful lives of up to sixyears on a straight line basis.
The value attributed to such assets is based on the future economic benefit thatis expected to be derived from them, calculated as the present value of future cash flows after a deduction for contributory assets.
Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policy Impairment At the acquisition date, acquisition intangibles are allocated to each of the CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
The Groups shared costs and assets relating mainly to infrastructure and central overheads are allocated across the two CGUs based on the relative future cash flows.
Determining whether the carrying amount of operating and acquisition intangibles have any indication of impairment requires judgement.
If an indication of impairment is identified, further judgement is required toassess whether the carrying amount can be supported by the value in use of the CGU that the asset is allocatedto.
The value in use calculation involves estimation of both the future cash flows of the CGUs and the selection ofappropriate discount rates, to use to calculate present values.
Useful economic lives The assessment of the useful economic lives of these operating and acquisition intangibles requires judgement.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement based on the useful economic life selected.
This assessment requires estimation of the period over which the Group will benefit from the assets.

Goodwill and other intangible assets continued b Other intangible assets continued Impairment of assets The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss at each reporting date.
Where an indicator of impairment exists, the Group makes a formal estimate of the assets recoverable amount and the extent of any impairment loss.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Other intangible assets are analysed as follows: Operating Acquisition Total other intangibles intangibles intangibles m m m Opening balance at 1 April 2012 123 79 202 Additions 30 30 Amortisation 26 52 78 Closing balance at 31 March 2013 127 27 154 Cost gross carrying amount 260 326 586 Accumulated amortisation 133 299 432 Closing balance at 31 March 2013 127 27 154 Operating Acquisition Total other intangibles intangibles intangibles m m m Opening balance at 1 April 2011 124 131 255 Additions 26 9 35 Amortisation 27 61 88 Closing balance at 31 March 2012 123 79 202 Cost gross carrying amount 230 326 556 Accumulated amortisation 107 247 354 Closing balance at 31 March 2012 123 79 202 Operating intangibles include internally generated assets of net book value 31m 2012: 26m, which are amortised over a period of up to eight years.
This includes additions of 10m 2012: 7m and an amortisation charge of 5m 2012: 6m in the year ended 31 March 2013.

Goodwill and other intangible assets continued b Other intangible assets continued Impairment of assets continued Included within operating intangibles is the following asset which is material to the Group: TRIO, the customer billing system, which has a net book value of 86m 2012: 90m.
TRIO is amortised over aperiod of up to eight years depending on the release date of the relevant component.
The weighted average remaining useful economic life of the components of TRIO is five years 2012: five years.
Acquisition intangibles are removed from cost in the analysis in the year after they are fully amortised.
All acquisition intangibles relate to customer bases.
The customer bases relate primarily to the AOL UK internet access business which was acquired in December 2006 and the Tiscali UK internet access business which was acquired in July 2009.
The valuation of customer bases is derived from the discounted future cash flows expected from them, after a deduction for contributory assets.
The following customer base is material to the Group at 31 March 2013: Tiscali customer base which has a net book value of 23m 2012: 41m and a remaining useful economic life of15 months 2012: 27 months.
In addition, the following customer base was material to the Group at 31 March 2012: AOL broadband customer base which had net book value of 32m and a remaining useful economic life of tenmonths.
Property, plant and equipment Accounting policy Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its expected useful life from the date it is brought into use, as follows: Short leasehold costs 10% or the lease term if less than ten years Network equipment and computer hardware 12.550% per annum Fixtures and fittings 2025% per annum Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policy The assessment of the useful economic lives of these assets requires judgement.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement based on the useful economic life selected.
Determining whether the carrying amount of these assets has any indication of impairment also requires judgement.
If an indication of impairment is identified, further judgement is required to assess whether the carrying amount can be supported by the value in use of the CGU that the asset is allocated to.
The value in use calculation involves estimation of both the future cash flows of the CGUs and the selection of appropriate discount rates, to use to calculate present values note 11.

Non-current asset investments Accounting policy Investments, other than subsidiaries, are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration givenplus any transaction costs associated with the acquisition.
Investments are categorised as available for sale and are then recorded at fair value.
Changes in fair value, together with any related taxation, are taken directly to equity and recycled to the income statement when theinvestment is sold or determined to be impaired.

Interest in joint venture Accounting policy Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
The Group income statement includes the Groups share of the post-tax profits or losses of the joint ventures based on their financial statements for the year.
In the Group balance sheet, the Groups interest in joint ventures are shown as a non-current asset in the balance sheet, representing the Groups investment in the share capital of the joint ventures, as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets or liabilities less provision for any impairment.
When a joint venture has net liabilities, any loans advanced to the venture are included in the Groups equity accounted investment in it.
When a venture has net assets, any loans advanced to it are shown separately in thebalance sheet, as a receivable to the Group.
The Group holds 14.3% of the ordinary share capital of YouView TV Limited, a joint venture with The British Broadcasting Corporation, ITV Broadcasting Limited, British Telecom PLC, Channel Four Television Corporation, Arqiva Limited and Channel 5 Broadcasting Limited.

Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments The book value and fair value of the Groups financial assets, liabilities and derivative financial instruments, excluding the Groups loans and other borrowings shown in note 18, are as follows: Book and fair value 2013 2012 m m Cash and cash equivalents 7 2 Trade and other receivables 226 184 Non-current investments and investment in joint venture 9 8 Trade and other payables 428 379 Derivative financial instruments 3 Loans to related parties 2 189 183 Deferred income has been included within the financial liabilities above so as to give completeness over the Groups contractual commitments on future cash outflows.
Derivative financial instruments are included with other payables in note 17. a Financial instruments The Groups activities exposed it to a variety of financial risks including market risk such as currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group Treasury function used certain financial instruments to mitigate potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance from these risks.
These financial instruments primarily consisted of bank loans and interest rate swaps.
Other products, such as currency options, can also beused depending on the risks to be covered but have not been used in the current or preceding financial year.
The Group does not trade or speculate in any financial instruments.
The Group has cash flow hedges in place that swap the interest rate risk on the RCF from floating to fixed.
These hedges have been fully effective from inception.
The fair value measurement is classified as Level 2, derived from other observable market data: this means that their fair value is based upon the mark to market valuation atthe balance sheet date.
The fair value of these instruments at 31 March 2013 is 3m 2012: nil.
An expense of2m 2012: nil has been recognised in other comprehensive income in the year ended 31 March 2013.
As the hedges were fully effective there has been no income statement impact.

Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued b Embedded derivatives No contracts with embedded derivatives have been identified and accordingly no such derivatives have been accounted for separately.
c Foreign exchange risk The Group uses spot and forward foreign exchange trading to hedge transactional exposures, which arise mainly through cost of sales and operating expenses, and are primarily denominated in Euro and US Dollar.
In the prior year the Group also used short term currency swaps for liquidity management.
At 31 March 2013, the Sterling value of outstanding currency contracts was 17m 2012: 2m.
Borrowings and foreign exchange contracts are sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates: this sensitivity can be analysed in comparison to year end rates adjusted for funding to related parties and assuming all other variables remain constant.
There was no material impact of a 10% movement in the UK Sterling Euro exchange rate on either the income statement or other equity as non-Sterling debtors are broadly offset by non-Sterling creditors.
The effect of foreign exchange derivatives on borrowings at the year end was as follows: UK Sterling Euro Other Total m m m m 2013 Borrowings before derivatives 400 400 Derivatives 17 19 2 383 19 2 400 UK Sterling Euro Other Total m m m m 2012 Borrowings before derivatives 436 436 Derivatives 2 2 434 2 436 During the year the Group used derivatives for management of foreign currency cash balances held by overseas subsidiaries, which were inherited from CPW on demerger, and foreign currency trading balances.
d Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises primarily from cash, cash equivalents and borrowings, all of which are at floating rates of interest and thus expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
These floating rates are linked to LIBOR and other interest rate bases as appropriate to the instrument and currency.
Future cash flows arising from these financial instruments depend on interest rates and periods for each loan or rollover.
As detailed in section a the Group has cash flow hedges in place to mitigate its interest rate risk on its borrowings.
Cash and borrowings, as well as some foreign exchange products, are sensitive to movements in interest rates and such movements have been analysed in the table below by calculating the effect on the income statement and equity of one percentage point movement in the interest rate for the currencies in which most Group cash and borrowings are denominated.
Funding to related parties has been offset against gross borrowings in calculating these sensitivities.
This annualised analysis has been prepared on the assumption that the year end positions prevail throughout the year and therefore may not be representative of fluctuations in levels of borrowings.

Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued e Liquidity risk The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by regularly reviewing the long and short term cash flow projections for the business against facilities and other resources available to it.
Headroom is assessed based on historical experience as well as by assessing current business risks, including foreign exchange movements.
Existing facilities do not expire until March 2015 and November 2015: it is Group policy to refinance debt maturities significantly ahead of maturity dates.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows assuming year end interest rates remain constant and that borrowings are paid in full in the year of maturity.
