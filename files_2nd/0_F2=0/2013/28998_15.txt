Schroder AsiaPacific Fund plc Notes to the Accounts 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts the SORP issued by the Association of Investment Companies in January 2009.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investments at fair value.
The policies applied in these accounts are consistent with those applied in the preceding year.
b Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy and information is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as held at fair value through profit or loss.
Investments are included initially at fair value which is taken to be their cost, excluding expenses incidental to purchase which are written off to capital at the time of acquisition.
Subsequently the investments are valued at fair value, which are quoted bid prices for investments traded in active markets.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
c Accounting for reserves Gains and losses on sales of investments are included in the Income Statement and in capital reserves within Gains and losses on sales of investments.
Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end are included in the Income Statement and in capital reserves within Holding gains and losses on investments.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on cash and deposit balances and unrealised exchange gains and losses on foreign currency loans are included in the Income Statement and in capital reserves.
d Income Dividends receivable are included in revenue on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is included in capital.
UK dividends are included net of tax credits.
Overseas dividends are included gross of any withholding tax.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in revenue.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital.
Deposit interest outstanding at the year end is calculated and accrued on a time apportionment basis using market rates of interest.
e Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are allocated wholly to the revenue column of the Income Statement except that expenses incidental to the purchase or sale of an investment are charged to capital.
These expenses are commonly referred to as transaction costs and mainly comprise brokerage commission.
Details of transactions costs are given in note 10 on page 37. f Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest method and in accordance with the provisions of FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Presentation and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement.
Finance costs are allocated wholly to the revenue column of the Income Statement.
g Financial instruments Cash and short term deposits may comprise cash and demand deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Other debtors and creditors do not carry any interest, are short term in nature and are accordingly stated at nominal value, with debtors reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Bank loans and overdrafts are classified as loans and receivables and are measured at amortised cost.
They are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Finance costs, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest method.
h Taxation Current tax is provided at the amounts expected to be received or paid.
Deferred tax is accounted for in accordance with FRS 19: Deferred Tax.
Deferred tax is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences but deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.
33 Schroder AsiaPacific Fund plc Notes to the Accounts Tax relief is allocated to expenses charged to the capital column of the Income Statement on the marginal basis.
On this basis, if taxable income is capable of being entirely offset by revenue expenses, then no tax relief is transferred to the capital column.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rate which is expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and is measured on an undiscounted basis.
i Value added tax VAT Expenses are disclosed inclusive of any related irrecoverable VAT.
j Foreign currency In accordance with FRS 23: The effects of changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates the Company is required to nominate a functional currency, being the currency in which the Company predominantly operates.
The Board, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its shareholders operate, has determined that Sterling is the functional currency.
Sterling is also the currency in which the accounts are presented.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets, liabilities and equity investments held at fair value denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.
k Dividends payable In accordance with FRS 21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date, dividends are included in the accounts in the year in which they are paid.
l Repurchases of Ordinary shares for cancellation The cost of repurchasing Ordinary shares including the related stamp duty and transactions costs is charged to Share purchase reserve and dealt with in the Reconciliation of Movement in Shareholders Funds.
Share repurchase transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis.
The nominal value of Ordinary share capital repurchased and cancelled is transferred out of Called-up share capital and into Capital redemption reserve.
m Conversion of Subscription shares When the holders of Subscription shares exercise their right to convert their shares into Ordinary shares, the nominal value of those Subscription shares is debited to Called-up share capital and the nominal value of the Ordinary shares into which the Subscription shares convert is credited to Called-up share capital.
The balance of the consideration received is credited to Share premium.
Gains on investments held at fair value through profit or loss 2013 2012 000 000 Gains on sales of investments based on historic cost 13,663 17,080 Amounts recognised in investment holding gains and losses in the previous year in respect of investments sold in the year 9,965 13,312 Gains on sales of investments based on the carrying value at the previous balance sheet date 3,698 30,392 Net movement in investment holding gains and losses 2,568 55,934 Gains on investments held at fair value through profit or loss 1,130 86,326 3.

Taxation 2013 2012 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 a Analysis of charge in the year: Irrecoverable overseas tax 282 282 438 438 Capital gains tax 52 52 Current tax charge for the year 282 282 438 52 490 The Company has no corporation tax liability for the year ended 30 September 2013 2012: nil.
b Factors affecting tax charge for the year The tax assessed for the year is lower 2012: lower than the Companys applicable rate of corporation tax for the year of 23.5% 2012: 25.0%.
The factors affecting the current tax charge for the year are as follows: 2013 2012 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Net return on ordinary activities before taxation 5,282 779 6,061 5,354 87,135 92,489 Net return on ordinary activities before taxation multiplied by the Companys applicable rate of corporation tax for the year of 23.5% 2012: 25.0% 1,241 183 1,424 1,339 21,784 23,123 Effects of: Capital returns on investments 183 183 21,784 21,784 Income not chargeable to corporation tax 2,309 2,309 2,164 2,164 Overseas withholding tax 282 282 438 438 Overseas withholding tax allowed as a deductible expense 5 5 9 9 Capital gains tax 52 52 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 1 1 Unrelieved expenses 1,073 1,073 835 835 Current tax charge for the year 282 282 438 52 490 35 Schroder AsiaPacific Fund plc Notes to the Accounts c Deferred taxation The Company has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 2,863,000 2012: 2,243,000 based on a prospective corporation tax rate of 20% 2012: 23%.
The reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax was substantively enacted in July 2013 and is effective from 1 April 2015.
The deferred tax asset has arisen due to the cumulative excess of deductible expenses over taxable income.
Given the composition of the Companys portfolio, it is not likely that this asset will be utilised in the foreseeable future and therefore no asset has been recognised in the accounts.
Given the Companys intention to continue to meet the conditions required to obtain approval as an Investment Trust Company, no provision has been made for deferred tax on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
However, the actual amount paid was 4,732,000 due to shares repurchased and cancelled after the balance sheet date but prior to the dividend record date.
b Dividends for the purposes of Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 Section 1158 The requirements of Section 1158 are considered on the basis of dividends declared in respect of the financial year as shown below.
The revenue available for distribution by way of dividend for the year is 5,000,000 2012: 4,916,000.
Return per Ordinary share 2013 2012 000 000 Revenue return 5,000 4,916 Capital return 779 87,083 Total return 5,779 91,999 Weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue during the year 162,538,879 145,950,002 Revenue return per share 3.08p 3.37p Capital return per share 0.48p 59.67p Total return per share 3.56p 63.04p There was no dilution to the return per Ordinary share for the current and comparative year.

Further details of the facility are given note 20 on page 42.
The loan at the prior year end comprises US$55 million drawn down on the preceding facility with Scotiabank.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of creditors falling due within one year approximates to their fair value.

The total consideration paid for these shares amounted to 11,063,000.
1 The Subscription shares were issued as a bonus issue to the Ordinary shareholders on 13 October 2009 on the basis of one Subscription share for every five Ordinary shares.
Each Subscription share conferred the right but not the obligation to subscribe for one Ordinary share on 31 December, 31 March, 30 June, and 30 September until 31 December 2012 when the rights under the Subscription shares lapsed.
During the period from 1 October 2012 to 31 December 2012, holders of 3,777,354 Subscription shares exercised their right to convert those shares into Ordinary shares at a price of 245.0 pence per share.
Following the subsequent appointment of a trustee, pursuant to paragraph 8 g of Part 4 of the Particulars and Procedures in respect of the Subscription shares set out in the prospectus of the Company dated 18 September 2009, the remaining 24,667,291 Subscription shares were exercised on the same terms and sold in the market.

Transactions with the Manager The Company has appointed Schroder Investment Management Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Schroders plc, to provide investment management, accounting, company secretarial and administration services.
If the Company invests in funds managed or advised by the Manager or any of its associated companies, those funds are excluded from the assets used for the purposes of the management fee calculation and therefore attract no fee.
Under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, the Manager is also entitled to receive a company secretarial fee.
Details of the Investment Management Agreement are given in the Report of the Directors on page 15.
The management fee payable in respect of the year ended 30 September 2013 amounted to 4,319,000 2012: 3,617,000, of which 3,330,000 2012: 993,000 was outstanding at the year end.
The company secretarial fee payable to Schroders in respect of the year ended 30 September 2013 amounted to 91,000 2012: 89,000, of which 68,000 2012: 51,000 was outstanding at the year end.
Current account facilities were provided during the year by Schroder & Co Limited.
At 30 September 2013, the balance held at Schroder & Co Limited was 500,000 2012: 499,000.
No Director of the Company served as a director of Schroder Investment Management Limited, or any member of the Schroder Group, at any time during the year.

Disclosures regarding financial instruments measured at fair value The Companys financial instruments within the scope of FRS 29 that are held at fair value comprise its investment portfolio.
The Company currently holds no derivative financial instruments and its liabilities are not held at fair value.
The investments are categorised into a hierarchy consisting of the following three levels: Level 1 valued using quoted prices in active markets.
Level 2 valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1.
Level 3 valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset.
Details of the valuation techniques used by the Company are given in note 1 b on page 33.
At 30 September 2013, the Companys investment portfolio comprised entirely equity investments and warrants included in Level 1 2012: same.
There have been no transfers between Levels 1, 2 or 3 during the year 2012: Nil.
Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies The Companys principal investment objective is to achieve capital growth through investment primarily in equities of companies located in the continent of Asia excluding the Middle East and Japan, together with the Far Eastern countries bordering the Pacific Ocean, with the aim of achieving growth in excess of the MSCI All Countries Asia excluding Japan Index in Sterling terms Benchmark Index over the longer term.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of financial risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
These financial risks include market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and market price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors policy for managing these risks is set out below.
The Board coordinates the Companys risk management policy.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
The Companys classes of financial instruments are as follows: investments in shares and warrants which are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: and a multicurrency credit facility with Scotiabank, the purpose of which is to assist in financing the Companys operations.
a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and market price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these three elements of market risk is given in parts i to iii of this note, together with sensitivity analyses where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and these policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Currency risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than Sterling, which is the Companys functional currency and the presentational currency of the accounts.
As a result, movements in exchange rates will affect the Sterling value of those items.
Management of currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board, which meets on at least four occasions each year.
The Manager measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
The Company may use foreign currency borrowings or forward foreign currency contracts to limit the exposure to anticipated changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into Sterling on receipt.
40 Schroder AsiaPacific Fund plc Notes to the Accounts Foreign currency exposure The fair value of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 30 September are shown below.
The Companys investments which are not monetary items have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
Foreign currency sensitivity The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of net profit for the year and net assets with regard to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date and assumes a 10% 2012: 10% appreciation or depreciation in Sterling against the currencies to which the Company is exposed, which is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on the volatility of exchange rates during the year.
If Sterling had weakened by 10% this would have had the following effect: 2013 2012 000 000 Income Statement return after taxation Revenue return 962 911 Capital return 1,161 2,384 Total return after taxation 2,123 1,473 Net assets 2,123 1,473 Conversely if Sterling had strengthened by 10% this would have had the following effect: 2013 2012 000 000 Income Statement return after taxation Revenue return 962 911 Capital return 1,161 2,384 Total return after taxation 2,123 1,473 Net assets 2,123 1,473 41 Schroder AsiaPacific Fund plc Notes to the Accounts In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analysis with respect to monetary financial assets and liabilities is broadly representative of the whole of the current and comparative year.
The sensitivity with regard to the Companys investments and foreign currency is subsumed into market price risk sensitivity on page 43. ii Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits and the interest payable on variable rate borrowings when interest rates are re-set.
Management of interest rate risk Liquidity and borrowings are managed with the aim of increasing returns to shareholders.
The Board would not expect gearing to exceed 20% where gearing is defined as borrowings used for investment purposes, less cash, expressed as a percentage of net assets.
The possible effects on cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when the Company draws on the credit facility.
However, amounts drawings on this facility are for short term periods and therefore exposure to interest rate risk is not significant.
Interest rate exposure The exposure of financial assets and financial liabilities to floating interest rates, giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are re-set, is shown below: 2013 2012 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Cash at bank and short term deposits 35,303 11,493 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year borrowings on the credit facility 20,233 34,060 Total exposure 15,070 22,567 Interest receivable on cash balances is at a margin below LIBOR 2012: same.
During the year, the Company extended the US$75 million credit facility with Scotiabank to May 2014.
Interest is payable at a rate of LIBOR as quoted in the market for the loan period plus a margin, plus Mandatory Costs, which are the lenders costs of complying with certain regulatory requirements of the Bank of England.
At 30 September 2013, the Company had drawn down US$15.0 million 9.2 million at an interest rate of 0.98% per annum and Australian $19.0 million 11.0 million at an interest rate of 3.40% per annum, on this facility.
At the prior year end, the Company had drawn down US$55 million 34.1 million on the preceding US$75 million credit facility with Scotiabank.
The above year end amounts are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year as the level of cash balances and drawings on the credit facility have fluctuated.
The maximum and minimum net cash loan balances during the year are as follows: 2013 2012 000 000 Maximum debit interest rate exposure during the year net loan balances 30,520 29,523 Maximum credit minimum debit interest rate exposure during the year net cash loan balances 15,070 3,828 Interest rate sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets to a 0.5% 2012: 0.5% increase or decrease in interest rates in regards to the Companys monetary financial assets and liabilities.
This level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary financial instruments held at the balance sheet date with all other variables held constant.
2013 2012 0.5% increase 0.5% decrease 0.5% increase 0.5% decrease in rate in rate in rate in rate 000 000 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 75 75 113 113 Capital return Total return after taxation 75 75 113 113 Net assets 75 75 113 113 In the opinion of the Directors, this sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the Companys future exposure to interest rate changes due to fluctuations in the level of cash balances and drawings on the credit facility.
42 Schroder AsiaPacific Fund plc Notes to the Accounts iii Market price risk Market price risk includes changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk, which may affect the value of equity investments.
Management of market price risk The Board meets on at least four occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular countries and industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objective and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
The Board may authorise the Manager to enter derivative transactions for the purpose of protecting the portfolio against falls in market prices.
Market price risk exposure The Companys total exposure to changes in market prices at 30 September comprises the following: 2013 2012 000 000 Investments held at fair value through profit or loss 442,669 417,326 The above data is broadly representative of the exposure to market price risk during the year.
Concentration of exposure to market price risk An analysis of the Companys investments is given on pages 8 and 9.
This shows that the portfolio comprises investments quoted on Asian stockmarkets.
Accordingly there is a concentration of exposure to that region.
However it should be noted that an investment may not be entirely exposed to the economic conditions in its country of domicile or of listing.
Market price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets to an increase or decrease of 20% 2012: 20% in the fair values of the Companys investments.

Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of a credit facility.
The Boards policy is for the Company to remain fully invested in normal market conditions and that the credit facility be used to manage working capital requirements and to gear the Company as appropriate.
Liquidity risk exposure Contractual maturities of financial liabilities, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required are as follows: Three months Three months or less or less 2013 2012 000 000 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year Bank loan including interest 20,274 34,093 Securities purchased awaiting settlement 15 Other creditors and accruals 3,514 1,157 23,788 35,265 43 Schroder AsiaPacific Fund plc Notes to the Accounts c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in loss to the Company.
Management of credit risk This risk is not significant and is managed as follows: Portfolio dealing The Company invests in markets that operate a Delivery Versus Payment settlement process which mitigates the risk of losing the principal of a trade during settlement.
The Manager continuously monitors dealing activity to ensure best execution, which involves measuring various indicators including the quality of trade settlement and incidence of failed trades.
Counterparties must be pre-approved by the Managers credit committee.
Cash Counterparties are subject to daily credit analysis by the Manager.
Cash balances will only be deposited with reputable banks with high quality credit ratings.
Exposure to the Custodian JPMorgan Chase is the Custodian of the Companys assets.
The Companys assets are segregated from JPMorgan Chases own trading assets and are therefore protected from creditors in the event that JPMorgan Chase were to cease trading.
Credit risk exposure The amounts shown in the balance sheet under debtors and cash and short term deposits represent the maximum exposure to credit risk at the current and comparative year ends.
No debtors are past their due date or deemed to be impaired.
The value of securities on loan at 30 September 2013 amounted to 3,009,000 2012: 9,535,000.
The highest value of securities on loan during the year ended 30 September 2013 amounted to 11,710,000 2012: 15,522,000.
Collateral is obtained by the Manager and is called in on a daily basis to a value of 102% of the value of the securities on loan if that collateral is denominated in the same currency as the securities on loan and 105% if it is denominated in a different currency.
Collateral acceptable under the Stock Lending Agreement may comprise Eurozone, UK, or US government securities.
d Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities All financial assets and liabilities are either carried in the balance sheet at fair value or the balance sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Capital management policies and procedures The Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding year.
The Companys debt and capital structure comprises the following: 2013 2012 000 000 Debt Bank loan 20,233 34,060 Equity Called-up share capital 16,970 14,880 Reserves 438,054 380,460 455,024 395,340 Total debt and equity 475,257 429,400 The Companys capital management objectives are to ensure that it will continue as a going concern and to maximise the capital return to its equity shareholders through an appropriate level of gearing.
The Board would not expect gearing to exceed 20%.
Gearing for this purpose is defined as borrowings used for investment purposes, less cash, expressed as a percentage of net assets.
2013 2012 000 000 Borrowings used for investment purposes, less cash 15,070 22,567 Net assets 455,024 395,340 Net cash gearing 3.3% 5.7% The Board, with the assistance of the Manager, monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Managers views on the market: the need to buy back equity shares, which takes into account the share price discount: the opportunities for issues of new shares: and the amount of dividend to be paid, in excess of that which is required to be distributed.
