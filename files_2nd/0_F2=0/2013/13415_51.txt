Of the total deferred tax assets, 31m 2012: 39m are recoverable within one year.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balance net.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised where it is probable that they will be recovered.
In recognising deferred tax assets, the Grouphas considered if it is more likely than not that sufficient future profits will be available to absorb tax losses and other temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets of 54m 2012:84m have not been recognised in respect of losses and other temporary differences due to the uncertainty of the availability of suitable profits in the foreseeable future.
The principal items on which nodeferred tax assets have been recognised are tax losses, principally capital losses, of 217m 2012:301m of which 5m 2012: 84m expire within five years.
No deferred tax has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries except where it is probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future.
If the earnings were remitted in full, tax of 28m 2012: 24m would be payable.
