Further unrecognised tax losses of 586.9 million also exist at 31 December 2013 2012: 470.4 million of which 29.8 million 2012: 44.2 million expires in 15 years.
12 iv Factors that may affect future tax charges No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries and joint ventures.
In the event of their remittance to the UK, no net UK tax is expected to be payable.
The standard rate of UK corporation tax is due to fall in stages to 20 per cent by April 2015.
This is unlikely to significantly impact the Groups tax charge.
