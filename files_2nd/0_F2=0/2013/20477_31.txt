Segment Reporting continued Segment Revenues The UK and International Car Insurance reportable segments derive all insurance premium income from external policyholders.
Revenue within these segments is not derived from an individual policyholder that represents 10% or more of the Groups total revenue.
The total of Price Comparison revenues from transactions with other reportable segments is 10.8 million 2012: 13.0 million.
These amounts have not been eliminated on consolidation as the Directors consider that not doing so results in a better overall presentation ofthe financial statements.
The impact on the financial statements in the current and prior period is not material.
There are no other transactions between reportable segments.
Within the UK Car Insurance segment, transactions between the Groups intermediary and the Groups insurance companies relating to vehicle commission totalling 18.4 million have been eliminated from the insurance expenses and Other revenue lines in the income statement on the basis that the non-elimination would have materially distorted the presentation of key performance indicators.
The equivalent amounts in the prior period have not been eliminated as there is no resulting material distortion of key performance indicators.
Revenues from external customers for products and services is consistent with the split of reportable segment revenues as shown on page 77.

Theseassets and liabilities are not regularly reviewed by the Board of Directors in the reportable segment format.
There is an asymmetrical allocation of assets and income to the reportable segments, in that the interest earned on cash and cash equivalent assets deployed in the UK Car Insurance, Price Comparison and International Car Insurance segments is not allocated inarrivingat segment profits.
This is consistent with regular management reporting.
Eliminations represent inter-segment funding and balances included in trade and other receivables.

Premium, Claims and Profit Commissions 5a.
Accounting Policies i Revenue Premiums Premiums relating to insurance contracts are recognised as revenue proportionally over the period of cover.
Premiums with an inception date after the end of the period are held in the statement of financial position as deferred revenue.
Outstanding collections from policyholders are recognised within policyholder receivables.
ii Revenue Profit Commission Under some of the co-insurance and reinsurance contracts under which motor premiums are shared or ceded, profit commission may be earned on a particular year of account, which is usually subject to performance criteria such as loss ratios and expense ratios.
The commission is dependent on the ultimate outcome of any year, with revenue being recognised when loss and expense ratios used in the preparation ofthe financial statements move below a contractual threshold.
iii Insurance Contracts and Reinsurance Assets Premiums The proportion of premium receivable on in-force policies relating to unexpired risks is reported in insurance contract liabilities and reinsurance assets as the unearned premium provision gross and reinsurers share respectively.
Claims Claims and claims handling expenses are charged as incurred, based on the estimated direct and indirect costs of settling all liabilities arising on events occurring up to the balance sheet date.
The provision for claims outstanding comprises provisions for the estimated cost of settling all claims incurred but unpaid at the balance sheet date, whether reported or not.
Anticipated reinsurance recoveries are disclosed separately as assets.
Whilst the Directors consider that the gross provisions for claims and the related reinsurance recoveries are fairly stated on the basis oftheinformation currently available to them, the ultimate liability will vary as a result of subsequent information and events and may resultin significant adjustments to the amounts provided.
Adjustments to the amounts of claims provisions established in prior years are reflected in the income statement for the period in which theadjustments are made and disclosed separately if material.
The methods used, and the estimates made, are reviewed regularly.
Provision for unexpired risks is made where necessary for the estimated amount required over and above unearned premiums netofdeferred acquisition costs to meet future claims and related expenses.
Co-insurance The Group has entered into certain co-insurance contracts under which insurance risks are shared on a proportional basis, with the co-insurer taking a specific percentage of premium written and being responsible for the same proportion of each claim.
As the contractual liability isseveral and not joint, neither the premiums nor claims relating to the co-insurance are included in the income statement.
Under the termsof these agreements the co-insurers reimburse the Group for the same proportionate share of the costs of acquiring and administering the business.

Premium, Claims and Profit Commissions continued 5a.
Accounting Policies continued iii Insurance Contracts and Reinsurance Assets continued Reinsurance Assets Contracts entered into by the Group with reinsurers under which the Group is compensated for losses on the insurance contracts issued bythe Group are classified as reinsurance contracts.
A contract is only accounted for as a reinsurance contract where there is significant insurance risk transfer between the insured and the insurer.
Reinsurance assets include balances due from reinsurance companies for ceded insurance liabilities.
Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a consistent manner with the outstanding claims provisions or settled claims associated with the reinsured policies and in accordance with the relevant reinsurance contract.
The Group assesses its reinsurance assets for impairment on a regular basis, and in detail every six months.
If there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, then the carrying value will be written down to its recoverable amount.
On the commutation of reinsurance contracts, the reinsurer is discharged from all obligations relating to the contract.
Reinsurance assets and liabilities relating to the commuted contracts are settled in the period in which the commutation agreement is signed.

All contracts are short term in duration, lasting for 10 or 12 months.
Reinsurance Assets and Insurance Contract Liabilities i Objectives, Policies and Procedures for the Management of Insurance Risk The Group is involved in issuing motor insurance contracts that transfer risk from policyholders to the Group and its underwriting partners.
Insurance risk involves uncertainty over the occurrence, amount or timing of claims arising on insurance contracts issued.
Reserving risk is the risk that value of insurance liabilities established is insufficient to cover the ultimate cost of claims incurred at the balance sheet date, whether reported or unreported.
Other risks include inadequate pricing and reinsurance policies, and inappropriate claims management processes and controls.
The Board of Directors is responsible for the management of insurance risk, although as mentioned in note 6, it has delegated the task ofsupervising risk management to the Group Risk Committee.
The Group also has a Reserving Committee.
This Committee, comprised senior managers within the finance, claims, pricing and actuarial functions, primarily recommends the approach for UK Car Insurance reserving but also reviews the systems and controls in place to allow accurate reserving and material reserving issues such as Periodic Payment Order PPO and claims inflation that represent the key uncertainties in the amount or timing of claims settlements.
The Board implements certain policies in order to mitigate and control the level of insurance risk accepted by the Group.
These include pricing policies and claims management and administration processes, in addition to reserving policies and coand reinsurance arrangements as detailed on the following page.

Premium, Claims and Profit Commissions continued 5d.
Reinsurance Assets and Insurance Contract Liabilities continued i Objectives, Policies and Procedures for the Management of Insurance Risk continued Reserving Policies and Controls Reserving risk is mitigated through a series of processes and controls.
The key processes are as follows: Regular management and internal actuarial review of individual and aggregate case claim reserves, including regular reporting of management information and exception reporting of significant movements Regular management and internal actuarial review of large claims, including claims settled or potentially settled by PPOs for which the uncertainty is increased by factors such as the lifetime of the claimant and movements in the indexation forthe cost of future care of the claimant Bi-annual external actuarial review of best estimate claims reserves using a variety of recognised actuarial techniques, including reviews of the potential ranges around best estimates Use of a Reserving policy which informs managements reserving decisions for the purposes of the Groups financial statements.
Asdescribed in note 2, critical accounting judgements and estimates, the policy determines that reserves should be set within a pre-determined range above best estimate assumptions to allow for unforeseen adverse claims development Co-insurance and Reinsurance As noted in the Strategic Report, the Group shares a significant amount of the motor insurance business generated with external underwriters.
In 2013, 40% of the UK risk was shared under a co-insurance contract, under which the primary risk is borne by the co-insurer.
A further 35% of the UK risk was ceded under quota share reinsurance contracts.
Co-insurance and reinsurance contracts are also used in the International Car Insurance businesses.
Further detail can be found in the Strategic Report on page 28.
As well as these proportional arrangements, an excess of loss reinsurance programme is also purchased to protect the Group against very large individual claims and catastrophe losses.
Concentration of Insurance Risk The Directors do not believe there are significant concentrations of insurance risk.
This is because, although the Group has historically written only one significant line of UK insurance business, the risks are spread across a large number of people and a wide regional base.
The introduction of the international car insurance businesses in recent years and the launch of UK household business in 2012, will further contribute to the diversification of the Groups insurance risk as these businesses grow.

Accounting Policies i Investment Income Investment income from financial assets comprises interest income and net gains both realised and unrealised on financial assets classified as fair value through profit and loss and interest income on term deposits.
ii Financial Assets Investments and Receivables Initial Recognition Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables or held to maturity investments.
At initial recognition assets are recognised at fair value and classified according to the purpose for which they were acquired.
The Groups investments in money market liquidity funds and short term debt securities are designated as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL atinception.
This designation is permitted under IAS 39, as the investments in money market funds and short dated securities are managed as a group of assets and internal performance evaluation of this group is conducted on a fair value basis.
The Groups deposits with credit institutions are classified as held to maturity investments, which is consistent with the intention for which they were purchased.
Subsequent Measurement Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised through the income statement.
Deposits with fixed maturities, classified as held to maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Movements in the amortised cost are recognised through the income statement, as are any impairment losses.
Loans and receivables are stated at their amortised cost less impairment using the effective interest method.
Impairment losses are recognised through the income statement.
Impairment of Financial Assets The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether any financial assets or groups of financial assets held at amortised cost, are impaired.
Financial assets are impaired where there is evidence that one or more events occurring after the initial recognition of the asset, may lead to a reduction in the estimated future cash flows arising from the asset.
Objective evidence of impairment may include default on cash flows due from the asset and reported financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty.
Derecognition of Financial Assets A financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from that asset have expired, or when the Group transfers the asset and all the attaching substantial risks and rewards relating to the asset, to a third party.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short term deposits with original maturities ofthree months or less.
All cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortised cost.

These funds target a short term cash return with capital security and low volatility and continue to achieve these goals.
The measurement of investments at the end of the period, for investments held at fair value and short term debt securities held at fair value is based on active quoted market values level 1.
Short term debt securities have been reclassified to fair value through profit and loss at the start of the period to align with the treatment ofthe money market fund holdings.
The deposits are held with well rated institutions: as such the approximate fair value is the book value of the investment as impairment of the capital is not expected.
There is no quoted market for these holdings and as such a level 2 valuation is used.
The book value of term deposits is 288.4 million 2012: 375.8 million.

The Board of Directors has delegated the task of supervising risk management and internal control to the Group Risk Committee.
There is also an Investment Committee that makes recommendations to the Board on the Groups investment strategy.
There are several key elements to the risk management environment throughout the Group.
These are detailed in full in the Corporate Governance Statement.
Specific considerations for the risks arising from financial assets and liabilities are detailed below.
Credit Risk The Group defines credit risk as the risk of loss if another party fails to perform its obligations.
The key areas of exposure to credit risk forthe Group result through its reinsurance programme, investments, bank deposits and policyholder receivables.
Economic and financial market conditions have led the Directors to consider counterparty exposure more frequently and in significant detail.
The Directors consider that the policies and procedures in place to manage credit exposure continue to be appropriate for the Groups risk appetite, and during 2013 and historically, no material credit losses have been experienced by the Group.
There are no specific concentrations of credit risk with respect to investment counterparties due to the structure of the liquidity funds which invest in a wide range of very short duration, high quality securities.
Cash balances and deposits are placed only with highly rated credit institutions.
The detailed holdings are reviewed regularly by the Investment Committee.
To mitigate the risk arising from exposure to reinsurers in the form of reinsurance recoveries and profit commissions, the Group only conducts business with companies of appropriate financial strength ratings.
In addition, most reinsurance contracts are operated on afunds withheld basis, which substantially reduces credit risk, as the Group holds the cash received as collateral.
The other principal form of credit risk is in respect of amounts due from policyholders, largely due to the potential for default by instalment payers.
The impact of this is mitigated by the large customer base and low average level of balance recoverable.
There is also mitigation by the operation of numerous highand low-level controls in this area, including payment on policy acceptance as opposed to inception and automated cancellation procedures for policies in default.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2013 is 2,644.8 million 2012: 2,415.1 million, being the carrying value offinancial assets and cash, and the excess of reinsurance assets over amounts owed to reinsurers under funds withheld arrangements.
TheGroup does not use credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate exposure.
The amount of bad debt expense relating to policyholder debt charged to the income statement in 2013 and 2012 is insignificant.
There were no significant financial assets that were past due at the close of either 2013 or 2012.
The Groups credit risk exposure to assets with external ratings is as follows: 31 December 31 December 2013 2012 Rating m m Financial institutions Money market funds AAA 1,406.1 1,025.4 Financial institutions Credit institutions AAA 61.8 60.1 Financial institutions Credit institutions AA 184.5 169.2 Financial institutions Credit institutions A 352.4 506.4 Financial institutions Credit institutions BBB and below 80.0 57.1 Reinsurers AA 239.9 117.8 Reinsurers A 20.0 196.3 Reinsurers BBB 23.4 6.5 Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 86 1 ADM ar13 back.

Financial Assets and Liabilities continued Objectives, Policies And Procedures For Managing Financial Assets and Liabilities continued Interest Rate Risk The Group considers interest rate risk to be the risk that unfavourable movements in interest rates could adversely impact on the capital values of financial assets and liabilities.
This relates primarily to investments held at fair value.
As noted above, the Group invests in money market liquidity funds, which in turn invest in a mixture of very short dated fixed and variable rate securities, such as cash deposits, certificates of deposits, floating rate notes and other commercial paper.
The funds are not permitted to have an average maturity greater than 60 days and hence are not subject to large movements in yield and value resulting from changes in market interest rates as longer duration fixed income portfolios can experience.
Returns are likely to closely track the LIBID benchmark and hence while the Groups investment return will vary according to market interest rates, the capital value ofthese investment funds will not be impacted by rate movements.
The interest rate risk arising is therefore considered to be minimal.
Other Group holdings include funds placed into two segregated mandates.
The guidelines of the investments retain the credit quality of the money market liquidity funds.
As the duration of the securities is short there is no material interest rate risk relating to these investments.
The Group also holds a number of fixed-rate, longer term deposits with strongly rated credit institutions.
These are classified as term andvalued at amortised cost.
Therefore neither the capital value of the deposits, nor the interest return will be impacted byfluctuations ininterest rates.
No sensitivity analysis to interest rates has been presented on the grounds of materiality.
Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group does not have sufficient, available, financial resources to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can only secure them at excessive cost.
The Group is strongly cash-generative due to the large proportion of revenue arising from non-underwriting activity.
Further, as noted above, a significant portion of insurance funds are invested in money market liquidity funds with same day liquidity, meaning that a large proportion of the Group cash and investments are immediately available.
A breakdown of the Groups financial liabilities trade and other payables is shown in note 10.
In terms of the maturity profile of these liabilities, all amounts will mature within three to six months of the balance sheet date.
Refer to the maturity profile at the start of this note for further detail.
In practice, the Groups Directors expect actual cash flows to be consistent with this maturity profile except for amounts owed to co-insurers and reinsurers.
Of the total amounts owed to co-insurers and reinsurers of 785.3 million 2012: 723.5 million, 629.3 million 2012: 609.6 million is held under funds withheld arrangements and therefore not expected to be settled within 12 months.
A maturity analysis for insurance contract liabilities is included in note 5.
The maturity profile for financial assets is included at the start of this note.
The Groups Directors believe that the cash flows arising fromthese assets will be consistent with this profile.
Liquidity risk is not, therefore, considered to be significant.
Foreign Exchange Risks Foreign exchange risks arise from unfavourable movements in foreign exchange rates that could adversely impact the valuation ofoverseasassets.
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its operations overseas.
Although the relative size of the International operations means that the risks are relatively small, increasingly volatile foreign exchange rates could result in larger potential gains or losses.
Assets held to fund insurance liabilities are held in the currency of the liabilities: however, surplus assets held as regulatory capital in foreign currencies remain exposed.
The Groups exposures to net assets held in euros and dollars at the balance sheet date were 7.1 million and 60.2 million respectively 2012:13.3 million and 46.7 million.
Fair Value For cash at bank and cash deposits and other receivables, the fair value approximates to the book value due to their short maturity.
For assets held atfairvaluethrough profit and loss, their value equates to level 1 quoted prices in active markets of the fair value hierarchy.
Cash and Cash Equivalents 31 December 31 December 2013 2012 m m Cash at bank and in hand 187.9 216.6 Total cash and cash equivalents 187.9 216.6 Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short term-term deposits with original maturities of three months or less.

Accounting Policy i Contribution from Additional Products and Fees and Other Revenue Contribution from additional products and fees and other revenue includes revenue earned on the sale of products supplementing the core motor insurance policy, administration and other charges paid by the policyholder, referral fees, revenue from policies paid by instalments and vehicle commission charges paid by coand reinsurers.
Revenue is credited to the income statement over the period matching the Groups obligations to provide services.
Where the Group has no remaining contractual obligations, the revenue is recognised immediately.
An allowance is made for expected cancellations where the customer may be entitled to a refund of amounts charged.
Commission from price comparison activities and broking commission earned by Gladiator is credited to revenue on the sale of the underlying insurance policy.

Accounting Policies i Acquisition Costs and Operating Expenses Acquisition costs incurred in obtaining new and renewal business are charged to the income statement over the period in which those premiums are earned.
All other operating expenses are charged to the income statement in the period that they are incurred.
ii Employee Benefits Pensions The Group contributes to defined contribution personal pension plans for its employees.
The contributions payable to these schemes are charged in the accounting period to which they relate.
Employee Share Schemes The Group operates a number of equity and cash settled compensation schemes for its employees.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of free shares under the equity settled schemes is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity.
For cash settled schemes, the fair value of services received are also recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liability.
For equity settled schemes, the total charge expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the free shares granted as determined atthe grant date excluding the impact of non-market vesting conditions.
Non-market conditions such as profitability targets as well as staff attrition rates are included in assumptions over the number of free shares to vest under the applicable scheme.
For cash settled schemes, the total charge expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the closing Admiral Group share price at the end of the period.
Prior to the vesting of each scheme, the closing share price at the end of the reporting period is used as an approximation for the closing share price at the end of the vesting period.
As with equity settled schemes, non-market vesting conditions also impact on the total charge expensed over the vesting period.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its assumptions on the number of shares to be granted with the impact of any change intheassumptions recognised through income.
Refer to note 8f for further details on share schemes.

The consolidated cash flow statement also shows the gross charge in the reconciliation between profit after tax and cash flows from operating activities.
The co-insurance share of the charge is included in the change in trade and other payables line.
i The Approved Share Incentive Plan the SIP Eligible employees qualified for awards under the SIP based upon the performance of the Group in each half-year period.
The current maximum award for each year is 3,000 per employee.
The awards are made with reference to the Groups performance against prior year profit before tax.
Employees must remain in employment for the holding period three years from the date of award otherwise the shares are forfeited.
The fair value of shares awarded is either the share price at the date of award, or is estimated at the latest share price available when drawing up the financial statements for awards not yet made and later adjusted to reflect the actual share price on the award date.
Awards under the SIP are entitled to receive dividends, and, hence, no adjustment has been made to this fair value.
ii The Discretionary Free Share Scheme the DFSS Under the DFSS, details of which are contained in the remuneration policy section of the Directors Remuneration Report, individuals receive an award of free shares at no charge.
Staff must remain in employment until the vesting date in order to receive shares.
The maximum number of shares that can vest relating to the 2013 scheme is 2,344,321 2012 scheme: 2,149,566.
The amount of award that actually vests is based on the growth in the Companys earnings per share EPS relative to a risk free return RFR, for which LIBOR has been selected as a benchmark.
This performance is measured over the three-year period the award applies to.
For the 2013 and 2012 schemes, 50% of the shares awarded at the start of the three year vesting period are subject to these performance conditions.

Staff Share Schemes continued ii The Discretionary Free Share Scheme the DFSS continued The range of awards is as follows: If the growth in EPS is less than the RFR, no awards vest EPS growth is equal to RFR 10% of maximum award vests To achieve the maximum award, EPS growth has to be 36 points higher than RFR over the three year period Between 10% and 100% of the maximum awards, a linear relationship exists.
Awards under the DFSS are not eligible for dividends although a discretionary bonus is currently paid equivalent to the dividend that would have been paid on the respective shareholding and hence the fair value of free shares to be awarded under this scheme has been revised downwards to take account of these distributions.
The unadjusted fair value is based on the share price at the date on which awards were made as stated in the Directors Remuneration Report.

Accounting Policy Income tax on the profit or loss for the periods presented comprises current and deferred tax.
i Current Tax Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, and includes any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Current tax related to items recognised in other comprehensive income is also recognised in other comprehensive income and not in the income statement.
ii Deferred Tax Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences arising between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes, and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
It is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date, or that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
The principal temporary differences arise from depreciation of property and equipment and share scheme charges.
The resulting deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except in relation to share scheme charges where the amount of tax benefit credited to the income statement is limited to an equivalent credit calculated on the accounting charge.
Any excess is recognised directly in equity.

Other Assets and Other Liabilities 10a.
Accounting Policy i Property and Equipment, and Depreciation All property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method to write off the cost less residual values of the assets over their useful economic lives.
These useful economic lives are as follows: Motor vehicles four years Fixtures, fittings and equipment four years Computer equipment two to four years Improvements to short leasehold properties four years ii Impairment of Property and Equipment In the case of property and equipment, carrying values are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there are any indications of impairment.
If any such indications exist, the assets recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying value.
The carrying value is the higher of the fair value of the asset, less costs to sell and the assets value in use.
Impairment losses are recognised through theincome statement.
iii Leased Assets The rental costs relating to assets held under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the life ofthe lease.
Leases under the terms of which the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classed as finance leases.
Assets acquired under finance leases are included in property and equipment at fair value on acquisition and are depreciated in the same manner as equivalent owned assets.
Finance lease and hire purchase obligations are included in creditors, and the finance costs are spread over the periods of the agreements based on the net amount outstanding.
iv Intangible Assets Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method.
Goodwill has been recognised in acquisitions of subsidiaries, andrepresents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
The classification and accounting treatment of acquisitions occurring before 1 January 2004 have not been reconsidered in preparing theGroups opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004 due to the exemption available in IFRS 1 First time adoption.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included at the transition date on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP, which was tested for impairment at the transition date.
On transition, amortisation of goodwill has ceased as required by IAS 38.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units CGUs according tobusiness segment and is reviewed annually for impairment.
The goodwill held on the balance sheet at 31 December 2013 is allocated solely to the UK car insurance segment.
Impairment of Goodwill The annual impairment review involves comparing the carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount by allocating the goodwill toCGUs and recognising an impairment loss if the recoverable amount is lower.
Impairment losses are recognised through the income statement and are not subsequently reversed.
The recoverable amount is the greater of the fair value of the asset less costs to sell and the value in use of the CGU.
The value in use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three year period.
Cash flows beyond this period are considered, but not included in the calculation.
The discount rate applied to the cash flow projections in the value in use calculations is 9.8% 2012: 9.0%, based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, which is in line with the market source: Bloomberg.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are those regarding growth rates and expected changes in pricing and expenses incurred during the period.
Management estimates growth rates and changes in pricing based on past practices and expected future changes in the market.
The headroom above the goodwill carrying value is very significant, and there is no foreseeable event that would eliminate this margin.
Deferred Acquisition Costs Acquisition costs comprise all direct and indirect costs arising from the conclusion of insurance contracts.
Deferred acquisition costs represent the proportion of acquisition costs incurred that correspond to the unearned premiums provision at the balance sheet date.
Thisbalance is held as an intangible asset.
It is amortised over the term of the contract as premium is earned.
Software Purchased software is recognised as an intangible asset and amortised over its expected useful life generally the licence term.
The carrying value is reviewed every six months for evidence of impairment, with the value being written down if any impairment exists.
Impairment may be reversed if conditions subsequently improve.

It is allocated solely to the UK Car Insurance segment.
As described in the accounting policies, the amortisation of this asset ceased on transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004.
All annual impairment reviews since the transition date have indicated that the estimated recoverable value of the asset is greater than the carrying amount and therefore no impairment losses have been recognised.
Refer to the accounting policy for goodwill for further information.

Reconciliations The following tables reconcile significant key performance indicators and non-GAAP measures included in the Strategic Report to items included in the financial statements.

At the same point, the Group began charging its panel of coand reinsurers a vehicle commission.
The substance of these changes meant that the total premiums written increased by the amount of revenue that was previously earned from the sale of legal protection policies.
The vehicle commission included within Other revenue is therefore eliminated from the turnover measure to avoid double counting.
2 Other reconciling items represent co-insurer and reinsurer shares of Other revenue in the Groups International Car Insurance businesses.
