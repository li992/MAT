Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 1 Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRS The consolidated financial statements of Computacenter plc for the year ended 31 December 2013 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 10 March 2014.
The balance sheet was signed on behalf of the Board by MJNorris and FA Conophy.
Computacenter plc is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in England whose shares are publicly traded.
The Groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2013 and applied in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 000 except when otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Computacenter plc and its subsidiaries as at 31December each year.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using existing GAAP in each country of operation.
Adjustments are made on consolidation for differences that may exist between the respective local GAAPs and IFRS.
All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses and profit and losses resulting from intra-group transactions have been eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the Group obtains control and cease to be consolidated from the date on which the Group no longer retains control.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and is presented separately within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from parent shareholders equity.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except as follows: The Group has adopted the following new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations during the year.
Except as noted below, adoption of these standards did not have any effect on the financial performance or position of the Group.
They may however give rise to additional disclosures.
The other pronouncements which came into force during the year were not relevant to the Group: IFRS 12: Disclosure of interests in other Entities IFRS 12 sets out the requirements for disclosures relating to an entitys interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and structured entities.
The requirements in IFRS 12 are more comprehensive than the previously existing disclosure requirements for subsidiaries.
This amendment has had no effect on the Groups financial position, performance or itsdisclosures.
IFRS 13: Fair Value Measurement IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements.
IFRS 13 does not change when an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under IFRS.
IFRS 13 defines fair value as an exit price.
As a result of the guidance in IFRS 13, the Group re-assessed its policies for measuring fair values, in particular, its valuation inputs such as non-performance risk for fair value measurement of liabilities.
IFRS 13 also requires additional disclosures.
Application of IFRS 13 has not materially impacted the fair value measurements of the Group.
Additional disclosures where required, are provided in the individual notes relating to the assets and liabilities whose fair values were determined.
IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income Amendments to IAS 1 The amendments to IAS 1 introduce a grouping of items presented in OCI.
Items that will be reclassified recycled to profit or loss at a future point in time e. g. net loss or gain on cash flow hedges have to be presented separately from items that will not be reclassified e. g. revaluation of land and buildings.
The amendments affect presentation only and have no impact on the Groups financial position or performance.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and 80 Enabling IT Users Accounts 2013 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued IAS 1 Clarification of the requirement for comparative information Amendment These amendments clarify the difference between voluntary additional comparative information and the minimum required comparative information.
An entity must include comparative information in the related notes to the financial statements when it voluntarily provides comparative information beyond the minimum required comparative period.
The amendments clarify that the opening statement of financial position as at 1 January 2012 in the case of the Group, presented as a result of retrospective restatement or reclassification of items in financial statements does not have to be accompanied by comparative information in the related notes.
As a result, the Group has not included comparative information in respect of the opening statement of financial position as at 1 January 2012.
The amendments affect presentation only and have no impact on the Groups financial position orperformance.
Critical judgements and estimates The preparation of the Groups financial statements requires management to make judgements on how to apply the Groups accounting policies and make estimates about the future.
Due to the inherent uncertainty in making these critical judgements and estimates, actual outcomes could be different.
The more significant judgements and estimates, where a risk exists that a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the next financial year could occur, relate to: revenue recognition where, on a limited number of support and managed services contracts, an estimate of the total contract costs is required to determine the stage of completion.
The policy on recognition of contractual services revenue explains how any losses on contracts are accounted for: estimation of residual value of assets owned to support certain contracts: impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, which is based upon estimates of future cash flows and discount rates for the relevant cash-generating units: the estimate of the value of the contingent consideration payable on acquisitions where that consideration is based on future performance or conditions: recognition of deferred tax assets in respect of losses carried forward, which are dependent upon estimates of future profitability of certain Group companies: and other estimated tax positions, where the decisions of tax authorities are uncertain.
Further information is provided within this note summarising significant accounting policies, and notes 10 and 15 to the financialstatements.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation, down to residual value, is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows: Freehold buildings 2550 years Short leasehold improvements shorter of 7 years and period to expiry of lease Fixtures and fittings Head office 515 years Other shorter of 7 years and period to expiry of lease Office machinery, computer hardware 215 years Motor vehicles 3 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item is included in the income statement in the year the item is derecognised.
Leases Assets held under finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of theleased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so asto achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly againstincome.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and 81 Enabling IT Users Accounts 2013 Financial statements Governance Strategic report Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Intangible assets Software and software licences Software and software licences include computer software that is not integral to a related item of hardware.
These assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment in value.
Amortisation is calculated on straight-line basis over the estimated useful life.
Currently software is amortised over four years.
The carrying values of software and software licences are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount.
Software under development Costs that are incurred and that can be specifically attributed to the development phase of management information systems for internal use are capitalised and amortised over their useful life, once the asset becomes available for use.
Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired as part of a business are carried initially at fair value.
Following initial recognition intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives with charges included in administrative expenses as follows: Existing customer contracts 5 years Existing customer relationships 10 years Tools and technology 7 years The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill Business combinations are accounted for under IFRS 3 Revised using the purchase method.
Any excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised in the balance sheet as goodwill and is not amortised.
Any goodwill asset arising on the acquisition of equity accounted entities is included within the cost of those entities.
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may beimpaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored by management, usually at business segment level or statutory company level as the case may be.
Where the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment of assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
Where an asset does not have independent cash flows, the recoverable amount is assessed for the cash-generating unit to which it belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of the asset or cash-generating unit.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the Group estimates the assets or cash-generating units recoverable amount.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment was recognised.
The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
As the Group has no assets carried at revalued amounts, such reversal is recognised in the income statement.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and 82 Enabling IT Users Accounts 2013 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Investment in associates The Groups interests in its associates, being those entities over which it has significant influence and which are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures, are accounted for using the equity method.
Under the equity method, the investment in an associate is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate, less distributions received and less any impairment in value of individual investments.
The Group income statement reflects the share of the associates results after tax.
Where there has been a change recognised in other comprehensive income of the associate, the Group recognises its share of any such change in the Group statement of other comprehensive income.
Inventories Inventories are carried at the lower of weighted average cost and net realisable value after making allowance for any obsolete or slow-moving items.
Costs include those incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition, on a first-in, first-out basis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Financial assets Financial assets are recognised at their fair value which initially equates to the consideration given plus directly attributable transaction costs associated with the investment.
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification as described in each category below.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which generally have 3090 day terms, are recognised and carried at their original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Current asset investments Current asset investments comprise deposits held for a term of greater than three months from the date of deposit and which is not available to the Group on demand.
Subsequent to initial measurement, current asset investments are measured at fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are initially recognised at their fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as described in each category below.
Interest-bearing borrowings All borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets A financial asset or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is derecognised where: the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: or the Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a pass-through arrangement: or the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either a has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and 83 Enabling IT Users Accounts 2013 Financial statements Governance Strategic report Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Financial liabilities A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Cash flow hedges that meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows: the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in other comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement in other operating expenses.
The Group uses forward currency contracts as hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecasted transactions and firm commitments.
The ineffective portion is recognised in other operating income.
Amounts recognised as other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement, within other operating expenses, when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when the hedged financial expense is recognised.
The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.
Forward contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date that the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value at each reporting date.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
Forward contracts are recorded as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when hedging the exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction or the foreign currency risk in an unrecognised firm commitment.
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.
The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the effectiveness of changes in the hedging instruments fair value in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged items fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in cash flows and are addressed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they are designated.
If the forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement within other operating expenses.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income remains in other comprehensive income until after the forecast transaction or firm commitment affects profit or loss.
Any other gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on forward contracts are taken directly to other operating expenses in the income statement.
Foreign currency translation The Groups presentation currency is Pounds Sterling.
Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the consolidated income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of initial transaction.
The functional currencies of the overseas subsidiaries are Euro, US dollar US$, South African rand ZAR and Swiss franc CHF.
As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of these overseas subsidiaries are translated into the presentation currency of the Group at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and their income statements are translated attheaverage exchange rates for the year.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation are recognised in the  of comprehensive income.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised inthe consolidated statement of comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the incomestatement.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and 84 Enabling IT Users Accounts 2013 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost.
Taxation Current tax Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions: where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses, can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to the statement of comprehensive income if it relates to items that are credited or charged to the statement of comprehensive income.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement.
Sales tax Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except: where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable: and trade receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax included.
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet.
Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts and rebates given to customers, VAT and other sales tax or duty.
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Supply Chain Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on dispatch of goods.
Professional Services Revenue is recognised when receivable under a contract following delivery of a service or in line with the stage of work completed.
The stage of completion is determined by reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the contract and unbilled revenue is recognised within accrued income.
If the total estimated costs and revenues of a contract cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is recognised only to the extent that costs have been incurred.
A provision is made as soon as a loss is foreseen.
Contractual Services Contractual Services revenue includes revenue from Support Services and Managed Services contracts, and is recognised as services are delivered.
Unrecognised contracted revenue is included as deferred income in the balance sheet.
Amounts invoiced relating to more than one period are deferred and recognised over their relevant life.
On a limited number of Contractual Services contracts revenue is recognised on a percentage of completion basis which is determined by reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the contract.
Unbilled revenue is recognised within accrued income.
If a contract cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is restricted to the extent that costs have been incurred.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and 85 Enabling IT Users Accounts 2013 Financial statements Governance Strategic report Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued If the performance of one of these limited number of contracts results in a margin that was less than anticipated at the time that it was agreed then the future financial performance of that contract will be reviewed in detail.
If, after further customer negotiation and financial analysis the full financial consequence of the contract can be reliably estimated, and it is determined that the contract is loss-making, then the best estimate of the losses expected to be incurred until the end of the contract will be provided for.
Where a contract contains several elements, the individual elements are accounted for separately where appropriate and revenue thereon is measured at the fair value of the consideration received.
Finance income Income is recognised as interest accrues.
Dividends Dividend income is recognised when the Groups right to receive payment is established.
Operating leases Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits The Group operates a defined contribution scheme available to all UK employees.
Contributions are recognised as an expense in the income statement as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme.
There are no material pension schemes within the Groups overseas operations.
Exceptional items The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement, those material items of income and expense which, because of the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess better trends in financial performance.
Share-based payment transactions Employees including Executive Directors of the Group can receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the award at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined by utilising an appropriate valuation model, further details of which are given in note 29.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions as none of the conditions set are market-related ones.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date, until the vesting date, reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Directors best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
As the schemes do not include any market-related performance conditions, no expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share seenote 11.
The Group has an employee share trust for the granting of non-transferable options to executives and senior employees.
Shares in the Group held by the employee share trust are treated as investment in own shares and are recorded at cost as a deduction from equity see note 28.
Own shares held Computacenter plc shares held by the Group are classified in shareholders equity as own shares held and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and 86 Enabling IT Users Accounts 2013 3 Restatement of 2012 results The rapid growth of our Services business in Germany during the fourth quarter of 2011, coupled with insufficient contractual governance procedures in place within our German business at that time has resulted in a number of Managed Services contracts failing to achieve the margins anticipated at the time they were agreed.
Actions taken in response to these issues, including a full review of our governance procedures, have had a positive effect, helping to stabilise the business and turnaround a number of operational issues.
However, the Group has determined that three of these contracts, following further customer negotiation and extensive financial analysis, will be loss-making over the course of their remaining life.
The Group has therefore held an exceptional one-off provision of 7.5 million representing our best estimate of the losses expected to be incurred between 2013 and the end of the three contracts.
In order to give investors a clearer picture of the past performance of the business, the Group has reclassified trading losses and provisions previously incurred on these three onerous contracts in 2012 as exceptional items, and has accordingly restated its 2012 results for the German segment and the Group as a whole results, as follows: Year ended 31 December 2012 As reported in 2012 Restated in 2013 Onerous German Contracts Provision Trading for future Rest of ReclassTotal Group in 000 losses losses Total Group Group ification Group Turnover 15,427 15,427 2,898,787 2,914,214 2,914,214 Cost of Sales 21,348 2,108 23,456 2,517,571 2,541,027 8,029 2,532,998 Adjusted Gross Profit 5,921 2,108 8,029 381,216 373,187 8,029 381,216 Administrative expenses 303,172 303,172 303,172 Adjusted Operating Profit 5,921 2,108 8,029 78,044 70,015 8,029 78,044 Adjusted net interest 1,265 1,265 1,265 Adjusted Profit before tax 5,921 2,108 8,029 79,309 71,280 8,029 79,309 Exceptional Items 3,874 3,874 8,029 11,903 Intangibles amortisation 2,608 2,608 2,608 Statutory Profit before tax 5,921 2,108 8,029 72,827 64,798 64,798 Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating profit for the Group that is shown in the segment information note includes interest on CSF of 1,072,000 that is reported in finance costs on the consolidated income statement.

The Groups business in each geography is managed separately and held in separate statutory entities.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the below reportable operating segments.
Management monitors the operating results of its geographical segments separately for the purposes of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
Segment performance is evaluated based on adjusted operating profit or loss which is measured differently from operating profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements.
Adjusted operating profit or loss takes account of the interest paid on customer-specific financing CSF which management consider to be a cost of sale.
Excluded from adjusted operating profit is the amortisation of acquired intangibles and exceptional items as management do not consider these items when reviewing the underlying performance of a segment.
Restatement of prior year comparative information Included within exceptional items in the German segment results in 2012 are losses and provisions incurred in relation to three onerous contracts that were previously classified within operating profit.
Further details of the restatement have been provided within note 3.

A 2.1 million provision was made in December 2012 for these contracts.
A provision for estimated future losses of 7.5 million was held as at December 2013.
This further provision has been classified as an exceptional item due to its size and nature and the 2012 result has been restated to be consistent.
Included within the German segment results in 2012 and 2013 are losses incurred in relation to these onerous contracts.
In order to provide a clearer understanding of the performance of the remainder of the business, losses previously recognised within the German operating result for these contracts have now been reclassified within exceptional items.
In 2012 trading losses of 5.9 million were incurred on revenues of 15.4 million.
In 2013 trading losses of 8.2 million have been incurred on turnover of 23.0 million.
The deterioration in the performance of Computacenter France has led to an assessment of their non-current assets.
It has been concluded that the forecasted cash flows for the French cash-generating unit do not fully support the value of non-current assets in the business.
This has resulted in an impairment of 12.2 million of intangible assets in the French cash-generating unit.
During 2013 Computacenter Germany continued its programme, from late 2012, to reduce its net operating expenses.
As a result, redundancy costs of 3.1 million were incurred during the year which, due to their size and nature, have been included within exceptional items.
Similarly, Computacenter France has begun a programme to also reduce its SG&A and restructure its business and senior management in line with the Group Operating Model.
Redundancy related expenses of 1.2 million have been included in the 2013 result.
Due to the continued adverse performance of our equity accounted associate, ICS Solutions Limited, we have decided to fully impair the 0.5 million recorded value of our investment.
As part of our normal processes, we have carried out a detailed evaluation of other long-term Services contracts across the Group.
As a result of this on-going evaluation, management have calculated that a positive change in certain estimates has resulted in a one-off gain of 4.0 million.
Due to the nature of the change in the estimates, and the size of the gain, it has been decided to highlight this as an exceptional item.
This is consistent with the treatment of the previously identified onerous contacts and will provide a fairer and more balanced understanding of our underlying growth in profitability.
During the year a deferred tax asset relating to losses carried forward in France has been written off for 2.2 million.
Tax relief from prior period Research and Development project spend on the Group ERP platforms has resulted in prior year adjustment credited in the statutory tax charge for year.
Due to the timing, materiality and one-off nature of this relief, it has been decided to classify it an exceptional tax item.
Included within the prior year are the following exceptional items: During the year, Computacenter France consolidated its operations in a new office and began the move to a new warehouse.
InJanuary 2013, RDC relocated to new premises in Braintree.
The one-off costs in relation to the relocation of these premises of 2.4 million that have been disclosed as an exceptional item relate principally to: operating lease rental expense charged on new properties during the fit-out period and prior to occupation: redundancy costs paid as a result of the relocation: and rental expense related to legacy properties once they had been vacated.
In the second half of 2012, Computacenter Germany undertook a programme to reduce its net operating expenses by approximately 1.2 million annually.
The related redundancy expenses of 1.5 million, due to their size and nature, have been included within exceptional items.
The income statement impact of both items has been shown as an exceptional tax item.

In addition, at 31 December 2013, there were unused tax losses across the Group of 125.4 million 2012: 115.5 million for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Of these losses, 54.5 million 2012: 61.6 million arise in Germany and 67.6 million 2012: 50.6 million arise in France.
A significant proportion of the losses arising in Germany have been generated in statutory entities that no longer have significant levels of trade.
The remaining unrecognised tax losses relate to other loss-making overseas subsidiaries.

e Impact of rate change The main rate of UK Corporation will be reduced to 21 per cent from 1 April 2014 and to 20 per cent from 1 April 2015, as enacted in the Finance Act 2013.
Deferred tax has been restated accordingly in these financial statements.
11 Earnings per ordinary share Earnings per share EPS amounts are calculated by dividing profit attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year excluding own shares held.
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing profit attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year excluding own shares held adjusted for the effect of dilutive options.
Adjusted basic and adjusted diluted EPS are presented to provide more comparable and representative information.
Accordingly, the adjusted basic and adjusted diluted EPS figures exclude amortisation of acquired intangibles and exceptional items.

Computacenter France, which is equivalent to the France segment, is the cash-generating unit CGU at which impairment is assessed.
The recoverable amount of the Computacenter France CGU has been determined based on a value-in-use calculation.
The discount rate used is 12 per cent 2012: 12 per cent.
As a result of the deterioration in performance, an impairment of 12.2 million has been recognised in this CGU, which has resulted in an impairment to goodwill and acquired customer relationships.
In France, adverse changes to the assumptions, such as a 0.5 per cent increase in the discount rate, a 0.5 per cent reduction in the market growth rate or a 5 per cent fall in long-term operating profit, would cause the carrying value of the remaining non-current assets in the French cash-generating unit to exceed the carrying amount.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and 96 Enabling IT Users Accounts 2013 15 Impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill acquired through business combinations have been allocated to the following CGUs: Computacenter UK Limited RD Trading Computacenter Germany Computacenter France Computacenter Switzerland NEWIS SA and Informatic Services IS SA together Belgium IS These represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Belgium IS is managed and therefore reported as part of the Belgium segment, however as it retains its own identifiable cash flows, it is considered as a CGU itself.
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations The recoverable amounts of all six CGUs have been determined based on a value-in-use calculation.
To calculate this, cash flow projections are based on financial budgets approved by senior management covering a three-year period and on long-term market growth rates of between 1.5 and 2.5 per cent 2012: between 1.5 and 2.5 per cent thereafter.
Key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation for all CGUs for 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 are: budgeted revenue, which is based on long-run market growth forecasts: budgeted gross margins, which are based on average gross margins achieved in the year immediately before the budgeted year, adjusted for expected long-run market pricing trends: and the discount rate applied to cash flow projections ranges from 11.0 to 15.0 per cent 2012: 11.0 to 15.0 per cent which represents the Groups pre-tax discount rate adjusted for the risk profiles of the individual CGUs.
Except in France, each CGU generates value substantially in excess of the carrying value of goodwill attributed to each of them.
Management therefore believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the unit to materially exceed its recoverable amount.
In France, adverse changes in the assumptions, such as a 0.5 per cent reduction in market growth rate or an increase in the discount rate of 0.5 per cent would cause the carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets consist of customer contracts, customer relationships and tools and technology.
The expected useful lives are shown in note 2.

Financial assets and liabilities through profit or loss are those foreign exchange contracts that are not designated in hedge relationships as they are intended to reduce the level of foreign currency risk for expected sales and purchases.
The Group also enters into other foreign exchange forward contracts with the intention to reduce the foreign exchange risk of expected sales and purchases.
When these other contracts are not designated in hedge relationships they are measured at fair value through profit and loss within other operating expenses.
The foreign exchange forward contract balances vary with the level of expected foreign currency costs and changes in the foreign exchange forward rates.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and 102 Enabling IT Users Accounts 2013 23 Forward currency contracts continued The terms of the foreign currency forward contracts have been negotiated for the expected highly probable forecast transactions to which hedge accounting has been applied.
No significant element of hedge ineffectiveness required recognition in the incomestatement.
The cash flow hedges of the forecasted costs were assessed to be highly effective and a net unrealised loss of 1,403,000 2012: gain of 494,000 with a deferred tax asset of 326,000 2012: 120,000 deferred tax liability relating to the hedging instruments is included in the other comprehensive income.
The amounts retained in the other comprehensive income of 1,403,000are expected to mature and affect the income statement in 2014 and 2015.
24 Obligations under leases a Finance lease commitments The Group has finance leases for various items of plant and machinery: these leases have no terms of renewal or purchase options and escalation clauses.

Whilst there is uncertainty around the future performance of these contracts and the exact timing of cashflows, Management remains comfortable with the level of the provision.
Assumptions used to calculate the property provisions are based on the market value of the rental charges plus any contractual dilapidation expenses on empty properties and the Directors best estimates of the likely time before the relevant leases can be reassigned or sublet, which ranges between one and 10 years.
The provisions in relation to the UK properties are discounted at arate based upon the Bank of England base rate.
Those in respect of the European operations are discounted at a rate based on Euribor.
26 Financial instruments An explanation of the Groups financial instrument risk management objectives, policies and strategies are set out in the Finance Directors Review on pages 28 to 33. Credit risk The Group principally manages credit risk through management of customer credit limits.
The credit limits are set for each customer based on the creditworthiness of the customer and the anticipated levels of business activity.
These limits are initially determined when the customer account is first set up and are regularly monitored thereafter.
The balance of trade receivables relates to customers for whom there is no recent history of default.
In determining the recoverability of the trade receivables, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivables from the date the credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The maximum exposure on trade receivables, as at the reporting date, is their carrying value.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, current asset investment and forward currency contracts, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents.
The Group manages its counterparty credit risk by placing cash on deposit across a panel of reputable banking institutions, with no more than 50.0 million deposited at any one time except for UK Government backed counterparties where the limit is 70.0 million.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, bank borrowings, cash and short-term deposits, invoice factoring in the UK and finance leases and loans for certain customer contracts.
The Groups bank borrowings, other facilities and deposits are at floating rates.
No interest rate derivative contracts have been entered into.
When long-term borrowings are utilised, the Groups policy is to maintain these borrowings at fixed rates to limit the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and 104 Enabling IT Users Accounts 2013 26 Financial instruments continued Interest rate sensitivity The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
There is no impact on the Groupsequity.
Effect Change on profit in basis before tax points 000 2013 Sterling 25 38 Euro 25 45 2012 Sterling 25 203 Euro 25 13 The impact of a reasonably possible decrease to the same range shown in the table would result in an opposite impact on the profit before tax of the same magnitude.
Fair values The carrying value of the Groups short-term receivables and payables is a reasonable approximation of their fair values.
The fair value of all other financial instruments carried within the Groups financial statements is not materially different from their carryingamount.
Forward currency contracts At 31 December 2013 the Group held foreign exchange contracts as hedges of an inter-company loan and future expected payments to suppliers.
The exchange contracts are being used to reduce the exposure to foreign exchange risk.
The terms of these contracts are detailed below: 31 December 2013 Buy Sell Value of Maturity Contract currency currency contracts dates rates UK Euros Sterling 2,715,853 Jan 14 1.1820-1.1871 Sterling Dollars 9,240,524 Jan 14 1.5713-1.6489 Sterling Swiss Francs 353,590 Apr 14 1.4141 Sterling Euros 3,089,003 Jan-Feb 14 1.1722-1.2093 Dollars Sterling $39,894,698 Jan-Apr 14 1.5458-1.6478 Danish Kroner Sterling DKK43,695 Jan 14 8.9164 Hungarian Forint Sterling HUF135,000,000 Feb 14 350.9973-358.3415 SA Rand Sterling ZAR223,996,644 Jan 14-Dec 15 14.9234-18.2271 Germany US Dollar Euro $48,975,000 Jan-May 14 1.3107-1.3863 31 December 2012 Buy Sell Value of Maturity Contract currency currency contracts dates rates UK Euro Sterling 4,506,533 Jan-Mar 13 1.2255-1.2325 Sterling Swiss Franc 342,505 Apr 13 1.4598 Sterling Euro 1,707,911 Jan 13 1.2255-1.2327 Sterling Norwegian Kroner 21,214 Jan 13 9.0034 US Dollar Sterling $14,360,237 Jan-Apr 13 1.5838-1.6206 Danish Kroner Sterling DKK304,922 Jan 13 9.1066 SA Rand Sterling ZAR148,641,912 Jan 13-Jun 14 13.6104-15.1952 Germany US Dollar Euro $49,625,000 Jan-May 13 1.2623-1.3310 The gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the above contracts are detailed in note 23.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and 105 Enabling IT Users Accounts 2013 Financial statements Governance Strategic report Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 26 Financial instruments continued Exchange rate sensitivity The majority of the transactions in each of the Groups geographical segments are denominated in the functional currency of that segment.
There are, however, a limited number of transactions where foreign currency exchange risk exists.
In these instances the Group enters into forward currency contracts, as shown in the above table, in order to mitigate such risk.
At the end of the year the fair value of the outstanding contracts was a liability of 2,360,000 2012: 554,000.
Other than differences arising from the translation of results of operations outside of the Groups functional currency, reasonably foreseeable movements in the exchange rates of 10 per cent or -10 per cent would not have a material impact on the Groups profit before tax or equity.
Liquidity risk The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities as at 31 December based on contractual undiscounted payments: On demand 3 months 312 months 15 years 5 years Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Year ended 31 December 2013 Financial liabilities 1,224 3,135 7,546 8,431 20,336 Derivative financial liabilities 1,148 842 370 2,360 Trade and other payables 604,316 604,316 1,224 608,599 8,388 8,801 627,012 On demand 3 months 312 months 15 years 5 years Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Year ended 31 December 2012 Financial liabilities 1,135 2,676 5,737 11,033 20,581 Derivative financial liabilities 764 181 1 584 Trade and other payables 527,539 527,539 1,135 530,979 5,556 11,034 548,704 Fair value measurements recognised in the consolidated balance sheet Financial instruments which are recognised at fair value subsequent to initial recognition are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
The three levels are defined as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
At 31 December 2013 the Group had a current asset investment, which was measured at Level 2 fair value subsequent to initial recognition, to the value of nil 31 December 2012: 10.0 million.
At 31 December 2013 the Group had forward currency contracts, which were measured at Level 2 fair value subsequent to initial recognition, to the value of a liability of 2,360,000 31 December 2012: 554,000.
The realised losses from forward currency contracts in the period to 31 December 2013 of 1,806,000 2012: 386,000, are offset by broadly equivalent realised gains on the related underlying transactions.
27 Capital management Computacenters approach to capital management is to ensure that the Group has a strong capital base to support the development of the business and to maintain a strong credit rating, whilst aiming to maximise shareholder value.
Consistent with the Groups aim to maximise return to shareholders, the dividend policy is to maintain a dividend cover of between 22.5 times.
In 2013 the cover was 2.5 times, on a pre-exceptional basis 2012: 2.3 times.
The Groups capital base is primarily utilised to finance its fixed assets and working capital requirements.
The Group seeks to optimise the use of working capital and improve its cash flow.
As a consequence, the UK has sourced an increasing proportion of its product business via distributors in order to reduce the working capital requirements of the business.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and 106 Enabling IT Users Accounts 2013 27 Capital management continued Capital is allocated across the Group in order to minimise the Groups exposure to exchange rates.
Each country finances its own working capital requirements, typically resulting in borrowings in France with cash on deposit in the UK and Germany.
During 2013, a notional cash pooling arrangement was introduced, which Group companies can access and allows the Group to pool its funds.
In certain circumstances, the Group enters into customer contracts that are financed by leases, which are secured only on the assets that they finance, or loans.
Whilst the outstanding amounts of this customer specific financing CSF are included within net funds for statutory reporting purposes, the Group excludes this customer specific financing when managing the net funds of the business as this outstanding financing is matched by committed future revenues.
These financing facilities, which are committed, are thus outside of the normal working capital requirements of the Groups product resale and services activities.
In certain circumstances, the Group deposits its funds in short-term investments that do not fulfil the criteria to be classified as cash and cash equivalents.
The Group considers these deposits when managing the net funds of the business, and accordingly includes these deposits within net funds excluding CSF.
Capital, defined as net funds, that the Group monitors is: 2013 2012 000 000 Net funds excluding CSF 90,271 147,327 Customer specific financing 18,857 18,701 Net funds 71,414 128,626 The Group continued to benefit from the extension of an improvement in credit terms with a significant vendor, equivalent to 41million at 31 December 2013, an increase of approximately 7 million over the course of the year.
Each operating country manages working capital in line with Group policies.
The key components of working capital, i. e. trade receivables, inventory and trade payables, are managed in accordance with an agreed number of days targeted in the budget process, in order to ensure efficient capital usage.
An important element of the process of managing capital efficiently is to ensure that each operating country rewards behaviour at an Account Manager and Account Director level to minimise working capital, at a transactional level.
This is achieved by increasing commission payments for early payment by customers and reduced commission payments for late payment by customers, which encourages appropriate behaviour.
The Group regularly reviews the adequacy of its facilities against any foreseeable peak borrowing requirement.
At 31 December 2013, the Group had available 17.3 million of uncommitted overdraft facilities 2012: 20.3 million of uncommitted overdraft and factoringfacilities.

Return of Value On 12 June 2013 the Company effected a capital reorganisation under which each ordinary share of 6 pence was divided into one ordinary of 6 pence and one B share of 0.01 pence with the B shares to be redeemed and cancelled at a future date.
Following this sub-division every 10 ordinary shares of 6 pence were consolidated into 9 ordinary shares of 6 pence.
As a result of the 9 for 10 consolidation, 153,931,830 ordinary shares of 6 pence became 138,538,647 ordinary shares of 6 pence.
