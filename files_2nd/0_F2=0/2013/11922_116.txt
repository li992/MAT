OVERVIEW OUR PERFORMANCE RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Section 5 Financial statements 161 14.
Classification of financial instruments continued Certain of the Groups derivative financial instruments are classified as held for trading either as they do not meet the hedge accounting criteria specified in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement or the Group has chosen not to seek hedge accounting for these instruments.
None of these derivatives are held for speculative trading purposes.
Transactions in derivative financial instruments are only undertaken to manage risks arising from underlying business activity, in accordance with the Groups treasury policy as described in note 19.
The Group designates certain qualifying derivative financial instruments as hedges of the fair value of its bonds fair value hedges.
Changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recorded in the income statement, together with any change in the fair value of the hedged liability attributable to the hedged risk.
The Group also designates certain of its borrowings and derivative financial instruments as hedges of its investments in foreign operations net investment hedges.
Movements in the fair value of these financial instruments to the extent they are effective are recognised in other comprehensive income.
None of the Groups financial assets or liabilities are designated at fair value through the income statement upon initial recognition.
More detail on the Groups accounting for financial instruments is included in the Groups accounting policies.
The Groups approach to managing risks in relation to financial instruments is described in note 19.

Derivative financial instruments continued The carrying value of the above derivative financial instruments equals their fair value.
Fair values are determined by using market data and the use of established estimation techniques such as discounted cash flow and option valuation models.
At the end of 2013, the currency split of the mark-to-market values of rate derivatives, including the exchange of principal on cross-currency rate derivatives, was US dollar 151 m, sterling 243m and South African rand 16 m 2012: US dollar 59 m, sterling 257m and South African rand 20 m. The fixed interest rates on outstanding rate derivative contracts at the end of 2013 range from 1.10% to 9.28% 2012: 3.65% to 9.28% and the floating rates are based on LIBOR in US dollar and sterling.
The Groups portfolio of rate derivatives is diversified by maturity, counterparty and type.
Natural offsets between transactions within the portfolio and the designation of certain derivatives as hedges significantly reduce the risk of income statement volatility.
The sensitivity of the portfolio to changes in market rates is set out in note 19.
Derivative financial assets and liabilities subject to offsetting arrangements are as follows: 2013 2012 Gross Gross Net derivative Gross Gross Net derivative derivative derivative assets derivative derivative assets assets liabilities liabilities assets liabilities liabilities All figures in millions m m m m m m Counterparties in an asset position 122 12 110 178 178 Counterparties in a liability position 2 36 34 Total as presented in the balance sheet 124 48 76 178 178 All of the Groups derivative financial instruments are subject to enforceable netting arrangements with individual counterparties, allowing net settlement in the event of default of either party.
Offset arrangements in respect of cash balances are shown in note 17.
Counterparty exposure from all derivatives is managed, together with that from deposits and bank account balances, within credit limits that reflect published credit ratings and by reference to other market measures e. g. market prices for credit default swaps to ensure that there is no significant risk to any one counterparty.
No single derivative transaction had a market value positive or negative at the balance sheet date that exceeded 3% of the Groups consolidated total equity.
In accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement the Group has reviewed all of its material contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet certain requirements, and has concluded that there are no material embedded derivatives.
