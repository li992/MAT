PROPERTIES CONTINUED 15 iii Valuation techniques and related quantitative information All of the Group's properties are level 3, as defined by IFRS 13, in the fair value hierarchy as at 31 December 2013 and there were no transfers between levels during the year.
Level 3 inputs used in valuing the properties, are those which are unobservable, as opposed to level 1 inputs from quoted prices and level 2 observable inputs either directly, i. e. as prices, or indirectly, i. e. derived from prices.
Based on a multi-criteria approach, the following valuation techniques can be used for a same class of assets: The yield methodology valuation technique is used when valuing the Groups assets which uses market rental values capitalised with a market capitalisation rate.
The resulting valuations are cross-checked against the initial yields and the fair market values per square metre derived from actual market transactions.
For properties under construction, the fair value is usually calculated by estimating the fair value of the completed property using the above mentioned methodology less estimated costs to completion.
An increase decrease to ERV will increase decrease valuations, while an increase decrease to yield decreases increases valuations.
There are interrelationships between all these inputs as they are determined by market conditions.
The existence of an increase in more than one input would be to magnify the input on the valuation.
The impact on the valuation will be mitigated by the interrelationship of two inputs in opposite directions, for example, an increase in rent may be offset by an increase in yield.
2 Land and development valuations by asset type are not available as land sites are not yet categorised by asset type.
Combined property portfolio column will not cast down but row does cast across.
