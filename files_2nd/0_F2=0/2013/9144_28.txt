84 Kier Group plc Overview Operational review Corporate responsibility Financial review Governance Financial statements 8 Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a number of pension schemes for eligible employees as described below.
Kier Group Pension Scheme This is the principal scheme and includes a defined benefit section and a defined contribution section.
The assets of the Scheme are held in trust separate from the assets of the Group.
The trustees are responsible for investing the assets and delegate day-to-day decisions to independent professional investment managers.
The defined benefit section of the Scheme was closed to new entrants on 1 January 2002: existing members continue to accrue benefits for future service.
An actuarial valuation of the Scheme was undertaken by the trustees independent actuaries as at 1 April 2010 using the projected unit method.
The market value of the Schemes assets at that date was 622.0m which represented approximately 88% of the benefits that had accrued to members at that date, after allowing for future increases in salaries.
The contributions paid during the year were 29.4m 2012: 20.9m which included special contributions of 20.1m 2012: 11.1m to fund the past service deficit.
Going forward, contributions will include an allowance for funding the past service deficit identified at the 2010 valuation date.
The Group expects to make contributions for future service of 9.4m, being 20.5% of pensionable pay until 1 April 2014 and 21.8% of pensionable pay thereafter, plus 10.8m for funding the past service deficit in the year to June 2014.
The Pension Protection Fund PPF levy is payable in addition to the above contributions.
Following closure of the defined benefit section of the Scheme to new entrants most new employees are offered membership of the defined contribution section of the Kier Group Pension Scheme.
The Group is required to pay contributions in respect of those employees in accordance with the rates specified in their contracts of employment.
The contributions paid during the year, and the pension charge, amounted to 13.7m 2012: 12.7m.
An actuarial valuation of the Kier Group Pension Scheme is currently being carried out as at 1 April 2013.
Kier Sheffield LLP The Group participates in this defined benefit scheme through its subsidiary Kier Sheffield LLP which has participated as an admitted body in the South Yorkshire Pension Fund since 1 April 2003.
As an admitted body it was granted a fully funded past service position at that date, with assets and past service liabilities of 65.0m.
The scheme covers 1,146 employees who transferred from Sheffield Councils employment to Kier Sheffield LLP at the start of the contract.
New employees are offered membership of the defined contribution section of the Kier Group Pension Scheme.
Kier Sheffield LLP is required to pay contributions in respect of these employees in accordance with the rates specified in their contracts of employment.
Kier Sheffield LLPs pension costs in respect of the defined benefit scheme are assessed on the advice of an independent qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The contributions paid during the year were 1.8m 2012: 2.2m.
Going forward Kier Sheffield LLP expects to pay contributions for future service at the rate of 10.5% of pensionable pay.
An actuarial valuation of the South Yorkshire Pension Fund is currently being carried out as at 1 April 2013.
Other schemes Contributions are also made in respect of hourly paid operatives to an industry-wide stakeholder pension scheme and in respect of employees who are members of a local government pension scheme.
The pension costs for these have been taken as the actual contributions paid during the year.
In response to the Governments recent legislation on automatic enrolment of employees into workplace pensions, the Group selected the Peoples Pension which is run by B&CE as a workplace pension arrangement and expects to pay in the future contributions of up to 1.5m p. a. in relation to this arrangement.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits disclosures Kier recognises any actuarial gains or losses through the statement of comprehensive income as permitted under IAS 19.
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 85 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2013 8 Retirement benefit obligations continued The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries and the expected rate of return on assets in providing the IAS 19 position as detailed below were: Kier Group Pension Scheme 2013 2012 2011 % %% Rate of general increases in pensionable salaries 3.3 2.8 3.4 Rate of increase to pensions in payment liable for Limited Price Indexation 3.2 2.8 3.4 Discount rate 4.7 4.7 5.5 Inflation rate RPI 3.5 3.0 3.6 Inflation rate CPI 2.5 2.0 2.7 The mortality assumptions are that life expectancy from age 60 is 29.1 years and 29.7 years for men and women respectively, for future pensioners who retire in 2033.

If the discount rate were to increase by 0.1% the Kier Group Pension Scheme deficit would decrease by 14.6m, and the Kier Sheffield LLP liability would decrease by 3.6m resulting in a surplus of 2.6m.

Amortisation disclosed separately relates to the amortisation of contract right costs held as intangibles on the balance sheet.
The prior year comparative has been re-presented to reflect this presentation.
Kier Group and its subsidiaries are based predominantly in the UK and are subject to UK corporation tax.
Where Kier operates overseas this will generally be either through UK resident companies or branches of UK companies, and therefore these companies will pay UK corporation tax subject to the offset of local overseas tax.
The Group does not have an aggressive tax policy and has not entered into any tax avoidance schemes which were, or should have been, notified to HMRC under the Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Scheme DOTAS rules during the year or previous year.
The tax charge before exceptional items and amortisation of contract rights of 8.9m 2012: 9.3m shown in the table above equates to an effective tax rate of 14% 2012: 13% on adjusted profit before tax of 63.2m 2012: 70.2m.
This effective rate is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax of 23.75% 2012: 25.5% due to a number of items shown in the table above.
The effect of the change in the UK corporation tax rate arises principally as a result of the impact of the rate change on the deferred tax asset related to the retirement benefit obligations.
In accordance with accounting standards the effect of the change in the tax rate on the deferred tax balance is recognised in the same primary statement that the original deferred tax balance was recognised in.
The original deferred tax balance relating to the retirement benefit obligation is made up of two larger amounts that were previously recognised in part through the income statement and in part through the statement of comprehensive income.
This has resulted in a credit in the income statement and a charge in the statement of comprehensive income for the years ended 30 June 2012 and 30 June 2013.
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 89 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2013 9 Taxation continued In accordance with UK tax legislation, capital gains arising on disposal of certain investments, including some of the joint ventures disposed of during the year, are not subject to tax.
Tax relief on expenses not recognised in the income statement includes the impact of the tax deduction received in respect of the cost of shares exercised under the Groups employee Save As You Earn Scheme.
As a result of additional investment made in joint ventures, there is more certainty that existing tax losses will be utilised against trading profits in the short term, and in accordance with accounting standards a deferred tax asset has been recognised.
The adjustment in respect of prior years results from differences between the estimates of taxation included in the previous years financial statements and the actual tax liabilities calculated in the tax returns submitted to and agreed by HMRC.
b Recognised in the cash flow statement The cash flow statement shows a repayment of 3.5m during the year.
Tax payments are generally lower than the tax charge in the income statement because tax deductions are claimed for pension contributions based on the level of contributions actually paid, and pension payments in the year exceed the amount included in the income statement.
During the year Kier received a corporate tax repayment from HMRC which related to earlier periods.
c Recognised in the statement of comprehensive income 2013 2012 m m Deferred tax expense including effect of change in tax rate Fair value movements on joint venture cash flow hedging instruments 1.7 2.3 Actuarial losses gains on defined benefit pension schemes 2.9 7.5 Total tax credit in the statement of comprehensive income 1.2 9.8 d Factors that may affect future tax charges The Chancellor has announced the main rate of corporation tax will be 24%, from April 2012, 23% from April 2013, 21% from April 2014 and 20% from April 2015.
The reduction to 23% has had the effect of reducing the net deferred tax asset included in the above figures by 1.5m, with 1.4m being credited to the income statement and 2.9m being charged directly to the statement of comprehensive income.
The reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax from 23% to 21% was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013 and is effective from 1 April 2014.
This will reduce the Group's future tax charge accordingly.
If the rate change from 23% to 21% had been substantively enacted at 30 June 2013 it would have had the effect of reducing the net deferred tax asset of 27.4m Group: 23.5 asset, joint ventures 3.9m asset held at this date by 3.3m, with 2.8m being credited to the income statement and 6.1m being charged directly to the statement of comprehensive income.
It has not been possible to fully quantify the anticipated effect of the further 1% rate reduction from 21% to 20%, although this is expected to reduce the Group's future tax charge and reduce deferred tax assets accordingly.
e Tax losses At the balance sheet date the Group has unused income tax losses of 10.3m 2012: 10.0m available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 10.2m 2012: 9.3m of these losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining losses, due to the unpredictability of future profit streams against which these losses could be offset.
Under present tax legislation, these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at meetings of the Company.
On 8 July 2013 14.7m shares were issued in connection with the acquisition on May Gurney Integrated Services plc.
Cash flow hedge reserve This reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of the cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred, together with any related deferred taxation.
Translation reserve This reserve comprises the cumulative difference on exchange arising from the retranslation of net investments in overseas subsidiary undertakings.

These are exercisable at the holders discretion from 1 July 2016 until 1 January 2017.
LTIP Awards made under the scheme are normally able to vest following the third anniversary of the date of the grant.
Vesting may be in full or in part with the balance of the award lapsing, and is subject to the Group achieving specific performance targets.
The awards which are taken as shares are intended to be satisfied from the following shares held by the Kier Group 1999 Employee Benefit Trust rather than from the issue of new shares.
These shares are accounted for as a deduction from retained earnings.

The dividends on these shares have been waived.
A description of these schemes and the terms and conditions of each scheme are included in the directors remuneration report on pages 58 to 67.
Value of share schemes The fair value per option granted has been calculated using the following assumptions.
These calculations are based on the Black-Scholes model for all options apart from the TSR element of the LTIP which is based on a stochastic model.

The fair value of the TSR element incorporates an assessment of the number of shares that will be awarded, as the performance conditions are market conditions under IFRS 2 Share-based payments.
The performance conditions of the EPS element are non-market conditions under IFRS 2.
The fair value therefore does not include an assessment of the number of shares that will be awarded.
Instead the amount charged for this element is based on the fair value factored by a true-up for the number of awards that are expected to vest.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
The total charge for the year relating to share-based payment plans was: 2013 2012 m m Equity-settled 4.0 2.9 Cash-settled including employers national insurance 0.2 Total charge recognised as employee costs 4.0 3.1 Included in other payables is an amount of 0.3m 2012: 0.8m relating to provisions for employers national insurance and cash-settled sharebased payments.

26 Guarantees and contingent liabilities There are contingent liabilities in respect of performance bonds, guarantees and claims under contracting and other arrangements, including joint arrangements and joint ventures, entered into in the normal course of business.
27 Financial instruments Capital risk management The Groups capital management objectives are: to ensure the Groups ability to continue as a going concern: to optimise the capital structure in order to minimise the cost of capital: and to maintain a strong balance sheet to support business development and tender qualification.
The three operating divisions of the Group have complementary capital characteristics, with the Construction division, and to a lesser extent the Services division, generating a net cash surplus, whilst the Property division requires net capital to fund developments.
The Groups capital management strategy is to use a blend of capital types with different risk, return and maturity profiles to support the operating divisions and deliver the Groups capital management objectives.
The Groups overall capital risk management strategy remains unchanged from 2012.
The capital structure of the Group comprises: equity, consisting of share capital, share premium, retained earnings and other reserves as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity: and cash, cash equivalents and borrowings as disclosed in note 20 and described further below.
The Group forecasts and monitors short, medium and longer-term capital needs on a regular basis and adjusts its capital structure as required through the payment of dividends to shareholders, the issue of new share capital and the increase or repayment of borrowings.
All investment decisions are made with regard to the Groups weighted average cost of capital and typically a pre-tax annualised return of at least 15% is required to ensure such investments are value enhancing for shareholders.
Financial risk management Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed.
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily to credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk.
The overall aim of the Groups financial risk management policies is to minimise any potential adverse effects on financial performance and net assets.
The Groups treasury team manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating limits approved by the Board.
Treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest and exchange rates.
Credit risk Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables, short-term bank deposits and interest rate and currency hedges.
Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history.
Short-term bank deposits and hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major ratings agencies.
Counter-party exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counterparty are within predetermined limits.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are stated net of a bad debt provision which has been estimated by management following a review of individual, receivable accounts.
There is no Group-wide rate of provision and provision made for debts that are overdue is based on prior default experience and known factors at the balance sheet date.
Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
100 Kier Group plc Overview Operational review Corporate responsibility Financial review Governance Financial statements An analysis of the provision held against trade receivables is set out below.
2013 2012 m m Provision as at 1 July 1.2 5.4 Charged credited to the income statement 0.1 4.2 Provision as at 30 June 1.3 1.2 There are 13.2m 2012: 41.4m of trade receivables that were overdue at the balance sheet date that have not been provided against, of which 7.7m 2012: 29.9m had been received by the end of August 2013.
There are no indications as at 30 June 2013 that the debtors will not meet their payment obligations in respect of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are overdue and unprovided.
The proportion of trade receivables at 30 June 2013 that were overdue for payment was 5.7% 2012: 15%.
Credit terms vary across the Group: the average age of trade receivables was as follows: Construction 46 days 2012: 54 days Services 34 days 2012: 37 days Overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to significant credit risk.
Market risk Interest rate risk The Group has mitigated part of its exposure to interest rate fluctuations through an issue, in December 2012, of 7 and 10-year loan notes, principal amounts of 45m and USD28m.
Loan notes denominated in US dollars were hedged back-to-back with cross-currency swaps.
The loan notes carry fixed rates of interest.
The Group has borrowing facilities to finance short-term working capital requirements and term loans to finance medium-term capital requirements, which carry interest at floating rates, at a margin over LIBOR.
In addition, a number of the Groups PFI joint ventures have entered into interest rate swaps.
Foreign currency risk The Group operates primarily within the UK such that its exposure to currency risk is not considered to be significant.
Where significant foreign currency exposures are identified these are hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts or swaps.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient borrowing facilities are available to fund operations without the need to carry significant net debt over the medium term.
The Groups principal borrowing facilities are provided by a group of relationship banks in the form of unsecured committed borrowing facilities.
The amount of committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.
Derivative financial instruments Current Non-current Total liabilities liabilities liabilities At 30 June 2013 m m m Fuel price forward contracts 0.1 0.5 0.6 Fuel price forward contracts have been accounted for as derivatives held at fair value through the income statement.
The fair value of these contracts has been determined based on a level 2 valuation method, using valuation techniques that include inputs that are based on observable market data.
During the year Kier Group plc entered in to three cross-currency fixed interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate and currency risk on a US dollar denominated loan, nominal value USD 28m.
These swaps have met the criteria for hedge accounting and as a result have been recognised directly in equity.
The following table indicates the periods in which the cashflows associated with cash flow hedges are expected to occur, how those cashflows will impact the income statement and the fair value of the related hedging instruments.
Expected cash flows 0-1 1-2 2-5 more than 5 Fair Value Total years years years years m m m m m m Interest rate swaps Assets 7.6 0.9 0.9 2.6 3.2 In addition to the above, a number of the Groups PFI joint ventures have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk.
Interest-bearing debts and associated interest rate derivatives within these joint ventures have a typical term of between 25 and 30 years and are without recourse to the Group.
At 30 June 2013 the aggregate amount outstanding on these interest-bearing debts against which interest rate derivatives are held is 175.9m.
The Groups share of the total net fair value liability of these interest rate derivatives at 30 June 2013, based on quoted prices in active markets, amounted to 16.5m which, together with the related deferred tax asset of 3.9m, have met the criteria for hedge accounting and as a result have been recognised directly in equity.

There is no material difference between the carrying value and fair value of the Groups financial liabilities.
The carrying value is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows.
Borrowings Borrowings represent loan notes, principal amounts of 45m and USD28m with fixed coupons of between 4.2% and 4.9% and a term loan of 30m, at a margin over LIBOR, net of capitalised interest costs of 0.2m.
Loan notes are repayable in two repayments, December 2019 and December 2022.
The term loan is repayable January 2017.
