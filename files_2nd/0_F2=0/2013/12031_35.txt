Signed on behalf of the Board of Directors Simon Denyer Director 132 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Strategic Corporate Report Governance Financial Statements The individual financial statements for the Company have been prepared in accordance with UK law and applicable UK GAAP accountingstandards.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
They have all been applied consistently throughout the financial year and the preceding year.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and company law.
Going concern The Company had cash balances of 75,542,000 at the year end and no borrowings.
Having reviewed cash flow forecasts and budgets for the year ahead the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Exemptions The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and not presented a profit and loss account for the Company alone.
The Company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 Related Parties from disclosing related-party transactions with entities that are wholly owned and part of the Perform Group plc Group.
The Company has not published its individual cash flow statement as its liquidity, solvency and financial adaptability are dependent on the Group rather than its own cash flows.
Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision, if any, for impairment.
Revenue recognition Revenue represents amounts derived from the provision of management services to the Groups subsidiaries and are also derived from the Groups continuing, ordinary activities, after the deduction of value added tax.
Foreign currency translation Foreign currency transactions are translated at the rates ruling when they occurred.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate.
Any differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the profit and loss account because itexcludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Companys liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 133 Perform Group plc Parent company financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2013 Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more, tax, with the following exceptions: provision is made for tax on gains arising from the revaluation and similar fair value adjustments of fixed assets, and gains on disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned.
However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold: deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted: and deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Share-based payments The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans for the employees of subsidiaries using the Companys equity instruments, as detailed in note 1 to the Group financial statements.
The fair value of the compensation given in respect of these share-based compensation plans is recognised as a capital contribution to the Companys subsidiaries over the vesting period.
The capital contribution is reduced by any payments received from subsidiaries in respect of these share-based payments.
Profit for the year As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the year.
The Company reported a profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2013 of 54,000 2012: loss of 678,000.
