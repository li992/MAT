Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk The Groups assets include both fixed and floating rate loans and non-interest bearing equity investments.
The Groups operations are financed with a combination of its shareholders funds, bank borrowings, private placement notes, public bonds, and fixed and floating rate notes.
The Group manages its exposure to market interest rate movements by matching, to the extent possible, the interest profiles of assets and liabilities and by using derivative financial instruments.
As a result, the Group does not have material financial exposure to interest rate movements.
The sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is disclosed below.
The Groups sensitivity to movements is assumed by applying 100 basis points sensitivity to interest rates to the Groups forecast model, which is a change in methodology compared to the prior year.
Sensitivity to interest rate risk 2013 2012 Floating Fixed Total Floating Fixed Total m m m m m m Financial assets 1,376.6 1,616.0 2,992.6 1,393.3 1,215.0 2,608.3 Financial liabilities 1,030.8 404.2 1,435.0 607.6 497.0 1,104.6 The sensitivity of floating rate financial assets to the 100 basis points interest rate increase is 13.0m 2012: 13.9m and the sensitivity of financial liabilities to the same interest rate increase is 7.7m 2012: 6.1m.
There is no interest rate risk exposure on fixed rate financial assets or liabilities.
Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to currency risk in relation to the translation of net assets, currency transactions and the translation of net assets, and income statement of foreign subsidiaries.
The Groups most significant exposures are to the Euro and the US dollar.
Exposure to market currency risk is managed by matching assets with debt to the extent possible and through the use of derivative instruments.
The Group regards its interest in overseas subsidiaries as long term investments.
Consequently it does not normally hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the financial statements of these businesses.
The Group is also exposed to currency risk arising on the translation of fund management fee income receipts, which are primarily denominated in Euro and US dollar.
Fund management fee income is hedged to provide more certainty over the value of future cash inflows.
The sensitivity to movements in exchange rates is assumed by applying a percentage measure, based on the volatility of the applicable currency, as defined in the Groups Treasury Policy, to the net currency asset or liability at the balance sheet date.
The effect of fluctuations in other currencies is considered by the Directors to be insignificant in the current and prior year.
The methodology for calculating sensitivity was revised in the current year, however this is still in line with the Groups Treasury Policy.
The prior year sensitivity has been prepared on this revised model.
The net assets liabilities by currency and the sensitivity of the balances to foreign exchange rates are shown below: 2013 Net statement of Forward financial position exchange Sensitivity to exposure contracts Net exposure strengthening Impact m m m % m Sterling 208.4 1,668.7 1,460.3 Euro 1,340.6 1,240.4 100.2 15% 15.0 US dollar 136.8 92.7 44.1 20% 8.8 Other currencies 319.2 292.4 26.8 1,588.2 43.2 1,631.4 23.8 90 Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31 March 2013 continued 3.

Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining headroom on its financing facilities, particularly its bank facilities.
The table below shows the liquidity profile of the Groups financial liabilities, based on contractual repayment dates of principal and interest payments.
Future interest and principal cash flows have been calculated based on exchange rates and floating rate interest rates as at 31 March 2013.
It is assumed that Group borrowings under its senior debt facilities remain at the level as at 31 March 2013 until contractual maturity.

The Groups policy is to maintain continuity of funding.
Due to the long term nature of the Groups assets, the Group seeks to ensure that the maturity of its debt instruments is matched to the expected maturity of its assets.
This has been achieved by the ongoing private placement programme with notes maturing between one and five years, short term borrowings under bank facilities, two public bonds and by issuing floating and fixed rate notes.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group as a result of a counterparty failing to meet is contractual obligations.
This risk is principally in connection with the Groups loans and receivables due from portfolio companies.
This risk is mitigated by the disciplined credit procedures that the Investment Committee have in place prior to making an investment and the ongoing monitoring of that investment throughout its lifespan.
In addition, the risk of significant credit loss is further mitigated by Groups policy to diversify its investment portfolio in terms of geography and industry sector and to limit the amount invested in any single company.

Financial risk management continued Credit risk continued The Group minimises its surplus operational cash balance by the regular forecasting of cash flow requirements, debt management and cash pooling arrangements.
Credit risk exposure on cash and derivative instruments is managed in accordance with the Groups treasury policy which provides limits on exposures with any single financial institution.
The Directors consider the Groups credit exposure to trade and other receivables and current assets held for sale to be low and as such no further analysis has been presented.

This exposure is derived from the Groups investment portfolio being weighted towards Europe and in particular France.
This is reflective of the historical focus of the business, however the more recent investment pattern has been more geographically diverse.
The investment portfolio is not exposed to any single industry with investments diversified across sectors.

Impairment losses taken during the year reflect the decline in recoverability on individual assets, either as a result of company specific or general macroeconomic conditions.
The Directors believe that credit risk as a result of the concentration of significant counterparties is low as there is no individual counterparty comprising more than 10% of the Groups total exposure.
The Groups largest individual exposure at 31 March 2013 was 120.0m 2012: 109.7m to Mdi Partenaires, which has been repaid in full since the year end.

Capital management The primary objectives of the Groups capital management are to ensure that the Group complies with externally imposed capital requirements by the Financial Conduct Authority FCA and ensure that the Group maximises the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The Groups strategy has remained unchanged from the year ending 31 March 2012.
The capital structure comprises debts, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 22, cash and cash equivalents, and capital and reserves of the Parent Company, comprising called-up share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Consolidated statement of changes in equity.
The Group has complied with the imposed minimum capital throughout the year.
The full Pillar 3 disclosures are available on the Companys website www.

Profit of Parent Company As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the income statement of the Parent Company is not presented as part of these financial statements.
The Parent Companys profit for the year amounted to 97.8m 2012: 225.8m.
5. Business and geographical segments For management purposes, the Group is currently organised into two distinct business groups, the Fund Management Company FMC and the Investment Company IC.
Segment information about these businesses is presented below.
This is as reviewed by the Executive Committee, with the exception of 3.4m relating to gains on the investment in ICG Europe Fund V, which is presented below in fair value movements on financial assets.
This is included within Net interest income for internal reporting purposes.
The Group reports the profit of the FMC separately from the profits generated by the IC.
The FMC is defined as the operating unit and as such incurs the majority of the Groups costs, including the cost of the investment network, i. e. the Investment Executives and the local offices, as well as the cost of most support functions, primarily information technology, human resources and marketing.
The IC is charged a management fee of 1% of the carrying value of the investment portfolio by the FMC and this is shown below as Fee income.
The costs of finance, treasury, and portfolio administration teams and the costs related to being a listed entity are allocated to the IC.
The cost of the Medium Term Incentive Scheme MTIS was charged to the IC in 2012: the scheme is no longer operational.
The remuneration of the Managing Directors is allocated equally to the FMC and the IC.

Tax expense continued Throughout the duration of the MTIS scheme, a partial deferred tax asset was recognised based on estimations of future tax relief on cash flows under the scheme.
During the current period, the final cash payments were made in respect of the termination of the scheme, enabling the final tax position to be calculated.
This gave rise to a one off 9.0m credit to the tax charge.

Intangible assets continued Intermediate Capital Managers Limited, a subsidiary company, purchased an investment management contract from Resource Europe in December 2010 for 5.9m 5.1m.
The contract is expected to generate junior, senior and incentive fees over a four year term and was therefore capitalised, and is amortised over the contract term on a straight line basis.
Amortisation of investment management contracts is recognised in the income statement as an administrative expense.
Goodwill arose from the 51% equity share acquisition of Longbow Real Estate Capital in December 2010.
Total consideration of 4.3m was paid for nil net assets and liabilities.

Further reductions to the main rate have been proposed to reduce the rate to 21% from 1 April 2014 and 20% from 1 April 2015.
These further reductions in the tax rate had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and therefore are not reflected in these financial statements.
As at 31 March 2013 the Group has tax losses carried forward of 18.6m 2012: 11.8m.
It is not probable that these will be utilised and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised.

The total charge to the income statement for the year was 13.6m 2012: 13.1m and this was credited to the reserve in equity for share based payments.
