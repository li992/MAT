The impact of these overseas taxes on the overall rate of tax is shown above.
The Group is required under IFRS to create a deferred tax asset in respect of unrealised inter-company profit arising on inventory held by the Group at the year-end by applying the tax rate of the country in which the inventory is held rather than the tax rate of the country where the profit was originally made and the tax paid, which is the practice under UK and US GAAP.
As a result of this difference in accounting treatment the Group tax rate on current period inter-company profit under IFRS reduced by 1.8% in 2013 2012 1.1% increase: 2011 0.7% decrease arising from changes in the location of work-in-progress and finished goods.

152 GSK Annual Report 2013 14 Taxation continued Issues relating to taxation The integrated nature of the Groups worldwide operations involves significant investment in research and strategic manufacture at a limited number of locations, with consequential cross-border supply routes into numerous end-markets.
This gives rise to complexity and delay in negotiations with revenue authorities as to the profits on which individual Group companies are liable to tax.
Resolution of such issues is an ongoing requirement for GSK.
The Group continues to believe that it has made adequate provision for the liabilities likely to arise from periods which are open and not yet agreed by tax authorities.
The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of agreements with relevant tax authorities or litigation where appropriate.
The aggregate amount of unremitted profits at the balance sheet date was approximately 14 billion 2012 18 billion.
UK legislation relating to company distributions provides for exemption from tax for most repatriated profits, subject to certain exceptions.
Provision for deferred tax liabilities of 129 million 2012 109 million have been made in respect of withholding taxation that would arise on the distribution of profits by certain overseas subsidiaries.
The unprovided deferred tax on unremitted earnings at 31 December 2013 is estimated to be 500 million 2012 500 million, which relates to taxes payable on repatriation levied by overseas tax jurisdictions.
No further provision is made on the grounds that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the remaining temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

All other deferred tax movements arise from the origination and reversal of temporary differences.
Other net temporary differences mainly include accrued expenses for which a tax deduction is only available on a paid basis.
