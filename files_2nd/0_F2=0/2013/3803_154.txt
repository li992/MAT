The executive and management options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 7.0 years 2012: 6.6 years.
In the year, options were granted on 22 November 2012 and 16 May 2013 under the terms of the CSOP 2010.
The estimated fair value of options granted on these dates was 95.82 pence and 99.88 pence respectively.
In 2012, options were granted on 25 November 2011 and 17 May 2012.
The estimated fair value of these options was 104.85 pence and 84.11 pence respectively.
Fair values for the executive and management schemes were calculated using a binomial distribution option pricing model so that proper allowance is made for the presence of performance conditions and the possibility of early exercise.
In addition, a Monte Carlo simulation model was used to estimate the probability of performance conditions being met.
Fair values for options granted under employee savings-related schemes are calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The inputs to the option pricing models are reassessed for each grant.
The expected volatility is calculated with reference to weekly movements in the Compass share price over the three years prior to the grant date.
The following assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of options granted under the CSOP 2010: Assumptions options 2013 2012 Expected volatility 17.4% 22.3% Risk free interest rate 1.0% 1.0% Dividend yield 2.5% 3.2% Expected life 6.0 years 6.0 years Weighted average share price at date of grant 875.49p 621.82p Weighted average option exercise price 869.56p 624.03p vesting of options awarded from October 2005 onwards depends on the achievement of the Adjusted Free Cash Flow AFCF target.

The vesting probability of each element has been assessed based on a simulation model of the AFCF and ROCE growth forecasts.
The AFCF performance targets relating to LTIP awards made in the years commencing 1 October 2008 and 1 October 2009 were met in full and the maximum number of shares available were released to the participants.
The element of awards made in the years commencing 1 October 2008 and 1 October 2009 dependent upon TSR performance targets also vested in full and the maximum number of shares available were released to participants as the Companys TSR performance was within the top quartile of the comparator group.

Deferred Annual Bonus Plan Certain executives participate in the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan.
Each award comprises two elements.
Payment of a portion of the annual bonus awarded to these executives is deferred for three years.
The amount released on expiry of the deferral period may be increased subject to achievement of organic revenue, profit growth and personal performance targets.
Any amount paid in cash must be immediately reinvested in ordinary shares of the Company which must then be held for a qualifying period.
The second element of the award reflects the growth in the share price over the deferral period assuming that the deferred element of the annual bonus had been invested in ordinary shares of the Company at the start of the deferral period.
The fair value of the awards is determined by using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Any sum payable at the end of the deferral period is paid in cash.
The Group has recorded a liability of 1 million 2012: nil in respect of this plan.
Long Term Bonus Plan Certain executives participating in the Long Term Bonus Plan in prior years received an award of deferred Compass Group PLC shares.
The award of bonus shares is subject to performance conditions and matching shares may be released by the Company following the completion of a further period of service.
The terms of the Plan require that these shares are purchased in the market, rather than being issued by the Company.
The shares are purchased and distributed by the ESOP and LTIPT.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share bonus awards released during 2012 was 608.31 pence.
The share bonus awards have all vested, although certain executives have elected to defer taking their entitlements for a further period of up to 4.3 years 2012: 5.3 years, the weighted average deferral period being 1.8 years 2012: 2.8 years.
