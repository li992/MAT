NOTES 1 BASIS OF PREPARATION The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 have been approved by the directors and prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as referred to in the Financial review on page 29 and under the historical cost convention with the exception of certain items which are measured at fair value as disclosed in the accounting policies below.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
The Group has adopted the following new standards and amendments to standards, including any consequential amendments to other standards, with a date of initial application of 1 January 2013. International Accounting Standard IAS 19 revised 2011 Employee Benefits IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income Annual Improvements to IFRS 20092011 cycle With the exception of the revisions to IAS 19, these have not had a material impact on the Groups overall results and financial position.
Some of the prior year numbers have been restated following the adoption of IAS 19 revised 2011 Employee Benefits, which is effective for the 2013 financial year, as a result of which the expected return on assets and the interest charge on pension scheme liabilities have been replaced with a net finance cost based on the relevant discount rate.
For the year ended 31 December 2012 the impact has been to increase the net finance cost by 5.5m, to reduce profit before income tax by 5.5m and reduce profit after tax by 4.0m.
The actuarial loss has been reduced by 5.5m and the income tax credit on other comprehensive income has been reduced by 1.5m.
Basic earnings per share in 2012 decreased by 1.2p to 58.7p as a result.
For the acquisitions made in 2012, the fair value reallocation period remained open during 2013.
In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations the Group has adjusted in 2013 the fair values attributable to some of these acquisitions.
The balance sheet at 31 December 2012 has been revised accordingly see Note 24 for further details.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at fair value at the acquisition date.
The consideration paid or payable in respect of acquisitions comprises amounts paid on completion, deferred consideration and payments which are contingent on the continued employment of former owners of businesses acquired.
The excess of the consideration excluding payments contingent on future employment over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Payments that are contingent on future employment and transaction costs and expenses such as professional fees are charged to the income statement.
ii Associates Associates are entities over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method and are recognised initially at cost.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the income and expenses of associates.
iii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
b Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement, unless they qualify for cash flow or net investment hedge accounting treatment, in which case the effective portion is recognised directly in a separate component of equity.
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Income and expenses of foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates.
All resulting exchange differences, including exchange differences arising from the translation of borrowings and other financial instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised directly in a separate component of equity.
Differences that have arisen since 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are presented as a separate component of equity.
BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 77 NOTES CONTINUED 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED c Financial instruments Under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, financial instruments are initially measured at fair value with subsequent measurement depending upon the classification of the instrument.
IFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Other financial assets and liabilities are held at amortised cost unless they are in a fair value hedging relationship.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposures to foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
i Fair value hedge Where a derivative financial instrument is designated and qualifies as a hedge of a recognised asset or liability, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in fair value that is attributable to the risk being hedged with changes recognised in the income statement.
ii Cash flow hedge Where a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a hedge is used to hedge forecast transactions, any effective portion of the change in fair value is recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled to the income statement in the period when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
iii Hedge of a net investment in foreign operations Foreign currency differences arising on the retranslation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of a net investment in foreign operations are recognised directly in equity to the extent the hedge is effective.
To the extent that the hedge is ineffective such differences are recognised in the income statement.
d Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
e Depreciation Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis to write off cost less estimated residual value over the assets estimated remaining useful lives.
This is applied at the following annual rates: Buildings 2% or depreciated over life of lease if shorter than 50 years Plant and machinery 8%33% Fixtures, fittings and equipment 8%33% Freehold land Not depreciated The assets residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
f Intangible assets i Goodwill Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method.
As permitted by IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group has chosen to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations from 1 January 2004 and has elected not to restate previous business combinations.
For acquisitions made before 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the amount previously recorded under UK GAAP.
For acquisitions that occurred between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2009, goodwill represents the cost of the business combination in excess of the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
For acquisitions that have occurred on or after 1 January 2010, goodwill represents the cost of the business combination excluding payments contingent on future employment and acquisition related costs in excess of the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units and is tested annually for impairment.
Negative goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised immediately in the income statement.
ii Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised on acquisition and recorded at fair value.
These principally relate to customer relationships and are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful economic lives which range from 10 to 19 years.
g Leases Operating lease rentals and any incentives receivable are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased assets are classified as finance leases.
Where land and buildings are held under leases, the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings due to the indefinite life of land.
h Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets are reviewed annually to determine if there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amounts are estimated.
The recoverable amounts of assets carried at amortised cost are calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at appropriate pre-tax discount rates.
The recoverable amounts of other assets are the greater of their fair value less the costs to sell and the value in use.
In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present values using appropriate pre-tax discount rates.
Impairment losses are recognised when the carrying amount of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, with impairment losses being recognised in the income statement.
78 BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED i Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
j Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, bank overdrafts and short term deposits with maturities of three months or less from the date the deposit is made.
k Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated at cost less any impairment losses.
A provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables or uncertainty as to whether the Group will be able to collect all such amounts.
l Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are stated at cost.
m Income tax Income tax in the income statement comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except when it relates to items reflected in equity when it is recognised in equity.
Current tax reflects tax payable on taxable income for the year using rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and any adjustments in respect of prior years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method providing for temporary differences arising between tax bases and carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets and liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profits and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which any asset can be utilised.
n Revenue The Group is engaged in the delivery of goods to customers.
Revenue from a sale is recognised in the income statement upon delivery of the relevant goods, which is the point in time at which the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods are transferred.
Revenue is valued at invoiced amounts, excluding sales taxes, less estimated provisions for returns and trade discounts where relevant.
Returns provisions and early settlement discounts are based on experience over an appropriate period whereas volume discounts are based on agreements with customers.
Revenue is not recognised if there is significant uncertainty regarding recovery of the consideration due.
o Retirement benefit obligations i Defined contribution pension schemes Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged as an expense to the income statement as incurred.
ii Defined benefit pension schemes Pension liabilities are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet and represent the difference between the fair value of scheme assets and the present value of scheme liabilities.
Scheme liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis using the projected unit method and discounted using the rate applicable to AA rated corporate bonds that have a similar maturity to the scheme liabilities.
Current service cost, past service cost credit and gains and losses on any settlements and curtailments are credited or charged to the income statement.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent benefits are already vested.
Net interest on the net defined benefit liability is included within finance cost and comprises interest income on scheme assets and interest cost on the defined benefit obligation.
The net interest is calculated using the same discount rate that is used in calculating the defined benefit obligation, applied to the net defined liability at the start of the period.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement of comprehensive income.
p Investment in own shares The cost of shares held either directly treasury shares or indirectly employee benefit trust shares is deducted from equity.
Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from total equity.
When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is recognised in retained earnings.
At each reporting date the Group remeasures the value of the shares held in the employee benefit trust to present them in the own shares reserve at the market value of those shares at reporting date.
This is done through a reclassification from retained earnings to the own shares reserve.
This movement has no effect on the actual numbers of shares held by the employee benefit trust.
BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 79 NOTES CONTINUED 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED q Share based payments The Group operates equity settled share based compensation plans.
Details of these plans are outlined in Note 16 and the Directors remuneration report.
The total expected expense is based on the fair value of options and other share based incentives on the grant date calculated using a valuation model and is spread over the expected vesting period with a corresponding credit to equity.
r Provisions Provisions are recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and where it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting the Groups obligations under the contract.
s Net debt Net debt is defined as interest bearing loans and borrowings and the fair value of interest rate swaps on fixed interest rate borrowings, less cash and cash equivalents.
t Dividends The interim dividend is recognised in the consolidated statement of changes in equity in the period in which it is paid and the final dividend in the period in which it is approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES The following provides information on those policies that management considers critical because of the level of judgement and estimation required which often involves assumptions regarding future events which can vary from what is anticipated.
The directors review the judgements and estimates on an ongoing basis with revisions to accounting estimates recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are set out below.
The directors believe that the consolidated financial statements reflect appropriate judgements and estimates and provide a true and fair view of the Groups performance and financial position.
Where appropriate and practicable, sensitivities are disclosed in the relevant notes.
a Retirement benefit obligations The cost of defined benefit pension schemes and the present value of the obligations relating thereto are determined using actuarial valuations appropriate for each country where defined benefit pension schemes are provided.
The actuarial valuations involve making assumptions about discount rates, future salary increases, future pension increases and mortality rates.
All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
In determining the appropriate discount rates, management considers the interest rates of corporate bonds with an AA rating in the relevant country.
Future salary increases and future pension increases are based on expected future inflation rates for each country.
Mortality rates are based on the relevant mortality tables for each country.
Further details about the assumptions used are set out in Note 20. b Intangible assets IFRS 3 requires the identification of acquired intangible assets as part of a business combination.
The methods used to value such intangible assets require the use of estimates including forecast performance and customer attrition rates.
Future results are impacted by the amortisation periods adopted and changes to the estimated useful lives would result in different effects on the income statement.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
Tests for impairment are based on discounted cash flows and assumptions including discount rates, timing and growth prospects which are inherently subjective.
Further details about the assumptions used are set out in Note 9. c Acquisitions Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method based on the fair value of the consideration paid.
Assets and liabilities are measured at fair value and the purchase price is allocated to assets and liabilities based on these fair values.
Determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including discount rates, asset lives and recoverability.
Assets and liabilities are measured at fair value and the value of freehold properties is typically determined by qualified valuers on an open market basis.
d Tax The Group is subject to income taxes in a number of jurisdictions.
Management is required to make judgements and estimates in determining the provisions for income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised in the consolidated financial statements.
Tax benefits are recognised to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable income will be available in the future against which temporary differences and unused tax losses can be utilised.
80 BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS The Group is currently assessing the potential impact of other new and revised standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board that will be effective from 1 January 2014 and beyond.
Based on the analysis to date, the Group does not anticipate that these will have a material impact on the Groups overall results and financial position.

The Group is managed through four business areas based on geographic regions which represent the reporting segments under IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
The revenue presented relates to external customers.
Sales between the business areas are not material.
Each of the business areas supplies a range of products to customers operating primarily in the foodservice, grocery, cleaning & hygiene, non-food retail, safety and healthcare market sectors.
The performance of the four business areas is assessed by reference to operating profit before intangible amortisation and acquisition related costs and this measure also represents the segment results for the purposes of reporting in accordance with IFRS 8.
Debt and associated interest is managed at a Group level and therefore has not been allocated across the business areas.
In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 8, the Companys chief operating decision maker is the Board of Directors.
BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 81 NOTES CONTINUED 3 SEGMENT ANALYSIS CONTINUED Within each of the four business areas, there are a number of further segments based on geography and market sector.
These segments have been aggregated into the four business areas as shown above due to the similarity between them in terms of economic characteristics and also in respect of the nature of the products and services, types of customer and the methods used to distribute these products and services.
There are no customers who account for more than 10% of Group revenue.
Customer dependencies are regularly monitored.

However other firms are also used by the Company to provide non-audit services and it is the Companys policy to assess the services required on a case by case basis to ensure that the best placed adviser is retained.
The Audit Committee, which consists entirely of independent non-executive directors, reviews and approves the level and type of non-audit work which the external auditor performs, including the fees paid for such work, to ensure that the auditors objectivity and independence are not compromised.
Further information is set out in the Audit Committees report on pages 44 to 46.

84 BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 6 INCOME TAX CONTINUED Factors affecting the tax charge for the year The Group operates in many countries and is subject to income tax in many different jurisdictions.
The expected tax rate is calculated as a weighted average of the tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
The adjustments to the tax charge at the weighted average rate to determine the income tax on profit are as follows: 2013 2012 m m Profit before income tax 289.9 263.8 Tax charge at weighted average rate 2013: 31.4%: 2012: 31.7% 91.0 83.7 Effects of: gain on disposal not taxable 1.0 adjustment in respect of prior years 12.3 10.0 non-taxable and non-deductible items 1.6 1.3 other 2.8 1.1 Income tax on profit 83.1 72.5 2013 2012 Deferred tax in the income statement m m Accelerated capital allowances 1.0 0.6 Retirement benefit obligations 0.5 0.8 Intangible assets 12.4 11.2 Share based payments 1.5 0.1 Provisions 1.5 0.7 Other 3.1 8.4 Deferred tax on profit 8.8 2.2 UK tax rate change Following the enactment of legislation in the UK to reduce the corporation tax rate to 21% from 1 April 2014 and 20% from 1 April 2015, the UK deferred tax balances were reduced from 23% to 20%.
The impact on the tax expense for the year was negligible.

Adjusted profit, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude the charge for intangible amortisation, acquisition related costs, the profit on disposal of business and the respective associated tax.
The intangible amortisation, acquisition related costs, profit on disposal of business and the associated tax are items which are not taken into account by management when assessing the underlying performance of the business.
Accordingly, such items are removed in calculating the adjusted earnings per share on which management assesses the performance of the Group.

Both goodwill and customer relationships have been acquired as part of business combinations.
Customer relationships are amortised over their estimated useful lives which range from 10 to 19 years.
Impairment tests The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated across cash generating units CGUs.
A description of the Groups principal activities is set out in the Chief Executives review.
There is no significant difference in the nature of activities across different geographies.
The identification of CGUs reflects the way in which the business is managed on a geographical basis.
Given the similar nature of the activities of each CGU, a consistent methodology is applied across the Group in assessing CGU recoverable amounts.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the value in use and the fair value less the costs to sell.
The value in use is the present value of the cash flows expected to be generated by the CGU over a projection period together with a terminal value.
The projection period is the time period over which future cash flows are predicted.
The Groups methodology is to use a projection period of five years being the maximum period over which detailed future cash flows for each CGU are prepared.
For periods after this five year period, the methodology applies a long term growth rate to derive a terminal value.
Cash flow expectations exclude any future cash flows that may arise from restructuring or other enhancements to the cash generating activities of the CGU and reflect managements expectations of the range of economic conditions that may exist over the projection period.
The value in use calculations are principally sensitive to revenue growth, including any significant changes to the customer base, achievability of future margins and the discount rate used in the present value calculation.
The information used for valuation purposes takes into consideration past experience and the current economic environment with regard to customer attrition rates and additions to the customer base, the ability to introduce price increases and new products and experience in controlling the underlying cost base.
This provides a long term growth rate which is consistent with the geographic segments in which the Group operates and managements assessment of future operating performance and market share movements.
The growth rate has been calculated based principally on current inflation rates of the relevant economies.
At 31 December 2013 North America, France Hygiene and UK Hospitality carried a significant amount of goodwill in comparison with the total value of the Groups goodwill.
At 31 December 2013 the carrying value of goodwill in respect of North America was 233.5m 2012: 224.8m as reported: 217.6m revised on adjustment to provisional fair values on acquisitions made in 2012, see Note 24.
At 31 December 2013 the aggregate amount of goodwill attributable to the Groups CGUs, excluding North America, France Hygiene and UK Hospitality, was 531.9m 2012: 462.9m.
The remaining goodwill relates to CGUs which are not individually significant.
For North America, France Hygiene and UK Hospitality the weighted average growth rate used in 2013 was 2.5% 2012: 2.5%.
A discount rate of 9% 2012: 8% has been applied to the value in use calculations representing a pre-tax rate reflecting market assessments of the time value of money at the balance sheet date.
Similar assumptions have been applied to the other CGUs but where appropriate the directors have considered alternative market risk assumptions to reflect the specific conditions arising in individual countries with discount rates ranging from 9%18%.
BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 87 NOTES CONTINUED 9 INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions Impairment testing is dependent on managements estimates and judgements, particularly as they relate to the forecasting of future cash flows, the discount rates selected and expected long term growth rates.
A key assumption on which value in use calculations are dependent relates to revenue growth including the impact of changes to the underlying customer base.
This assumption is sensitive to customer attrition and the rate at which new customer relationships are introduced and established.
Based on past experience and taking into account current market conditions, management has concluded that it is reasonable to assume that there will be no material deterioration in the customer base over the projection period which will significantly impact future cash flows and that no reasonably possible change in key assumptions would result in impairment in any of the Groups CGUs.
Should such a change occur, this would represent a triggering event to indicate that an impairment review may be necessary.
In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, a full impairment review would then be undertaken on the relevant assets within the CGU.
Any such changes are monitored through normal monthly procedures.

13 RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Capital management The Groups policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Group monitors the return on average operating capital employed and the return on invested capital as well as the level of total shareholders equity and the amount of dividends paid to ordinary shareholders.
For the year ended 31 December 2013, the return on average operating capital employed was 56.9% 2012: 56.5%, revised on adjustment to provisional fair values on acquisitions made in 2012, see Note 24, the return on invested capital was 17.9% 2012: 17.9%, the level of total shareholders equity at 31 December 2013 was 939.9m 2012: 885.5m and the amount of dividends paid in the year ended 31 December 2013 was 91.8m 2012: 85.7m.
The Group funds its operations through a mixture of shareholders equity and bank and capital market borrowings.
All of the borrowings are managed by a central treasury function and funds raised are lent onward to operating subsidiaries as required.
The overall objective is to manage the funding to ensure the Group has a portfolio of competitively priced borrowing facilities to meet the demands of the business over time and, in order to do so, the Group arranges a mixture of borrowings from different sources with a variety of maturity dates.
The Groups businesses provide a high and consistent level of cash generation which helps fund future development and growth.
The Group seeks to maintain an appropriate balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
There were no changes to the Groups approach to capital management during the year and the Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Treasury policies and controls The Group has a centralised treasury department to control external borrowings and manage liquidity, interest rate and foreign currency risks.
Treasury policies have been approved by the Board and cover the nature of the exposure to be hedged, the types of financial instruments that may be employed and the criteria for investing and borrowing cash.
The Group uses derivatives to manage its foreign currency and interest rate risks arising from underlying business activities.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
The treasury department is subject to periodic independent review by the internal audit department.
Underlying policy assumptions and activities are periodically reviewed by the executive directors and the Board.
Controls over exposure changes and transaction authenticity are in place.
Hedge accounting The Group designates derivatives which qualify as hedges for accounting purposes as either a a hedge of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability: b a hedge of the cash flow risk resulting from changes in interest rates or foreign exchange rates: or c a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.
The accounting treatment for hedges is set out in the financial instruments accounting policy in Note 2.
The Group tests the effectiveness of hedges on a prospective and retrospective basis to ensure compliance with IAS 39.
Methods for testing effectiveness include dollar offset, critical terms and hypothetical derivatives.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group continually monitors net debt and forecast cash flows to ensure that sufficient facilities are in place to meet the Groups requirements in the short, medium and long term and, in order to do so, arranges borrowings from a variety of sources.
Additionally, compliance with debt covenants is monitored.
During 2013 all covenants have been complied with.
The Group has substantial borrowing facilities available to it comprising multi-currency credit facilities from the Groups banks and US dollar and sterling bonds.
An issue of fixed interest US dollar bonds of US$240.0m, which was agreed in 2012, was drawn down by the Group in April 2013.
At 31 December 2013 the total bonds outstanding were 607.1m 2012: 618.9m with maturities ranging from 2014 to 2024.
During the year the Group also refinanced or agreed new banking facilities totalling 264.2m.
The Groups committed bank facilities mature between 2014 and 2018.
At 31 December 2013 the available committed bank facilities totalled 886.7m 2012: 758.5m of which 273.1m 2012: 169.2m was drawn down.
BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 89 NOTES CONTINUED 13 RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED The undrawn committed bank facilities available at 31 December were as follows: 2013 2012 m m Expiring within one year 40.0 50.1 Expiring after one year but within two years 245.8 80.0 Expiring after two years 327.8 459.2 613.6 589.3 In addition the Group maintains overdraft and uncommitted facilities to provide short term flexibility.
At 31 December 2013 loans totalling 0.8m were secured by fixed charges on property 2012: 0.8m.
The contractual maturity profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at 31 December is set out in the tables below.
The amounts disclosed are the contractual undiscounted cash flows and therefore include interest cash flows forecast using LIBOR interest rates at 31 December in the case of floating rate financial assets and liabilities.
Derivative assets and liabilities have been included within the tables since they predominantly relate to derivatives which are used to manage the interest cash flows on the Groups debt.
Bank loans have been drawn under committed facilities and can be refinanced on maturity from these same facilities.
Accordingly they have been aged based on the maturity dates of the underlying facilities.
The tables below also compare the fair value and carrying amounts for financial assets and liabilities: Contractual cash inflows outflows After After Total one year two years After Carrying contractual Within one but within but within more than Fair value amount cash flows year two years five years five years 2013 m m m m m m m Financial assets: Cash and deposits 73.1 73.1 73.1 73.1 Loans and receivables Trade receivables 695.2 695.2 695.2 695.2 Derivative financial instruments Interest rate swaps 6.0 6.0 6.4 2.1 2.1 2.2 Foreign exchange contracts for net investment hedging 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 774.5 774.5 774.9 770.6 2.1 2.2 Financial liabilities: Financial liabilities at amortised cost Bank loans 285.5 285.4 294.6 14.8 4.1 275.7 US dollar and sterling bonds 635.7 607.1 761.3 58.2 61.2 258.8 383.1 Bank overdrafts 26.3 26.3 26.3 26.3 Other interest bearing loans and borrowings 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 Finance lease creditors 1.1 1.1 1.1 0.4 0.2 0.5 Trade payables 682.9 682.9 682.9 682.9 Other current payables 151.1 151.1 151.1 151.1 Non-current payables 22.7 22.7 22.7 22.7 Financial liabilities at fair value US dollar bonds Derivative financial instruments Cross currency interest rate swaps 9.2 9.2 9.5 5.3 4.2 Foreign exchange contracts for cash flow hedging 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 1,815.4 1,786.7 1,950.4 939.7 92.6 535.0 383.1 90 BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 13 RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Contractual cash inflows outflows After After Total one year two years After Carrying contractual Within one but within but within more than Fair value amount cash flows year two years five years five years 2012 m m m m m m m Financial assets: Cash and deposits 81.2 81.2 81.2 81.2 Loans and receivables Trade receivables 666.6 666.6 666.6 666.6 Derivative financial instruments Interest rate swaps 10.2 10.2 11.8 5.2 2.2 4.1 0.3 758.0 758.0 759.6 753.0 2.2 4.1 0.3 Financial liabilities: Financial liabilities at amortised cost Bank loans 175.7 175.7 180.4 56.7 1.6 122.1 US dollar and sterling bonds 528.9 472.2 659.4 117.6 62.8 278.3 435.9 Bank overdrafts 25.4 25.4 25.4 25.4 Other interest bearing loans and borrowings 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 Finance lease creditors 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.3 0.1 0.2 Trade payables 648.1 648.1 648.1 648.1 Other current payables 113.5 113.5 113.5 113.5 Non-current payables 26.4 26.4 26.4 26.4 Financial liabilities at fair value US dollar bonds 146.4 146.7 148.6 148.6 Derivative financial instruments Cross currency interest rate swaps 7.3 7.3 7.3 0.6 3.7 3.0 Foreign exchange contracts for cash flow hedging 0.8 0.8 0.8 0.8 Foreign exchange contracts for net investment hedging 2.7 2.7 2.7 2.7 1,676.1 1,619.7 1,813.5 879.1 94.6 403.9 435.9 Revised on adjustment to provisional fair values on acquisitions made in 2012 see Note 24.
All financial assets and liabilities stated at fair value in the tables above have carrying amounts where the fair value component is, and has been throughout the year, a level two fair value measurement.
Level two fair value measurements use inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the relevant asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
The fair values of both financial assets and liabilities are calculated by discounting expected future cash flows using observable inputs and translating at the appropriate balance sheet date exchange rates.
The Group has taken into account its own credit risk in the valuation of financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value.
Fair value gains and losses on interest rate caps impact the income statement immediately while all other financial assets and liabilities stated at fair value are in hedging relationships.
BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 91 NOTES CONTINUED 13 RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Interest rate risk The Group is funded by a mixture of fixed and floating rate debt.
In addition, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps are used to manage the interest rate risk profile.
At 31 December 2013 fixed rate debt of 607.1m 2012: 472.2m related to fixed rate US dollar and sterling bonds stated at amortised cost with maturities ranging from 2014 to 2024.
At 31 December 2013, floating rate debt was comprised of 273.1m floating rate bank loans 2012: 174.3m.
Bank loans are drawn for various periods of up to three months at interest rates linked to LIBOR.
The interest rate risk on the floating rate debt is managed using interest rate options.
Borrowings with a notional principal of 60.0m were capped at 31 December 2013 2012: 162.6m.
Hedge accounting is not applied to the interest rate caps since the majority of their value is related to time value.
The strike rates of these options are based on LIBOR repricing every three months.
After taking account of hedge relationships, a change of 1% in the interest rate forward curves on 31 December would have increased decreased profit before tax and equity for the year by the amounts shown below as a result of changes in the fair values of derivative assets and liabilities at that date: Impact on profit before tax Impact on equity 1% 1% 1% 1% m m m m 2013 0.6 0.1 0.6 0.1 2012 0.1 0.2 0.1 0.2 Foreign currency risk The majority of the Groups sales are made and income is earned in US dollars, euros and other foreign currencies.
The Group does not hedge the impact of exchange rate movements arising on translation of earnings into sterling at average exchange rates.
The following significant exchange rates applied during the year: Average rate Closing rate 2013 2012 2013 2012 US dollar 1.56 1.59 1.66 1.63 Euro 1.18 1.23 1.20 1.23 For the year ended 31 December 2013, a movement of one cent in the US dollar and euro average exchange rates would have changed profit before tax by 1.0m and 0.3m respectively 2012: 0.8m and 0.3m and profit before tax, intangible amortisation, acquisition related costs and disposal of business by 1.1m and 0.6m respectively 2012: 0.9m and 0.5m.
The majority of the Groups transactions are carried out in the respective functional currencies of the Groups operations and so transaction exposures are usually relatively limited.
Where they do occur the Groups policy is to hedge significant exposures of firm commitments for a period of up to one year as soon as they are committed using forward foreign exchange contracts and these are designated as cash flow hedges.
However, the economic impact of foreign exchange on the value of uncommitted future purchases and sales is not hedged.
As a result, sudden and significant movements in foreign exchange rates can impact profit margins where there is a delay in passing on to customers the resulting price increases.
For the year ended 31 December 2013 all foreign exchange cash flow hedges were effective with a loss of 0.7m recognised in equity 2012: loss of 0.8m which will affect the income statement during 2014.
The majority of the Groups borrowings are effectively denominated in sterling, US dollars and euros, aligning them to the respective functional currencies of the component parts of the Groups EBITDA.
This currency profile is achieved using short term foreign exchange contracts, long term cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency debt.
This currency composition minimises the impact of foreign exchange rates on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
Cross currency interest rate swaps in a cash flow hedge relationship were effective during the year with a loss of 0.4m 2012: loss of 1.1m being recognised in equity which will affect the income statement from 2014 to 2015.
92 BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 13 RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED The currency profile of the Groups net debt at 31 December is set out in the table below: 2013 2012 m m Sterling 292.7 198.7 US dollar 388.2 365.3 Euro 149.9 114.4 Other 18.7 59.7 849.5 738.1 If a 10% strengthening or weakening of sterling had taken place on 31 December it would have increased decreased profit before tax and equity for the year by the amounts shown below.
The impact of this translation is much greater on equity than it is on profit before tax since equity is translated using the closing exchange rates and profit before tax is translated using the average exchange rates for the year.
As a result the value of equity is more sensitive than the value of profit before tax to a movement in exchange rates on 31 December and the resulting movement in profit before tax is due solely to the translation effect on monetary items.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, and in particular interest rates, remain constant.
Impact on profit before tax Impact on equity 10% 10% 10% 10% m m m m 2013 0.7 0.8 71.6 87.5 2012 0.5 0.7 47.0 57.6 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of loss in relation to a financial asset due to non-payment by the counterparty.
The Groups objective is to reduce its exposure to counterparty default by restricting the type of counterparty it deals with and by employing an appropriate policy in relation to the collection of financial assets.
The Groups principal financial assets are cash and deposits, derivative financial instruments and trade and other receivables which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for cash and deposits Note 23, derivative financial instruments see page 90 and trade and other receivables Note 11 is their carrying amount.
Dealings are restricted to those banks with the relevant combination of geographic presence and investment grade rating.
The Group continually monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties and the credit exposure to each counterparty.
For trade and other receivables, the amounts represented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Note 11 sets out an analysis of trade and other receivables and the provision for doubtful debts in respect of trade receivables.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The properties provision includes provisions for vacant properties where amounts are held against liabilities for onerous lease commitments, repairs and dilapidations.
These provisions cover the relevant periods of the lease agreements, up to the earliest possible termination date, which typically extend from one to 10 years.
The Group has provisions for expected legal, environmental and other claims based on managements best estimate at the balance sheet date of the probable loss likely to be incurred.
It expects that these amounts, which are based on detailed plans or other known factors and take account of past experience for similar items, will be settled within the next one to five years.
The Group is a defendant in a number of legal proceedings incidental to its operations.
While any litigation has an element of uncertainty, management does not expect that the outcome of such proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial condition or results of operations.

The Company is able to control the dividend policy of its subsidiaries and, therefore, the timing of the remittance of the undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
In general, the Company has determined either that such earnings will not be distributed in the foreseeable future or, where there are plans to remit those earnings, no tax liability is expected to arise.
Deferred tax liabilities of 3.0m 2012: 2.5m has been recognised in the exceptional case where distribution of earnings is both planned and expected to result in a tax liability.
Deferred tax assets in respect of temporary differences have only been recognised in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences where it is probable that these assets will be realised.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of unutilised tax losses of 9.0m 2012: 5.3m.
The unutilised tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of unutilised capital losses of 96.1m 2012: 96.1m as it is not considered probable that there will be suitable future taxable profits against which they can be utilised.

Sharesave Scheme 2011 The Sharesave Scheme 2011, approved by shareholders at the 2011 Annual General Meeting, is approved by HM Revenue & Customs in the UK and is open to all UK employees, including UK based executive directors, who have completed at least three months of continuous service.
It is linked to a contract for monthly savings of up to 250 per month over a period of either three or five years.
Under the Sharesave Scheme 2011 options are granted to participating employees at a discount of up to 20% of the market price prevailing shortly before the invitation to apply for the option.
Options are normally exercisable either three or five years after they have been granted.
The Sharesave Scheme 2011 replaced the Sharesave Scheme 2001 which was approved by shareholders at the 2001 Annual General Meeting.
The Sharesave Scheme 2001 operates on a similar basis to the Sharesave Scheme 2011.
Although there are a number of options outstanding under the Sharesave Scheme 2001, no further options have been granted under this Scheme since it expired in May 2011. International Sharesave Plan The International Sharesave Plan was introduced following the approval of the Sharesave Scheme 2001 by shareholders and was extended following the approval of the Sharesave Scheme 2011.
The plan operates on a similar basis to both the Sharesave Scheme 2001 and the Sharesave Scheme 2011 as described above except that it is linked to a contract for monthly savings of approximately 250 per month or equivalent in other currencies over a period of three years.
Irish Sharesave Plan The Irish Sharesave Plan was also introduced following the approval of the Sharesave Scheme 2001 by shareholders and was extended following the approval of the Sharesave Scheme 2011.
It is approved by the Irish Revenue Commissioners and operates on a similar basis to both the Sharesave Scheme 2001 and the Sharesave Scheme 2011 as described above except that it is linked to a contract for monthly savings of the euro equivalent of approximately 250 per month over a period of three years.
1994 Executive Share Option Scheme 1994 Scheme The 1994 Scheme was approved by shareholders at the 1994 Annual General Meeting.
No further options have been granted under the 1994 Scheme since it expired in May 2004.
A performance condition, based on the Companys adjusted earnings per share growth relative to UK RPI inflation over three years, had to be satisfied before options would normally be exercisable.
All such performance conditions relating to options granted under the 1994 Scheme were satisfied.
As at 31 December 2013 no options remained outstanding under the 1994 Scheme.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP was approved by shareholders at the 2004 Annual General Meeting and replaced the 1994 Scheme.
The LTIP is divided into two parts.
Part A allows the Board to grant share options.
In normal circumstances options granted are only exercisable if the relevant performance condition has been satisfied.
Share options granted to date have a performance condition attached based on the Companys adjusted earnings per share growth relative to UK RPI inflation over three years.
Part B of the LTIP allows the Board to grant performance share awards which is a conditional right to receive shares in the Company for nil consideration.
A performance share award will normally vest i. e. become exercisable on the third anniversary of its grant to the extent that the applicable performance condition has been satisfied.
The extent to which performance share awards granted vest is normally partly subject to the Companys total shareholder return performance and partly subject to the Companys adjusted earnings per share growth relative to UK RPI inflation over three years.
The LTIP is due to expire in May 2014 and no further share options or performance share awards will be granted after that date.
A resolution will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting to adopt a revised LTIP to be known as the 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan 2014 LTIP.
Further details of the 2014 LTIP are set out in the Directors remuneration report.

98 BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 20 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The Group operates a number of retirement benefit schemes in the UK, the US and other countries including both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
The funds of the principal defined benefit schemes are administered by trustees and are held independently from the Group.
Pension costs of defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries.
Full triennial actuarial valuations were last carried out on the UK defined benefit schemes in April 2012 and annual actuarial valuations are performed on the principal US defined benefit schemes.
The valuation of the UK defined benefit schemes has been updated to 31 December 2013 by the Groups actuaries.
Contributions to all schemes are determined in line with actuarial advice and local conditions and practices.
Scheme assets for the purpose of IAS 19 are stated at their bid value.
Characteristics Europe The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes in Europe including the UK, France, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland.
The Groups principal defined benefit scheme in Europe is the UK scheme.
The UK defined benefit scheme is a contributory defined benefit pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The scheme has been closed to new members for over 10 years.
The UK scheme is an HMRC registered pension scheme and is subject to standard UK pensions and tax law.
This means that the payment of contributions and benefits are subject to the appropriate tax treatments and restrictions and the scheme is subject to the scheme funding requirements outlined in section 224 of the Pensions Act 2004.
In accordance with UK trust and pensions law, the pension scheme has a corporate trustee.
Although the Company bears the financial cost of the scheme, the responsibility for the management and governance of the scheme lies with the trustee, which has a duty to act in the best interest of members at all times.
The assets of the scheme are held in trust by the trustee who consults with the Company on investment strategy decisions.
A fide-risking strategy has been agreed for the scheme to reduce the mismatch between the assets and liabilities, whereby investments are switched from return seeking assets to liability matching assets as the funding improves, based on pre-agreed triggers.
The last triennial review was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 5 April 2012 and showed that there was a deficit on the agreed funding basis.
To address the deficit, the Company has agreed to contribute an additional 5.5m per year from April 2013 to March 2019.
In comparison, in the year to April 2013, the Company paid 5.3m in shortfall contributions.
US The US defined benefit scheme is a non-contributory defined benefit pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the scheme are held in trust by an independent custodian.
The US scheme is a qualified pension scheme and is subject to standard regulations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Pension Protection Act 2006 and the Department of Labor and Internal Revenue reporting requirements.
The scheme pays annual premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to insure the benefits of the scheme.
The Company has established a Retirement Scheme Investment Committee.
The members of the Committee are the scheme fiduciaries and as such are ultimately responsible for the management of the scheme assets.
The Committee performs the oversight function and will delegate the day-to-day management process to appropriate staff.
A registered investment adviser advises the Committee regarding the investment of scheme assets.
The last annual review was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 1 January 2013 and showed that there was a required annual contribution of 2.4m.
Bunzl plans to contribute 4.9m for the 2013 plan year to cover prudently this required contribution and anticipate future funding needs.
In comparison, in the 2012 plan year, Bunzl paid a contribution of 4.3m.
Risks The main risks to which the Company is exposed in relation to the defined benefit schemes are described below: Inflation risk the majority of the UK schemes liabilities increase in line with inflation and, as a result, if inflation is greater than expected the liabilities will increase.
The impact of high inflation is capped each year for the UK schemes benefits.
The US schemes liabilities are not directly tied to inflationary increases.
Interest rate risk a fall in bond yields will increase the value of the schemes liabilities.
A proportion of both the UK and US schemes assets are invested in liability matching assets to mitigate bond yield and inflation risk.
Mortality risk the assumptions adopted by the Company make allowance for future improvements in life expectancy.
However, if life expectancy improves at a faster rate than assumed, this would result in greater payments from the schemes and consequently increases in the schemes liabilities.
The mortality assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis to minimise the risk of using an inappropriate assumption.
Investment risk the schemes invest in a diversified range of asset classes to mitigate the risk of falls in any one area of the investments.
In the UK, the trustee implements partial currency hedging on the overseas assets to mitigate currency risk.
BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 99 NOTES CONTINUED 20 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED The risks above could lead to a material deficit in the schemes.
Given the long term time horizon of the schemes cash flows, the assumptions used are uncertain and can be volatile from year to year.
The Company and the trustees seek to mitigate actively the risks associated with the schemes.
A higher retirement benefit obligation could lead to additional funding requirements in future years.
Any deficit measured on a funding valuation basis, which may differ from the actuarial valuation under IAS 19, will generally be financed over a period that ensures the contributions are appropriate to the Group and in line with the relevant regulations.

Acquisitions involving the purchase of the acquirees share capital or the relevant assets of the businesses acquired, have been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting.
Part of the Groups strategy is to grow through acquisition.
The Group has developed a process to assist with the identification of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including the separate identification of intangible assets in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
This formal process is applied to each acquisition and involves an assessment of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with assistance provided by external valuation specialists where appropriate.
Until this assessment is complete, the allocation period remains open up to a maximum of 12 months from the relevant acquisition date.
At 31 December 2013 the allocation period for all acquisitions completed since 1 January 2013 remained open and accordingly the fair values presented are provisional.
104 BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 24 ACQUISITIONS CONTINUED Adjustments are made to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the allocation period to the extent that further information and knowledge come to light that more accurately reflect conditions at the acquisition date.
To date the adjustments made have impacted assets acquired to reflect more accurately the estimated realisable or settlement value.
Similarly, adjustments have been made to acquired liabilities to record onerous commitments or other commitments existing at the acquisition date but not recognised by the acquiree.
Adjustments have also been made to reflect the associated tax effects.
IFRS 3 requires that any payments that are contingent on future employment are charged to the income statement.
All other consideration has been allocated against the identified net assets, with the balance recorded as goodwill.
Transaction costs and expenses such as professional fees are charged to the income statement.
The acquisitions provide opportunities for further development of the Groups activities and create enhanced returns.
Such opportunities and the workforces inherent in each of the acquired businesses do not translate to separately identifiable intangible assets but do represent much of the assessed value that supports the recognised goodwill.
