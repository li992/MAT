The decrease in UK current tax in 2013 reflects the settlement of prior year tax matters.
indd 118 07 03 2014 11:25 Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2013 119 9 Taxation continued The net tax expense charged on profit before tax differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the weighted average of tax rates applicable to accounting profits and losses of the consolidated entities, as follows: Restated 2013 2012 m m Profit before tax 1,196 1,151 Tax at average applicable rates 280 244 Tax on share of results of joint ventures 10 7 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes and US state taxes 38 30 Non-taxable costs of share based remuneration 3 3 Non-deductible non-taxable disposal related gains and losses 22 69 Tax losses of the period not recognised 4 6 Recognition and utilisation of tax losses that arose in prior years 9 6 Exceptional prior year tax credit 96 Deferred tax credit on the alignment of business assets 221 Other adjustments in respect of prior periods 24 2 Deferred tax effect of changes in tax rates 4 1 Tax expense 81 102 The weighted average applicable tax rate for the year was 23% 2012 restated: 21%.
This increase is caused by a change in the relative profitability of Reed Elsevier entities in the countries in which they operate, partially offset by the impact of the reduction in the tax rate of the United Kingdom see below.
During 2013, Reed Elsevier aligned certain business assets with their global management structure.
As a result of this alignment the tax deductible value of these assets was updated to market value.
As at 31 December 2013, Reed Elsevier has recognised a deferred tax credit of221m in respect of these assets, which has been excluded from adjusted earnings.
During 2012, Reed Elsevier resolved a number of significant prior year tax matters and reassessed its exposure to other tax matters across the jurisdictions in which Reed Elsevier operates.
As a result of this reassessment, current tax liabilities were reduced by 96m to reflect the lower cash tax expected to be payable.
The following tax has been recognised directly in equity during the year: Restated 2013 2012 m m Tax on items that will not be reclassified to profit or loss Tax on actuarial movements on defined benefit pensions schemes 24 91 Tax credit on other items 5 24 96 Tax on items that may be reclassified to profit or loss Tax on fair value movements on cash flow hedges 15 19 15 19 Net tax debit credit recognised in other comprehensive income 39 77 Tax credit on share based remuneration recognised directly in equity 20 A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system, including reductions of the main rate of corporation tax from 23% to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014, and from 21% to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015, were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013.
Reed Elsevier has therefore remeasured its UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period at 20%, which has resulted in recognition of a deferred tax debit of 4m in the income statement.
