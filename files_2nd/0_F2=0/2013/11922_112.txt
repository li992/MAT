Intangible assets continued Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill continued The recoverable amount of each CGU is based on value in use calculations.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually.
Other than goodwill there are no intangible assets with indefinite lives.
The goodwill is generally denominated in the currency of the relevant cash flows and therefore the impairment review is not materially sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations.
Key assumptions The value in use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period.
The key assumptions used by management in the value in use calculations were: Discount rates The discount rate is based on the risk-free rate for government bonds, adjusted for a risk premium to reflect the increased risk in investing in equities.
The risk premium adjustment is assessed for each specific CGU.
The average pre-tax discount rates used are in the range of 10.7% to 13.8% for the Pearson Education businesses 2012: 9.8% to 12.7% and 11.3% for the Financial Times 2012: 11.5%.
Perpetuity growth rates A perpetuity growth rate of 2.0% was used for cash flows subsequent to the approved budget period for all CGUs in 2013 2012: 2.0%.
This perpetuity growth rate is a conservative rate and is considered to be lower than the long-term historic growth rates of the underlying territories in which the CGU operates and the long-term growth rate prospects of the sectors in which the CGU operates.
Cash flow growth rates The cash flow growth rates are derived from managements latest forecast of sales taking into consideration experience of operating margins achieved in the CGU.
Historically, such forecasts have been reasonably accurate.
Sensitivities The Groups impairment review is sensitive to a change in assumptions used, most notably the discount rates, the perpetuity growth rates and expected future cash flows.
Based on the Groups sensitivity analysis, a reasonably possible change in any of these assumptions is unlikely to cause an impairment in any of the CGUs.
