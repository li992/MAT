Financial statements Section 3: Operating profit and tax continued 3.5 Exceptional operating items continued Acquisition exceptional items Acquisition costs of 0.8m and aborted acquisition costs of 1.2m have been expensed as exceptional items.

These contracts entail minimum commitments for space rentals in excess of those foreseen to be necessary which exceed the economic benefits expected to be received and which have therefore been designated as onerous contracts.
Project CORE, the global Oracle ERP and business process outsourcing arrangement commenced for Europe at the start of 2014.
The one-off non-operating expenditure incurred during the year in the transition or provided as at 31 December 2013 in respect of redundancy payments are reported as an exceptional item.

3.6 Tax This note details the accounting policies applied for tax, the current and deferred tax charges or credits in the year, a reconciliation of profit before tax to the tax charge and the movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Accounting policy Current tax for the current and prior periods is recognised, to the extent unpaid, as a liability at the amount expected to be paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax liabilities are measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
However, deferred tax is not recognised on temporary differences arising from initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
Current tax expense and deferred tax expense are recognised in the income statement except to the extent they arise from a transaction or event recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Any such tax expense is recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity respectively.
The Group is a multi-national group with tax liabilities arising in many geographical locations.
This inherently leads to complexity in the Groups tax structure.
Therefore the calculation of the Groups current tax liabilities and tax expense necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority or, as appropriate, through a formal legal process.
The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Group and issues can, and often do, take many years to resolve.
The tax liabilities recognised in the financial statements are measured at the Directors estimate of tax that may become payable.
Payments in respect of tax liabilities for an accounting period result from payments on account and on the final resolution of open items.
As a result, there can be substantial differences between the tax charge in the income statement and tax payments.
The final resolution of certain of these items may give rise to material profit and loss and or cash flow variances.
Any difference between expectations and the actual future liability will be accounted for in the period identified.

These have been recognised as the Group expects to generate taxable profits against which these will be used.
The Group has the following unrecognised deferred tax assets relating to unused tax losses: 43.8m 2012: 45.4m in respect of UK subsidiaries which are available to offset against future UK corporate tax liabilities: 82.9m 2012: 94.8m in respect of US subsidiaries which are available to offset against future US federal tax liabilities.
Of these 82.2m expire between 2019 and 2033 2012: 93.6m between 2019 and 2032 : 46.4m 2012: 56.4m in respect of UK capital losses which are only available for offset against future capital gains: 2,082m 2012: 2,036m that have arisen in Luxembourg holding companies as a result of revaluations of those companies investments for local GAAP purposes: and 0.1m 2012: nil in respect of companies in other countries.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of any of these amounts as it is uncertain that these losses will be utilised.
In addition the Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets in relation to other deductible temporary differences of 35.1m 28.5m in relation to the US, 5.5m in relation to the UK and 1.1m in relation to other countries 2012: 50.3m 40.5m, 8.0m and 1.8m respectively.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect these assets as it is uncertain that they will be utilised.
At 31 December 2013, there was no deferred tax liability recognised for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of the Groups subsidiaries as the Group has determined that profits of subsidiaries will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised amount in aggregate to 4.2bn 2012: 4.2bn.
