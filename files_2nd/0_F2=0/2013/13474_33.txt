Within newly consolidated operations for 31 December 2012, US$2,678 million represents non-controlling interests in the non OT assets, of which US$1,439 million is the 49 per cent non-controlling interest in net loans receivable from Rio Tinto Group companies.
Refer to note 37. d Rio Tinto acquired a controlling interest in Richards Bay Minerals RBM in 2012, with consolidation effective from 3 September 2012 the acquisition date.

Refer to note 37. e The majority of the adjustments to equity held by Rio Tinto in 2012 arose from the acquisition by a consortium led by Chalco of shares in Simfer Jersey Limited, a Rio Tinto subsidiary, as set out in the Simandou Joint Development Agreement SJDA.
Chalco made a payment of US$1.35 billion on 24 April 2012 in exchange for an equity interest of 47 per cent in Simfer Jersey, reimbursing Rio Tinto for historic project costs.
The transfer on 24 April 2012 resulted in an adjustment to retained earnings attributable to owners of Rio Tinto of US$1.05 billion, relating to the amount received over Rio Tintos carrying value of the interest transferred.
f Equity issued to holders of non-controlling interests in 2012 include US$0.9 billion of proceeds from a rights offering by Turquoise Hill, and cash calls of US$480 million following the transfer described in e, which resulted in the Chalco consortium being issued with additional equity interest in proportion to its interest.
