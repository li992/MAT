These balances have been generated because a large part of the Companys income is derived from dividends which are no longer taxable.
Based on current UK tax law, the Company is not expected to generate taxable income in a future period in excess of deductible expenses for that period and, accordingly, is unlikely to be able to reduce future tax liabilities by offsetting these excess management expenses.
These excess management expenses are therefore not recognised as a deferred tax asset.

12 Related party transactions The following are considered to be related parties: Templeton Asset Management Ltd TAML Franklin Templeton Investment Management Limited FTIML The Directors of the Company All material related party transactions, as set out in International Accounting Standard 24 Related Party, have been disclosed in the Directors Report, Note 2 and Note 3.
Details of the remuneration of all Directors can be found on page 49.
Other funds managed by TAML may be investors in the same securities as the Company.
66 TEMPLETON EMERGING MARKETS INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 13 Risk management In pursuing the investment objectives set out on page 33 of this Report the Company holds a number of financial instruments which are exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction of the profits available for dividends.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are market risk which comprises market price risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk, other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing these risks, and the methods used to measure the risk, are set out below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the year to which these financial statements relate.
Investment and Concentration risk The Company may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of one issuer, securities domiciled in a particular country, or securities within one industry group than other types of fund investments.
As a result, there is the potential for increased concentration of exposure to economic, business, political or other changes affecting similar issues or securities, which may result in greater fluctuation in the value of the portfolio.
Market price risk Market risk arises mainly from uncertainties about future prices of financial instruments held.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Directors meet quarterly to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio in order to minimise the risk associated with particular countries or industry sectors whilst continuing to follow the investment objectives.
The Investment Manager has responsibility for monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet the risk reward profile on an ongoing basis.
The Investment Manager does not use derivative instruments to hedge the investment portfolio against market price risk, as in its opinion, the cost of such a process would result in an unacceptable reduction in the potential for capital growth.
Foreign currency risk Currency translation movements can significantly affect the income and capital value of the Companys investments as the majority of the Companys assets and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling, which is the Companys functional currency.
The Investment Manager has identified three principal areas where foreign currency risk could affect the Company: movements in rates affect the value of investments: movements in rates affect short-term timing differences: and movements in rates affect the income received.
The Company does not hedge the sterling value of investments that are priced in other currencies.
The Company may be subject to short-term exposure to exchange rate movements, for instance where there is a difference between the date an investment purchase or sale is entered into and the date on which it is settled.
The Company receives income in currencies other than sterling and the sterling values of this income can be affected by movements in exchange rates.
The Company converts all receipts of income into sterling on or near the date of receipt: it, however, does not hedge or otherwise seek to avoid rate movement risk on income accrued but not received.
TEMPLETON EMERGING MARKETS INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 67 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 13 Risk management continued The fair value of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31 March are shown below: 2013 Trade and Trade and Total net Investments at other Cash other foreign currency fair value through receivables at bank payables exposure profit or loss Currency 000 000 000 000 000 US dollar 2,311 957 994 2,274 539,341 Hong Kong dollar 472,492 Thai baht 2,024 2,024 337,620 Indonesian rupiah 43 43 234,552 Indian rupee 574 574 209,708 Turkish lira 1,314 1,314 162,180 Other 2,533 2,533 321,572 2012 Trade and Trade and Total net Investments at other Cash other foreign currency fair value through receivables at bank payables exposure profit or loss Currency 000 000 000 000 000 US dollar 1,529 1,529 540,328 Hong Kong dollar 457,295 Thai baht 1,591 1,591 267,749 Indonesian rupiah 110 110 193,555 Indian rupee 231 231 193,464 Turkish lira 120,839 Other 2,848 39 2,887 314,378 Sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and the equity in regard to the Companys monetary financial assets and liabilities and its equity if sterling had strengthened by 10% relative to all currencies on the reporting date, with all other variables held constant.
2013 2012 Capital Capital Revenue Return Revenue Return Financial Assets and Liabilities 000 000 000 000 US dollar 1,785 53,934 2,141 54,033 Hong Kong dollar 1,115 47,249 966 45,729 Thai bhat 903 33,762 855 26,775 Indonesian rupiah 434 23,455 415 19,356 Indian rupee 383 20,971 454 19,346 Turkish lira 679 16,218 361 12,084 5,299 195,589 5,192 177,323 A 10% weakening of the sterling against the above currencies would have resulted in an equal and opposite effect on the above amounts.
68 TEMPLETON EMERGING MARKETS INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 13 Risk management continued Interest rate risk The Company is permitted to invest in fixed rate securities.
Any change to the interest rates relevant to particular securities may result in either income increasing or decreasing, or the Investment Manager being unable to secure similar returns on the expiry of contracts or the sale of securities.
In addition, changes to prevailing rates or changes in expectations of future rates may result in an increase or decrease in the value of the securities held.
Interest rate risk prole The majority of the Companys financial assets are non-interest bearing equity investments.
The carrying amount, by the earlier of contractual re-pricing or maturity date, of the Companys financial instruments was as follows: Within Within one year one year 2013 2012 000 000 Cash flow interest rate risk Cash 20,255 7,024 Exposures vary throughout the year as a consequence of changes in the make up of the net assets of the Company.
Cash balances are held on call deposit and earn interest at the banks daily rate.
There were no exposure to fixed interest investment securities during the year or at the year end.
Liquidity risk The Companys assets comprise mainly of securities listed on the stock exchanges of emerging economies.
Liquidity can vary from market to market and some securities may take longer to sell.
As a closed ended investment trust, liquidity risks attributable to the Company are less significant than for an open ended fund.
The risk of the Company not having sufficient liquidity at any time is not considered by the Board to be significant, given the large number of quoted investments held in the portfolio and the liquid nature of the portfolio of investments.
The Investment Manager reviews liquidity at the time of making each investment decision and monitors the evolving liquidity profile of the portfolio regularly.
Investments held by the Company are valued in accordance with the accounting policies at bid price.
Other financial assets and liabilities of the Company are included in the balance sheet at fair value.
TEMPLETON EMERGING MARKETS INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 69 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 13 Risk management continued Credit risk Certain transactions in securities that the Company enters into expose it to the risk that the counter-party will not deliver the investment purchase or cash in relation to sale or declared dividend after the Company has fulfilled its responsibilities.
The Company only buys and sells through brokers which have been approved by the Investment Manager as an acceptable counter-party.
In addition, limits are set as to the maximum exposure to any individual broker that may exist at any time.
These limits are reviewed regularly.
The amount of credit risk that the Company is exposed to is disclosed under interest rate risk profile and represents the maximum credit risk at the Balance Sheet date.
The Company has an ongoing contract with its custodian JPMorgan Chase Bank for the provision of custody services.
As part of the annual risk and custody review, the Company reviewed the custody services provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank and concluded that while there are inherent custody risks in investing in emerging markets, the custody network employed by TEMIT has appropriate controls in place to mitigate those risks, and that these controls are consistent with recommended industry practices and standards.
Securities held in custody are held in the Companys name or to its accounts.
Details of holdings are received and reconciled monthly.
Cash is actively managed by Franklin Templeton Investments Trading Desk in Edinburgh and is typically invested in overnight time deposits in the name of TEMIT with an approved list of counterparties.
Any excess cash not invested by the Trading Desk will remain in a JPMorgan Chase Bank interest bearing account.
There is no significant risk on debtors and accrued income or tax at the year end.
Fair value Fair values are derived as follows: Where assets are denominated in a foreign currency, they are converted into the sterling amount using year-end rates of exchange.
Non-current financial assets on the basis set out in the accounting policies.
Cash at the face value of the account.
The tables below analyse financial instruments carried at fair value by valuation method.
The different levels have been defined as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included with level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly prices or indirectly derived from prices.
Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
