Serco Group plc | Annual report and accounts 2013 Financial statements Notes to the Consolidated Financ ial Statements 4.
Prior year restatement Changes in accounting policies IFRS 11 and the revisions to IAS 19 were adopted in 2013.
IFRS 11 removes the option for proportional consolidation of joint ventures and instead requires equity accounting.
The revisions to IAS 19 require the pension interest return to be calculated using the value of scheme assets multiplied by the discount rate rather than the expected rate of return.
Both of these changes were applied retrospectively, with the date of initial application being 1 January 2012, in accordance with the transition provisions of the individual standards and IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors.
Reallocation of costs In 2012 114m of costs previously included in administrative expenses have been reallocated to cost of sales, as in the view of the Group, this classification better reflects the underlying nature of these items.
