528 Guaranteed by HSBC Holdings or HSBC Bank plc The six capital securities guaranteed on a subordinated basis by HSBC Holdings or HSBC Bank are non-cumulative step-up perpetual preferred securities issued by Jersey limited partnerships.
The proceeds of the issues were on-lent to the respective guarantors by the limited partnerships in the form of subordinated notes.
These preferred securities qualify as tier 1 capital for HSBC Group and the two capital securities guaranteed by HSBC Bank also qualify as tier 1 capital for HSBC Bank on a solo and a consolidated basis.
These preferred securities, together with the guarantee, are intended to provide investors with economic rights equivalent to the rights that they would have had if they had purchased non-cumulative perpetual preference shares of the relevant issuer.
There are limitations on the payment of distributions if such payments are prohibited under UK banking regulations or other requirements, if a payment would cause a breach of HSBCs capital adequacy requirements or if HSBC Holdings or HSBC Bank have insufficient distributable reserves as defined.
HSBC Holdings and HSBC Bank have individually covenanted that if prevented under certain circumstances from paying distributions on the preferred securities in full, they will not pay dividends or other distributions in respect of their ordinary shares, or effect repurchases or redemptions of their ordinary shares, until the distribution on the preferred securities has been paid in full.
With respect to preferred securities guaranteed by HSBC Holdings if i HSBCs total capital ratio falls below the regulatory minimum ratio required, or ii the Directors expect, in view of the deteriorating financial condition of HSBC Holdings, that i will occur in the near term, then the preferred securities will be substituted by preference shares of HSBC Holdings which have economic terms which are in all material respects equivalent to those of the preferred securities and the guarantee taken together.
With respect to preferred securities guaranteed by HSBC Bank if i any of the two issues of preferred securities are outstanding in April 2049 or November 2048, respectively, or ii the total capital ratio of HSBC Bank on a solo and consolidated basis falls below the regulatory minimum ratio required, or iii in view of the deteriorating financial condition of HSBC Bank, the Directors expect ii to occur in the near term, then the preferred securities will be substituted by preference shares of HSBC Bank having economic terms which are in all material respects equivalent to those of the preferred securities and the guarantee taken together.
