b Defined benefit plan As a consequence of the Groups acquisition of Zoran on 31 August 2011, the Group has assumed the obligation for a defined benefit plan in CSR Israel Ltd formerly Zoran Microelectronics Limited.
Under Israeli law, there is a requirement to make severance payments to all employees who leave a company involuntarily.
There is no such requirement for those employees who leave the company voluntarily.
Severance payments are calculated based on varying factors, namely the length of employee service and salary and are funded entirely by individual investment funds held in the name of the employee by the Group.
The Group does not hold a central fund to finance this obligation.
Where there are insufficient funds in these investment funds to meet involuntary severance obligations, there is a legal obligation for the Company to finance this shortfall.
This therefore meets the definition of a post employment benefit and more specifically a defined benefit plan, under IAS 19.
The obligation for the company to make up the shortfall in severance payments of this nature is restricted to employees who joined the Company prior to 2007.
Though there is no obligation for the Company to make severance payments for employees leaving voluntarily, the assets accumulated in the employees fund are returned to the employee when leaving the Company.
Severance payments to employees who joined subsequent to 2007, have been accounted for as a defined contribution employment plan.
The valuation of the deficit in the balance sheet is based on the most recent actuarial valuation of the Plan as updated to take account of the market value of the assets and the present value of the liabilities of the Plan at 27 December 2013.
