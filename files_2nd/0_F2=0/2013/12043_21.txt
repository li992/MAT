Strategic Report Governance Financials Other information Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2013 69 Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 1 Adoption of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs andInterpretations IFRICs The following new standards and amendments to standards are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1January 2013: t Amendments to IAS 19: Employee Benefits t Amendments to IAS 1: Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income t Amendments to IFRS 13: Fair Value Measurement t Amendments to IFRS 7: Financial Instruments: Disclosures Offsetting Financial Assets and Liabilities t Annual improvements to IFRSs 20092011 Cycle With the exception of IAS 19: Employee Benefits the effects of the implementation of these standards have been limited to disclosure amendments.
The amendments to IAS 19 affect the allowable actuarial assumptions in calculation of the annual expense of defined benefit pension schemes.
In particular the actuarial assumptions in relation to asset returns are limited to the discount rate applied to liabilities.
As a result of the changes the accounting charge for the year ended 31 December 2012 for both the Group and the Company has been increased by 3.6m.
Basic earnings per share for 2012 have been restated and reduced by 0.9p per share as aresult.
Were the previous IAS 19 requirements applied to the year ended 31 December 2013 we estimate profit before tax would have been 5.4m higher, with basic earnings per share increased to 86.0p.
In implementing these changes the Group has also reviewed its accounting policies in relation to the expensing of defined benefit pension scheme costs.
Previously all expenses in relation to provision of long term employee benefits were charged as anoperating expense.
However, to more appropriately reflect the nature of the costs the Group will now charge credit the net finance cost income element of such benefits as a finance expense income.
Following this change and reflecting the increased net finance cost reduced net finance income associated with Amendment to IAS 19: Employee Benefits 2.9m of expense has been reclassified for the year ending 31December 2012 2013: 0.1m income.
As required equal adjustments have been made to the remeasurement gains and losses within other comprehensive income expense.
Shareholders equity remains as previously reported as do the previously reported balance sheets.
The Group has not applied the following amendments to standards which are EU endorsed but not yet effective: t IFRS 10: Consolidated Financial Statements t IFRS 11: Joint Arrangements t IFRS 12: Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities t IAS 27: Separate Financial Statements t IAS 28: Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures t Amendments to IAS 32: Financial Instruments: Disclosures Offsetting Financial Assets and Liabilities t Amendments to IAS 36: Recoverable Amount Disclosures for non-Financial Assets t Amendments to IAS 39: Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting The Group is currently considering the implication of these standards, however it is anticipated the impact of these standards on the financial position and performance of the Group will be minimal and effects will principally relate to amendment and extension of current disclosures.
2 Accounting policies Statement of compliance Both the consolidated Group and Parent Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS including International Accounting Standards IAS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable tocompanies reporting under accounting standards as adopted for use in the EU.
Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2013 70 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2 Accounting policies continued Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of certain non-current assets and financial instruments.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for assets.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position areset out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 33.
The financial position ofthe Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described onpages 19 to 27 of the Strategic Report.
Further disclosures regarding borrowings are provided in note 20 to the financial statements.
Inaddition, note 22 to the financial statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial riskmanagement objectives: details of its financial instruments andhedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Directors have assessed the future funding requirements ofthe Group and the Company and compared it to the level of committed bank facilities and cash resources over the medium term.
The assessment included a review ofthefinancial forecasts andthe preparation ofsensitivity analysis on the key factors which could affect future cash flow andfunding requirements.
The Groups policy on funding capacity is to ensure that it always has sufficient committed bank facilities in place to meet foreseeable peak working capital requirements.
At31December 2013 the Group had cash and depositsof 204.3m and 300.0mof undrawn committed bank facilities available to meet future funding requirements.
At31December 2013, the net cash position of the Group was 204.3m note 26.
Having undertaken this review, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to fund its operations forthe foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue toadopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries up to 31December each year.
Theresults of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year, are included in the consolidated financial statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those usedby the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method.
The subsidiarys identifiable assets, liabilities andcontingent liabilities are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value ofthe identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity at the date of the acquisition.
Goodwill arising on acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses is capitalised as an asset.
Goodwill allocated to the strategic land holdings is recognised as an asset, being the intrinsic value within these holdings in the acquired entities, which is realised upon satisfactory planning permission being obtained and sale of theland.
Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is assessed for impairment at each reporting date by performing a value in use calculation, using a discount factor based on the pre-tax rate implicit in current market transactions of similar assets, covering the expected period of realisation and considering current market conditions.
It is tested by reference to the proportion oflegally completed plots in the period compared to the total plots which are expected to receive satisfactory planning permission in the remaining acquired strategic land holdings, taking account of historic experience and market conditions and comparing the carrying value of the assets with their recoverable amounts.
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSshas been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment.
The allocation of this goodwill for impairment testing is disclosed in note 14.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit orloss on disposal.
Strategic Report Governance Financials Other information Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2013 71 2 Accounting policies continued Brand intangibles Internally generated brands are not held on the balance sheet.
TheGroup carries assets on the balance sheet only for brands that have been acquired.
Acquired brand values are calculated based ondiscounted cash flows.
No amortisation is charged on brand intangibles, as the Group believes that the value of the brands is maintained indefinitely.
The factors that result in the durability of the brands capitalised are that there are no material legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of these intangibles.
The acquired brands are tested annually for impairment by performing a value in use calculation, using a discount factor based on the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital, on the branded incremental income stream.
Where a brands life is not deemed to be indefinite it is written off over its expected useful life on a straight-line basis.
Revenue recognition Revenue in respect of the sale of residential properties is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable on legal completion.
The sales proceeds of part exchange properties are included as a reduction in cost of sales.
Government grants Grants are included within work in progress in the balance sheet andare credited to the statement of comprehensive income over thelife of the developments to which they relate.
Grants related to income are deducted from the related expense in the statement ofcomprehensive income.
Other operating income Other operating income comprises profits from the sale of land holdings, freehold reversions, rent receivable, and other incidental sundry income.
Operating expenses Operating expenses represent the administration costs of the business, which are written off to the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
Borrowing costs Interest bearing bank loans, overdrafts and Partnership liabilities are initially measured at fair value being proceeds received, net of direct issue costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Finance charges, including direct issue costs are accounted for and taken to the statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Where bank agreements include a legal right of offset for in hand andoverdraft balances, and the Group intends to settle the net outstanding position, the offset arrangements are applied to record the net position in the balance sheet.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are items of income and expenditure that, in the judgement of management, should be disclosed separately on the basis that they are material, either by their nature or their size, to an understanding of the financial performance and significantly distort the comparability of financial performance between accounting periods.
Items of income or expense that are considered by management for designation as exceptional include such items as major restructuring and significant impairment of assets.
Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2013 72 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2 Accounting policies continued Share-based payment Charges for employee services received in exchange for share-based payment have been made for all options awards in accordance with IFRS 2: Share-based Payment, to spread the fair value of the grant over the vesting period.
The fair value of such options has been calculated using generally accepted option pricing models, based upon publicly available market data at the point of grant.
Share options include both market and non-market conditions.
Market conditions are considered in the establishment of the initial valuation of the options.
In the event of failure to meet market conditions share-based payment charges are not reversed.
In the event of failure to meet non-market conditions share-based payment charges are reversed.
Share-based payments are charged wholly in the ultimate Parent Company, which makes internal recharges to subsidiaries forthese services as appropriate.
Retirement benefit costs The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes.
It also operates a defined contribution scheme for employees who are not members of a defined benefit scheme.
The asset liability in respect of the defined benefit schemes is thepresent value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheetdate, less the fair value of the schemes assets, together with adjustments for remeasurement gains and losses.
Where a net asset results it is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of future refunds from the scheme or reductions in future contributions, subject to any minimum funding requirements.
Further details of the schemes and the valuation methods applied may be found in note29.
Interest cost on the scheme liabilities and finance returns on scheme assets are recognised at the applicable discount rate as net finance income costs in the statement of comprehensive income and remeasurement gains and losses via the statement of other comprehensive income.
Subsidiary entities bear a charge for current employees based upontheir current pensionable salaries.
Differences between this charge and the current service cost are borne by the Company as the legal sponsor, as are all experience gains andlosses.
There is no contractual arrangement or stated policy for recharging the other Group entities involved in the Scheme.
Payments to the defined contribution scheme are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Once the payments have been made, theGroup has no further payment obligations.
Taxation Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised inequity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates, andadjusted for any tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting or taxable profit, and differences relating to investment in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using the tax rates applicable, or expected to be applicable at the date of settlement, based on enacted rates at the reporting date.
Where the deferred tax asset recognised in respect of share-based payments would give rise to a credit in excess of the related accounting charge at the prevailing tax rate the excess is recognised directly in equity.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset canbe utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Leases as lessee Amounts payable under operating leases are charged to work in progress or operating expenses on a straight line accruals basis over the lease term.
Strategic Report Governance Financials Other information Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2013 73 2 Accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment It is the Groups policy to hold property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation, subject to the requirement to test assets for impairment.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is provided using the straight line method to write off the cost less any estimated residual value, over the estimated useful lives on the following bases: Plant 3 to 5 years.
Fixtures and fittings 3 to 5 years.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
The assets useful economic lives and residual values are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each financial year end.
Animpairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
Investments Interests in subsidiary undertakings are valued at cost less impairment.
Other investments are stated at fair value.
Jointly controlled entities A jointly controlled entity is an entity in which the Group holds an interest with one or more other parties where a contractual arrangement has established joint control over the entity.
Investments in jointly controlled entities are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
Available for sale financial assets Receivables on extended terms granted as part of a sales transaction are secured by way of a second legal charge on the respective property, and are stated at fair value as described in note 17.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in the other comprehensive income section of the statement of comprehensive income, with the exceptions of impairment losses, changes in future cash flows and interest calculated using the effective interest rate method, which are recognised within profit for the year.
Where the asset is disposed of, or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or losspreviously recognised in other comprehensive income is included in the income statement for the period.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Land with planning includes undeveloped land and land under development and is initially recorded at discounted cost.
Where, through deferred purchase credit terms, the carrying value differs from the amount that will ultimately be paid in setting the liability, this difference is charged as a finance cost in thestatement of comprehensive income over the period of settlement.
Work in progress comprises direct materials, labour costs, site overheads, associated professional charges and other attributable overheads.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling prices less all estimated costs of completion and overheads.
Investments in land without the benefit of a planning consent are initially included at cost.
Regular reviews are carried out to identify any impairment in the value of the land considering the existing use value of the land and the likelihood of achieving aplanning consent and the value thereof.
Provision is made to reflect any irrecoverable amounts.
Expenditure relating to forward land, including options and fees, is held at cost.
If the option expires or the Directors no longer consider it likely that the option will be exercised prior to the securing of planning permission, the amount is written off on thatdate.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables on normal terms do not carry any interest, are stated at amortised cost and are assessed for recoverability on anongoing basis.
Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2013 74 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2 Accounting policies continued Inter-Group guarantees Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within theGroup, theCompany considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats theguarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will berequired to make a payment under the guarantee.
Trade and other payables Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at amortised cost.
Trade payables on extended terms, particularly in respect of land purchases, are initially recorded at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Deposits New property deposits and on account contract receipts are held within current trade and other payables until the legal completion of the related property or cancellation of the sale.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash and balances in the bank accounts with no notice or less than three months notice from inception, and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Interest bearing borrowings Interest bearing borrowings and Partnership liabilities are carried at amortised cost.
Dividends Dividends receivable from subsidiaries are accounted for on a cashbasis, or once formally approved by the shareholders of the subsidiarycompanies.
Dividends payable are recorded in the period in which they are approved or paid, whichever is earliest.
Own shares held The Group may acquire holdings in its own shares either directly orviaemployee benefit trusts.
The acquisition cost of suchshares including associated purchase costs is treated as a deduction fromretained earnings.
Such shares may be used insatisfaction of employee options or rights, in which case the cost of such shares is reversed from the profit reserves on afirstinfirst out basis.
Strategic Report Governance Financials Other information Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2013 75 3 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In applying the Groups accounting policies which are described in note 2, the Directors have made no individual judgements that have asignificant impact upon the financial statements, excepting those involving estimation which are dealt with below.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet dateare: Land and work in progress Valuations which include an estimation of costs to complete and remaining revenues are carried out at regular intervals throughout the year, during which site development costs are allocated between units built in the current year and those to bebuilt in future years.
These assessments include a degree of inherent uncertainty when estimating the profitability of a site and in assessing any impairment provisions which may be required.
During the year ended 31 December 2012, the Group conducted a review of inventories in the light of the challenging UK housing market.
This resulted in a net reversal of previous write downs of inventory carrying values of 2.8m.
During the year ended 31December 2013, the Group conducted further reviews of the net realisable value of its inventory carrying values which resulted in a further net reversal of theprevious write downs of inventories of 14.1m.
The reviews were conducted on asite by site basis, using valuations that incorporated selling price and development cost movements, based onlocal management and the Boardsassessment of market conditions existing at the balance sheet date.
Ifthere are significant movements in UK house prices or development costs beyond managements expectations then further impairments reversals of previous write downs of land and work in progress may be necessary.
Available for sale financial assets Available for sale financial assets, also known as shared equity receivables, principally comprise loans granted aspart of sales transactions that are secured by way of a second legalcharge on the respective property.
Asset valuation and impairment allowances are determined on a portfolio basis which takes into account factors such as the length of time that the loan has been outstanding, market conditions, including those in respect of house price inflation, forced sale discount and probability of borrower default.
The variables used are kept under regular review to ensure that as far as possible they reflect current economic circumstances: however changes in house prices, redemption dates, interest rates, unemployment levels and bankruptcy trends in the UK could result in actual returns differing from reported valuations.
At 31 December 2013 the asset recognised on the balance sheet was 215.4m 2012:202.9m.
Goodwill The impairment testing of goodwill is substantially dependent upon the ability of the Group to successfully progress its strategic land holdings.
The assumptions on which this estimate is based may beundermined by any significant changes inthecurrent planning regime, or adverse economic conditions in the United Kingdom.
Thecarrying amount of goodwill atthe balance sheet date was 177.9mwith an impairment of 6.6m recognised during the year.
Brand intangibles The intangible brand assets have been assessed against the discounted cash flows arising.
These are based upon estimated returns from the related businesses, which may be impacted by various factors, most notably Government social housing policy andfurther deterioration in the economic conditions in the United Kingdom.
The carrying amount of indefinite life brands at the balance sheet date was 60.0m, with no impairment recognised during the year ended 31 December 2013.
Pensions The Directors have employed the services of a qualified, independent actuary in assessing pension assets liabilities.
However, they recognise that final liabilities and asset returns may differ from actuarial estimates and therefore the ultimate pension asset liability may differ from that included in the financial statements.

37.0m 2012: 37.0m of this amount represented the brand value of Charles Church, acquired with Beazer Group plc in 2001.
Acquired brand values, including the brand value of Charles Church which is classified as goodwill as this was acquired beforethe date oftransition to IFRSs, are calculated based on discounted cash flows and are tested annually for impairment.
Theremainder of goodwill isallocated to acquired strategic land holdings and is tested annually for impairment.
The recoverable amounts of the intangibles are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for value inusecalculations are those regarding discount and growth rates.
Growth rates incorporate volume, selling price and direct costchanges.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management and extrapolated for fouryears, to form the basis of the Groups five year business plan.
When performing the impairment review ofthe brands, the relevant retraction growth rates included therein vary between 3% to 2% 2012: 4% to 3%, reflecting the current state of the UK housing market.
The retraction growth rates in relation to the impairment review of goodwill allocated to strategic land holdings vary between 3% to 2% 2012:2% to 3%.
After this period the growth rates applied to calculate the cash flow forecasts vary between nil and 2% 2012: nil and 3% reflecting managements estimate of the forecast recovery in the UK housing market, which do not exceed the long term average growth rates for the industry.
Management used pre-tax discount factors between 5% and 10% 2012: 5% and 8% over the forecast periods.
Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2013 82 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 14 Intangible assets continued The goodwill allocated to acquired strategic land holdings is further tested by reference to the proportion of legally completed plots in the period compared to the total plots which are expected to receive satisfactory planning permission in the remaining strategic land holdings, taking account of historic experience and market conditions.
This review resulted in an underlying impairment of 6.6m 2012: 5.4m.
This charge reflects ongoing consumption of the required strategic land holdings by the business once satisfactory planning permission has been received.
The effect of testing goodwill for impairment in the manner set out is that the goodwill willbe completely impaired once the final plot that management expects to receive asatisfactory planning permission, is sold.
On concluding the annual impairment testing, there remains 108.2m 2012: 113.1m and 32.7m 2012: 34.4m of Beazer and Westbury goodwill allocated to strategic land holdings and 37.0m 2012: 37.0m allocated to the Charles Church brand.
Inaddition, there is 60.0m 2012: 60.0m of carrying value in relation to the Westbury brand.
Acquired know-how is amortised over its estimated useful life, which is ten years from the date of its inception.
No reasonable possible change in any of the assumptions noted above would lead to an impairment charge being required.
However, in the event of deterioration in the UK housing market conditions, operating margins reducing, orappropriate discount rates increasing the possibility of impairment losses in the future remains.

Available for sale financial assets, also known as shared equity receivables, comprise loans, largely with a ten-year term and variable repayment amounts, provided as part of sales transactions that are secured by way of a second legal charge on the related property.
Loans are repayable at the borrowers option on sale or transfer of the related property or other redemption of the first legal charge orat the end of the fixed term.
Theassets are recorded at fair value, being the estimated future amount receivable by the Group, discounted to present dayvalues.
The fair value of future anticipated cash receipts takes into account the Directors view of future house price movements, the expected timing of receipts and the likelihood that a purchaser defaults on a repayment.
TheDirectors revisitthe future anticipated cash receipts from the assets at the end of each financial reporting period.

Credit risk, which theDirectors currently consider to be largely mitigated through holding a second legal charge over the assets, is accounted for in determining fair values and appropriate discount factors are applied.
The Directors review the financial assets for impairment at each balance sheet date.
There were no indicators of impairment at 31 December 2013 2012: nil.
None of the financial assets are past their due dates 2012: nil and the Directors expect an average maturity profile of between5 and 10 years from the balance sheet date.
Further disclosures relating to financial assets are set out in note 22.
18 Inventories 2013 2012 m m Land 1,636.6 1,495.7 Work in progress 463.5 443.1 Part exchange properties 45.5 58.6 Showhouses 49.3 53.6 2,194.9 2,051.0 The Directors consider all inventories to be essentially current in nature although the Groups operational cycle is such that aproportion of inventories will not be realised within 12 months.
It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this issubject to a number of issues, including consumer demand and planning permission delays.
As set out in note 6, the Group conducted a further review of the net realisable value of its land and work in progress portfolio during 2013.
Theimpact of these reviews on the net realisable value of inventories is a net exceptional credit to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income of14.1m 2012: 2.8m.
A reversal of 22.0m 2012: 23.8m on inventories that were written down in a previous accounting period and an impairment of land and work in progress of 7.9m 2012: 21.0m were recognised in the year.
This reversal charge arose due to forecast selling prices and development costs on individual sites being higher or lower than previously estimated by management as a result of changing conditions, and or development plans.
Our approach toour net realisable value review has been consistent with that conducted at 31 December 2012.
Net realisable provisions held against inventories at 31 December 2013 were 102.8m 2012: 151.3m.
The key judgements in estimating the future net present realisable value of a site was the estimation of likely sales prices, house types and costs to complete the developments.
Sales prices and costs to complete were estimated on a site by site basis based upon existing market conditions.
If the UK housing market were to improve or deteriorate in the future then further adjustments to the carrying value of land and work in progress may be required.
Following the 2013 review, 139.0m 2012: 234.5m of inventories are valued at fair value less costs to sell rather than at historical cost.
Land with a carrying value of 528.6m 2012: 394.7m was used as security for land payables note 21.
The value of inventories expensed in 2013 and included in cost of sales was 1,583.3m excluding a net exceptional impairment reversal of 14.1m on inventories that were written down in a previous accounting period 2012: 1,351.9m, excluding the 2.8m exceptional impairmentreversal.

Land payables are reduced for imputed interest, which is charged to the statement of comprehensive income over the credit period of the purchase contract.
22 Financial risk management The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: Market risk Liquidity risk Capital risk Credit risk This note presents basic information regarding the Groups exposure to these risks and the Groups objectives, strategy and processes for measuring and managing exposure to them.
Unless otherwise stated references to Group should be considered toapply to the Company as well.
The Board has overall responsibility for risk management of the Group.
The Board has established the Risk Committee which has the delegated task of overseeing the Boards responsibility with respect to risk and internal control.
TheRisk Committee reports to the Audit Committee on a regular basis.
The Risk Committee is supported in this task by the Group Risk management function.
The Group Risk function performs anannual assessment of the risks faced by the Group.
This assessment is used to drive a risk focused programme of work aimed to improve business processes and increase internal control effectiveness.
Market risk Market risk represents the potential for changes in foreign exchange prices and interest rates to affect the Groups profit and thevalue of its financial instruments.
It also incorporates the effect of the overall UK housing market on the Group.
The Groups objective in market risk management is to minimise its exposures to fluctuations within such variables whilst optimising returns.
The Group also has investments in a number of Portuguese jointly controlled entities.
These interests are not hedged.
Theseinvestments are considered to be long term in nature.
The Group has no other significant currency exposures.
The following exchange rates applied during the year: 2013 2012 Average Year end Average Year end rate spot rate rate spot rate Euro 1.17 1.20 1.23 1.23 The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk may be summarised as follows: 2013 2012 m m Investments 3.6 3.7 Sensitivity analysis A rise fall in the Euro Sterling exchange rate of 10% would result in a 0.3m loss gain in relation to investments 2012: 0.3m.
Strategic Report Governance Financials Other information Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2013 89 22 Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk The Group currently holds no fixed interest borrowings.
This reflects both the low borrowing requirements of the Group and the current low interest rates applicable to floating borrowings.
The Group has no formal target for a ratio of fixed to floating funding.
The responsibility for setting the level of fixed rate debt lies with the Board and is continually reviewed inthe light of economic data provided by a variety of sources.
Sensitivity analysis If in the year ended 31 December 2013 UK interest rates had been 0.5% higher lower then the Groups pre-tax profit would have increased decreased by 0.3m 2012: increased decreased by 0.3m.
The Groups post-tax profit would haveincreased decreased by 0.2m 2012: increased decreased by 0.2m.
These sensitivities have been prepared in respect of the direct impact of such an interest rate change on the net financing expense of financial instruments only, and do not attempt to estimate the indirect effect such a change may have on wider economic environment such as house pricing, mortgage availability and exchange rates.
Housing market risk The Group is fundamentally affected by the level of UK house prices.
These in turn are affected by factors such as credit availability, employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and supply of land with planning.
Whilst it is not possible for the Group to fully mitigate such risks on a national macroeconomic basis the Group does continually monitor its geographical spread within the UK, seeking to balance its investment in areas offering the best immediate returns with a long term spread of its operations throughout the UK to minimise the risk of local microeconomic fluctuations.
The Group has taken steps to control its speculative build, land acquisition activities andwork in progress levels so as to manage the exposure of the Group to any further market disruption.
Sensitivity analysis At 31 December 2013, if UK house prices had been 5% higher lower, and all other variables were held constant, the Groups house price linked financial instruments, which are solely available for sale financial assets, would increase decrease in value, excluding any effects of current or deferred tax, by 10.7m 2012: 10.1m.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk reflects the risk that the Group will have insufficient resources to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups strategy to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that the Group has sufficient liquid funds to meet all its potential liabilities as they fall due.
This is true not only of normal market conditions but also of negative projections against expected outcomes, so as to avoid any risk of incurring contractual penalties or damaging the Groups reputation, which would in turn reduce the Groups ability to borrow at optimal rates.
Therefore the Group remains confident of its continued compliance with financial covenants under the syndicated loan even in the event of deterioration in market conditions.
The Group has entered into a number of deferred payment guarantees and performance bonds in the normal course of operations.
Theliabilities to which these guarantees relate are recognised and accounted for in accordance with our standard accounting policies.
Liquidity forecasts are produced on i a daily basis to ensure that utilisation of current facilities is optimised: ii a monthly basis to ensure that covenant compliance targets and medium term liquidity is maintained: and iii a long term projection basis for the purpose of identifying long term strategic funding requirements.
The Directors also continually assess the balance of capital and debt funding of the Group.
They consider the security of capital funding against the potentially higher rates of return offered by debt financing in order to set an efficient but stable balance appropriate to the size oftheGroup.
The Group operates short term uncommitted overdraft facilities to meet day to day liquidity requirements.
These facilities arecancellable onrequest from the bank: however the Group generally maintains low levels of borrowing on these in favour ofmore cost efficient facilities.
These overdraft facilities are provided by five leading clearing banks to minimise exposure to anyone lender.
The Group maintains a 300m revolving credit facility committed to March 2016.
These committed facilities are sufficient tomeet projected liquidity requirements to this date.
Undrawn committed facilities at the reporting date amount to 300m 2012:300m.
Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2013 90 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 22 Financial risk management continued Cash deposits The Group has a policy of ensuring cash deposits are made with the primary objective of security of principal.
Accordingly deposits are made only with approved, respected, high credit rating financial institutions.
Deposits are spread across such institutions to minimise exposure to any single entity and are made on a short term basis only to preserve liquidity.
Capital risk The capital structure of the Group consists of net cash debt borrowings as detailed in note 20 offset by cash and bank balances and equity of the Group comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as detailed in the statement ofchanges in shareholders equity.
The Groups objective in managing capital is primarily to ensure the continued ability of theGroup to meet its liabilities as they fall due whilst alsomaintaining an appropriate balance of equity and borrowings and minimising costs of capital.
Close control of deployment of capital is maintained by detailed management review procedures for authorisation of significant capital commitments, such as land acquisition, capital targets for local management and asystem of internal interest recharges, ensuring capital cost impact is understood and considered by all management tiers.
Decisions regarding the balance of equity and borrowings, dividend policy and all major borrowing facilities are reserved for the Board.
The Group is currently pursuing a strategy of capital return to shareholders, whilst at the same time building astronger, larger business.
Full details are available in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 33.

In the majority of cases the full cash receipt for each sale occurs on legal completion, which is also the point of revenue recognition under the Groups accounting policies.
Strategic Report Governance Financials Other information Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2013 91 22 Financial risk management continued In certain specific circumstances the Group has entered into shared equity arrangements not applicable to the Company.
Thepressures of recent market conditions necessitated an increase in this form of sales structure from 2008 onwards.
In such cases the long term debt is secured upon the property concerned.
The Group does not recognise collateral rights as a separate asset, nor does it have rights to trade such collateral.
Reductions in property values leads to an increase in the credit risk oftheGroup in respect of such sales.
There was 0.6m requirement for a charge in relation to credit impairment in the year 2012:0.5m.

The fair value is determined by reference to the rates at which they could be exchanged by knowledgeable and willing parties.
Fair value is determined bydiscounting forecast cash flows for the residual period of the contract by a risk adjusted rate.
There exists an element of uncertainty over the precise final valuation and timing of cash flows arising from these assets.
As a result the Group has applied inputs based on current market conditions and the Groups historic experience of actual cash flows resulting from such arrangements.
These inputs are by nature estimates and as such the fair value has been classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy laid out in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
Significant unobservable inputs into the fair value measurement calculation include regional house price movements based on the Groups actual experience of regional house pricing and management forecasts of future movements, weighted average duration from inception to settlement of 10 years 2012: 10 years and discount rate 8% 2012: 8% based on current observed market interest rates offered to private individuals on secured second loans.
The discounted forecast cash flow calculation is dependant upon the estimated future value of the properties on which the available for sale financial assets are secured.
Adjustments to this input, which might result from a change in the wider property market, would have a proportional impact upon the fair value of the asset.
Furthermore, whilst not easily assessable in advance, the resulting change in security value may affect the credit risk associated with the counterparty, influencing fair value further.
Detail of the movements in available for sale financial assets in the period are disclosed in note 17.

Dependant upon an employees role and length of service the Group may make contributions to the scheme up to a maximum of 9% of basic salary.
The Group has no liability beyond these contributions.
Group contributions to these schemes of 1.1m 2012: 1.0m are expensed through the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.

The assets of the Persimmon Scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
On 12 December 2012 Persimmon Plc made a one-off cash contribution of 57.8m to the Persimmon Scheme.
The Persimmon Scheme used these funds to invest in Persimmon Scottish Limited Partnership, which has undertaken to provide fixed cash payments to the Persimmon Scheme to meet its liabilities over a 15 year period.
See note 30 for further details.
Prowting Pension Scheme The Group also operates the Prowting Pension Scheme the Prowting Scheme, a defined benefit scheme.

They also are responsible for jointlyagreeing with the employer the level of contributions due to the Pension Schemes see below.
Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2013 96 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 29 Retirement benefit assets obligations continued Funding requirements UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently i. e. to a level in excess of the current expected cost of providing benefits.
The last funding valuation of the Persimmon Scheme was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 1 January 2011 and as at 31 March 2012 for the Prowting Pension Scheme.
The next funding valuation required by law on 1 January 2014 for the Persimmon Scheme is in progress and will be as at 31 March 2015 for the Prowting Scheme.
Subsequently valuations will be at intervals of no more than three years thereafter.
Following each valuation, the Trustees and the Company must agree the contributions required if any to ensure the Schemes are fully funded over time on a suitable prudent measure.
Contributions agreed in this manner constitute a minimum funding requirement.
Given the current strength of the Pension Schemes funding due to recent cash contributions made to the Persimmon Scheme no contributions are required towards the Persimmon Scheme, however 2.2m p. a. is required for theProwting Scheme payable to 30 April 2018.
In both cases salary related contributions for active members are also payable.
Under the governing documentation of the Pension Schemes, any future surplus in either scheme would be returnable to the Group by refund, assuming gradual settlement of the liabilities over the lifetime of the schemes.
As a result the Group does not consider there to be an asset ceiling in respect of the Pension Schemes.
Regulation The UK pensions market is regulated by The Pensions Regulator whose key statutory objectives in relation to UK defined benefit plans are: t To protect the benefits of members t To promote, and to improve understanding of good administration t To reduce the risk of situations arising which may lead to compensation being payable from the Pension Protection Fund PPF The Pensions Regulator has sweeping powers including the powers: t To wind up a scheme where winding up is necessary to protect members interests t To appoint or remove a trustee t To impose a schedule of company contributions or the calculation of the technical provisions where a trustee and company fail toagree on appropriate contributions t To impose a contribution where there has been a detrimental action against a scheme Risks associated with the Pension Schemes The Pension Schemes expose the Group to a number of risks, the most significant of which are: Risk Description Volatile asset returns The defined benefit obligation DBO is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields.
If assets underperform this discount rate, this will create an element of deficit.
The Schemes hold a significant proportion 55% of assets in growth assets such as equities which, although expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Pension Schemes long term objectives.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the DBO for accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value ofthePension Schemes bond holdings.
Inflation risk A significant proportion of the DBO is indexed in line with price inflation and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although, in most cases, this is capped at an annual increase of 5%.
Life expectancy The majority of the Pension Schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
There are a number of other risks of running the Pension Schemes including operational risks such as paying out the wrong benefits, legislative risks such as the government increasing the burden on pension through new legislation and other demographic risks such as a higher proportion members dying than assumed with a dependant eligible to receive a survivors pensions from the fund.
