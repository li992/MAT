General information HomeServe plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act.
The address of the registered office is Cable Drive, Walsall, WS2 7BN.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs, adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
Adoption of new or revised standards and accounting policies Improvements to IFRSs 2011 have been adopted in the year but their adoption has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements.
Standards in issue but not yet effective At the date of authorisation of these financial statements the following Standards and Interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective not all of which have been endorsed by the EU : Amendments to IFRS1 Government Loans Amendments to IFRS7 Disclosures Transfers of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities IFRS9 Financial Instruments IFRS10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS11 Joint Arrangements IFRS12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities IFRS13 Fair Value Measurement Amendments to IAS1 Presentation of other Items of Comprehensive Income Amendments to IAS12 Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets IAS19 revised Employee Benefits IAS27 revised Separate Financial Statements IAS28 revised Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures Amendments to IAS32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Improvements to IFRSs 2012 The implementation of IFRS9 which the Group expects to adopt for the year beginning on 1 April 2015 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of Financial Instruments.
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the other Standards and Interpretations listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in the future periods.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 85 Notes to financial statements Year ended 31 March 2013 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Standards in issue but not yet effective continued The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis and on a going concern basis as set out in the Corporate Governance statement.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company made up to 31 March each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value.
Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period see below adjustments.
All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs.
Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.
Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period see below, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 86 Financial statements The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
Any adjustments to contingent consideration for acquisitions made prior to 31 March 2010 which result in an adjustment to goodwill continue to be accounted for under IFRS3 2004 and IAS27 2005.
Goodwill Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised at cost as an asset at the date control is acquired the acquisition date.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if there is an indication that it may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash generating unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary or joint venture, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Investments in joint ventures In the prior year, the Groups share of results of joint ventures was included in the consolidated income statement using the equity method of accounting.
The Groups share of their net assets was included in the consolidated balance sheet, including associated goodwill.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 87 Notes to financial statements Year ended 31 March 2013 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT, Insurance Premium Tax and other sales related taxes.
Revenue recorded by the Group includes commissions receivable in the Groups role as an intermediary in the policy sale and administration process.
Any third-party costs incurred on behalf of the principal that are rechargeable under the contractual arrangement, or where the Groups role is only as an intermediary in the cash collection process, are not included in revenue.
Consequently, on the sale of a policy, gross revenue consists of only a component of the overall policy price, representing the commission receivable for the marketing and sale of the policy, stated net of sales related taxes.
Where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more separate arrangements that can be provided to customers either on a stand-alone basis or as an optional extra, revenue is recognised for each element as if it were an individual contract.
Accordingly, revenue is recognised on the sale of a policy except where an obligation exists to provide future services, typically claims handling and policy administration services.
In these situations, a proportion of revenue, sufficient to cover future claims handling costs and margin, is deferred over the life of the policy, as deferred income.
The assessment of future claims handling takes account of the expected numbers of claims and the estimated cost of handling those claims, which are validated through experience of historical actual costs.
The deferred revenue is released over the expected profile of anticipated claims over the policy period.
The deferral also includes a profit element to recognise the performance of these services in the future.
Revenue on sales of franchises is recognised when the obligations to the franchisee are complete.
Revenue on the sale of new franchise licences is recognised upon the signing of the related franchise agreement.
These franchise fees are non-refundable and primarily relate to initial set-up services.
Repair revenue relates to repairs undertaken on behalf of underwriters subject to separate contractual arrangements.
Such revenue is recognised on completion of the repair.
Marketing expenses Costs incurred in respect of marketing activity, including for example, direct mail and inbound outbound telephone costs, which is undertaken to acquire or renew a policy, are charged to the income statement in the period in which the related marketing campaign is performed.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 88 Financial statements Marketing expenses also include payments made to Affinity Partners in recognition of their support in selling and renewing policies.
The terms of their support and related payments are included in contractual agreements with each Affinity Partner.
Amounts incurred upon the sale and renewal of an individual policy, referred to as Affinity Partner Commissions, are recognised as an operating expense when individual policies incept or renew.
Commissions are payable to Affinity Partners only when HomeServe has collected the premium due on behalf of the third party underwriter from the policy holder.
Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Borrowings in foreign currencies are treated as monetary liabilities and are translated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Exchange rate movements on foreign currency borrowings are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Foreign currency borrowings are not treated as hedges of net investments.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly.
Exchange movements, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such cumulative exchange movements are recognised as income or expense in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 89 Notes to financial statements Year ended 31 March 2013 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated after charging all operating costs and after the share of results of joint ventures net of tax but before investment income and finance costs.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For defined benefit retirement schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and is otherwise amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
Any retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Any tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 90 Financial statements The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Buildings 25 - 50 years Furniture, fixtures and equipment 7 years Computer equipment 3 - 7 years Motor vehicles 3 years with 25% residual value Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
Intangible assets Acquisition intangible assets Acquired access rights relate to the contractual agreements entered into with the former owners of businesses acquired as part of business combinations.
These agreements set out the contractual terms of the Affinity Partnership and provide the contractual framework within which the Group will develop and build relationships with the individual customers of the Affinity Partner.
Acquired access rights are recorded at fair value by using the estimated and discounted incremental future cash flows resulting from the relationship.
Acquired access rights are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are in the range of 3 - 15 years.
Acquired customer databases represent the value attributable to the portfolios of renewable customer policies that are acquired as part of business combinations.
Acquired customer databases are recorded at fair value using the estimated and discounted incremental future cash flows resulting from the portfolio of acquired policies over their estimated residual life.
Acquired customer databases are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are in the range of 3 - 15 years.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 91 Notes to financial statements Year ended 31 March 2013 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Other intangible assets Access rights arise from the contractual agreements with Affinity Partners which provide the opportunity to develop and build relationships with the individual customers of the Affinity Partners.
Access rights are valued at the discounted present value of the contractually committed payments, where such payments are not related to the success or otherwise of activity under the contractual agreements and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the length of the contractual agreement, up to a maximum of 20 years.
Trademarks represent costs incurred to legally protect the established brand names of the Business.
Trademarks are stated at cost and amortised on a straight line basis over their useful economic lives, up to a maximum of 20 years.
Computer software and the related licences are stated at cost and amortised on a straight line basis over their useful lives of 3 - 7 years.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the assets for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cashgenerating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 92 Financial statements Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Costs comprise direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is measured on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are classified either at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL or loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at FVTPL or other financial liabilities.
Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at amortised cost as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Borrowings Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are stated at amortised cost and are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at amortised cost.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 93 Notes to financial statements Year ended 31 March 2013 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The Group also provides employees with the ability to purchase the Groups ordinary shares at a discount to the current market value through Save As You Earn schemes.
The Group also issues cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised for the services acquired, measured initially at the fair value of the liability.
At each balance sheet date, until the liability is settled, the fair value of the liability is re-measured with any changes in fair value recognised in the profit or loss for the year.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model or Monte Carlo simulation models depending on the type of scheme.
Own shares reserve Shares of the parent Company that are purchased by the HomeServe plc Employee Benefit Trust are held at cost and shown as a deduction in equity.
Cost comprises consideration paid, including directly attributable costs.
The shares are held to satisfy obligations under the share option schemes.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are items that are unusual because of their size, nature or incidence and which the Directors consider should be disclosed separately to enable a full understanding of the Group's results.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 94 Financial statements 3.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Revenue recognition An appropriate proportion of revenue, sufficient to cover future costs and margin, is deferred to future periods when the Group has obligations extending to future periods.
As a result, judgement is required in assessing the extent and associated costs of fulfilling those future obligations.
The Group uses historical experience and forecast activity levels in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognise in the current period and how much to defer to future periods.
An assessment is also made of any factors that are likely to materially affect the economic benefits which will flow to the Group such as policy cancellations.
To the extent that economic benefits are not expected to flow to the Group, the value of that revenue is not recognised.
The Group uses historical experience in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognise.
Valuation of acquisition intangible assets Acquisitions may result in acquired access rights and acquired customer databases being recognised as intangible assets.
These are valued using the excess earnings method.
In applying this methodology certain key judgements and estimates are required to be made in respect of future cash flows together with an appropriate discount factor for the purpose of determining the present value of those cash flows.
FCA investigation Having taken advice and reviewed internal and external available information, the Board has decided to record exceptional expenditure in relation to the anticipated costs of managing the investigation and a fine.
Whilst there remains uncertainty as to the nature or extent of the action that the FCA may seek to take, this represents management's best estimate.
Customer re-contact programme Over the past 12 months we have been addressing the issues identified in the UK, and where appropriate compensating customers.
The expected cost of re-contacting customers and the extent of any compensation due is based on our experience to date and represents our best estimate.
It is possible that our assumptions regarding the number of customers, level of compensation payable, response rate and the upheld rate could be different to those currently assumed.
At this stage however, we believe that the provision is sufficient to cover the remaining costs of the customer re-contact exercise including customer compensation.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 95 Notes to financial statements Year ended 31 March 2013 3.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued Impairment of goodwill and acquisition intangible assets The annual impairment assessment in respect of goodwill and acquisition intangibles requires estimates of the value in use or fair value less costs to sell of cash-generating units to which goodwill and acquisition intangibles have been allocated.
As a result, estimates of future cash flows are required, together with an appropriate discount factor for the purpose of determining the present value of those cash flows.
The carrying value of goodwill is 248.4m 2012: 260.9m.
The carrying value of acquisition intangibles is 103.3m 2012: 111.4m.
Following the annual impairment review, no impairment charge has been recorded against acquisition intangibles in either year.
As set out in note 6, an impairment charge of 14.8m has been recognised in relation to Socit Franaise fide Garantie SA, relating to goodwill.
This write down reflects the challenging conditions in the electrical retail market in France and lower than expected levels of new partner business.
During the prior year, an impairment charge of 3.9m was recorded against goodwill relating to the Groups Belgian operations which were disposed of.
As set out in note 14, reasonably possible changes in respect of commercial outcomes around sales volumes, prices, margins and discount rates can impact the recoverable value.
Management believes that it is unlikely that there will be any changes to the key assumptions in the forthcoming year.
Revenue An analysis of the Groups revenue is as follows: 2013 2012 m m Provision of services 546.5 534.7 Investment income note 9 0.1 0.1 546.6 534.8 5. Business and geographical segments Segment revenues and results IFRS8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, who is considered to be the Group Chief Executive, to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
Segment profit loss represents the result of each segment including allocating costs associated with head office and shared functions, but before allocating investment income, finance costs, gain on re-measurement and tax.
This is the measure reported to the Group Chief Executive for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in Significant Accounting Policies.
Group cost allocations are deducted in arriving at segmental operating profit.
Inter-segment revenue is charged at prevailing market prices.

Goodwill continued Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at acquisition to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
CGUs are defined as geographical territories, because they represent the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates the Group discount rate using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.
The growth rates are based on detailed business plans.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and plans for the next three years approved by the Directors and extrapolates the annual cash flow using estimated, country specific, long-term growth rates.
The pre-tax rates used to discount the forecast pre-tax cash flows are different for each territory and are detailed below 2012: All CGUs 15% : UK - 12.1% USA - 15.4% France - 13.8% Spain - 13.2% Management has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each CGUs carrying value, which also reflects the different risk profile of each CGU.
Management believes that there are no reasonably possible changes to the key assumptions in the next year which would result in the carrying amount of goodwill exceeding the recoverable amount.
This view is based upon inherently judgemental assumptions, however, it takes account of the headroom in managements internal growth targets versus the conservative growth estimates used in the impairment review.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2013 2012 m m UK 154.6 154.0 United States of America 4.4 4.2 France - Domo 76.1 75.2 Spain - Reparalia 13.3 13.2 France - SFG 14.3 248.4 260.9 An impairment charge of 14.8m has been recognised in respect of Socit Franaise fide Garantie S. A, of which 0.5m relates to the movement in exchange rates between 31 March 2012 and 31 March 2013.

Subsidiaries and joint ventures A list of the significant investments in subsidiaries, including the name, country of incorporation and proportion of ownership interest is given in note 45 to the Companys separate financial statements.
During the prior year, the Group acquired the remaining 51% interest in Domo including its subsidiary Domo Assistance that it did not already own.
In accordance with IFRS3 2008, the joint venture interest was deemed to have been disposed of and the subsidiary interest acquired at the fair value on the acquisition date.
The fair value of the Domo joint venture interest was estimated to be 61.7m, at the acquisition date.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 106 Financial statements Taking into account the joint venture interest held by the group at the time of the transaction of 6.8m, a re-measurement gain of 54.9m was recognised in the income statement.

This assessment has been undertaken by reviewing the status of all significant balances that are past due and involves assessing both the reason for non-payment and the credit worthiness of the counterparty.
Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, there is no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread across a large number of counterparties and customers.
There are no customers that represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 3.9m 2012: 5.3m which are past due at the reporting date but for which the Group has not provided for as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The average age of receivables not impaired is 18 days 2012: 19 days.
Trade debtors to be received from customers relating to instalments of policy premiums that are not yet due have been excluded from the average age calculation.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Ageing of impaired trade receivables: 2013 2012 m m 1 - 30 days 0.3 31 - 60 days 0.2 61 - 90 days 0.8 0.2 91 days 1.3 1.6 2.4 2.0 The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
Other receivables The Group serves as an intermediary, whereby it is responsible for the collection of cash on behalf of third parties.
Other receivables mainly represent those amounts to be collected from policyholders, but to be remitted to third parties for obligations such as the cost of underwriting and Insurance Premium Tax.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to individual receivables being small and spread across a diverse policyholder base.
In addition, overall balance sheet exposure is mitigated as defaults on these receivables can, in the most part, be offset against the corresponding payable included in Other creditors.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 108 Financial statements Cash balances and cash equivalents Cash balances and cash equivalents of 88.6m 2012: 52.8m comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.

The borrowings are drawn in the UK and passed to the overseas subsidiaries of the Group by way of intercompany loans, denominated in the same currencies.
These external borrowings and the equivalent intercompany receivable loans are treated as monetary liabilities and assets respectively and, as such, the Groups foreign currency exposure risk is minimised.
2013 2012 % % The weighted average interest rates paid were as follows: Revolving credit facilities 1.8 2.3 All the Groups revolving credit facilities are unsecured.
The carrying amount of the Groups borrowings approximates to their fair value, and the currencies in which they are denominated reflect the geographical segments for which they have been used.
The other principal features of the Groups borrowings are as follows: The Group has a 250m revolving credit facility with five banks.
This facility was taken out on 22 July 2011 and has a term of five years.
This provides the Group with sufficient funding to support its strategic objectives.
The financial covenants associated with the credit facilities are net debt to EBITDA of less than 3.0 times 2012: 3.0 times and interest cover greater than 4.0 times EBITDA 2012: 4.0 times.
The Group has complied with all covenant requirements in the current and prior year.
The Groups principal borrowings are currently at floating rates at margins of 1% 2012: between 0.5 and 1.5% above the relevant reference rate, thus exposing the Group to cash flow and interest rate risk.
At 31 March 2013, the Group had available 120.4m 2012: 132.2m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
Information about liquidity risk is presented in note 39.

Deferred income represents revenue where an obligation exists to provide future services.
An appropriate proportion of monies received in advance are treated as deferred income and recognised over the relevant period.
Other creditors mainly represent those amounts to be collected from policyholders but to be remitted to third parties for obligations such as the cost of underwriting and Insurance Premium Tax.
In addition, short-term cash advances from customers are included in other creditors until the services are performed and the customer is invoiced.

Provisions continued The provision for the cost of addressing the UK matters represents managements estimate of the Groups liability relating to the UK issues identified in FY2012.
The remaining provision is expected to be utilised within the next 12 months and principally relates to the cost of re-contacting customers and potential compensation.
The provision has been based on managements forecasts which include initial pilot re-contact exercises.
The assumptions used relating to the number of customers, level of compensation, response rate and upheld rate require the use of judgement and estimation.
There remains uncertainty as to the nature or extent of the action, that the FCA may seek to take following the conclusion of its investigation and accordingly any related financial effect.
In March 2013, the Group announced plans to reduce the number of roles in the UK by around 300.
The costs of this reorganisation have been estimated at 4.0m and these have been provided for at 31 March 2013.

Share-based payments During the year ended 31 March 2013, the Group had five 2012: five share-based payment arrangements, which are described below: i Executive Share Option Plan ESOP The ESOP provided for a grant price equal to the closing quoted market price of the Companys shares on the day before the date of grant.
The vesting period was three years and was dependent upon the real increase in Earnings per Share over the vesting period.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
The plan is no longer used.
ii 2005 Key Executive Incentive Plan KEIP The KEIP provided for a grant price equal to the closing quoted market price of the Companys shares on the day before the date of grant.
The awards vested in two tranches, the first being between three and four years from the date of grant and the second being on the second anniversary of the vesting of the first tranche.
The number of awards vesting was dependent upon the Profit before Tax of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2008 and was subject to a minimum share price criteria during the year ending 31 March 2009.
iii Deferred Bonus Plan DBP The DBP enabled the individual to defer receipt of their annual cash bonus up to a maximum of 100% and to invest an equivalent amount in the ordinary share capital of the Company.
The deferred bonus may be matched by the Company dependent upon the Companys relative Total Shareholder Return over a three year period.
The shares lapse if not exercised within 10 years from the date of grant.
iv Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP provides for the grant of performance, matching and restricted awards.
The vesting period is three years for performance and matching awards and two years for the restricted awards.
For the performance and matching awards granted in FY2010 and FY2013, vesting is dependent upon the Total Shareholder Return performance of the Group over the relevant performance period.
For the FY2011 and FY2012 awards, 50% of the award is dependent upon Total Shareholder Return and 50% is subject to a target based on Earnings per Share growth.
The restricted awards granted in FY2013 are subject to the continued employment of the participant at the date of vesting.
v Save As You Earn Scheme SAYE The SAYE is open to all UK employees and provides for an exercise price equal to the closing quoted market price on the day before the date of grant, less a discretionary discount.
The options can be exercised during a six month period following the completion of either a three or five year savings period.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 117 Notes to financial statements Year ended 31 March 2013 36.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 1.82 2012: 3.66.
The estimated fair values are calculated by applying a Black-Scholes option pricing model for the ESOP and SAYE and Monte Carlo simulations for the KEIP, LTIP and DBP.
The assumptions used in the models which are comparable to the prior year are as follows: Input Assumption Share price Price at date of grant Exercise price Per scheme rules Expected volatility 20% 56% Option life Per scheme rules Expected dividends Based on historic dividend yield Risk free interest rate 3.1% 5.2% Annual Report & Accounts 2013 118 Financial statements Levels of early exercises and lapses are estimated using historical averages.
Volatility is calculated by looking at the historical share price movements prior to the date of grant over a period of time commensurate with the remaining term for each award.
The Group recognised total expenses of 3.0m 2012: 1.7m related to equity-settled sharebased payment transactions and total expenses of nil 2012: 16,000 related to cash-settled share-based payment transactions.
Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution scheme The Group operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme for all UK employees.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
Where there are employees who leave the scheme within two years of joining and they choose to take a refund, the contributions paid by the Group are forfeited by the employee.
The total cost charged to income of 3.1m 2012: 3.3m represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the scheme.
At 31 March 2013, contributions of 230,000 2012: 218,000 due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit scheme The Group participates in a defined benefit scheme, the Water Companies Pension Scheme, which is closed to new members.
This is a sectionalised scheme and the Group participates in the HomeServe plc Section of the Scheme.
The Section is administered by a Trustee and is independent of the Groups finances.
Contributions are paid to the Section in accordance with the recommendations of an independent actuary.
The results of the actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2011 were updated to the accounting date by a qualified independent actuary in accordance with IAS19.
As required by IAS19, the value of the defined benefit obligation and the current service cost has been measured using the projected unit credit method.
Valuation at 2013 2012 Key assumptions used: Discount rate at 31 March 4.6% 4.8% Consumer price inflation 2.7% 2.5% Retail price inflation 3.7% 3.5% Expected rate of salary increases 2.7% 4.5% Future pension increases 2.7% 2.5% Expected rate of return on scheme assets at 31 March 6.6% 7.4% Life expectancy of male aged 60 at balance sheet date 27.4yrs 26.9yrs Pensions accounting entries are subject to judgement and volatility, as the assets are largely linked to the equity market, whereas the present value of the obligation is linked to yields on AA-rated corporate bonds.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 119 Notes to financial statements Year ended 31 March 2013 37.
Retirement benefit schemes continued As an indication, all other things being equal: an increase in the discount rate of 0.1% would lead to a reduction in the value placed on the obligations of the Section of approximately 0.5m an increase in the inflation assumption rate of 0.1% would lead to an increase in the value placed on the obligations of the Section of approximately 0.5m a decrease in the equity market of 25% would lead to an increase in the balance sheet liability of approximately 2.1m.
Amounts recognised in income in respect of the defined benefit scheme are as follows: 2013 2012 m m Current service cost 0.2 0.1 Interest cost 0.9 1.0 Expected return on scheme assets 1.2 1.3 Past service cost Recognised in operating costs 0.1 0.2 The actual return on scheme assets was a gain of 2.2m 2012: gain of 1.0m.

The cumulative amount recognised outside profit and loss at 31 March 2013 is a loss of 2.6m 2012: loss 1.9m.
The analysis of the scheme assets and the expected rate of return at the balance sheet date was as follows: E xpected return Fair value of assets 2013 2012 2013 2012 % % m m Equity instruments 7.0 7.3 8.2 12.8 Diversified growth funds 6.3 6.6 2.9 3.4 Debt instruments 3.0 7.2 Other 3.0 3.3 3.6 2.5 21.9 18.7 The overall expected rate of return on assets for the financial year ending 31 March 2013 was 6.6% per annum 2012: 7.4% per annum.

Financial instruments Principal financial instruments The principal financial instruments used by the Group from which financial instrument risk arises are as follows: cash and cash equivalents bank overdrafts and revolving credit facilities trade receivables other receivables trade payables other creditors All principal financial instruments are stated at amortised cost.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group are able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the appropriate balance of debt and equity.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 20, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 25 to 31 and the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
The table below presents quantitative data for the components the Group manages as capital: 2013 2012 m m Shareholders funds 375.2 366.4 Revolving credit facilities 129.6 117.8 Certain of the entities in the Group are subject to externally imposed capital requirements from the Financial Conduct Authority.
Where such requirements exist, the Group manages the risk through the close monitoring of performance and distributable capital within the entities impacted by the regulations.
The Group has complied with all such arrangements throughout the current and preceding year.
Financial risk management objectives The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans and overdrafts and cash and cash equivalents.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group also has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations.
Financial risk management is overseen by the Board according to objectives, targets and policies set by the Board.
Treasury risk management, including management of currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk is carried out by a central Group Treasury function in accordance with objectives, targets and policies set by the Board.
Treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.

Financial instruments continued Classification of financial instruments In addition to the other financial assets and liabilities set out above in Principal financial instruments, the Group also has financial assets and liabilities disclosed in notes 19 and 22.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Groups long-term debt requirements with floating interest rates.
The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts.
The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities based on contractual maturities is provided in the table below.
Interest is payable on the bank overdraft and revolving credit facilities.
Deferred and contingent consideration payments are stated on the basis of expected cash outflows before discounting.
The actual payment profile of Other creditors is principally dependent upon the collection of the corresponding Other receivables from policyholders.
These amounts principally relate to underwriting, which are collected from policyholders and remitted to underwriters following cash collection.
Therefore, the actual cash flows may differ from those presented, but will not result in the acceleration of the settlement of the liability.
Bank overdrafts Deferred and and revolving Trade Other contingent credit facilities payables creditors consideration Total m m m m m 2013 Under 2 months 51.0 45.0 96.6 Between 2 and 6 months 34.5 43.2 0.1 77.8 Between 6 and 12 months 6.3 25.4 1.9 33.6 Between 1 and 2 years 0.6 1.6 1.6 Between 2 and 3 years 1.0 1.0 Between 3 and 4 years 129.6 1.0 130.6 Between 4 and 5 years 1.0 1.0 After 5 years 0.2 0.2 Total 129.6 91.8 114.2 6.8 342.4 Bank overdrafts Deferred and and revolving Trade Other contingent credit facilities payables creditors consideration Total m m m m m 2012 Under 2 months 83.8 17.9 101.7 Between 2 and 6 months 32.3 0.1 32.4 Between 6 and 12 months 58.1 2.3 60.4 Between 1 and 2 years 1.6 1.6 Between 2 and 3 years 1.8 1.8 Between 3 and 4 years 0.9 0.9 Between 4 and 5 years 117.8 0.9 118.7 After 5 years 1.2 1.2 Total 117.8 83.8 108.3 8.8 318.7 Annual Report & Accounts 2013 124 Financial statements The revolving credit facility is drawn down and associated interest is settled on a monthly basis.
The principal is included in the previous table when the facility is due to expire.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change of 10% increase in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
2013 2012 Increase in interest rate 10% 10% Reduction in profit before tax m 0.1 0.2 Credit risk The Group trades only with creditworthy third parties.
It is the Groups policy that, with the exception of our policy membership customers, customers who wish to trade on credit terms are reviewed for financial stability.
The majority of the Groups trade receivables consist of a large number of individual members and hence for these balances the Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to a single counterparty.
As a result, the Groups exposure to bad debts is not considered to be significant.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
The Group manages the risk associated with cash and cash equivalents through depositing funds only with reputable and creditworthy banking institutions.
The Group has a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of the above receivables and instruments.
Liquidity risk Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Groups Board which sets the framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities and continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows.
Included in note 20 are details of the undrawn facilities that are available to the Group to further reduce liquidity risk.
With the exception of deferred and contingent consideration and the bank overdrafts and the revolving credit facilities, all of the Groups financial liabilities are due for payment within two years, based on contractual payment terms.
