Strategic report 71 Corporate governance Man Group plc Financial statements Annual Report 2013 Other information Notes to the Group financial statements 1.
Basis of preparation Accounting policies The audited consolidated financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and interpretations IFRICs as adopted by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Mans principal accounting policies have been consistently applied across the Group in the preparation of the financial statements.
Accounting policies are included in the relevant sections, and significant policies are provided below.
The impact of new accounting standards and amendments applicable to the year ended 31 December 2013 and accounting standards that are not yet effective are outlined below.
Consolidated group and presentation currency The consolidated group is Man Group plc the Company and its subsidiaries together the Group or Man.
The stand-alone Parent Company financial statements of Man Group plc have been included as separate financial statements, starting on page 101.
The majority of revenues, assets, liabilities and funding are denominated in United States dollars USD and therefore Mans presentation currency is USD.
The consolidated financial information contained within these financial statements incorporates the results, cash flows and financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year to 31 December 2013.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by Man and are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to Man until the date that control ceases.
Control exists when Man has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
All intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses between Group entities are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value at the acquisition date of assets transferred, liabilities incurred, and equity instruments issued by the Group.
The fair value of an acquisition is calculated at the acquisition date by recognising the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at their fair values at that date.
Costs relating to acquisitions are recognised in the Group income statement as incurred.
The acquisition date is the date on which Man effectively obtains control of the acquiree.
Any contingent consideration will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration will be recognised in Group income statement and classified as an adjusting item.
Mans relationship with independent fund entities Man acts as the investment manager advisor to fund entities.
Having considered all significant aspects of Mans relationships with fund entities, the directors are of the opinion that although Man manages the assets of certain fund entities: the existence of independent boards of directors at the fundentities: termination provisions in the investment management agreements, which allow for the removal of the investment manager advisor: the influence of investors: and, the arms length nature of Mans contracts with the fund entities, Man does not control the fund entities and their associated assets, liabilities and results should not be consolidated into Mans Group financial statements.
An understanding of the aggregate funds under management FUM and the fees earned from the fund entities is relevant to an understanding of Mans results and earnings sustainability and this information is provided in the Chief Financial Officers review on page 14.
Judgemental areas and accounting estimates The most significant area of judgement is the allocation and valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, in particular the goodwill in relation to the GLG acquisition which includes an allocation to AHL and the FRM business Note 12 and the carrying value of capitalised product placement fees Note 13.
The valuation of goodwill and intangibles has been an area of focus for the Group Board, and in particular the Audit and Risk Committee, during the year.
The report of the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee discusses the involvement of the Committee in this evaluation on page 35.
Other areas of judgement are the determination of fair values for contingent consideration in relation to the FRM acquisition Note 26, illiquid investments Notes 15 and 26, deferred compensation awards Note 20 and pension obligations Note 22.
Going concern Mans business activity is discussed on pages 1 to 25, together with the significant risk factors pages 20 to 23.
Mans liquidity and capital positions are set out in Note 14 and 21 respectively.
The directors monitor Mans capital and liquidity positions and forecasts throughout the year, and in addition they have approved a budget, medium term financial plan, and a capital and liquidity plan, which cover the foreseeable future and include rigorous analysis of stressed capital and liquidity scenarios.
The directors have concluded that there is a reasonable expectation that Man has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the Group and Parent financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis using the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of certain financial instruments that are available-for-sale or held at fair value through profit or loss.
Scheme of arrangement in prior year In the prior year, on 6 November 2012, under a scheme of arrangement between Man Strategic Holdings plc formally Man Group plc, the former holding company of the Group, and its shareholders under Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006, and as sanctioned by the High Court, all the issued ordinary shares in that company were cancelled and the same number of new ordinary shares were issued to Man Group plc the new holding company in consideration for the allotment to shareholders of one ordinary share in Man Group plc for each ordinary share they held in Man Strategic Holdings plc.
The scheme of arrangement was treated as a capital reorganisation.
The consequence was that the Man Group did not fundamentally change in any way, and no fair value adjustments or goodwill were recognised.

Basis of preparation continued Financial reporting controls The Groups systems of internal control aim to safeguard assets, ensure that proper accounting records are maintained, and ensure that the financial information used in the business and published externally is robust and reliable.
The financial reporting controls comply with the guidance given in Internal Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code.
The Corporate governance report is provided on pages 28 to 39.

IAS 19 Revised Employee benefits has been adopted this year, and has been applied retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors, and hence the prior year has been restated and the opening restated balance sheet presented.
The most significant change arising was to cease to apply the corridor approach in accounting for Mans defined benefit plans.
The impact of the adoption of IAS 19 Revised Employee benefits resulted in a decrease in net pension assets of $110 million as at 31 December 2012 31 December 2011: $94 million and in deferred tax liabilities of $26 million 31 December 2011: $23 million, with a corresponding debit to equity of $84 million 31 December 2011: $71 million.
The comparative Group statement of comprehensive income for the prior year has been restated to reflect remeasurements in relation to defined benefit plans of $13 million, partially offset by related tax effects.
The profit for 2012 has reduced due to a $3 million increase in pension costs in the compensation line, which has also reduced both the 2012 basic and diluted earnings per share.
Other relevant new standards adopted by Man in the current year, which have not had a significant impact, are: Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements Amendment to IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures IFRS 13 Fair value measurement Other new or revised standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective, which are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group financial statements of Man, are as follows: IFRS 11 Joint arrangements IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in other entities IAS 27 revised 2011 Separate financial statements IAS 28 revised 2011 Investments in joint ventures and associates Amendments to IAS 36 Impairment of assets IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements is the revised consolidation accounting standard, which is effective from 1 January 2014.
The adoption of this standard is expected to have an impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements as some of the Groups investments in fund products will fall into scope for consolidation under this standard.
The adoption of IFRS 10 is expected to result in the consolidation of one fund at 1 January 2014 with an increase in the gross assets and liabilities on the Group balance sheet of around $400 million, and a minimal impact on the Group income statement.
Certain sections of IFRS 9 Financial instruments have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and are effective from 1January 2015, however at present these have not yet been endorsed by the EU and are therefore currently not expected to be applicable in 2014.
Presentation of internal commission costs and calculation of the compensation ratio The presentation of internal commission costs has been changed in the Group income statement in the current year, and the prior year has been restated accordingly, to reclassify these costs to compensation costs rather than distribution costs.
This reflects the way the business is now managed, providing more relevant information to the readers of the financial statements, and brings the treatment in line with industry practice.
Internalcommission costs for the year ended 31 December 2013 were $30 million 2012: $45 million.
The methodology for calculating the Groups compensation ratio, as disclosed in Note 6, has changed from the prior year to include internal commission costs and is now a percentage of net revenue as defined in Note 6 rather than gross revenue.
As a result of the change in methodology, the compensation ratio for 2013 has changed from 36% 2012: 33% to 42% 2012: 42%.

Adjusted profit before tax Statutory profit loss before tax is adjusted to give a fuller understanding of the underlying profitability of the business.
The directors consider that the Groups profit is most meaningful when considered on a basis which excludes restructuring costs, amortisation and impairment of intangible assets and certain non-recurring gains or losses, which therefore reflect the recurring revenues and costs that drive the Groups cash flow.
The directors are consistent in their approach to the classification of adjusting items period to period.
These are explained in detail either below or in the relevant note.
Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2012 1 $m Note 2013 Restated Statutory profit loss before tax 56 748 Adjusting items: Gain on disposal of interest in Nephila and other interests 11 Compensation restructuring 6 36 65 Other costs restructuring 7 28 4 Other costs accelerated depreciation 43 Gain on disposal of Lehman claims 5 131 Regulatory and other settlements 7 14 Impairment of goodwill 12 69 979 Release of tax indemnity provision 11 Recycling of FX revaluation on liquidation of subsidiaries 1 42 Impairment of capitalised placement fees 4,13 88 FRM acquisition costs 6,7 12 Revaluation of contingent consideration 3 9 Unwind of contingent consideration discount 8 3 3 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 12 66 65 Adjusted profit before tax 297 275 Tax on adjusted profit 21 40 Adjusted net income 276 235 Note: 1 Refer to Note 1 for details of the adoption of IAS 19 Revised.
The gain on disposal of interest in Nephila and other interests primarily relates to the disposal of a 6.25% stake in Nephila on 23 January 2013, reducing the Groups holding to 18.75%.
Compensation costs incurred as part of restructuring are accounted for in full at the time the obligation arises, following communication of the formal plan, and include payments in lieu of notice, enhanced termination costs, and accelerated share-based payment and fund product based charges.
The $36 million of compensation restructuring costs recognised in 2013 relate to the further phase of cost saving initiatives announced on 2 August 2013.
Restructuring costs included within Other costs primarily relate to onerous property lease provisions, mainly in relation to Riverbank House our main London office and headquarters.
The accelerated depreciation included within Other costs primarily relates to leasehold improvements and equipment as a result of the sub-letting of office space in Riverbank House.
Regulatory and other settlement costs of $14 million in the year primarily relate to the settlement of a regulatory enquiry in the US and directly associated legal costs.
$5 million of additional proceeds were received in the year relating to the disposal of the Lehman claims in 2012.
In the prior year, the Lehman claims were sold by Man for a total consideration of $456 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $131 million.
Following a test for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets at 31 December 2013, the FRM goodwill was impaired by $69 million, primarily relating to our legacy Man Multi-Manager Business.
Refer to Note 12 for further details.
In the prior year, GLG and the legacy Man Multi-Manager goodwill was impaired by $837 million and $142 million respectively.
The revaluation of contingent consideration is an adjustment to the fair value of expected earn-out payments resulting primarily from movements in net management fee run rates since the acquisition of FRM and has been included within Gains losses on investments and other financial instruments.
The gain of $3 million 2012: $9 million was offset by an unwind of the discount on the contingent consideration of $3 million 2012: $3 million, included within Finance expense Note 8.
The amortisation of acquired intangible assets relates to the amortisation of the investment management contracts and brands recognised on the acquisition of FRM, GLG, and Ore Hill.
Further details are provided in Note 12.
During the year, some of the Groups foreign subsidiaries were liquidated, which had accumulated foreign currency translation reserves of $1 million 2012: $42million at the date of liquidation.
The related foreign currency translation was recycled to the Group income statement upon liquidation of these subsidiaries as required by IAS 21.
In the prior year, capitalised placement fees were impaired by $88 million, as a result of fide-gearing and negative investment performance in relation to guaranteed products $50 million and the introduction of a new servicing fee based internal compensation structure effective from 1 January 2013 $38 million.
74 Man Group plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements continued 3.
Revenue and margins Fee income is Mans primary source of revenue, which is derived from the investment management agreements that we have in place with the fund entities.
Fees are generally based on an agreed percentage of the valuation of FUM and are typically charged in arrears.
Management fees net of rebates, which include all non-performance related fees and interest income from loans to fund products, are recognised in the year in which the services are provided.
Performance fees net of rebates relate to the performance of the funds managed during the year and are recognised when the quantum of the fee can be estimated reliably and it is probable that the fee will crystallise.
This is generally at the end of the performance period or upon early redemption by a fund investor.
Until the performance period ends market movements could significantly move the net asset value NAV of the fund products.
Man will typically only earn performance fee income on any positive investment returns in excess of the high-water mark, meaning we will not be able to earn performance fee income with respect to positive investment performance in any year following negative performance until that loss is recouped, at which point a fund investors investment surpasses the high-water mark.
Distribution costs Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December $m 2013 2012 External distribution costs before adjusting items 145 203 Impairment of capitalised placement fees Note 2 88 Total distribution costs 145 291 Distribution costs paid to intermediaries are directly related to their marketing activity and the investors serviced by them.
The distribution expense is therefore variable to sales, FUM, and the associated management fee income to sustain management fee margins.
Distribution costs, before adjusting items, of $145 million 2012: $203 million comprise product placement fees of $17 million 2012: $47 million and investor servicing fees of $128 million 2012: $156 million.
Placement fees are paid for product launches or sales and are capitalised and amortised over the expected investment hold period refer to Note 13.
Investor servicing fees are paid to intermediaries for ongoing investor servicing and are expensed asincurred.
Capitalised placement fees were impaired by $88 million during the prior year, and classified as an adjusting item.
Distribution costs relating to employees internal commissions are now presented as compensation costs and the prior year has been restated accordingly.
Refer to Note 1 for further details.
Asset services Asset services include valuations, fund accounting, and registrar functions performed by third parties under contract to Man, on behalf of the funds.
The cost of these services is based on the number of transactions or FUM, therefore variable with activity levels and FUM.
Asset services costs for the year were $32 million 2012: $31 million.
Compensation Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December $m 2013 2012 Salaries fixed 163 198 Salaries variable 169 111 Share-based payment charge 30 68 Fund product based payment charge 32 20 Internal commissions variable 17 30 Social security costs 24 30 Pension costs 10 18 Compensation costs before adjusting items 445 475 Restructuring 36 65 FRM acquisition costs 7 Total compensation costs 481 547 Compensation is our largest cost and an important component of our ability to retain and attract talent at Man.
In the short-term, the variable component of compensation adjusts with revenues and profitability.
In the medium term the active management of headcount can reduce fixed based compensation, if required.
Strategic report 75 Corporate governance Man Group plc Financial statements Annual Report 2013 Other information Compensation costs in total were $445 million, before adjusting items, or 42% of net revenue 2012: 42%.
Net revenue is defined as gross management and other fees, performance fees, gains losses on investments and other financial instruments, share of after tax profit of associates, less external distribution costs.
Internal commission costs were reclassified in the current year to compensation costs from distribution costs, and the prior year has been restated accordingly.
Total internal commission costs for the year were $30 million 2012: $45 million, with $6 million 2012: $12 million included in the share-based payment charge line and $7 million 2012: $3 million included in the fund product based payment charge line.
Fixed compensation and benefits were $188 million compared to $236 million in the prior year.
Fixed compensation comprises salaries fixed, pension costs and a portion of the social security costs.
The prior year includes FRM fixed compensation from 17 July 2012, the date of acquisition.
Variable compensation, excluding internal commissions, was $227 million compared to $194 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting higher performance fee related compensation.
Salaries, both fixed and variable, are charged to the Group income statement in the year in which they are incurred.
The accounting for share-based and fund product based compensation arrangements is covered in Note 20.
The unamortised deferred compensation at year end was $24 million 2012: $54 million which had a weighted average remaining vesting period of 1.4 years 2012: 1.2 years.
The decrease from the prior year of these two items in aggregate primarily reflects the decrease in the unamortised deferred compensation in line with the decline in profitability over recent years.
Pension costs relate to Mans defined contribution and defined benefit plans Note 22.
The aggregate directors remuneration including social security, for both executive and non-executive directors, is: 1 Fees and remuneration of $8,469,000 2012: $5,538,000 : 2 Gains made on transfer of share awards and exercise of share options in the year of $nil 2012: $nil : 3 Amounts receivable by directors under long-term incentive schemes in the year of $426,000 2012: $nil : and 4 Contributions to money purchase pension schemes of $49,000 2012: $132,000.

Other costs, before depreciation and amortisation and adjusting items, were $191 million in the year, compared to $244 million in the prior year, which reflects the impact of the various previously announced cost saving initiatives to reduce the cost base of the Group.
Auditors remuneration, including advisory and professional services, is disclosed in more detail in the Corporate governance section on page 36.

Taxation Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December $m 2013 2012 Analysis of tax credit charge for the period: Current tax: UK corporation tax on profits of the period 29 44 Foreign tax 16 14 Adjustments to tax charge in respect of previous periods 34 17 Total current tax 11 41 Deferred tax: Origination and reversal of temporary differences 28 6 Adjustments to tax charge in respect of previous periods 1 4 Total tax credit charge 16 39 Man is a global business and therefore operates across many different tax jurisdictions.
Income and profits are allocated to these different jurisdictions based on transfer pricing methodologies set in accordance with the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
The effective tax rate results from the combination of taxes paid on earnings attributable to the tax jurisdictions in which they arise.
The majority of the Groups profit was earned in the UK, Switzerland, and Australia.
The current effective tax rate of -28.6% 2012: -5.2% differs from the underlying rate principally as a result of prior year tax credits including for further settled tax returns across a number of countries and multiple periods, and the impairment of goodwill on which no tax relief is received.
The effective tax rate is otherwise consistent with this earnings profile.
The effective tax rate on adjusted profits Note 2 is 7.1% 2012: 14.4%.
The lower rate again is principally the result of the effect of prior year tax credits, which along with utilisation of tax losses outweighs the impact of reduced relief on share-based compensation costs.
The tax on Mans total profit loss before tax is lower 2012: higher than the amount that would arise using the theoretical effective tax rate applicable to profits losses of the consolidated companies, as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2012 1 $m 2013 Restated Profit loss before tax 56 748 Theoretical tax charge credit at UK rate 23.25% 2012: 24.5% 13 183 Effect of: Overseas rates compared to UK 14 32 Adjustments to tax charge in respect of previous periods 33 13 Impairment of goodwill and other adjusting items 19 249 Share-based payments 10 8 Other 11 10 29 222 Total tax credit charge 16 39 Note: 1 Refer to Note 1 for details of the adoption of IAS 19 Revised.
Strategic report 77 Corporate governance Man Group plc Financial statements Annual Report 2013 Other information Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates expected to be applied when the deferred tax asset or liability is realised.
The deferred tax closing balance of $58 million 2012: $71 million relates mostly to the tax arising on intangible assets of $97 million 2012: $114 million.
The closing balance is also net of deferred tax assets primarily related to defined benefit pension schemes of $9 million 2012: $25 million, employee share schemes of $7 million 2012: $8 million, and tax allowances over depreciation of $18 million 2012: $9 million.
The movement in the deferred tax liability of $58 million 2012: $71 million includes an income statement credit of $27 million 2012: $2 million, a charge toother revenue reserves of $10 million 2012: $nil, and other currency differences credits of $4 million 2012: $5 million.
The income statement credit of $27 million 2012: $2 million is made up of a decrease in the deferred tax liability arising on intangibles assets of $17 million 2012: $6 million, an increase in the deferred tax asset arising on tax allowances over depreciation of $9 million 2012: $1 million, decrease and a decrease in the deferred tax liability on other temporary differences of $1 million 2012: $3 million, increase.
The charge to other revenue reserves $10 million arises on the movement in pension accrual in the year.
The adoption of IAS 19 Revised Employee Benefits resulted in a deferred tax asset of $26 million at 31 December 2012.
Earnings per ordinary share EPS The calculation of basic EPS is based on post-tax profit, after payments to holders of the perpetual subordinated capital securities $19 million after tax, $25 million for the prior year, of $53 million compared to a loss of $812 million in the prior year, and ordinary shares of 1,787,851,123 2012: 1,772,828,571, being the weighted average number of ordinary shares on issue during the period after excluding the shares owned by the Man Employee Trusts.
For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, being ordinary shares of 1,818,402,923 2012: 1,802,501,332.
The details of movements in the number of shares used in the basic and dilutive EPS calculation are provided below.

The impairment of $979 million in 2012 relates to the legacy Man Multi-Manager business $142 million and GLG $837 million.
4 The other adjustment of $5 million to goodwill relates to an adjustment to the calculation for the FRM contingent consideration at the date of acquisition July 2012, reducing the goodwill and contingent consideration creditor.
Strategic report 79 Corporate governance Man Group plc Financial statements Annual Report 2013 Other information Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired business at the date ofacquisition.
Goodwill is carried on the Group balance sheet at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill has an indefinite useful life, is not subject to amortisation and is tested for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash generating units.
Investment management contracts IMCs IMCs, distribution channels and brand names are recognised at the present value of the expected future cash flows and are amortised on a straightline basis over the expected useful lives, which are between 9 and 12 years.
Allocation of goodwill to cash generating units The Group has three identified cash-generating units CGUs for impairment review purposes: GLG, FRM, and AHL.
The goodwill and other intangible assets acquired on the acquisition of FRM have been allocated to the FRM CGU as the acquired FRM business has been fully integrated with the previous Man Multi-Manager business, which will benefit from all of the synergies from the acquisition.
The Man Systematic Strategies business MSS was integrated into the AHL business on 1 January 2013, which was previously reported within the GLG and FRM CGUs.
The goodwill associated with the MSS business of $71 million has been transferred from the GLG CGU $61 million and the FRM CGU $10 million to the AHL CGU.
Calculation of recoverable amounts for cash generating units The recoverable amounts of the Groups CGUs are assessed each year using a value in use calculation.
A value in use calculation gives a higher valuation compared to a fair value less cost to sell approach, as a fair value approach would exclude some of the revenue synergies available to Man through its ability to distribute products using its well established distribution channels, which is unlikely to be fully available to other market participants.
The value in use calculations at 31 December 2013 use cash flow projections based on the approved budget for the year to 31 December 2014 and a further two years of projections 2015 and 2016 plus a terminal value.
The valuation analysis is based on best practice guidance whereby a terminal value is calculated at the end of a short discrete budget period and assumes, after this three year budget period, no growth in asset flows above the long-term growth rate.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are represented by the compound average annualised growth in FUM over the three yearbudget period and the discount rates applied to the modelled cash flows.
The value in use calculations are sensitive to small changes in the key assumptions, in particular in relation to the compound average annualised growth in FUM over the three year forecast period.
Sensitivity analysis of thisassumption is given in each of the GLG, FRM and AHL sections below.
The terminal value is calculated based on the projected closing FUM at 31December 2016 and applying a mid-point of a range of historical multiples to the forecast cash flows associated with management and performance fees.
A bifurcated discount rate has been applied to the modelled cash flows to reflect the different risk profile of net management fee income and net performance fee income.
The discount rates are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital using a risk free interest rate, together with an equity risk premium and an appropriate beta derived from a consideration of Mans beta, similar alternative asset managers and the asset management sector as a whole.
The post-tax discount rates applied are the same as those used in 2012.
The specific assumptions applied to the value in use calculations for each of the CGUs are explained in the sections below.
GLG cash generating unit In 2012, GLG goodwill was impaired by $837 million.
At 30 June 2013, GLGs FUM and run rate revenues were higher than the modelled FUM and run rate revenues in the value in use calculation at 31December 2012 as a result of better than forecast investment performance, particularly for long only.
Therefore, there were no indicators of impairment and no impairment test was deemed necessary.
The recoverable amount of the GLG CGU has again been assessed at 31 December 2013.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculation are shown in the table below.
Compound average annualised growth in FUM over three years 16.5% 1 Discount rate post-tax Net management fees 11% Net performance fees 17% 2 Terminal value mid-point of range of historical multiples Management fees 13x Performance fees 5.5x Notes: 1 The pre-tax equivalent of the net management fee and net performance fee discount rates are 13% and 22% respectively.
2 The terminal value is equivalent to an overall terminal growth of 3.1% for management fees and 0% for performance fees.

Goodwill and acquired intangibles continued The GLG value in use calculation at 31 December 2013 indicates a value of $1.3 billion, with around $550 million of headroom over the carrying value of the GLG business.
Therefore, no impairment charge is deemed necessary at 31 December 2013.
The valuation at 31 December 2013 is around $500 million higher than the value in use calculation at 31 December 2012, primarily as a result of better than anticipated net inflows and investment performance in 2013, particularly for long only, and higher growth in FUM anticipated over the next three years.
The table below shows two adverse scenarios, whereby the base case key assumptions are changed to stressed assumptions.
The table below shows the effect of these scenarios and the associated modelled headroom or impairment that would result.
The results of these sensitivities make no allowance for actions that management would take if such market conditions persisted.
Compound average annualised growth in FUM stressed to: 7% 5% Modelled headroom impairment $m 58 50 If the net management fee and net performance fee post-tax discount rates were increased by 1% to 12% and 18% respectively, it would result in the modelled headroom decreasing by $25 million.
If the discount rates were decreased by 1%, it would result in the modelled headroom increasing by $27million.
If the mid-point of the range of historical multiples for management and performance fees used to calculate the terminal value were increased by 1 to 14 times and 6.5 times respectively, it would result in the modelled headroom increasing by around $102 million.
If they were decreased by 1 to 12 times and 4.5 respectively, it would result in the modelled headroom decreasing by $103 million.
FRM cash generating unit The FRM CGU includes the legacy Man Multi-Manager business and the acquired FRM business.
A significant majority of the carrying value of the goodwill relates to the legacy RMF and Glenwood businesses, which were acquired in 2002 and 2000 respectively.
In 2012, as a result of the challenging economic environment, a goodwill impairment charge of $142 million was recognised at 30 June 2012.
The recoverable amount of the FRM CGU was again assessed at 31 December 2012, which included the previous Man Multi-Manager and the acquired FRM business, and suggested a value for the FRM CGU with significant headroom over the carrying value of the business.
Therefore, no further impairment charge was deemed necessary.
At 30 June 2013, FRMs growth in FUM was slightly lower than modelled in the value in use calculation at 31 December 2012.
However, as FRM had significant headroom at 31 December 2012, and FRMs margins and costs were as forecast, the lower growth in FUM was deemed to not be significant enough to be an indicator of impairment.
As a result, no impairment test of FRMs goodwill was undertaken at 30 June 2013.
As with the GLG CGU, the recoverable amount of the FRM CGU has again been assessed at 31 December 2013.
Compound average annualised growth in FUM over three years Fund of fund products 4.5% Guaranteed products -36% 1 Discount rate post-tax Net management fees 11% Net performance fees 17% 2 Terminal value mid-point of range of historical multiples Management fees 12x Performance fees 4x Notes: 1 The pre-tax equivalent of the net management fee and net performance fee discount rates are 13% and 19% respectively.
2 The terminal value is equivalent to an overall terminal growth of 1.0% for management fees and 0% for performance fees.
As a result of guaranteed product FUM decreasing faster than anticipated, and higher than anticipated outflows in 2013 and Q1 2014, in particular in relation to redemptions from a small number of institutional investors in our legacy Multi-Manager Business, the value in use calculation at 31 December 2013 suggests a value of $179 million for the FRM business.
As the carrying value of the FRM business was $248 million, this resulted in an associated goodwill impairment charge of $69 million at 31 December 2013.
Strategic report 81 Corporate governance Man Group plc Financial statements Annual Report 2013 Other information The table below shows two scenarios: one positive scenario and one adverse scenario, whereby the base case key assumptions for the fund of fund products are changed to more favourable or stressed assumptions.
The assumptions for guaranteed products remain unchanged.
The result of the adverse sensitivity makes no allowance for actions that management would take if such market conditions persisted.
Fund of fund compound average annualised growth in FUM stressed to: 8% 2% Modelled headroom increased impairment $m 18 136 If the net management fee and net performance fee post-tax discount rates were increased by 1% to 11% and 18% respectively, it would result in the modelled impairment increasing by $3 million.
If the discount rates were decreased by 1%, it would result in the modelled impairment decreasing by $3million.
If the mid-point of the range of historical multiples for management and performance fees used to calculate the terminal value were increased by 1to13 times and 5 times respectively, it would result in the modelled impairment decreasing by around $15 million.
If they were decreased by 1 to 11 times and 3 respectively, it would result in the modelled impairment increasing by around $15 million.
AHL cash generating unit The recoverable amount of the AHL CGU was reviewed at 31 December 2012 using a value in use calculation.
The value in use calculation indicated a value for the AHL CGU with significant headroom over the carrying value of the AHL business.
At 30 June 2013, AHLs growth in FUM was slightly lower than that modelled in the value in use calculation at 31 December 2012.
However, as AHL had significant headroom at 31 December 2012, and AHLs margins and costs were as expected, the lower growth in FUM was not significant enough to be deemed an indicator of impairment.
As a result, no impairment test of AHLs goodwill was undertaken at 30 June 2013.
As with the GLG and FRM CGUs, the recoverable amount of the AHL CGU has been assessed at 31 December 2013 using a value in use calculation.
Compound average annualised growth in FUM over three years Quant products 10.8% Guaranteed products -38% 1 Discount rate post-tax Net management fees 11% Net performance fees 17% 2 Terminal value mid-point of range of historical multiples Management fees 13x Performance fees 5.5x Notes: 1 The pre-tax equivalent of the net management fee and net performance fee discount rates are 13% and 20% respectively.
2 The terminal value is equivalent to an overall terminal growth of 2.8% for management fees and 0% for performance fees.
The value in use calculation at 31 December 2013 for the AHL CGU indicates a value of around $1.25 billion, giving a significant amount of headroom over the carrying value of the AHL CGU.
In an adverse scenario, the compound average annualised growth in FUM over three years for quant alternative products, with guaranteed products unchanged, would have to decrease to 3% as a result of a combination of declined net investment performance and net flows for any impairment to arise.
If the net management fee and net performance fee post-tax discount rates were increased by 1% to 11% and 18% respectively, it would result inmodelled headroom decreasing by $25 million.
If the discount rates were decreased by 1%, it would result in modelled headroom increasing by $25million.
If the mid-point of the range of historical multiples for management and performance fees used to calculate the terminal value were increased by 1to14 times and 6.5 times respectively, it would result in modelled headroom increasing by around $118 million.
If they were decreased by 1 to 12 times and 4.5 respectively, it would result in modelled headroom decreasing by around $119 million.

The majority of placement fees paid are capitalised as intangible assets which represent the contractual right to benefit from future income from providing investment management services.
The amortisation period is based on managements estimate of the weighted average period over which Man expects to earn economic benefit from the investor in each product, estimated to be five years on a straight-line basis.
If an investor redeems their investment in a fund product, the corresponding unamortised placement fee is written off.
The placement fees intangible isalso subject to impairment testing semi-annually to ensure that the future economic benefit arising from each fund product is in excess of the remainingunamortised balance.
Amortisation expense, amounts written off, and any impairment losses, are included in distribution costs in the Groupincome statement.
During the prior year $88 million of external and internal capitalised placement fees were impaired.
The weighted average remaining period of the unamortised placement fees at 31 December 2013 is 1.5 years 31 December 2012: 2.9 years.
From a capital management perspective capital is held against the unamortised balance of placement fees based on an evaluation of the risk of an accelerated amortisation or impairment charge relating to poor investment performance or early redemptions.
From a regulatory capital perspective placement fees are an intangible asset and are required to be supported by Tier 1 regulatory capital.
Capitalised computer software Costs that are directly associated with the procurement or development of identifiable and unique software products, which will generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as capitalised computer software.
Capitalised computer software is amortised on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life three years and is subject to regular impairment reviews.
Amortisation of capitalised computer software is included in Other costs in the Group income statement.
Cash, liquidity and borrowings Liquidity and borrowings Total liquidity resources aggregated to $2,517 million at 31 December 2013 2012: $3,525 million and comprised cash and cash equivalents of $992million 2012: $2,000 million and the undrawn committed revolving credit facility of $1,525 million 2012: $1,525 million.
Cash and cash equivalents atyear end comprises $291 million 2012: $268 million of cash at bank on hand, $nil of treasury bills 2012: $1,153 million, and $701 million 2012: $579million in short-term deposits, net of overdrafts of nil 2012: nil.
Cash ring-fenced for regulated entities totalled $16 million 2012: $303 million.
Liquidity resources support on-going operations and potential liquidity requirements under stressed scenarios.
The amount of potential liquidity requirements is modelled based on scenarios that assume stressed market and economic conditions.
With the exception of committed purchase arrangements Note 28.1, the funding requirements for Man relating to the investment management process are discretionary.
The liquidity profile ofMan is monitored on a daily basis and the stressed scenarios are updated regularly.
The Board reviews Mans funding resources at each Board meeting and on an annual basis as part of the strategic planning process.
Mans available liquidity is considered sufficient to cover current requirements and potential requirements under stressed scenarios.
Strategic report 83 Corporate governance Man Group plc Financial statements Annual Report 2013 Other information Cash is invested in accordance with strict limits consistent with the Boards risk appetite, which consider both the security and availability of liquidity.
Accordingly, cash is invested in short-term US Treasury bills and is held in short-term bank deposits and on-demand deposit bank accounts.

Borrowings are initially recorded at fair value net of transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
The difference between the amount repayable at maturity on the borrowings and the carrying value is amortised over the period up to the expected maturity of the associated debt in accordance with the effective interest rate method.
At 31 December 2013, the fair value of borrowings was nil 2012: $826 million.
On 7 May 2013, the 216 million $285 million senior 2015 fixed rate bonds were repurchased at a premium of $23 million.
This premium, along with an accelerated unwind of issue costs and fees of $2 million, has been included in finance expense for the period.
The $231 million Tier 2 subordinated 2017 fixed rate bonds were repurchased at a premium of $3 million on 14 June 2013.
There were no fees payable on the repurchase of the $170 million Tier 2 subordinated 2015 floating rate notes, which took place on 24 June 2013.
On 1 August 2013, the $173 million senior 2013 fixed rate bonds were redeemed at par value.
On 7 August 2013, the $300 million Tier 1 perpetual capital securities were redeemed at par value.
The committed revolving credit facility of $1,525 million was put in place during July 2011 as a five year facility and includes the option for Man to ask the banks to extend the maturity date by a year on each of the first and second anniversaries.
The participant banks have the option to accept or decline Mans request.
Before the second anniversary in July 2013 the banks were asked to extend the maturity date of the facility by a further year.
Banks with participations totalling $1,335 million accepted the request and as a result $70 million of the facility is currently scheduled to mature in July 2016, $120 million in July 2017, and $1,335 million in July 2018.
Disclosures in relation to financial guarantees and commitments are included in Note 28.
Foreign exchange and interest rate risk Man is subject to risk from changes in interest rates or foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities.
A 10% strengthening weakening of the US dollar against all other currencies, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a foreign exchange loss gain of $2 million 2012: $8 million loss gain, with a corresponding impact on equity.
In respect of Mans monetary assets and liabilities which earn incur interest indexed to floating rates, as at 31 December 2013, a 50bp increase decrease in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a $3million increase or a $1 million decrease 2012: $4 million increase or $1 million decrease in net interest income.

Loans to fund products Loans to fund products are short-term advances primarily to Man guaranteed products, which are made to assist with the financing of the leverage associated with the structured products.
The loans are repayable on demand and are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The average balance during the year was $238 million 2012: $332 million.
Loans to fund products have decreased compared to the prior year as the guaranteed product FUM has decreased together with the associated leveraging.
The liquidity requirements of the guaranteed products together with commitments to provide financial support Note 28 which give rise to loans to funds are subject to our routine liquidity stress testing and any liquidity requirements are met by available cash resources, or the committed revolving credit facility.
Loans to fund products expose Man to credit risk and therefore the credit decision making process is subject to limits consistent with the Boards risk appetite.
The carrying value represents Mans maximum exposure to this credit risk.
Loans are closely monitored against the assets held in the funds.
The largest single loan to a fund product was $12 million 2012: $21 million.
Fund entities are not externally rated, but our internal modelling indicates that fund products have a probability of default that is equivalent to a credit rating of A.
Other investments in fund products Man uses capital to invest in our fund products as part of our on-going business to build our product breadth and to trial investment research developments before we market the products to investors.
These investments are generally held for less than one year.
Where due to the level of investment Man is deemed not to control the fund, these are classified as other investments in fund products.
Other investments in fund products are classified primarily at fair value through profit or loss, with movements in fair value being recognised through gains losses on investments and other financial instruments.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade date.
Other investments in fund products are not actively traded and the valuation at the fund level cannot be determined by reference to other available prices.
The fair values of investments in fund products are derived from the reported net asset values NAVs of each of the fund products, which in turn are based upon the value of the underlying assets held within each of the fund products and the timings of being able to redeem the fund product.
The valuation of the underlying assets within each fund product is determined by external valuation service providers VSPs based on an agreed valuation policy and methodology.
Whilst these valuations are performed independently of Man, Man has established oversight procedures and due diligence processes to ensure that the net asset values reported by the VSPs are reliable and appropriate.
Man makes adjustments to NAVs where the timing of being able to redeem the fund product or events or circumstances indicate that the NAVs are not reflective of fair value.
The fair value hierarchy of financial assets is disclosed in Note 26.
Other investments in fund products expose Man to market risk and therefore the commitment process is subject to limits consistent with the Boards risk appetite.
The largest single investment in fund products was $50 million 2012: $46 million.
The market risk from other investments in fund products and other investments is modelled using a value at risk VaR methodology using a 95% confidence interval and 1 month time horizon.
The VaR is estimated to be $7 million at 31 December 2013 2012: $6 million.
The total net gain on investments in fund products reported in the Group income statement was $28 million 2012: $23 million.
Strategic report 85 Corporate governance Man Group plc Financial statements Annual Report 2013 Other information Fund investment for deferred compensation arrangements At year end, investment in fund products included $61 million 2012: $51 million of Man and GLG fund products related to deferred compensation arrangements.
Employees are subject to mandatory deferral arrangements and as part of these arrangements employees can elect deferral into a designated series of Man fund products.
The changes in the fair value of the fund product awards are recognised over the relevant vesting period, which means the compensation expense changes based on the value of the designated fund products.
The fund product investments are held to offset this change in compensation during the vesting period and at vesting the value of the fund investment is delivered to the employee.
The fund product investments are recorded at fair value with any unrealised gain loss during the vesting period charged to gains losses on investments and other financial instruments in the Group income statement.
Other investments Sale of Lehman claims In the prior year, on 16 November 2012, the Group entered into a series of transactions with Hutchinson Investors LLC, managed by the Baupost Group, to sell the residual exposure to the Lehman estates Lehman claims that it acquired in July 2011 from certain GLG managed funds.
The total consideration for the transactions was $456 million, and resulted in a gain on sale of $131 million Note 2.
A further $5 million was then received in 2013 as overall recoveries by the buyer exceeded certain thresholds.
Man provided guarantees of up to $75 million Note 28 to the funds for prompt payment by the Baupost Group of amounts owed to the funds in the event of a successful claim.
Non-current assets held for sale Seed capital invested into funds may at times be significant, and therefore the fund may be deemed to be controlled by the Group.
Where the Group acquired the controlling stake exclusively with a view to subsequent disposal through sale or dilution and it is considered highly probable that it will relinquish control within a year, the investment in the controlled fund is classified as held for sale.
The seeded fund is recognised in the Group balance sheet as non-current assets and liabilities held for sale, with the interests of any other parties included within non-current liabilities held for sale.
The non-current liabilities held for sale in 2013 relate to derivatives, which are offset against the assets in the fund.
Amounts recognised are measured at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The non-current assets and liabilities held for sale were as follows: 31 December 31 December $m 2013 2012 Non-current assets held for sale 56 Non-current liabilities held for sale 6 Investments in fund products held for sale 50 Investments held for sale cease to be classified as held for sale when the fund is no longer controlled by the Group, at which time they are classified asfinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss Note 15.2.
Loss of control may eventuate through sale of the investment or a dilution in the Groups holding.
If a held for sale fund remains under the control of the Group for more than one year, and it is unlikely that the Group will reduce or no longer control its investment in the short-term, it will cease to be classified as held for sale and will be consolidated on a line-by-line basis.

Fee receivables and accrued income represent management and performance fees from fund products and are received in cash when the funds NAV is determined.
All fees are deducted from the NAV of the respective funds by the independent administrators and therefore the credit risk of fee receivables is minimal.
No balances were overdue or delinquent at year end.
For the Open Ended Investment Collective OEIC Funds businesses, Man acts as the intermediary for the collection of subscriptions due from customers and payable to the funds, and for redemption requests receivable from funds and payable to customers.
At 31 December 2013 the amount included in other receivables is $27 million 2012: $29 million.
The unsettled fund payable is recorded in trade and other payables.

Fee and other receivables continued In limited circumstances, the Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its risk associated with foreign exchange movements.
Derivative financial instruments, which consist primarily of foreign exchange contracts, are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
The notional value of the derivative financial assets was $265 million 2012: $599 million.
All derivatives are held with external banks with ratings of A or higher and mature within one year.
During the year, there were $18 million net realised and unrealised gains arising from derivatives 2012: $18 million net gains.

In January 2013, Man reduced its holding in Nephila from 25% to 18.75%, realising a gain on disposal of $10 million, which is included asan adjusting item Note 2.
Additions of $2 million in the year relate to the acquisition of a 20% holding in OFI MGA a French asset manager.
Associates are entities in which Man holds an interest and over which it has significant influence but not control.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method at cost plus or minus our share of cumulative post-acquisition movements in undistributed profits or losses.
Gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the entities.
At each reporting date it is determined whether there is any objective evidence that an investment in the associate is impaired.
Impairment is calculated as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and expensed in the Group income statement.
Where Man has investments in certain fund entities over which it is able to exert significant influence but not control, these are classified as associates.
Man has applied the scope exclusion within IAS 28 Investments in Associates for mutual funds, unit trusts and similar entities and has classified such holdings as investments and measured them at fair value through profit or loss Note 15.
Details of associates will be annexed in the Companys annual return.

Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful life, which for leasehold improvements is over the shorter of the life of the lease and the improvement and for equipment is between 3 and 10 years.
The accelerated depreciation of $43 million during the year relates to the assets no longer being used following the sub-letting of space in Riverbank House our main London headquarters.
In prior year, additions primarily relate to the fit-out of the New York office and reclassifications relate to the completion and capitalisation of Mans new data centre facility.
Deferred compensation arrangements Man operates cash and equity-settled share-based payment schemes as well as fund product based compensation arrangements.
Details of these schemes may be found in the Directors Remuneration report on pages 40 to 59.
During the year, $70 million 2012: $101 million was included in compensation costs for share-based payment and deferred fund product plans, splitbetween equity-settled share-based payments of $35 million 2012: $74 million, cash-settled share-based payments totalling $1 million 2012: $4million, and deferred fund product plans of $34 million 2012: $23 million.
In respect of equity-settled share-based payment schemes, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the share awards and options granted is recognised as an expense, with the corresponding credit being recognised in equity.
The fair value of the share awards and options granted in exchange for employee services is calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model that takes into account the effect of both financial and demographic assumptions.
Forfeiture and early vesting are based upon historical observable data.
The fair values per option and award granted during the period to employees and the assumptions used in the calculations are presented below.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares and options awarded granted.
Changes to the original estimates, if any, are included in the Group income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Man also operates compensation plans in which deferred compensation is invested in fund products managed by Man.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the fund units is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding liability.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards, re-measured at each reporting date until the settlement date is reached.
The fair value of the awards equates to the fair value of the underlying fund products at the settlement date.
20.1 Employee Trusts The Employee Trusts have the obligation to deliver shares, options and fund product based payments which have been granted to employees.
Mancontributed funds, in order for the Trusts to meet their current period obligations, of $27 million 2012: $25 million in the year.
The Trusts are fully consolidated into Man and shares held are treated as treasury shares for EPS purposes.
The shares held by the Trusts are deducted from Tier 1 Capital.
The Employee Trusts are controlled by independent trustees and their assets are held separately from those of Man.
At31 December 2013 the net assets of the employee trusts amounted to $36 million 2012: $43 million.
These assets include 29,681,372 2012: 40,762,323 ordinary shares in the Company, $31 million notional value options over Man shares 2012: $35 million, and $36 million fund units to deliver against the future obligations 2012: $26 million.
The shares are recorded at cost and shown as a deduction from shareholders funds.

Capital management Investor confidence is an important element in the sustainability of our business.
That confidence comes, in part, from the strength of our capital base.
Man has maintained significant surplus capital and available liquidity throughout the recent periods of financial crisis.
This capital has given Man flexibility to support our investors, intermediaries and financial partners and to allow them to make informed decisions regarding their investment exposures.
This confidence gives our business credibility and sustainability.
We have a conservative capital and liquidity framework which allows us to invest in the growth of our business.
We utilise capital to support the operation of the investment management process and the launch of new fund products.
We view this as a competitive advantage which allows us to directly align our interests with those of investors and intermediaries.
Man monitors its capital requirements through continuous review of its regulatory and economic capital, including monthly reporting to the Finance Committee and the Board.
Share capital and capital reserves Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Own shares held through the Employee Trusts are recorded at cost, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of tax, and are deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are transferred to employees or sold.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
Ordinary shares 3 3 7 7 Ordinary shares have a par value of 3 US cents per share 2012: 3 US cents per share and represent 99.9% of issued share capital.
All issued shares are fully paid.
The shares have attached to them full voting, dividend and capital distribution including on wind up rights.
They do not confer any rights of redemption.
Ordinary shareholders have the right to receive notice of, attend, vote and speak at general meetings.
A holder of ordinary shares is entitled to one vote per ordinary share held when a vote is taken on a poll and one vote only when a vote is taken on a show of hands.
During the year ended 31 December 2013, no shares were repurchased during the year 2012: 3,332,756.
As at 26 February 2014, Man had an unexpired authority to purchase further shares up to a maximum amount of 182,179,028 ordinary shares.
A resolution to allow the purchase of 182,373,308 ordinary shares, representing 10% of the issued share capital, will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Deferred sterling shares 50,000 unlisted deferred sterling shares, representing 0.1% of the Companys issued share capital with a par value of 1 per share, were issued due to the redenomination of the ordinary share capital into US dollars.
These shares are necessary for the Company to continue to comply with Section 763 of the Companies Act 2006.
The deferred sterling shares are freely transferable and have no rights to participate in the profits of the Company, to attend, speak or vote at any general meeting and no right to participate in any distribution in a winding up except for a return of the nominal value in certain limited circumstances.
New Group holding company in 2012 A new holding company was incorporated in the prior year, on 8 August 2012, and became the new listed holding company of the Man Group on 6November 2012 via a Court approved scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006.
The former holding company was renamed Man Strategic Holdings plc and the new holding company assumed the name Man Group plc.
Under the scheme of arrangement, shares in the former holding company of the Group were cancelled.
The same number of new ordinary shares were issued to the new holding company in consideration for the allotment to shareholders of one ordinary share of $1.07 in that new holding company 3 7 for each ordinary share of 3 US cents they had held in the former holding company.
On 8 November 2012, Man Group plc effected a reduction of its share capital to create distributable reserves, as sanctioned by the High Court of the 3 7 United Kingdom.
This capital reduction reduced the nominal value of ordinary shares in the new holding company from $1.07 to 3 US cents.

92 Man Group plc Annual Report 2013 Financial statements continued 22.
Pension benefits Man operates 12 2012: 12 defined contribution plans and two 2012: two funded defined benefit plans.
Defined contribution plans Man pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
Man has no further payment obligation once the contributions have been paid.
Defined contribution pension costs totalled $8 million for the year to 31December 2013 2012: $10 million.
The contributions are recognised as pension costs when they are due.
Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan creates a financial obligation to provide funding to the pension plan to provide a retired employee with pension benefits usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
As with the vast majority of similar arrangements, Man ultimately underwrites the risks related to the defined benefit plans.
These risks include investment risks and demographic risks, such as members living longer than expected.
The two defined benefit plans operated are the Man Group plc Pension Fund in the UK the UK Plan and the Man Group Pension Plan in Switzerland theSwiss Plan.
At 31 December 2013, the UK plan comprised 89% 31 December 2012: 86% of the Groups total defined benefit pension obligations.
The UK Plan is approved by HMRC for tax purposes, and is operated separately from Man and managed by an independent set of trustees.
Thetrustees are responsible for payment of the benefits and management of the UK Plans assets.
Under UK regulations, Man and the trustees of the UK Plan are required to agree a funding strategy and contribution schedule for the UK Plan.
The latest funding valuation of the UK Plan was carried out by independent qualified actuaries as at 31 December 2011 and indicated a deficit of 45million, after including 49 million of assets in the Reservoir Trust.
To remove the funding deficit, Man agreed to make three cash payments of 11.8 million at 31 March 2013, 2014 and 2016, with a further lump sum to be contributed from the Reservoir Trust in March 2018 of up to 69.0 million to cover any remaining funding deficit.
Cash contributions of 12.6 million were made to the UK Plan and asset contributions of 20 million were made to the Reservoir Trust in the year to 31 December 2013.
If the contributions currently agreed are insufficient to pay the benefits due, Man will need to make further contributions.
In order to maintain flexibility with regards to the funding of the UK Plan, Man set up the Man Group Reservoir Trust the Reservoir Trust in 2010.
Man contributed $76 million 50 million of assets to the Reservoir Trust on 31 March 2010 and has committed to ensure the Reservoir Trust value remains at least 69 million from 1 April 2013 or at the level of the funding deficit in the UK Plan, if lower.
The Reservoir Trust gives the pension trustees comfort that Man can fund a deficit at 31 December 2017 and in the event that the UK Plan is fully funded, allows Man to recover the assets so that the UK Plan is not over funded.
The UK plan was closed to new members in May 1999, and to future accrual in May 2011.
Employed members of the UK plan retain enhanced benefits, including a link to salary, on their accrued benefits in the UK plan.
Future benefits are provided via a defined contribution plan.
In Switzerland, the Group operates a retirement foundation with assets which are held separately from the Group.
This foundation covers the majority of employees in Switzerland and provides benefits on a cash balance basis.
From 1 January 2014 the financing vehicle was changed, and from this date the assets and liabilities were transferred to a multi-employer vehicle called Vita Invest, with the assets and liabilities segregated from those of the other employers.
A number of other changes were made to the structure of benefits, resulting in a past service credit recognised in 2013.
Each employee has a retirement account to which the employee and the Group make contributions at rates set out in the plan rules based on a percentage of salary.
Every year the pension fund commission composed of employer and employee representatives decides the level of interest, ifany, to apply to retirement accounts based on their agreed policy.
At retirement an employee can take their retirement account or have this paid as apension.
The amounts recognised in the Group balance sheet are determined as follows: 31 December 31 December 2012 1 $m 2013 Restated Present value of funded obligations 413 417 Fair value of plan assets 484 413 Net pension asset liability in the Group balance sheet at year end 71 4 Note: 1 Refer to Note 1 for details of the adoption of IAS 19 Revised.

The UK Plans investment strategy is broadly split into growth and matching portfolios.
At the beginning of 2013 the matching portfolio was invested primarily in gilts, along with some corporate bond investments.
These were intended to partially match the movement in the UK Plans liabilities, and therefore remove some interest and inflation rate risk.
In January, the trustees of the UK Plan switched the gilts portfolio into liability driven investments LDI funds, which provide a better match for the Plans liabilities, in order to increase protection against interest and inflation rate risk.
Over the course of 2013 the level of interest and inflation rate hedging was gradually increased.
As the Swiss Plan is essentially a defined contribution plan with guarantees, the assets held aim to be at least as much as the total of the member account balances at any point in time.
Member account balances cannot reduce, but interest is only applied to the account balances when sufficient surplus assets are available.
As such there is no specific asset liability matching strategy in place, but if the liabilities i. e. the sum of the member account balances ever exceed the value of the assets, the Company will consider how to remove a deficit as quickly as possible.
Segmental analysis The criteria for identifying an operating segment is that it is a component of Man whose results are regularly reviewed by the Board and the Executive Committee to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance.
Management information regarding revenues, gross management fee margins, investment performance and distribution costs relevant to the operation of the investment managers, products and the investor base are reviewed by the Board and the Executive Committee.
A centralised shared infrastructure for operations, product structuring and distribution means that operating costs are not allocated to constituent parts of the investment management businesses.
As a result, resources are allocated and performance is assessed by the Board and the Executive Committee on the basis of the investment management business of Man as a whole.
Accordingly we operate and report as a single segment investment management business, together with relevant information regarding FUM flows, gross margins, and distribution costs to allow for the analysis of the direct contribution of products and the respective investor base.
Geographical disclosure Disclosure of revenue by geographic location is required by IFRS based on the registered domicile of the fund entity paying Man fees.

Foreign currencies The majority of revenues, assets, liabilities and funding are denominated in US dollars USD and therefore Mans presentation currency is USD.
The assets and liabilities of consolidated entities that have a functional currency other than USD are translated into USD at the balance sheet date rate.
Income and expenses are translated at the average rate for the period in which the transactions occur.
Exchange differences which arise are recorded in other comprehensive income.
For consolidated entities with a USD functional currency, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at each balance sheet date rate.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at the spot rate at the date of the transaction or if appropriate the average rate for the month in which the transaction occurs.
Resulting exchange differences are recognised in the Group income statement.
Fair value of financial assets liabilities Man discloses the fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities using three levels, as follows: Level 1.
Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities can be analysed as follows: 31 December 2013 31 December 2012 $m Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Financial assets held at fair value: Investments in fund products and other investments Note 15 5 102 67 174 4 96 122 222 Derivative financial instruments Note 16 20 20 14 14 5 122 67 194 4 110 122 236 Financial liabilities held at fair value: Derivative financial instruments 1 1 2 2 Contingent consideration Note 17 44 44 60 60 1 44 45 2 60 62 During the year, there were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances that affected the fair value of Mans financial assets andno significant transfers of financial assets or liabilities held at fair value between categories.
For investments in fund products, Level 2 investments comprise holdings primarily in unlisted, open-ended, active and liquid funds, such as seeding investments, which have weekly or daily pricing derived from third party information.
A transfer into Level 3 would be deemed to occur where the level of prolonged activity, as evidenced by subscriptions and redemptions, is deemed insufficient to support a Level 2 classification.
This, as well as other factors such as a deterioration of liquidity in the underlying investments, would result in a Level 3 classification.
The material holdings within this category are priced on a recurring basis based on information supplied by third parties without adjustment.
Liquidity premium adjustments of $6 million 2012: $8 million have been applied to gated, suspended, sidepocketed or otherwise illiquid Level 3 investments.
The range of liquidity premium adjustments is from 18% to 38% based on the expected timeframe for exit.
Alarger liquidity adjustment is applied where the exit is further in the future.
Reasonable changes in the liquidity premium assumptions would not havea significant impact on the fair value.
The fair value of non-current assets and liabilities held for sale Note 15.4 are equal to the carrying values of $56 million and $6 million respectively, and would be classified within Level 2.
Strategic report 97 Corporate governance Man Group plc Financial statements Annual Report 2013 Other information The basis of measuring the fair value of Level 3 investments is outlined in Note 15.
Movement in Level 3 financial assets and financial liabilities, measured at fair value, during the year can be analysed as follows: Year ended 31 December 2013 Year ended 31 December 2012 Financial Financial assets at fair Available-forassets at fair Available-forvalue through sale financial value through sale financial $m profit or loss assets Total profit or loss assets Total Level 3 financial assets held at fair value At beginning of the year 117 5 122 183 339 522 Purchases 24 24 52 52 Total gains losses in the Group statement of comprehensive income 16 2 18 17 18 35 Included in profit loss for the year 16 2 18 17 1 16 Included in other comprehensive income 19 19 Sales or settlements 82 6 88 137 352 489 Transfers into Level 3 - 3 3 Transfers out of Level 3 9 9 1 1 At year end 66 1 67 117 5 122 Total gains losses for the period included in the Group statement of comprehensive income for assets held at year end 16 1 15 17 17 Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December $m 2013 2012 Level 3 financial liabilities held at fair value At beginning of the year 60 Purchases 87 Total gains in the Group statement of comprehensive income 2 21 Included in profit loss for the year 2 21 Included in other comprehensive income Settlements 13 6 Other adjustments 5 At year end 44 60 Total gains for the year included in the Group statement of comprehensive income for liabilities held at year end 2 6 The financial liabilities in Level 3 relate to the contingent consideration payable to former shareholders of FRM Holdings Limited.
The fair value is based on a discounted cash flow calculation, based on the expected run rate management fee level for the legacy FRM business up to three years after the original acquisition date of July 2012, and is determined using a combination of inputs, such as weighted average cost of capital, high water mark levels, net management fee margins and the growth in FUM.
The discount rates applied are 11% for management fees and 17% for performance fees.
The most significant inputs into the valuation relate to the expectations of the weighted average net management fee margin over the future period of 0.8% and the compound growth in average FUM over three years of 5.6%.
If the net management fee margin for FRM legacy funds decreased from 0.8% to 0.7%, the fair value of the contingent consideration creditor would decrease by $5 million, with a corresponding further gain of $5 million in the Group income statement.
If the compound average growth in FUM over three years decreased by 2%, from 5.6% to 3.6%, the fair value of the contingent consideration creditor would decrease by $3 million, with a corresponding further gain of $3 million in the Group income statement.
