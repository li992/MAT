21a Credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: 2013 2012 $m $m Non-current assets: HDSA receivable 399 381 Other financial assets 31 37 Current assets: Trade receivables 24 33 Other receivables 54 43 Tax recoverable 4 3 Cash and cash equivalents 201 315 713 812 HDSA receivable The HDSA receivable as described in note 14 is secured on shares in the HDSA borrower, Lexshell 806 Investments Proprietary Limited, a subsidiary of Shanduka Resources Proprietary Limited.
The HDSA borrowers only asset of value is its ultimate shareholding in Incwala.
The value of the security is $403 million at 30 September 2013.
As Incwalas principal assets are investments in WPL, EPL and Akanani, all subsidiaries of Lonmin Plc, the value in use models for the Marikana and Akanani CGUs as described in note 1 under Impairment of non-financial assets are applied to determine the value of Incwala and in turn, the value of the HDSA borrower the security.
Key assumptions to the value in use models are described in note 1 under Impairment of non-financial assets.
Any downward changes in the key assumptions would affect the value of the security which would lead to an impairment of the receivable as follows: Assumption Movement in assumption Impairment of receivable Metal prices 10% $136m ZAR:USD exchange rate 10% $106m Discount rate 100 basis points $49m www.
com 136 Lonmin Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts 21 Financial risk management continued 21a Credit risk continued Trade receivables The Group is exposed to significant trade receivable credit risk through the sale of PGM metals to a limited group of customers.
This risk is managed as follows: aged analysis is performed on trade receivable balances and reviewed on a monthly basis: credit ratings are obtained on any new customers and the credit ratings of existing customers are monitored on an ongoing basis: credit limits are set for customers: and trigger points and escalation procedures are clearly defined.
It should be noted that a significant portion of Lonmins revenue is from two key customers.
However, both of these customers have strong investment grade ratings and their payment terms are very short, thereby reducing trade receivable credit risk significantly.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic location was: 2013 2012 $m $m Asia 4 6 Europe 6 10 South Africa 14 17 24 33 The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was as follows: 2013 2012 Gross Provision Net Gross Provision Net $m $m $m $m $m $m Not past due 24 24 33 33 Banking counterparties Banking counterparty credit risk is managed by spreading financial transactions across an approved list of counterparties of high credit quality.
Banking counterparties are approved by the Board and consist of the ten banks that have participated in Lonmins existing bank debt facilities as described in note 18.
21b Liquidity risk and capital management Liquidity risk The policy on overall liquidity is to ensure that the Group has sufficient funds to facilitate all ongoing operations.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments and excluding the impact of netting agreements: Carrying Contractual 1 1 to 2 2 to 5 5 amount cash flows year years years years 30 September 2013 $m $m $m $m $m $m Financial liabilities: Trade and other payables 295 295 295 Carrying Contractual 1 1 to 2 2 to 5 5 amount cash flows year years years years 30 September 2012 $m $m $m $m $m $m Financial liabilities: Unsecured bank loans 742 840 152 80 608 Trade and other payables 328 328 328 Derivative financial instruments 15 15 5 5 5 01 Strategic Report 02 Governance 03 Financial Statements 04 A Deeper Look 05 Shareholder Information Lonmin Plc 137 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts 21 Financial risk management continued 21b Liquidity risk and capital management continued Capital management The Groups philosophy on capital management is to maintain a low level of financial gearing given the exposure of the business to fluctuations in PGM commodity prices and the Rand US Dollar exchange rate.
The Group funds its operations through a mixture of equity funding and bank borrowings.
The table below presents quantitative data for the components the Group manages as capital: 2013 2012 $m $m Equity shareholders funds 3,409 2,488 Loans and borrowings 736 Cash and cash equivalents 201 315 At 30 September 3,208 2,909 As part of the annual budgeting and long-term planning process, the Groups cash flow forecast is reviewed and approved by the Board.
The cash flow forecast is amended for any material changes identified during the year, for example material acquisitions and disposals.
Where funding requirements are identified from the cash flow forecast, appropriate measures are taken to ensure these requirements can be satisfied.
Factors taken into consideration are: the size and nature of the requirement: preferred sources of finance applying key criteria of cost, commitment, availability, security covenant conditions: recommended counterparties, fees and market conditions: and covenants, guarantees and other financial commitments.
In December 2012, Lonmin Plc successfully concluded a Rights Issue which raised net proceeds of $767 million see note 31.
In conjunction with the Rights Issue, Lonmin Plc negotiated certain amendments to the terms of the Groups existing debt facilities.
The proceeds of the Rights Issue were utilised to reduce the Groups debt exposure.
21c Foreign currency risk The Groups operations are essentially based in South Africa and the majority of the revenue stream is in US Dollars.
However, the bulk of the Groups operating costs and taxes are paid in Rand.
Most of the cash received in South Africa is in US Dollars.
A majority of the Groups funding sources are in US Dollars.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on monetary items that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant Group entity.
The table below shows the extent to which Group companies have monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant Group entity.
Foreign exchange differences on retranslation of such assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement.

com 138 Lonmin Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts 21 Financial risk management continued 21c Foreign currency risk continued The principal exchange rates impacting the Groups results are Rand Dollar and Sterling Dollar.
Details of average exchange rates and closing exchange rates can be found in the Operating Statistics.
The Group also carries a $388 million Rand denominated deferred tax liability on the balance sheet which is exposed to currency risk 2012 $461 million.
Our current policy is not to hedge Rand US Dollar currency exposures and, therefore, fluctuations in the Rand to US Dollar exchange rate can have a significant impact on the Groups results.
A strengthening of the Rand against the US Dollar has an adverse effect on profits due to the majority of operating costs being paid in Rand.
The approximate effects on the Groups results of a 10% movement in the Rand to US Dollar 2013 average and closing exchange rate would be as follows: 2013 2012 Underlying operating profit loss $130m $117m Underlying profit loss for the year $81m $69m Equity $81m $69m EPS cents 15.2c 18.1c These sensitivities are based on 2013 prices, costs and volumes and assume all other variables remain constant.
21d Interest rate risk The bulk of our borrowing facilities are in US Dollars and at floating rates of interest.
The interest position is kept under constant review in conjunction with the liquidity policy outlined in note 21b and the future funding requirements of the business.
Based on contracted maturities the following amounts are exposed to interest rate risk over future years as shown below: Weighted average interest rate in 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 % $m $m $m $m Liabilities: i Unsecured bank loans 5.9 Non-interest bearing At floating interest rates At fixed interest rates 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 $m $m $m $m $m $m Financial assets: US Dollar 10 36 162 148 SA Rand 72 43 50 185 Sterling 2 399 381 Other 17 19 1 99 98 215 333 399 381 Non-interest bearing At floating interest rates At fixed interest rates 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 $m $m $m $m $m $m Financial liabilities: US Dollar 6 39 212 300 SA Rand 284 284 245 Sterling 5 5 Other 295 328 457 300 Footnote: i Figures are based on facilities outstanding at the financial reporting date.

21e Commodity price risk Our policy is not to hedge commodity price exposure on PGMs, except Gold, and therefore any change in prices will have a direct effect on the Groups trading results.
For base metals and gold, hedging is undertaken where the Board determines that it is in the Groups interest to hedge a proportion of future cash flows.
The policy is to hedge up to a maximum of 75% of the future cash flows from the sale of these products looking forward over the next 12 to 24 months.
The Group did not undertake any hedging of base metals under this authority in the financial year and no forward contracts were in place in respect of base metals at the end of the year.
In 2012 the Group undertook a pre-paid sale of Gold.
Refer to note 20 for details.
The approximate effects on the Groups results of a 10% movement in the 2013 average metal prices achieved for Platinum Pt $1,517 per ounce, Palladium Pd $715 per ounce and Rhodium Rh $1,097 per ounce would be as follows: 2013 2012 Pt Pd Rh Pt Pd Rh Underlying operating profit loss $106m $22m $9m $106m $21m $15m Underlying profit loss for the year $66m $14m $5m $63m $12m $9m Equity $66m $14m $5m $63m $12m $9m EPS cents 17.2c 3.7c 1.4c 16.5c 3.2c 2.3c These sensitivities are based on 2013 prices, costs and volumes and assume all other variables remain constant.
21f Fair values The fair values of financial assets and liabilities, together with the carrying amounts shown in the statement of financial position, are as follows: 2013 2012 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair amount value amount value $m $m $m $m Other financial assets 31 31 37 37 HDSA receivable 399 399 381 381 Trade and other receivables 78 78 76 76 Tax recoverable 44 33 Cash and cash equivalents 201 201 315 315 Financial assets 713 713 812 812 Trade and other payables 295 295 328 328 Unsecured bank loans 742 742 Derivative financial instruments 15 15 Financial liabilities 295 295 1,085 1,085 Net financial assets liabilities 418 418 273 273 Listed investments within other financial assets are marked to market.
The unlisted investment is at Directors valuation and the residual balances in available for sale financial assets relate to cash deposits held in respect of rehabilitation obligations for which carrying values are at fair value.
The HDSA receivable represents loans held at amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments are held at fair value.
For cash and cash equivalents the carrying value is equal to fair value.
For trade and other receivables and trade and other payables these are typically due within one month and therefore the carrying amount is fair value.
For unsecured bank loans there is considered to be no material difference between the carrying amount and fair value.
Amounts are shown gross of unamortised bank fees unless the unamortised bank fees relate to undrawn facilities in which case they are treated as other receivables.
