The objective of market risk is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, whilst optimizing the return on risk.
a Foreign currency risk The Group transacts licence and development agreements with customers and purchases of products for Pure primarily in US Dollars and, therefore, the Groups earnings are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
The Group reviews its foreign exchange exposure on a regular basis and, if there is a material exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and the Board considers it appropriate, the Group will reduce the risk by currency hedging on net receivable payable balances.
Forward contracts are entered into with the objective of matching their maturity with currency receipt.
During the period the total value of currency contracts entered into amounted to 61,722,000 91 2012: 6,182,000.
As at 30 April 2013 the outstanding currency contracts amounted to 33,437,000 2012: 7,993,000.
The fair value of these outstanding currency contracts was 991,000 2012: 44,000.
The movement in fair value of 947,000 has been recognized within finance income in the period.
The majority of the other assets and liabilities are held within foreign subsidiaries in the respective local currencies.
The majority of the USD cash and cash equivalents balance is to settle a pre acquisition tax liability of MIPS.
The Group has a number of overseas business operations and operates in a number of foreign currencies which give rise to transactional and translational foreign exchange risk.
The most important foreign currency to the Group is the US Dollar.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group transacts a large proportion of its revenues and costs in US Dollars.
Taking all income and expenditure in US Dollars into account, management have appraised that for the financial year to 30 April 2013, each additional one cent increase or decrease in the US Dollar exchange rate against Sterling would have decreased or increased revenues by circa 725,000 2012: 615,000 and profit by circa 436,000 2012: 395,000. b Interest rate risk The Groups earnings may be affected by changes in interest rates available on bank deposits.
The Group aims to maximize returns from funds held on deposit and uses market deposits with major clearing banks accordingly.
With the current level of bank deposits, the impact of a change in interest rates is not considered material.
In respect of income-earning financial assets and interest bearing financial liabilities, the following table indicates their average effective interest rate at the reporting date and the periods in which they mature or, if earlier, reprice.
The fixed rate cash deposits were placed with banks throughout the year and earned interest of between 0.00% and 0.51%.
Floating rate cash earns interest based on LIBID equivalents.
Short term receivables and payables are not interest bearing with the exception of the short term element of the long term loan.
The Group repaid its two long term loans and took out a new loan during the year with a balance of 30,952,000 at the balance sheet date.
The loan floats at 1.5% above quarterly LIBOR and the unexpired term is 3 years and 3 months.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis In the financial year to 30 April 2013, if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit would have been increased by circa 255,000 2012: 466,000.
Similarly, if interest rates had been 100 basis points lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit would have been decreased by circa 133,000 2012: 247,000. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investment of liquid funds.
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in liquid securities and only with counter parties that have a high credit rating.
Capital risk The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximizing the return to stakeholders as well as sustaining the future development of the business.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may consider the total amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issued new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Groups overall strategy remains unchanged from the previous financial year.
93 The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 14, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to the parent.
The latter comprises share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 16 and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The CFO regularly monitors the capital risk on behalf of the Board.
Trade receivables The exposure to credit risk is mitigated by selling to a diverse range of customers.
The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers prior to sales taking place.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk either by customer or by geography.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet.
Gross Impairment Gross Impairment 2013 2013 2012 2012 Ageing of trade receivables: 000 000 000 000 Not past due 27,398 19,565 Past due 0-90 days 4,174 3,939 Past due greater than 90 days 2,268 1,578 125 33,840 25,082 125 Trade receivables that are less than three months overdue are generally not considered impaired.
Receivables more than three months overdue are considered on a line by line basis and a provision is made where recovery is considered doubtful.
No other financial assets are past due.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
To minimize this risk the Group only invests funds in liquid securities.
As a contingency, the Group maintains a 3 million overdraft and 20 million revolving credit facility.
The following table is drawn up based on undiscounted contractual maturities including both interest and principal cashflows.

Available for sale investments Fair value hierarchy The Group measures the fair value of available for sale investments using the following hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurement: Level 1: Quoted market price unadjusted in an active market for an identical financial instrument.
Level 2: Valuation techniques based on observable inputs, such as market prices for similar financial instruments.
Level 3: Valuation techniques using unobservable inputs which can have a significant effect on the instruments valuation.
The Group has applied the above hierarchy to its investments as follows: Toumaz the valuation is based on the quoted share price for Toumaz Holdings on AIM.
This investment is categorised as Level 1.
UBC the valuation is based on the quoted share price for UBC Media Group on AIM.
GreenPlug the valuation of the equity holding in GreenPlug is based on managements best estimate based on information made available to them.

Orca the valuation is based on the purchase price of the investment.
7digital the valuation is based on the purchase price of the investment which was acquired during the year.
