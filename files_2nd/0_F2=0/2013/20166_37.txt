102 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013 Notes to the financial statements 8 Share-based payments continued A summary of the vesting conditions of share awards is as follows: Performance share awards market condition The performance condition for Performance shares issued before July 2011 is based on the outperformance of the theoretical growth in value ofa shareholding in the Company with dividends reinvested for the three year performance period from grant averaged over a 60-day period compared to the growth in value of the FTSE 100 Index with dividends reinvested adjusted for mergers, demergers and fide-listings over that period.
Performance share awards non market condition Performance shares issued after June 2011 will vest, subject to a vesting scale, if the annualised growth of the Groups return on opening equity during the three year performance period equals or exceeds 10% per annum.
Performance-based awards Performance-based share awards are made to certain investment executives.
These plans operate in a similar format to a carry scheme where apercentage of shares will vest once a realised profit hurdle has been achieved on a defined group of assets.
Deferred share bonus Certain employees receive an element of their bonus as a conditional award of shares which vest after two or three years.
The awards arenotsubject to a performance condition.
The fair value of the deferred shares is the share price at the date of the award.

The Plan has not been offered to new employees joining 3i since 1 April 2006.
The Plan was closed to the future accrual of benefits by members with effect from 5April2011, although the final salary link will be maintained on existing accruals.
Members of the Plan have been invited to join the Groups defined contribution plan with effect from 6 April 2011.

Level 3 inputs are sensitive to assumptions made when ascertaining fair value as described in the Portfolio valuation an explanation section.
Areasonable alternative assumption would be to apply a standard marketability discount of 5% for all assets rather than the specific approach adopted.

At the time of the transaction FSIM, a specialist US debt management company, was managing US$2.5 billion of AUM, comprising six CLO funds, one credit opportunity fund and one senior loan fund.
Following completion of the transaction, the fund management of the Senior Loan Fund and the Credit Opportunities Fund transferred across to3i DM US.
The senior loan fund was renamed 3i US Senior Loan Fund.
FSIM continued to manage the existing CLO funds until investor approval was granted to change the fund manager to 3i DM US in March 2013.
As part of the strategic transaction the FSIM team were initially employed byboth FSIM and by 3i DM US, following the transfer of all FSIM funds to 3i DM US all employees are now employed solely by 3i DM US.
3i DM US has acquired certain of the assets and liabilities of FSIM.
3i DM US entered into a services agreement with FSIM which was classified asan intangible asset.
Following the transfer of existing CLO fund management to 3i DM US in March 2013 this agreement has been replaced and3i DM US will now directly manage the CLO funds.
This strategic transaction is judged to have key features of a business combination and accordingly has been classified as a business combinationunder IFRS3: Business Combinations.
The Group subscribed for 80% of the equity of 3i DM US for cash consideration of 8 million.
The management team of FSIM subscribed for the remaining 20% of the equity of 3i DM US.
The Group has entered into agreements to purchase this remaining 20% from the management team by March 2016, with the price subject to the performance of 3i DM US.
The purchase of the management teams equity holding or earn-out is made up of two parts: nn2 million deferred consideration, for the transfer of the remaining 20% of the shares held by FSIM management by March 2016.
This has been recognised on acquisition and will be carried as a liability on the Group balance sheet.
nnThe remaining amount is contingent on the management team remaining in employment with 3i DM US and raising new funds.
The amount will be determined by the performance of 3i DM US during the three year period and will be recognised in the statement of comprehensive income ascarried interest and performance fees payable.

This note provides further detail on financial risk management, cross-referring to the Risk section where applicable, and includes quantitative data on specific financial risks.
The Group is a highly selective investor and each investment is subject to a risk assessment through an investment approval process.
The Groups Investment Committee is part of the overall risk management framework set out in the Risk section.
Capital structure The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, including cash held on deposit, long term borrowing and shareholders equity.
The type and maturity of the Groups borrowings are analysed further in note 21 and the Groups equity is analysed into its various components in the statement of changes in equity.
Capital is managed with the objective of maximising long-term return to shareholders, whilst maintaining a capital base to allow the Group to operate effectively in the marketplace and sustain future development of the business.

Capital constraints The Group is generally free to transfer capital from subsidiary undertakings to the parent company subject to maintaining each subsidiary with sufficient reserves to meet local statutory regulatory obligations.
No significant constraints have been identified in the past and the Group has been able to distribute profits in a tax-efficient manner.
The Groups regulated capital requirement is reviewed regularly by the Board of 3i Investments plc, an investment firm that is regulated by theFSA which has since changed to the Financial Conduct Authority.
The last submission to the FSA demonstrated a significant consolidated capitalsurplus in excess of the FSAs prudential rules.
The Groups capital requirement is updated annually following approval of the Groups Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP report by the Board of 3i Investments plc.
The Group complies with the Individual Capital Guidance as agreed with the FSA and remains at a significant regulatory capital surplus.
The Groups Pillar 3 disclosure document can be found on www.
Financial statements 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013 111 19 Financial risk management continued Financial risks Concentration risk The Groups exposure to and mitigation of concentration risk is explained within the investment and treasury and funding sections in the Risk section.
Quantitative data regarding the concentration risk of the portfolio across geographies can be found in note 1, segmental analysis.
Credit risk The Group is subject to credit risk on its loans, traded portfolio, receivables, derivatives cash and deposits.
The Groups cash and deposits are heldwith a variety of counterparties with circa 72% of the Groups surplus cash held on demand in AAA Liquidity funds.
The balance is held on short-term deposit with 3is relationship banks.
The credit quality of loans and receivables within the investment portfolio is based on the financial performance of the individual portfolio companies.
For those assets that are not past due it is believed that the risk of default is small and that capital repayments and interest payments will be made in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions of the Groups investment.
Where the portfolio company has failed or is expected to fail in the next 12 months, the Groups policy is to record a provision for the full amount of the loan.
Loan impairments are made when the valuation of the portfolio company implies non-recovery of all or part of the Groups loan investment.
In these cases an appropriate loan impairment is recorded to reflect the valuation shortfall.
Further information on how credit risk is managed is given in the Risk section.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the amounts shown as past due represent the total credit exposure, not the amount actually past due.

The Groups sensitivity to these items is set out below.
i Interest rate risk Further information on how interest rate risk is managed is provided in the Risk section.
The direct impact of a movement in interest rates isrelatively small.
An increase of 100 basis points, based on the closing balance sheet position over a 12 month period, would lead to an approximate increase in total comprehensive income of 21 million 2012: 21 million increase restated for the Group and 22 million 2012: 21million increase restated for the Company.
This increase arises principally from changes in interest receivable and payable on floating rate instruments, including cash, deposits and floating rate debt, and change in fair value of the interest rate swap.
In addition the Group and Company have indirect exposure to interest rates through changes to the financial performance and valuation of portfolio companies caused by interest rate fluctuations.
114 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013 Notes to the financial statements 19 Financial risk management continued ii Currency risk The Groups net assets in euro, US dollar, Swedish krona, Indian rupee, Chinese renminbi and all other currencies combined is shown in the table below.
This sensitivity analysis is performed based on the sensitivity of the Group and Companys net assets to movements in foreign currency exchange rates assuming a 10% movement in exchange rates against sterling.
The figures presented as at 31 March 2012 have been restated toreflect a change in the sensitivity assumption from 5% to 10%, which provides a more appropriate assessment of the sensitivity given the market fluctuations in the year.
The Group manages currency risk on a consolidated basis.
Further information on how currency risk is managed is provided in the Risk section.

Thefair value of these contracts is recorded in the balance sheet and is determined by discounting future cash flows at the prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date.
No contracts are designated as hedging instruments, as defined in IAS 39, and consequently all changes in fair value are taken to profit and loss.
The Group continues its use of derivatives to hedge exchange movements on its US dollar and euro portfolio during the year although the hedging policy has been reviewed and the use of derivatives will reduce during the course of the next financial year.
At the balance sheet date, the notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts was 481 million 2012: 549 million.
116 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013 Notes to the financial statements 20 Derivative financial instruments continued Interest rate swaps The Group has one interest rate derivative.
The fair value of this contract is recorded in the balance sheet and is determined by discounting future cash flows at the prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date.
This contract is not designated as a hedging instrument, as defined in IAS 39, and consequently all changes in fair value are taken to the statement of comprehensive income.
At the balance sheet date, the notional amount outstanding of the fixed rate to variable rate swap was 150 million.
The Group does not trade in derivatives.
In general, derivatives held hedge specific exposures and have maturities designed to match the exposures they are hedging.
It is the intention to hold both the financial instruments giving rise to the exposure and the derivative hedging them until maturity and therefore no net gain or loss is expected to be realised.
The derivatives are held at fair value which represents the replacement cost of the instruments at the balance sheet date.
Movements in the fair value of derivatives are included in the statement of comprehensive income.
In accordance with the fair value hierarchy described in note 13, derivative financial instruments are measured using Level 2 inputs.

All of the Groups borrowings are repayable in one instalment on the respective maturity dates.
None of the Groups interest-bearing loans and borrowings are secured on the assets of the Group.
The fair value of the loans and borrowings is 1,087 million 2012: 1,581 million, determined where applicable with reference to their published market price.
