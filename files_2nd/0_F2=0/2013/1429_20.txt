The legislation to effect these rate changes was enacted before the balance sheet date and UK deferred tax has therefore been calculated using a rate of 20%.
This rate change results in an 18m reduction in the tax charge in the income statement.
The tax credit of 29m arising on the exceptional impairment charge in 2012 was included within the overseas deferred tax credit.
Deferred taxation balances are analysed in note 13.
The 2013 final dividend of 22.65 pence, total value of 179m, will be paid on 10 January 2014 to shareholders on the register on 6 December 2013.
Dividends relating to the period were 32.0 pence per share totalling 253m 2012 28.5 pence per share totalling 225m.

Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share at 14 September 2013 was based on the net profit attributable to equity shareholders of 591m 2012 555m, and a weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year of 790 million 2012 789 million.
The calculation of the weighted average number of shares excludes the shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust on which the dividends are being waived.
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share, which exclude the impact of profits less losses on disposal of non-current assets and sale and closure of businesses, amortisation of non-operating intangibles, exceptional items, and any associated tax credits, is shown to provide clarity on the underlying performance of the group.
The diluted earnings per share calculation takes into account the dilutive effect of share incentives.
The diluted, weighted average number of shares is 790 million 2012 789 million.
There is no difference between basic and diluted earnings.

Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2013 F inancial statements | Notes forming part of the financial statements 101 8.
Intangible assets continued A CGU, or group of CGUs, to which goodwill has been allocated must be assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The carrying value of goodwill is assessed by reference to its value in use to perpetuity reflecting the projected cash flows of each of the CGUs or group of CGUs.
These projections are based on the most recent budget, which has been approved by the board and reflects managements expectations of sales growth, operating costs and margin, based on past experience and external sources of information.
Long-term growth rates for periods not covered by the annual budget reflect the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU, or group of CGUs, operate.
For some recently acquired intangible assets, management expects to achieve growth over the next three to five years in excess of the long-term growth rates for the applicable country or region.
In these circumstances, budgeted cash flows are extended, generally to between three and five years, using specific growth assumptions and taking into account the specific business risks.
The key assumptions on which the cash flow projections for the most recent annual budget are based relate to discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in volumes, selling prices and direct costs.
The cash flow projections have been discounted using a range of rates based on the groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital adjusted for country, industry and market risk.
The rates used were in a range between 9.1% and 13.8% 2012 between 8% and 12.8%.
The growth rates to perpetuity beyond the initial budgeted cash flows, applied in the value in use calculations for goodwill allocated to each of the CGUs or groups of CGUs that are significant to the total carrying amount of goodwill, were in a range between 0% and 3.5% 2012 between 0% and 3%.
Changes in volumes, selling prices and direct costs are based on past results and expectations of future changes in the market.
Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions Impairment testing is dependent on managements estimates and judgements, particularly as they relate to the forecasting of future cash flows, the discount rates selected and expected long-term growth rates.
Each of the groups CGUs had significant headroom under the annual impairment review with the exception of AB Mauri and the North China sugar business.
AB Mauri has experienced increased competitive pressure, higher molasses costs and an inability to recover inflationary cost increases through pricing in some of its different businesses around the world.
This resulted in an indicator of impairment risk under the requirements of IFRS.
Management has reviewed detailed forecasts for this business taking those issues into account, and has concluded that the assets are not impaired.
Key drivers of the forecast improvement in performance include improved reach and competitiveness in the global dry yeast market from the newly commissioned yeast factory in Mexico, implementation of a global review of margin improvement opportunities, particularly on cost reduction, which is already under way, and continuing growth in the global bakery ingredients business.
Headroom was $103m on a CGU carrying value of $1,195m.
The discount rate used was 11.5% and would have to increase to more than 12.1% before value in use fell below the CGU carrying value.
Estimates of long-term growth rates beyond the forecast periods were 2.5%3% per annum dependent on location.
In North China Sugar, a 10m goodwill and 4m operating intangible impairment were charged to adjusted operating profit in the year as a consequence of the decision to mothball the Baolongshan and Wangkui factories at the end of the campaign.
14m was charged against goodwill as a loss on sale of business in the year in respect of the sale of the Chifeng beet factory, completed in early September.
Current forecasts for the remaining North China Sugar business continue to support the carrying value of the assets, but the achievement of these forecasts depends on significant improvements in a variety of operational parameters, including agricultural yields, factory volumes and sugar prices.
Management has reviewed detailed forecasts for this business taking those issues into account, and has concluded that no impairment is required.
Headroom was 2m on a CGU carrying value of 221m.
The discount rate used was 13.0%.
The estimate of long-term growth beyond the forecast period was 2% per annum.
For all goodwill other than AB Mauri and North China Sugar, management has concluded that no reasonably possible change in key assumptions on which it has determined value in use would cause carrying values to materially exceed value in use.

Employee entitlements The group operates pension schemes, the majority of which are of the defined benefit type.
The group also operates a small number of unfunded overseas post-retirement medical benefit schemes.
UK schemes The groups principal UK defined benefit pension schemes are funded schemes and are closed to new members, with defined contribution arrangements in place for other employees.
The pension costs in the UK for the defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit method.
For defined contribution schemes, the pension costs are the contributions payable.
Actuarial gains and losses arising over the financial year are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income and are reflected in the balance sheet at 14 September 2013.
Past service cost is recognised immediately in the income statement to the extent that the benefits have already vested.
The last actuarial valuation of the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2011.
At the valuation date the total market value of the assets of the Scheme was 2,559m and represented 101% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
By agreement with the trustees, the Company agreed to eliminate the deficit identified at the time of the triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme in 2008 with five annual payments of 30m, and although the Scheme was in surplus at the time of the most recent valuation, the Company made the final payment in March2013.
Overseas schemes The group also operates defined benefit pension schemes in a number of overseas businesses, which are primarily funded schemes.
The charge for the year is based on recommendations by qualified actuaries.
Unfunded post-retirement medical benefit schemes are accounted for as defined benefit pension schemes.

Employee entitlements continued Assumptions The UK pension schemes represent 91% 2012 90% of the groups plan assets and 89% 2012 88% of the groups scheme liabilities.
The financial assumptions used to value the UK pension schemes under IAS 19 are: 2013 2012 2011 % % % Discount rate 4.7 4.6 5.1 Inflation 3.5 3.1 3.3 Rate of increase in salaries 4.5 4.1 4.3 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.3 2.9 3.1 Rate of increase for pensions in deferment where provided 3.0 2.6 2.8 The mortality assumptions used to value the UK pension schemes are derived from the S1NA generational mortality tables with improvements in line with the 2009 projection model prepared by the Continuous Mortality Investigation of the UK actuarial profession, with no rating for males and a 0.2 year rating for females, with a long-term underpin of 1.5%.
These mortality assumptions take account of experience to date, and assumptions for further improvements in life expectancy of scheme members.
Examples of the resulting life expectancies are as follows: 2013 2012 Life expectancy from age 65 in years Male Female Male Female Member aged 65 in 2013 2012 22.7 24.8 22.6 24.7 Member aged 65 in 2033 2032 25.0 27.2 24.8 27.1 The other demographic assumptions have been set having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data.
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the pension schemes.
For the overseas schemes, regionally appropriate assumptions have been used where recommended by local actuaries.
Balance sheet The expected rates of return on plan assets were determined, based on actuarial advice, by a process that takes the long-term rate of return on government bonds available at the balance sheet date and with a similar maturity to the scheme liabilities, and applies to these rates suitable risk premia that take account of historic market returns and current market long-term expectations for each assetclass.
The UK schemes net pension asset of 28m 2012 4m liability plus the overseas schemes net pension liability of 72m 2012 91m liability totals a liability of 44m 2012 95m.
This equates to the employee benefits asset of 52m 2012 18m and liability of 96m 2012 113m shown on the face of the consolidated balance sheet.
The expected rates of return and market values of the assets of the principal schemes were as follows: 2013 2013 2012 2012 2011 2011 UK schemes % m % m % m Expected long-term rates of return: Equities 6.7 1,133 6.3 961 6.7 827 Government bonds 3.7 849 3.3 896 3.7 631 Non-government bonds 4.7 527 4.6 638 5.1 939 Property 5.2 163 4.8 103 5.2 102 Other 0.5 260 0.5 117 0.5 7 Total market value of plan assets 2,932 2,715 2,506 Present value of scheme liabilities 2,904 2,719 2,490 Net pension asset liability 28 4 16 Unfunded liability included in the present value of scheme liabilities above 23 19 17 The plan assets, scheme liabilities and aggregate net deficit of the plans were respectively 2,405m, 2,434m and 29m in 2010 and 2,135m, 2,211m and 76m in 2009.

In addition, there are temporary differences of 2,514m 2012 2,098m relating to investments in subsidiaries.

Financial instruments continued The methods and assumptions used to estimate fair values of financial assets and liabilities are as follows: Financial asset liability Fair value determination Cash and cash equivalents Fair values have been stated at book values due to short maturities or Trade receivables, other receivables and accrued income otherwise immediate or short-term access and realisability.
Trade payables, other payables and accruals Other non-current investments recorded within other These comprise minority shareholdings held primarily in privately owned, non-current receivables unquoted companies, where there is no active market available to value them.
Where the fair value of the equity instruments cannot be reliably measured, they are recorded at cost.
Where shareholdings are held in publicly quoted companies, bid price is used to estimate fair value.
Other long-term receivables Fair values have been estimated by discounting expected future cashflows.
Loans, overdrafts and debenture stock Finance leases Derivatives Fair values are typically determined either by reference to third-party valuations usually from a bank, or by reference to readily observable marketprices.
The groups derivatives primarily cover a period of no more than 12 months from the balance sheet date, and information derived from an active market is almost always available to assist with the valuation ofderivatives.
Provisions These are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Consequently, fair value is equivalent to book value.
Valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value Financial instruments carried at fair value in the balance sheet comprise other non-current investments and derivatives.
The group classifies these financial instruments using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the relative significance of both objective evidence and subjective judgments on the inputs used in making the fair value measurements: Level 1: financial instruments are valued using observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted market prices in an active market for identical instruments.
An example of an item in this category is a widely traded equity instrument with a normal quoted market price.
Level 2: financial instruments are valued using techniques based on observable inputs, either directly i. e. market prices and rates or indirectly i. e. derived from market prices and rates.
An example of an item in this category is a currency derivative, where forward exchange rates and yield curve data which are observable in the market are used to derive fair value.
Level 3: financial instruments are valued using techniques involving significant unobservable inputs.
b Derivatives All derivatives are classified as current on the face of the balance sheet.
The table below analyses the carrying amount of derivatives and their contractual notional amounts, together with an analysis of derivatives by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which their fair value measurement method is categorised.

Net movements in the year of 4 m 2012 17m are wholly attributable to equity shareholders in both years.
d Financial risk identification and management The group is exposed to the following financial risks from its use of financial instruments: market risk: credit risk: and liquidity risk.
The groups financial risk management process seeks to enable the early identification, evaluation and effective management of key risks facing the business.
Risk management policies and systems have been established and are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the groups activities.
The group, through its standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The group sources and sells products and manufactures goods in many locations around the world.
These operations expose the group to potentially significant price volatility in the financial and commodity markets.
Trading and risk management teams have been established in the groups major businesses to manage this exposure by entering into a range of products, including physical and financial forward contracts, futures and, where appropriate, options.
These teams work closely with group Treasury and report regularly to executivemanagement.
Treasury operations and commodity procurement are conducted within a clearly defined framework of board-approved policies and guidelines to manage the groups financial and commodity risks.
Treasury works closely with the groups procurement teams to manage commodity risks.
Treasury policy seeks to ensure that adequate financial resources are available to the group at all times, for the management and development of the groups businesses, whilst effectively managing its market risk and credit risk.
The groups risk management policy explicitly forbids the use of financial or commodity derivatives outside its risk management framework of mitigating financial and commodity risks for speculative purposes.
e Foreign currency translation The group presents its financial statements in sterling.
As a result of its worldwide operations, the group is exposed to foreign currency translation risk where overseas operations have a functional currency other than sterling.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation into sterling of both the income statement and net assets of these foreign operations.
Where appropriate, the group finances its operations by borrowing locally in the functional currency of its operations.
This reduces net asset values reported in functional currencies other than sterling, thereby reducing the economic exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on translation.
Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2013 F inancial statements | Notes forming part of the financial statements 116 NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 14 SEPTEMBER 2013 24.
Financial instruments continued The group also finances its operations by obtaining funding at group level through external borrowings and, where they are not in sterling, these borrowings may be designated as net investment hedges.
This enables gains and losses arising on retranslation of these foreign currency borrowings to be charged to other comprehensive income, providing a partial offset in equity against the gains and losses arising on translation of the net assets of foreign operations.
The group does not actively hedge the translation impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the income statement other than via the partial economic hedge arising from the servicing costs on non-sterling borrowings, nor does it generally use derivatives to hedge its net investments in foreign operations.
The group designates certain of its intercompany loan arrangements as quasi-equity for the purposes of IAS 21.
The effect of the designation is that any foreign exchange volatility arising within the borrowing entity and or the lending entity is accounted for directly within other comprehensive income.
The group has foreign currency borrowings that have been designated as hedges of its net investment in foreign operations in euros and US dollars.
The value of these financial liabilities used as hedging instruments at the balance sheet date was: 2013 2012 m m Euro 17 17 US dollar 532 597 549 614 A net foreign exchange loss of 26m 2012 gain of 11m on retranslation of these loans has been taken to the translation reserve on consolidation.
Of this balance a loss of 19m was attributable to equity shareholders and a loss of 7m to non-controlling interests 2012 12m gain to equity shareholders and 1m loss to non-controlling interests.
The group also held currency forwards that have been designated as hedges of its net investment in Australian dollars, whose fair value of 6m 2012 nil has been credited to the translation reserve.
f Market risk Market risk is the risk of movements in the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument or forecast transaction as underlying market prices change.
The group is exposed to changes in the market price of commodities, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
These risks are known as transaction or recognised exposures and economic or forecast exposures.
i Commodity price risk Commodity price risk arises from the procurement of raw materials and the consequent exposure to changes in market prices.
The group purchases a wide range of commodities in the ordinary course of business.
Exposure to changes in the market price of certain of these commodities including wheat, edible oils, soya beans, meat, sugar raws, cocoa, rice, tea and energy is managed through the use of forward physical contracts and hedging instruments, including futures and options contracts, primarily to convert floating or indexed prices to fixed prices.
The use of such contracts to hedge commodity exposures is governed by the groups risk management policies and is continually monitored by group Treasury.
Commodity derivatives also provide a way to meet customers pricing requirements whilst achieving a price structure consistent with the groups overall pricing strategy.
Some of the groups commodity derivatives are treated as own use contracts, since they are both entered into, and continue to be held, for the purposes of the groups ordinary operations, and the group takes physical delivery of the commodity concerned.
Own use contracts do not require accounting entries until the commodity purchase actually crystallises.
Certain other commodity derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges, but some are not eligible for treatment as own use contracts and are not contracts for which the strict requirements of hedge accounting can be satisfied.
This occurs typically where the group does not take physical delivery of the commodity concerned.
Such commodity derivatives are used only where the business believes they provide an economic hedge of an underlying exposure.
These instruments are classified as held for trading and are marked to market through the income statement.
The majority of the groups forward physical contracts and commodity derivatives have original maturities of less than one year.
The group does not have significant sensitivities in respect of the accounting for its on-balance sheet commodity contracts.
ii Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises two primary elements: interest price risk results from financial instruments bearing fixed interest rates.
Changes in floating interest rates therefore affect the fair value of these fixed rate financial instruments: and interest cash flow risk results from financial instruments bearing floating rates.
Changes in floating interest rates affect cash flows on interest receivable or payable.
Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2013 F inancial statements | Notes forming part of the financial statements 117 24.
Financial instruments continued The groups policy is to maintain floating rate debt for a significant proportion of its bank finance, although it periodically assesses its position with respect to interest price and cash flow risk.
At 14 September 2013, 730m 63% 2012 943m and 65% of total debt was subject to fixed rates of interest.
Following the redemption in July 2013 of the 150m secured redeemable debenture stock, the majority of the groups fixed rate debt is the US private placement loans of 710m 2012 774m.
Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings bearing interest rates fixed in advance, for various time periods up to 12 months, by reference to official market rates e. g. LIBOR.
The group does not have significant sensitivities to the impact of interest rates on derivative valuations, nor to the impact of interest rates on floating rate borrowings.
iii Foreign currency risk The group conducts business worldwide and consequently in many foreign currencies.
As a result, it is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates which affect the groups transaction costs.
The group also publishes its financial statements in sterling and is therefore exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates on the translation of the results and underlying net assets of its foreign operations into sterling.
Translation risk is discussed in section e above.
Transaction risk Currency transaction exposure occurs where a business makes sales and purchases in a currency other than its functional currency.
It also arises where monetary assets and liabilities of a business are not denominated in its functional currency, and where dividends or surplus funds are remitted from overseas.
The groups policy is to match transaction exposures wherever possible, and to hedge actual exposures and firm commitments as soon as they occur by using forward foreign currency contracts.
All foreign currency instruments contracted with non-group entities to manage transaction exposures are undertaken by group Treasury or, where foreign currency controls restrict group Treasury acting on behalf of subsidiaries, under its guidance.
Identification of transaction exposures is the responsibility of each business.
The group uses derivatives principally forward foreign currency contracts and time options to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates on its foreign currency trade receivables and payables.
The group does not seek formal fair value hedge accounting for such transaction hedges.
Instead, such derivatives are classified as held for trading and marked to market through the income statement.
This offsets the income statement impact of the retranslation of the foreign currency trade receivables and payables.
Economic forecast risk The group also uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates on its highly probable forecast foreign currency sales and purchases on a rolling 12-month basis.
The group does not formally define the proportion of highly probable forecast sales and purchases to hedge, but agrees an appropriate percentage on an individual basis with each business by reference to the groups risk management policies and prevailing market conditions.
The group documents currency derivatives used to hedge its forecast transactions as cash flow hedges.
To the extent that cash flow hedges are effective, gains and losses are deferred in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, at which point the gains and losses are recycled either to the income statement or to the non-financial assetacquired.
The majority of the groups currency derivatives have original maturities of less than one year.
The groups most significant currency transaction exposures are: sugar prices in British Sugar to movements in the sterling euro exchange rate: sugar prices in Illovo to movements in the South African rand US dollar euro exchange rates: and sourcing for Primark costs are denominated in a number of currencies, predominantly sterling, euros and US dollars.
Elsewhere, a number of businesses make sales and purchase a variety of raw materials in foreign currencies primarily US dollars and euros, giving rise to transaction exposures.
In all other material respects, businesses tend to operate in their functional currencies and, as a result, further transaction exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements is modest.

The analysis covers currency translation exposures at year end on businesses financial assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currencies of those businesses.
A similar but opposite impact would be felt on both profit and equity if the groups main operating currencies weakened against local functional currencies by a similar amount.
The exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses on translating the financial statements of subsidiaries into sterling is not included in this sensitivity analysis, as there is no impact on the income statement, and the gains and losses are recorded directly in the translation reserve in equity see below for a separate sensitivity.
This sensitivity is presented before taxation and non-controlling interests.

The groups businesses are exposed to counterparty credit risk when dealing with customers, and from certain financing activities.
The immediate credit exposure of financial instruments is represented by those financial instruments that have a net positive fair value by counterparty at 14 September 2013.
The group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk to be: 2013 2012 m m Cash and cash equivalents 362 391 Loans and receivables see note 24a 1,331 1,288 Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss derivative assets 1 10 Designated net investment hedging relationships derivative assets 6 Designated cash flow hedging relationships derivative assets 20 23 1,720 1,712 The majority of cash balances and short-term deposits are held with strong investment-grade banks or financial institutions.
The group uses market knowledge, changes in credit ratings and other techniques to identify significant changes to the financial profile of its counterparties.
Trade and other receivables Concentrations of credit risk are limited as a result of the groups large and diverse customer base.
The group has an established credit policy applied by each business under which the credit status of each new customer is reviewed before credit is advanced.
This includes external credit evaluations where possible and in some cases bank references.
Credit limits are established for all significant or high-risk customers, which represent the maximum amount permitted to be outstanding without requiring additional approval from the appropriate level of management.
Outstanding debts are continually monitored by each business.
Credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis, and at least annually.
Customers that fail to meet the groups benchmark creditworthiness may only transact with the group on a prepayment basis.
Aggregate exposures are monitored at group level.
Many of the groups customers have been transacting with the group for many years and the incidence of bad debts has been low.
Where appropriate, goods are sold subject to retention of title so that, in the event of non-payment, the group may have a secured claim.
The group does not typically require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables.
The group provides for impairment of financial assets including trade and other receivables based on known events, and makes a collective provision for losses yet to be identified, based on historical data.
The majority of the provision comprises specific amounts.
Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2013 F inancial statements | Notes forming part of the financial statements 120 NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 14 SEPTEMBER 2013 24.
Financial instruments continued The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade and other receivables at the reporting date by geographic region of origin was: 2013 2012 m m UK 460 405 Europe & Africa 234 241 The Americas 149 141 Asia Pacific 340 350 1,183 1,137 Trade receivables can be analysed as follows: 2013 2012 m m Not overdue 894 850 Up to 1 month past due 126 107 Between 1 and 2 months past due 15 22 Between 2 and 3 months past due 6 6 More than 3 months past due 27 32 Provision for doubtful debts 35 37 1,033 980 Based on past experience, the group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables that are not pastdue.
Trade and other receivables are stated net of the following provision for irrecoverable amounts: 2013 2012 m m Opening balance 37 38 Amounts provided for during the year 7 9 Amounts released during the year 5 3 Amounts utilised during the year 3 6 Effect of movements in foreign exchange 1 1 Closing balance 35 37 No trade and other receivables 2012 none were written off directly to the income statement in the year.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents Banking relationships are generally limited to those banks that are members of the core relationship group.
These banks are selected for their credit status, global reach and their ability to meet the businesses day-to-day banking requirements.
The credit ratings of these institutions are monitored on a continuing basis.
In locations where the core relationship banking group cannot be used, operating procedures including choice of bank, opening of bank accounts and repatriation of funds must be agreed with group Treasury.
The group has not recorded impairments against cash or cash equivalents, nor have any recoverability issues been identified with such balances.
Such items are typically recoverable on demand or in line with normal banking arrangements.
Other financial assets Other non-current investments are typically equity investments with no fixed maturity or recoverability date.
No impairment issues have been identified with respect to other non-current investments.
Since derivative assets are recorded at fair value, either through profit and loss for those not in a designated cash flow hedging relationship, or otherwise through the hedging reserve, no impairment issues have been identified.

Financial instruments continued h Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities as they fall due.
Group Treasury is responsible for monitoring and managing liquidity and ensures that the group has sufficient headroom in its committed facilities to meet unforeseen or abnormal requirements.
The group also has access to uncommitted facilities to assist with short-term funding requirements.
Available headroom is monitored via the use of detailed cash flow forecasts prepared by each business, which are reviewed at least quarterly, or more often, as required.
Actual results are compared to budget and forecast each period, and variances investigated and explained.
Particular focus is given to management of working capital.
Details of the groups borrowing facilities are given in section i.
The following table analyses the contractual undiscounted cash flows relating to financial liabilities at the balance sheet date and compares them to carrying amounts: 2013 Due Due Due between between between Due within 6 months 1 and 2 2 and 5 Due after Contracted Carrying 6 months and 1 year years years 5 years amount amount Note m m m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities Trade and other payables 18 1,649 7 1,656 1,656 Secured loans 17 39 12 37 7 95 95 Unsecured loans and overdrafts 17 345 28 157 165 557 1,252 1,059 Finance leases 25 1 1 2 38 42 12 Provisions 19 42 5 6 24 77 77 Derivative financial liabilities Currency derivatives net payments 20 18 38 37 Commodity derivatives net payments 10 4 3 17 1 Total financial liabilities 2,106 74 204 198 595 3,177 2,937 2012 Due Due Due between between between Due within 6 months 1 and 2 2 and 5 Due after Contracted Carrying 6 months and 1 year years years 5 years amount amount Note m m m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities Trade and other payables 18 1,494 11 1,505 1,505 Secured redeemable debenture stock 17 5 158 163 150 Secured loans 17 6 17 27 42 92 92 Unsecured loans and overdrafts 17 353 43 161 289 558 1,404 1,198 Finance leases 25 1 1 2 38 42 12 Provisions 19 86 2 27 19 2 136 136 Derivative financial liabilities Currency derivatives net payments 29 10 39 39 Commodity derivatives net payments 22 6 1 29 11 Total financial liabilities 1,996 247 217 352 598 3,410 3,143 The above tables do not include forecast data for liabilities which may be incurred in the future but which were not contracted at 14September 2013.
The principal reasons for differences between carrying values and contractual undiscounted cash flows are coupon payments on the secured redeemable debenture stock and other fixed rate debt to which the group is already committed, future interest payments on the groups finance leases, and cash flows on derivative financial instruments which are not aligned with their fair value.

The group also has 12m 2012 12m of finance lease liabilities which are not included in the tables above, but which are included in the groups loans and overdrafts in note 17.
The 1.15bn syndicated facility matures in July 2015.
In addition to the bank debt, the Company has 710m of private placement notes in issue to institutional investors in the US and Europe.
At 14 September 2013, these had an average remaining duration of 5.6 years and an average fixed coupon of 5.3%.
The other significant core committed debt facilities comprise a 120m EIB loan maturing 2015, as well as local committed facilities in Illovo and Azucarera.
Uncommitted bank borrowing facilities are normally reaffirmed by the banks annually, although they can theoretically be withdrawn at anytime.
Refer to note 9 for details of the groups capital commitments and to note 26 for a summary of the groups guarantees.

Financial instruments continued j Capital management The capital structure of the group is presented in the balance sheet.
The statement of changes in equity provides details on equity and note 17 provides details of loans and overdrafts.
Short and medium-term funding requirements are provided by a variety of loan and overdraft facilities, both committed and uncommitted, with a range of counterparties and maturities.
Longer term funding is sourced from a combination of these facilities, the private placement notes and committed syndicated loan facilities.
