notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
General information Britvic plc the company is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
It is a public limited company domiciled in England & Wales and its ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
Britvic plc and its subsidiaries together the group operate in the soft drinks manufacturing and distribution industry, principally in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland and France.
The operating companies of the group are disclosed within note 31.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the board of directors on 25 November 2013.
Statement of compliance The financial information has been prepared on the basis of applicable International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRS, as they apply to the financial statements of the group.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
For further detail, please refer to note 32.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except where measurement of balances at fair value is required as explained below.
The consolidated financial statements of the group are presented in pounds sterling, which is also the functional currency of the company, and all values are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million except where otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements of the group incorporate the financial information of the company and the entities controlled by the company its subsidiaries in accordance with IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the company, using consistent accounting policies.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the date the group gains control or up to the date control ceases respectively.
Control comprises the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee so as to obtain benefit from its activities and is achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting rights: currently exercisable or convertible potential voting rights: or by way of contractual agreement.
Revenue recognition Revenue is the value of sales, excluding transactions with or between subsidiaries, after the deduction of sales related discounts and rebates, value added tax and other sales related taxes.
Revenue is recognised when goods are delivered and accepted by customers, when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and the amount can be measured reliably.
Sales related discounts are calculated based on the expected amounts necessary to meet claims by the groups customers in respect of these discounts and rebates.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
Cost comprises the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset and includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, on a straight-line basis, over the useful economic life of that asset as follows: Plant and machinery 3 to 20 years Vehicles included in plant and machinery 5 to 7 years Equipment in retail outlets included in fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 5 to 10 years Other fixtures and fittings included in fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 3 to 10 years Land is not depreciated.
Freehold properties are depreciated over 50 years.
Leasehold properties are depreciated over 50 years, or over the unexpired lease term when this is less than 50 years.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount, and are included in the consolidated income statement in the period of derecognition.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount.
Useful lives and residual amounts are reviewed annually and where adjustments are required these are made prospectively.

Accounting policies continued Goodwill While the original acquisition of Britannia Soft Drinks Limited was accounted for under the merger method, business combinations on or after 4 October 2004 have been accounted for under IFRS 3 Business Combinations using the acquisition method.
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired discount on acquisition is credited to the consolidated income statement in the period of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
As at the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to the group of cash-generating units expected to benefit from the combinations synergies by management.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the group of cash-generating units to which the goodwill relates.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets Trademarks, franchise rights and customer lists Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at the fair value of consideration paid.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation or impairment losses.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill, at fair value at the date of acquisition, if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite.
Amortisation is charged on assets with finite lives on a straight-line basis over a period appropriate to the assets useful life.
The carrying values of intangible assets with finite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are also tested for impairment annually either individually or, if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, as part of the cash generating unit to which it belongs.
Such intangibles are not amortised.
The useful life of an intangible asset with an indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether indefinite life assessment continues to be supportable.
If not, the change in the useful life assessment from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.
Software Costs Software expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only after its technical feasibility and commercial viability can be demonstrated.
Acquired computer software licences and software developed in-house are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
Costs include resources focussed on delivery of capital projects where the choice has been made to use internal resource rather than external resources.
These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of three to seven years on a straight line basis.
Impairment of assets The group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects senior managements estimate of the cost of capital.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the consolidated income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Goodwill impairment losses cannot subsequently be reversed.
Inventories and work in progress Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Britvic plc Annual Report 2013 71 notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3.
Accounting policies continued Financial assets The group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, which is normally the transaction price, plus directly attributable transaction costs for those financial assets not subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.
The group assesses at each reporting date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Loans and receivables The group has financial assets that are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit or loss or available for sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant.
Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement when loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging The group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
All derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is appropriate, the hedging relationship is documented at its inception.
This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration.
Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the consolidated income statement.
The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluing derivatives designated as hedging instruments depends on the nature of the hedging relationship, as follows: Cash flow hedges Hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the consolidated income statement in the period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale occurs.
However, when the forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the consolidated income statement.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are then transferred to the consolidated income statement or included in the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above.
Net investment hedges Financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges when they hedge the groups net investment in foreign operations.
Some of the groups foreign currency borrowings qualify as hedging instruments that hedge foreign currency net investment balances.
The effective portion of gains or losses on translation of borrowings designated as net investment hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
Upon disposal of the associated investment in foreign operations any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is recycled through the consolidated income statement.
Fair value hedges Hedges of the change in fair value of recognised assets or liabilities are classified as fair value hedges.
For fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item and is also recognised in the consolidated income statement.
If the hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the hedged item would no longer be adjusted and the cumulative adjustment to its carrying amount would be amortised to the consolidated income statement based on a recalculated effective interest rate.
The fair value gain on loss on the hedging instrument would continue to be recorded in the consolidated income statement.
Derecognition of financial instruments The derecognition of a financial asset takes place when the contractual rights to the cash flows expire, or when the contractual rights to the cash flows have either been transferred or an obligation has been assumed to pass them through to a third party and the group does not retain substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset.
Financial liabilities are only derecognised when they are extinguished, that is, when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires.
72 Britvic plc Annual Report 2013 financial statements overview business review governance shareholder information notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3.
Accounting policies continued Share-based payments The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.
Fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate pricing model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares market conditions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of equity instruments that, in the opinion of the directors and based on the best available estimate at that date, will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described below.
The consolidated income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Taxation The current income tax expense is based on taxable profits for the period, after any adjustments in respect of prior periods.
It is calculated using taxation rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
Provision is made for deferred tax liabilities, or credit taken for deferred tax assets, on all material temporary differences between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying values in the consolidated financial statements.
The principal temporary differences arise from accelerated capital allowances, provisions for pensions and other post-retirement benefits, provisions for share-based payments and unutilised losses incurred in overseas jurisdiction.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability will be settled based on the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when: the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
Pensions and post retirement benefits The group operates a number of pension schemes.
These include both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
Defined benefit plans The defined benefit pension liability or asset in the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the present value of the defined benefit obligation less any past service cost not yet recognised and less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
Plan assets are measured at fair value based on market price information and in the case of quoted securities, the published bid price.
Plan liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis, using the projected unit credit method and discounted at an interest rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term to the plan liabilities.
The movement in the defined benefit pension asset or liability in the balance sheet consists of four main elements: - The service cost of providing pension benefits to employees for the period which is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
- A charge representing the unwinding of the discount on the plan liabilities during the year which is included within administrative expenses.
- A credit representing the expected return on the plan assets during the year which is included within administrative expenses.
This credit is based on the market value of the plan assets, and expected rates of return, at the beginning of the period.
These may result from: differences between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets: differences between the actuarial assumptions underlying the plan liabilities and actual experience during the year: or changes in the actuarial assumptions used in the valuation of the plan liabilities.
Actuarial gains and losses, and taxation thereon, are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income.
Britvic plc Annual Report 2013 73 notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3.
Accounting policies continued Changes to benefits under a defined benefit plan are accounted for as follows: - Past service cost is the increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation for employee service in prior periods, resulting from changes to post-employment benefits.
Past service costs are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the vesting period or immediately if the benefits have vested.
- When a settlement eliminating all obligations for part or all of the benefits already accrued or a curtailment reducing future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the scheme membership or a reduction in future entitlement occurs the obligation and related plan assets are re-measured using current actuarial assumptions and the resultant gain or loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement during the period in which the settlement or curtailment occurs.
Any net pension assets arising are assessed for restrictions.
Defined contribution plans Under defined contribution plans, contributions payable for the period are charged to the consolidated income statement as an operating expense.
Employee benefits Wages, salaries, bonuses and paid annual leave are accrued in the period in which the associated services are rendered by the employees of the group.
Leases Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases by the group.
Leases in which the group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Any lease incentives received are credited to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases to which they relate.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, bank overdrafts repayable on demand are a component of cash and cash equivalents.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which generally have 30-90 day terms, are recognised at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount.
Provision is made when collection of the full amount is no longer considered probable.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings Interest bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income and finance cost.
Foreign currencies Functional and presentation currency The consolidated financial statements of the group are presented in pounds sterling.
The presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements is the same as the functional currency of the company.
Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the consolidated income statement, except when hedge accounting is applied and for differences in monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the groups net investment in a foreign operation.
These are taken in other comprehensive income until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in profit and loss.
Foreign operations The consolidated income statement and statement of cash flows of foreign operations are translated at the average rate of exchange during the period.
The balance sheet is translated at the rate ruling at the reporting date.
Exchange differences arising on opening net assets and arising on the translation of results at an average rate compared to a closing rate are both recognised in other comprehensive income.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the accumulated exchange differences previously recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the consolidated income statement.
Certain of the groups financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges when they hedge the groups net investment in foreign operations.
See derivative financial instruments and hedging policy above for further detail.
Segmental reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the board of directors of the company.
74 Britvic plc Annual Report 2013 financial statements overview business review governance shareholder information notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3.
Accounting policies continued Issued share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Other reserves Share premium account The share premium account is used to record the excess of proceeds over the nominal value on the issue of shares.
Own shares reserve The own shares reserve is used to record purchases by the group of its own shares, which will be distributed to employees as and when share awards made under the Britvic employee share plans vest.
Share scheme reserve The share scheme reserve is used to record the movements in equity corresponding to the cost recognised in respect of equity-settled share based payment transactions.
Amounts recognised in the share scheme reserve are transferred to retained losses upon subsequent settlement of any awards that vest either by issue or purchase of the groups shares, or when awards lapse.
Hedging reserve The hedging reserve records the effective portion of movements in the fair value of forward exchange contracts, interest rate and cross currency swaps that have been designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges.
Translation reserve The translation reserve includes cumulative net exchange differences on translation into the presentational currency of items recorded in group entities with a non-sterling functional currency net of amounts recognised in respect of net investment hedges.
Merger reserve The merger reserve arose as a result of the non pre-emptive share placement which took place on 21 May 2010.
It was executed using a structure which created a merger reserve under Section 612-3 of the Companies Act 2006.
Own shares The cost of own shares held in employee share trusts and in treasury is deducted from shareholders equity until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, the fair value of any consideration received is also included in shareholders equity.
Exceptional and other items The group presents items as exceptional and other items on the face of the consolidated income statement to allow shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess trends in financial performance more readily.
Exceptional items include those significant items of income and expense which, because of the size, nature and infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation.
Other items include fair value movements on financial instruments where hedge accounting cannot be applied.
These items have been included within exceptional and other items because they are non-cash and do not form part of how management assesses performance.
Key judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year.
However, the nature of estimation means that the actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
In the process of applying the groups accounting policies, management has made the following judgements which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Post retirement benefits The determination of the pension and other post retirement benefits cost and obligation is based on assumptions determined with independent actuarial advice.
The assumptions include discount rate, inflation, pension and salary increases, expected return on scheme assets, mortality and other demographic assumptions.
These key assumptions are disclosed in note 22.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which the goodwill intangible asset has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires an estimate of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Further details are given in note 15.
Britvic plc Annual Report 2013 75 notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3.
Accounting policies continued Cross currency interest rate swaps The group measures cross currency interest rate swaps at fair value at each balance sheet date.
The fair value represents the net present value of the difference between the projected cash flows at the swap contract rate and the relevant exchange interest rate for the period from the balance sheet date to the contracted expiry date.
The calculation therefore uses estimates of present value, future foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Information regarding cross currency interest rate swaps is provided in notes 21 and 25.
New standards adopted in the current period During the period, the group adopted a number of interpretations and amendments to standards which had an immaterial impact on the consolidated financial statements of the group.
New standards and interpretations not applied The group has not applied the following IFRSs, which may be applicable to the group, that have been issued but are not yet effective: Effective date periods commencing on or after International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS IFRS 7 Amendment to IFRS 7 Offsetting of assets and liabilities 1 January 2013 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Classification and measurement 1 January 2015 IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements 1 January 2013 IFRS 11 Joint arrangements 1 January 2013 IFRS 12 Disclosures of interests in other entities 1 January 2013 IFRS 13 Fair value measurement 1 January 2013 International Accounting Standards IAS IAS 19 IAS 19 revised 2011 - Employee benefits 1 January 2013 IAS 27 IAS 27 revised 2011 Separate financial statements 1 January 2013 IAS 32 Amendment to IAS 32 Offsetting of assets and liabilities 1 January 2014 IAS 36 Amendment to IAS 36 Recoverable amount disclosures 1 January 2014 for nonfinancial assets IAS 39 Amendment to IFRS 9 Novation of derivatives 1 January 2014 and continuation of hedge accounting Other Annual improvements Annual improvements 2011 1 January 2013 IFRIC Interpretation 21 IFRIC 21 - Levies 1 January 2014 The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards, which will be adopted in line with the effective date will have a material impact on the groups reported income or net assets in the period, with the exception of IAS 19 revised which is not anticipated to have a material impact on net assets, but the impact on the reported income of the group is not possible to determine as it will depend on conditions at the time of adoption.
The most significant change for Britvic under IAS 19 revised is the replacement of interest cost and expected return on plan assets with a finance cost component which is determined by applying the same discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
The difference between the actual return on plan assets and the discount rate will be presented in other comprehensive income.
The effect at the date of adoption will depend on market interest rates, rates of return and the actual mix of scheme assets at that time.
Other changes will include the treatment of expenses paid in relation to the plans and the narrative disclosures.
The directors consider that this change will not have a material impact on the group consolidated results.

Segmental reporting For management purposes, the group is organised into business units and has five reportable segments as follows: GB Stills United Kingdom excluding Northern Ireland GB Carbs United Kingdom excluding Northern Ireland Ireland Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland France International These business units sell soft drinks into their respective markets.
Management monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
Segment performance is evaluated based on brand contribution.
This is defined as revenue less material costs and all other marginal costs that management considers to be directly attributable to the sale of a given product.
Such costs include brand specific advertising and promotion costs, raw materials and marginal production and distribution costs.
However, group financing including finance costs and income taxes are managed on a group basis and are not allocated to reportable segments.
Transfer prices between reportable segments are on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.

No deferred tax has been provided in respect of these differences, since the timing of the reversals can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the future.
The group expects that future remittances of earnings from its overseas subsidiaries will be covered by the UK dividend exemption and so the un-remitted earnings of these subsidiaries are not disclosed above.
A deferred tax asset of 0.4m 2012: nil has not been recognised in respect of tax losses.
d Impact of rate change Finance Act 2013 enacted reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 23% to 21% from 1 April 2014 and to 20% from 1 April 2015.
The effect of the new rate is to reduce the deferred tax provision by a net 2.1m, comprising a credit of 3.2m to the income statement and a charge of 1.1m to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit loss for the period attributable to the equity shareholders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to the ordinary equity shareholders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
The following table reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations: 2013 2012 m m Basic earnings per share Profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders 61.9 57.4 243.2 Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue for basic earnings per share 241.6 Basic earnings per share 25.5p 23.8p Diluted earnings per share 61.9 Profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders 57.4 Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue for diluted earnings per share 244.7 256.6 25.3p Diluted earnings per share 22.4p The group presents as exceptional and other items on the face of the consolidated income statement, those significant items of income and expense which, because of the size, nature and infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance in the period, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess trends in financial performance more readily.
To this end, basic and diluted earnings per share are also presented on this basis with the amortisation of acquisition related intangible assets also added back using the weighted average number of ordinary shares for both basic and diluted amounts as per the table below.

These agreements have been allocated a 35 year useful economic life.
As at 29 September 2013 these intangible assets have a remaining useful life of 29 years.
The franchise agreement itself has a contract life less than the useful economic life.
The useful economic life has been determined on the basis that the renewal of the contract is highly probable.

The movements in the carrying amount of goodwill from the prior year relate to translation movements and the impairment of goodwill related to the Water business.
With the exception of Britvic Ireland and Britvic France goodwill, all other goodwill amounts were recognised on acquisitions made within Britvic GB.
Trademarks with indefinite lives were recognised as part of the fair value exercises relating to the 2007 acquisition of Britvic Ireland and the 2010 acquisition of Britvic France.
They were allocated by senior management to the individual cash-generating units for impairment testing as shown in the table above.
Method of impairment testing Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives Impairment reviews of goodwill and intangible assets are undertaken by senior management annually.
Value in use calculations are performed for each cash-generating unit using cash flow projections and are based on the latest financial budgets prepared by senior management and approved by the board of directors.
Senior management expectations are formed in line with performance to date and experience, as well as available external market data.
The group has considered the impact of the current economic climate in determining the appropriate discount rate to use in impairment testing.
The applicable pre-tax discount rate for cash flow projections is: At 29 September 2013 At 30 September 2012 Britvic GB 8% 11% Britvic Ireland 10% 11% Britvic France 10% 12% Cash flows beyond a one year period are extrapolated based on growth and discount rates as described on page 86.
Britvic plc Annual Report 2013 87 notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 15.
Impairment testing of intangible assets continued Key assumptions used in value in use calculations The following describes each key assumption on which management has based its cash flow projections to undertake impairment testing of goodwill.
Volume growth rates reflect senior management expectations of volume growth based on growth achieved to date, current strategy and expected market trends.
Discount rates reflect senior managements estimate of the pre-tax cost of capital adjusted where necessary to reflect the different risks of different countries in which the group operates.
The estimated pre-tax cost of capital is the benchmark used by management to assess operating performance and to evaluate future capital investment proposals.
Marginal contribution being revenue less material costs and all other marginal costs that management considers to be directly attributable to the sale of a given product.
Marginal contribution is based on financial budgets approved by the Britvic plc board.
Key assumptions are made within these budgets about pricing, discounts and costs based on historical data, current strategy and expected market trends.
Advertising and promotional spend financial budgets approved by senior management are used to determine the value assigned to advertising and promotional spend.
This is based on the planned spend for year one and strategic intent thereafter.
Raw materials price, production and distribution costs, selling costs and other overhead inflation the basis used to determine the value assigned to inflation is the forecast increase in consumer price indices in the relevant market.
This has been used in all value in use calculations performed.
Intangible assets with finite lives No indicators of impairment were identified on intangible assets with finite lives and no impairment was recognised against these assets.
Results and conclusions Following the strategic cost initiative announcement in May 2013, the carrying value of goodwill relating to the Water business of 1.7m has been impaired, and the impairment charge recognised within exceptional and other items see note 5.
The directors do not consider that a reasonably possible change in the assumptions used to calculate the value in use of remaining goodwill and intangible assets would result in any impairment.

The 2007 Notes are unsecured and rank pari passu in right of repayment with other senior unsecured indebtedness of the company.
In order to manage the risk of foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations, the group has entered into currency interest rate swaps whereby fixed floating US dollar interest is swapped for fixed sterling interest.
The swap contracts have the same duration and other critical terms as the borrowings which they hedge and are designated as part of effective hedge relationships see note 25.
2009 Notes On 17 December 2009, Britvic plc issued US$250.0m of Senior Notes in the United States Private Placement market the 2009 Notes.
The 2009 Notes are additional borrowings to the 2007 Notes.
Britvic plc makes semi-annual interest payments in US dollars under these notes.
The 2009 Notes are unsecured and rank pari passu in right of repayment with other senior unsecured indebtedness of the group.
In order to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and to ensure an appropriate mix of sterling and euro funding, the group has entered into a number of cross currency interest rate swaps.
The 2009 Notes were swapped into floating rate sterling and euro liabilities through a series of US dollar to sterling and, with the exception of series A, sterling to euro swap instruments.
These cross currency interest rate swap contracts have the same duration and other critical terms as the relevant borrowings they hedge and are designated as part of effective hedge relationships see note 25.

To mitigate exposure to interest rates on a portion of this liability, 20.0m of 2-year interest rate swaps were transacted with an effective date of December 2011.
2014 Notes In November 2013, the group reached agreement with a number of investors in the US private placement market to raise an additional $170.4m equivalent of funding for terms of between 7 and 12 years.
This funding is subject to documentation and due diligence which is scheduled to be completed in December 2013.
Where this funding is dollar-denominated this has been hedged using cross-currency interest-rate swaps to meet the groups desired funding profile and to manage the associated foreign currency risk to the profit and loss account.
Pensions The groups principal pension scheme for GB employees, the Britvic Pension Plan BPP has both a defined benefit and contribution section.
The defined benefit section was closed to new members from 1 August 2002 and closed to future accrual for active members from 1 April 2011, with new members moving to the defined contribution section for future service benefits.
Contributions are paid to the Plan as determined by the Trustee, agreed by the company and certified by an independent actuary in the Schedule of Contributions.
The latest formal actuarial valuation for contribution purposes was carried out as at 31 March 2010.
The 31 March 2013 valuation is currently underway and is expected to be completed by 30 June 2014.
Changes to the contributions payable could result.
The BPP is a limited partner of Britvic Scottish Limited Partnership Britvic SLP, which in turn is a limited partner in both Britvic Property Partnership Britvic PP and Britvic Brands LLP Britvic Brands.
Britvic SLP, Britvic PP and Britvic Brands are all consolidated by the group.
The investment held by BPP does not represent a plan asset for accounting purposes and is therefore not included in the fair value of the plan assets.
Properties were transferred to Britvic PP at a value of 28.6m and certain group brands to the value of 72.4m were transferred to Britvic Brands, all of which are leased back to Britvic Soft Drinks Limited.
The group retains operational flexibility over the properties and brands including the ability to substitute the properties and brands held by Britvic PP and Britvic Brands respectively.
92 Britvic plc Annual Report 2013 financial statements overview business review governance shareholder information notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22.
Pensions continued The BPP is entitled to a share of the profits in Britvic SLP for the next 13 years.
At the end of this period, the partnership capital allocated to the BPP will be changed to an amount equal to any funding deficit of the BPP at this time, up to a maximum of 105m.
In addition to the expected partnership income of at least 5m per annum, the group will make payments to the BPP of 15m per annum by 31 December each year, from 2013 to 2017.
During this year 12.5m of additional contributions were paid to the BPP, of which 7.5m was paid by the group and 5.0m relates to income received from the pension funding partnership structure.
The amount recognised as an expense in relation to the BPP defined contribution scheme in the consolidated income statement for 2013 was 10.6m 2012: 10.5m.
Britvics business in GB also has a secured unfunded unregistered retirement benefit scheme called The Britvic Executive Top Up Scheme BETUS which provides benefits for members who have historically exceeded the Earnings Cap, or the Lifetime Allowance whilst members of the defined benefit section of the BPP.
BETUS closed to future accrual on 10 April 2011 which coincided with the closure of the defined benefit section of the BPP.
The Britvic Northern Ireland Pension Plan BNIPP was closed to new members on 28 February 2006, and since this date new employees have been eligible to join a Stakeholder plan with Legal & General.
The latest formal actuarial valuation for contribution purposes was carried out as at 31 December 2011.
In relation to the Britvic Ireland Pension Plan BIPP, following the changes made in 2012 no deficit recovery contributions are currently required.
The next valuation is due as at 1 January 2015.
The Trustee has been undertaking investment fide-risking to protect the on-going funding position achieved as a result of the 2012 changes.
The amount recognised as an expense in relation to the Irish defined contribution schemes in the consolidated income statement for 2013 was 0.8m 2012: 0.3m.
All group pension schemes are administered by trustees who are independent of the groups finances.
The assets and liabilities of the pension schemes were valued on an IAS 19 basis at 29 September 2013 by Towers Watson BPP, Invesco BIPP and Buck BNIPP.
Included within the pension liability on the consolidated balance sheet is an accrual of 2.1m 2012: 1.8m in respect of Britvic France.
The liability represents an unfunded pension obligation made up of two components being retirement indemnities of 1.9m 2012: 1.6m and long-service cash payments due on retirement of 0.2m 2012: 0.2m.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate on assets assumption for the portfolio.
Demographic assumptions The most significant non-financial assumption is the assumed rate of longevity.
This is based on standard actuarial tables, which for the BPP are known as SAPS Series 1.
The following life expectancy assumptions have been used: 2013 2013 2013 2012 2012 2012 Years Years Years Years Years Years ROI NI GB ROI NI GB 22.7 22.0 22.2 Current pensioners at age 65 males 23.1 21.0 22.1 Current pensioners at age 65 females 24.5 25.0 24.8 24.7 23.8 24.7 Future pensioners currently aged 45 at age 65 males 25.6 23.3 24.4 25.8 22.8 24.3 Future pensioners currently aged 45 at age 65 females 26.8 26.6 27.1 26.9 25.3 27.0 Britvic plc Annual Report 2013 93 notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22.
Pensions continued Sensitivities Changes in assumptions used for determining retirement benefit costs and obligations may have a material impact on the consolidated income statement and balance sheet.
The main assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of inflation and the assumed mortality rate.
The following table provides an estimate of the potential impact of each of these variables on the principal pension plans.

Financial risk management objectives and policies Overview The groups principal financial instruments comprise derivatives, borrowings and overdrafts, and cash and cash equivalents.
These financial instruments are used to manage interest rate and currency exposures, funding and liquidity requirements and share price exposure arising under the groups employee incentive schemes.
Other financial instruments which arise directly from the groups operations include trade receivables and payables see notes 18 and 23 respectively.
It is, and has always been, the groups policy that no derivative is entered into for trading or speculative purposes.
The main risks arising from the groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Additionally, the group is exposed to commodity price risk and share price risk.
The board of directors review and agree policies for managing these risks as summarised below.
Interest rate risk The groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the groups long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates.
The groups policy is to manage its interest cost by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt.
The groups policy is to have an average over the next three years of between 25% and 80% of its borrowings at fixed rates of interest.
To manage this, the group enters into interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward rate agreements which are designated to hedge underlying debt obligations.
At 29 September 2013 after taking into account the effect of these instruments, approximately 97% of the groups borrowings are at a fixed rate of interest 2012: 86%.
Britvic plc Annual Report 2013 97 notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 24.
Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Interest rate risk table The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, on the groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings and equity through the change in fair values of applicable derivative instruments.

The group has operations in euro-denominated countries and finances these partly through the use of foreign currency borrowings and cross currency swaps which hedge the translation risk of net investments in foreign operations.
Additionally cash generation from euro-denominated operations can be utilised to meet euro payment obligations in sterling denominated companies, providing a natural hedge.
The group also has transactional exposures arising from purchases of prime materials, capital expenditure and interest costs in currencies other than the functional currency of the individual group entities.
Non functional currency purchases and interest costs are made in the currencies of US dollars and euros.
As at 29 September 2013 the group has hedged 65% 2012: 69% of forecast net exposures 12 months in advance using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Where funding is raised in a currency other than the currency ultimately required by the group, cross currency interest rate swaps are used to convert the cash flows to the required currency.
These swaps have the same duration and other critical terms as the underlying borrowing.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar and euro exchange rates, with all other variables held constant, of the groups profit before tax due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities and the groups equity due to changes in fair value of forward exchange contracts.

Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Credit risk The group trades only with recognised creditworthy third parties.
It is the groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the groups exposure to bad debts is not significant.
The maximum exposure is the carrying amount disclosed in note 18.
For transactions that do not occur in the country of the relevant operating unit, the group does not offer credit terms without the approval of the Head of Finance Shared Services.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the group.
The group maintains a policy on counterparty credit exposures with banks and financial institutions arising from the use of derivatives and financial instruments.
This policy restricts the investment of surplus funds and entering into derivatives to counterparties with a minimum credit rating maintained by either Moodys, Standard & Poors or Fitch.
The level of exposure with counterparties at various ratings levels is also restricted under this policy.
The level of exposure and the credit worthiness of the groups banking counterparties is reviewed regularly to ensure compliance with this policy.
Commodity price risk The main commodity price risk arises in the purchases of prime materials, being polyethylene terephthalate PET, sugar, steel and frozen concentrated orange juice.
Where it is considered commercially advantageous, the group enters into fixed price contracts with suppliers to hedge against unfavourable commodity price changes.
Share schemes equity price risk The group operates several employee incentive share schemes.
It has an exposure to the share price for the schemes in which shares are purchased in the market to satisfy the requirements of the plan.
To hedge this risk the group has entered into a number of total return share swaps against schemes maturing in 2014.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the Britvic plc share price, with all other variables held constant, of the groups profit before tax due to changes in the fair value of the share swaps.
Increase Effect decrease in on profit share price before tax % m 2013 10 0.8 10 0.8 2012 10 1.5 10 1.5 Liquidity risk The group monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using rolling cash flow forecasts.
These forecasts consider the maturity of both its financial investments and financial assets e. g. accounts receivable, other financial assets and projected cash flows from operations.
The objective of the groups liquidity policy is to maintain a balance between continuity of funds and flexibility through the use of bank loans and overdrafts and long term private placement issuance.
The bank loans entered into under the 400.0m bank facility are unsecured however 1.0m of outstanding Britvic France bank loans are secured.
At 29 September 2013, 91.6m of the groups debt will mature in less than one year 2012: 0.6m.

Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.

Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Capital management The group defines capital as being net debt plus equity.
The groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the groups ability to continue as a going concern and maintain an appropriate capital structure to balance the needs of the group to grow, whilst operating with sufficient headroom within its bank covenants.
The group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group has a number of options available to it including modifying dividend payments to shareholders, returning capital to shareholders or issuing new shares.
In this way, the group balances returns to shareholders between long term growth and current returns whilst maintaining capital discipline in relation to investing activities and taking any necessary action on costs to respond to the current environment.
The group monitors capital on the basis of the adjusted net debt EBITDA ratio.
Adjusted net debt is calculated as being the net of cash and cash equivalents, interest bearing loans and borrowings and the element of the fair value of interest rate currency swaps hedging the balance sheet value of the US private placement notes.
Adjusted net debt is shown in note 29.
The adjusted net debt EBITDA ratio enables the group to plan its capital requirements in the medium term.
The group uses this measure to provide useful information to financial institutions and investors.

Non-derivative financial assets are categorised as loans and receivables as defined in IAS 39 Financial instruments recognition and measurement.
Non-derivative financial liabilities are all carried at amortised cost.
The fair value of derivatives, which are quoted at market price, has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The fair value of the current trade and other receivables and payables approximate to book value.
The fair value of fixed rate borrowings has been derived from the sum of future cash flows to maturity discounted back to present values at a market rate.

Britvic plc Annual Report 2013 105 notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 28.
Share-based payments The expense recognised for share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the 52 weeks ended 29 September 2013, including national insurance of 1.1m 2012: 0.4m and dividend equivalents of nil 2012: 1.0m, is 6.2m 2012: 3.0m.
This expense arises from transactions which are expected to be equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
The Britvic Share Incentive Plan SIP The SIP is an all-employee plan approved by HMRC.
The plan allows for discretionary annual awards of free ordinary shares with a value of 3% of salary subject to HMRC maximum limits together with an offer of matching shares on the basis of one free matching share for each ordinary share purchased with a participants savings, up to a maximum of 50 2012: 50 per four week pay period.
Employees are entitled to receive the annual free share award, where granted by the group, provided they are employed by the company on the last day of each financial year and on the award date.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.
Awards made during the period are shown in the table below.
The fair value of these awards is equivalent to the intrinsic value of the shares.
of shares 2013 2012 Annual free shares award - - Matching shares award 1 free share for every ordinary share purchased 185,563 281,662 The Britvic Executive Share Option Plan Option Plan The Option Plan allows for options to buy ordinary shares to be granted to selected employees.
The option price is the average market price of Britvic plcs shares on the three business days before the date of grant.
Options become exercisable on the satisfaction of the performance condition and remain exercisable until ten years after the date of grant.
The performance condition requires average growth in EPS of 7% pa over a three year period in excess of the average growth in RPI over the same period for the options to vest in full.
If EPS growth averages 3% per annum in excess of RPI growth, 25% 2012: 25% of the options will vest.
Straight-line apportionment will be applied between these two levels to determine the number of options that vest and no options will vest if average EPS growth is below the lower threshold.
In some circumstances, at the discretion of the company, an option holder who exercises his her option may receive a cash payment rather than the ordinary shares under option.
The cash payment would be equal to the amount by which the market value of the ordinary shares under option exceeds the option price.
However, it is expected that this plan will be equity-settled and as a consequence has been accounted for as such.
The following table illustrates the movements in the number of share options during the period.
Weighted average Number exercise of share price options pence Outstanding as at 2 October 2011 8,764,386 314.8 Granted during the period 2,175,767 331.6 Exercised during the period 244,499 233.1 Forfeited during the period 246,138 406.4 Lapsed during the period 9,496 347.0 Outstanding at 30 September 2012 10,440,020 318.0 Granted during the period 1,583,878 427.5 Exercised during the period 2,220,417 253.7 Forfeited during the period 573,284 367.7 Lapsed during the period 1,994,425 364.4 Outstanding at 29 September 2013 7,235,772 347.1 Exercisable at 29 September 2013 2,739,540 257.1 The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was 491.1p 2012: 362.2p.

The weighted average fair value of options granted during the period was 79.8p 2012: 58.2p.
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial model, taking account of the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.

Share-based payments continued The Britvic Performance Share Plan PSP The PSP allows for awards of ordinary shares or nil cost options to be made to selected employees with vesting subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition.
Different performance conditions apply to different groups of employees.
Awards up to and including 2008 were made in respect of ordinary shares.
Awards granted since 2009 have been in respect of nil cost options.
Nil cost options become exercisable on the satisfaction of the performance conditions and remain exercisable until 10 years 7 years after the date of grant for employees based in the UK Ireland respectively.
The performance condition applying to the total number of awards granted to members of the senior leadership team during the current period is divided equally between the total shareholder return TSR and return on invested capital ROIC performance conditions described below.
The TSR condition measures the companys TSR relative to a comparator group consisting of 18 companies over a three year performance period.
The awards will not vest unless the companys position in the comparator group is at least median.
At median 25% 2012: 25% will vest, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting at upper quartile.
For the award granted during the 52 weeks ended 29 September 2013, the ROIC performance condition requires the companys ROIC to be at least 21.5% 2012: 22.3% over the three year performance period for the award to vest in full.
If ROIC is 20.7% 2012: 21.5% over the performance period, 25% 2012: 25% of the award will vest.
Straight-line apportionment will be applied between these two levels to determine the percentage of awards that vest and no awards will vest if ROIC is below the lower threshold.
Awards granted to members of the senior management team vest solely subject to a performance condition which requires average growth in EPS of 7% pa over a three year period in excess of the growth in RPI over the same period for the awards to vest in full.
If EPS growth averages 3% pa in excess of RPI growth, 25% 2012: 25% of the awards will vest.
Straight-line apportionment will be applied between these two levels to determine the number of awards that vest and no awards will vest if average EPS growth is below the lower threshold.
In some circumstances, at the discretion of the company, vested awards may be satisfied by a cash payment rather than a transfer of ordinary shares.
The following tables illustrate the movements in the number of shares and nil cost options during the period.

Share-based payments continued The Britvic Performance Share Plan PSP The fair value of equity-settled shares and nil cost options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using separate models, taking account of the terms and conditions upon which the shares and nil cost options were granted.
The fair value of the options subject to the TSR condition is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation.
The fair value of all other options is calculated using the share price at the date of grant, adjusted for dividends not received during the vesting period.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used in respect of the Option Plan and PSP awards granted during the 52 weeks ended 29 September 2013.
