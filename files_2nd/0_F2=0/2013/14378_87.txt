For all grants of share options and awards, the fair value at the grant date is calculated using appropriate option pricing models.
The grant date fair value is recognised over the vesting period as an expense, with a corresponding increase in retained earnings.
Employee plans The Smith & Nephew Sharesave Plan 2002 adopted by Shareholders on 3 April 2002 the Save As You Earn SAYE plan, the Smith & Nephew International Sharesave Plan 2002, Smith & Nephew France Sharesave Plan 2002, Smith & Nephew Sharesave Plan 2012 the Save As You Earn SAYE 2012 plan adopted by Shareholders on 12 April 2012, Smith & Nephew International Sharesave Plan 2012 adopted by Shareholders on 12 April 2012 and Smith & Nephew France Sharesave Plan 2012 adopted by Shareholders on 12 April 2012 are together termed the Employee Plans.
The SAYE and SAYE 2012 plans are available to all employees in the UK employed by participating Group companies, subject to three months service.
The schemes enable employees to save up to 250 per month and give them an option to acquire shares based on the committed amount to be saved.
The option price is not less than 80% of the average of middle market quotations of the ordinary shares on the three dealing days preceding the date of invitation.
The Smith & Nephew International Sharesave Plan 2002 and Smith & Nephew International Sharesave Plan 2012 are available to employees in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
Employees in China and France participated in these plans for the first time in 2013.
Puerto Rico participants were eligible to receive options under the International Plans up to 2011 and were eligible to receive phantom options in 2013.
The Smith & Nephew France Sharesave Plans were available to all employees in France up to 2012.
The International and French plans operate on a substantially similar basis to the SAYE plans.
Employees in the US are able to participate in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which gives them the opportunity to acquire shares, in the form of ADSs, at a discount of 15% or more if the shares appreciate in value during the plans quarterly purchase period to the market price, through a regular savings plan.
Executive plans The Smith & Nephew 2001 UK Approved Share Option Plan, the Smith & Nephew 2001 UK Unapproved Share Option Plan, the Smith & Nephew 2001 US Share Plan adopted by Shareholders on 4 April 2001, the Smith & Nephew 2004 Executive Share Option Plan adopted by Shareholders on 6 May 2004 and the Smith & Nephew Global Share Plan 2010 adopted by shareholders on 6 May 2010 are together termed the Executive Plans.
Under the terms of the Executive Plans, the Remuneration Committee, consisting of Non-Executive Directors, may at their discretion approve the grant of options to employees of the Group to acquire ordinary shares in the Company.
Options granted under the Smith & Nephew 2001 US Share Plan the US Plan and the Smith & Nephew 2004 Executive Share Option Plan are to acquire ADSs or ordinary shares.
For Executive Plans adopted in 2001 and 2004, the market value is the average quoted price of an ordinary share for the three business days preceding the date of grant or the average quoted price of an ADS or ordinary share, for the three business days preceding the date of grant or the quoted price on the date of grant if higher.
For the Global Share Plan adopted in 2010 the market value is the closing price of an ordinary share or ADS on the last trading day prior to the grant date.
With the exception of options granted under the 2001 US Plan and the Global Share Plan 2010, the vesting of options granted from 2001 is subject to achievement of a performance condition.
Options granted under the 2001 US Plan and the Global Share Plan 2010 are not subject to any performance conditions.
Prior to 2008, the 2001 US Plan options became cumulatively exercisable as to 10% after one year, 30% after two years, 60% after three years and the remaining balance after four years.
With effect from 2008, options granted under the 2001 US Plan became cumulatively exercisable as to 33.3% after one year, 66.7% after two years and the remaining balance after the third year.
The 2001 UK Unapproved Share Option Plan was open to certain employees outside the US and the US Plan is open to certain employees in the US, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico.
The Global Share Plan 2010 is open to employees globally.
The 2004 Plan was open to Senior Executives only.
The maximum term of options granted, under all plans, is 10 years from the date of grant.
All share option plans are settled in shares.
From 2012 onwards Senior Executives were granted share awards instead of share options and from 2013 executives were granted conditional share awards instead of share options.
The awards vest 33.3% after one year, 66.7% after two years and the remaining balance after the third year subject to continued employment.
There are no performance conditions for executives.
Vesting for senior executives is subject to personal performance levels.
The market value used to calculate the number of awards is the closing price of an ordinary share on the last trading day prior to the grant date.

Options granted under Employee Plans are valued using the Black-Scholes option model as management consider that options granted under these plans are exercised within a short period of time after the vesting date.
For all plans the inputs to the option pricing models are reassessed for each grant.
The following assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of options granted: Employee plans Executive plans 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 Dividend yield % 2.0 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 Expected volatility % i 25.0 25.0 30.0 25.0 30.0 Risk free interest rate % ii 1.3 1.3 2.0 1.2 2.0 Expected life in years 3.8 3.8 3.9 10.0 10.0 i Volatility is assessed on a historic basis primarily based on past share price movements over the expected life of the options.
ii The risk free interest rate reflects the yields available on zero coupon government bonds over the option term and currency.
Summarised information about options outstanding under the share option plans at 31 December 2013 is as follows: Number Weighted average outstanding remaining contract life Thousand Years Employee Plans: 380.0p to 764.7p i 3,287 2.5 Executive Plans: 409.5p to 764.7p i 10,314 6.2 i The split has been determined based on the weighted average share price of 764.7p.
Smith & Nephew ANNuAl report 2013 146 FiNANCiAl StAtemeNtS Notes to the Group accounts continued 23 Other Notes to the accounts continued 23.1 Share based payments continued Share-based payments long-term incentive plans In 2004, a share-based incentive plan was introduced for Executive Directors, Executive Officers and the next level of Senior Executives.
The plan included a Performance Share Plan PSP and a Bonus Co-Investment Plan CIP.
Vesting of the PSP awards is dependent upon performance relative to the FTSE 100 and an index based on major international companies in the medical devices industry.
Under the CIP, participants could elect to use up to a maximum of one-half of their annual bonus to purchase shares.
If the shares are held for three years and the Groups EPSA growth targets are achieved participants receive an award of matching shares for each share purchased.
From 2009, the CIP was replaced by the Deferred Bonus Plan.
This plan was designed to encourage Executives to build up and maintain a significant shareholding in the Company.
Under the plan, up to one-third of any bonus earned at target level or above by an eligible employee was compulsorily deferred into shares which vested, subject to continued employment, in equal annual tranches over three years ie one-third each year.
No further performance conditions applied to the deferred shares.
From 2010, Performance Share awards were granted under the Global Share Plan 2010 for all Executives other than Executive Directors.
Awards granted under both plans are combined to provide the figures below.
From 2012, Deferred Bonus Plan and GSP 2010 options for Executive Directors, Executive Officers and the next level of Senior Executives were replaced by Equity Incentive Awards EIA.
EIA are designed to encourage Executives to build up and maintain a significant shareholding in the Company.
EIA will vest, in equal annual tranches over three years ie one-third each year, subject to continued employment and personal performance.
No further performance conditions apply to the EIA.
The fair values of awards granted under long-term incentive plans are calculated using a binomial model.
Performance Share awards under both the PSP and Global Share Plan 2010 contain vesting conditions based on TSR versus a comparator group which represent market-based performance conditions for valuation purposes and an assessment of vesting probability is therefore factored into the award date calculations.
The assumptions include the volatilities for the comparator groups.
A correlation of 40% 2012 35%, 2011 40% has also been assumed for the companies in the medical devices sector as they are impacted by similar factors.
The Performance Target for the Global Share Plan 2010 is a combination of Free Cash Flow growth and the Groups TSR performance over the three-year performance period.
The other assumptions used are consistent with the Executive scheme assumptions disclosed in Note 23.1.
At 31 December 2013 the maximum number of shares that could be awarded under the Groups long-term incentive plans was: Number of shares in Thousands Other Deferred Awards EIA PSP CIP Bonus Plan Total Outstanding at a January 2011 6,012 197 522 6,731 Awarded 838 2,282 351 3,471 Vested 44 366 375 785 Forfeited 1,660 197 6 1,863 Outstanding at 31 December 2011 794 6,268 492 7,554 Awarded 187 1,060 2,190 3,437 Vested 263 49 1,785 287 2,384 Forfeited 82 1,431 41 1,554 Outstanding at 31 December 2012 718 929 5,242 164 7,053 Awarded 1,179 785 1,963 3,927 Vested 437 379 411 115 1,342 Forfeited 11 51 1,597 5 1,664 Outstanding at 31 December 2013 1,449 1,284 5,197 44 7,974 Other awards mainly comprises of conditional share awards granted under the Global Share Plan 2010.
