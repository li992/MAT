Pension arrangements Restatements IAS 19 revised 2011 and the related consequential amendments have impacted the accounting for the Groups defined benefit schemes, by replacing the combined interest cost on liabilities and expected return on plan assets with a net interest charge on the net defined benefit liability.
Prior year comparatives have been restated as set out in note 5e.
Following recent guidance from the FRRP regarding the treatment of a schedule of contributions in relation to a minimum funding requirement under IFRIC 14, the Group has reconsidered the appropriate accounting treatment for its pension funding obligations.
The Group is party to deficit repair schedules in respect of both the Travis Perkins Pension and Dependants Benefit Scheme the TP scheme and the BSS Pension Benefit Scheme BSS scheme.
Under the terms of the agreement with the Trustees of the TP scheme dated 16 June 2010 and amended in December 2012 and August 2013, the Group is committed to a series of annual payments to make good a historic shortfall as assessed on an actuarial basis.
The restated Group balance sheets at 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2012 reflect the present value of payments due under the schedule as at those dates.
The agreement provides for the suspension of the payment in the event that the scheme is 100% funded on an actuarial basis, and the funding position is monitored on a quarterly basis.
At 31 December 2012 the scheme was 91% funded on an actuarial basis but had reached 99% funded at 31 December 2013.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 28.
Pension arrangements continued 130 The liability reported as at 31 December 2013 of 5.6m is the net present value of payments due as at that date, which are required before the scheme becomes fully funded and payments are suspended.
The liabilities reported as at 31 December 2012 and 1 January 2012 do not assume suspension on the basis that the actuarial shortfall at those dates exceeded the total payments due under the schedules.
During the year, the Group agreed a revised schedule of deficit repair contributions with the Trustees of the BSS scheme.
The net present value of the payments due under this arrangement exceed the IAS19 liability by 25.0m as at 31 December 2013 and an additional liability for this amount has been recorded.
Full details of both restatements is provided in note 5e.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operates three final salary schemes being the TP scheme, the BSS scheme and the BSS Ireland defined benefit scheme.
All defined benefit schemes are closed to new members.
The TP scheme is for the majority of members a 1 60th scheme.
Employees are entitled to start drawing a pension, based on their membership of the scheme, on their normal retirement date.
If employees choose to retire early and draw their pension, then the amount they receive is scaled down accordingly.
The TP scheme is funded by contributions from Group companies and employees.
Contributions are paid to the Trustees on the basis of advice from an independent professionally qualified actuary who carries out a valuation of the scheme every three years.
A full actuarial valuation of the TP scheme was carried out on 30 September 2011.
The IAS 19 valuation has been based upon the results of the 30 September 2011 valuation, and then updated to 31 December 2013 by a qualified actuary.
The present values of the defined obligations, the related current service costs and the past service costs for the scheme were measured using the projected unit method.
Following the acquisition of The BSS Group plc the Group, operated three additional defined benefit pension schemes the BSS schemes based on final pensionable salary.
On 6 April 2012 the defined benefit section of the Tricom Retirement and Death Benefits scheme was transferred to the TP scheme.
The BSS Ireland scheme is immaterial.
The assets of the BSS schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of the schemes trustees.
The most recent actuarial valuations of the BSS schemes assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligations were carried out at 1 June 2012 for the UK and the Irish schemes.
The present value of the defined benefit obligations, and the related current service cost and past service cost, were measured using the projected unit method with a control period equal to the future working lifetime of the active members.
In June 2010, an agreement was reached with the trustees of the TP scheme to fund 34.7m of the deficit using a group controlled special purpose vehicle.
The pension scheme will be entitled to receive the income of the SPV for a period of up to 20 years, subject to funding levels.
This income is backed by the security of 16 Travis Perkins freehold properties.
As the SPV is consolidated into the Travis Perkins plc group accounts advantage has been taken of Regulation 7 of The Partnership Accounts Regulations 2008 and accounts for the SPV will neither be audited or filed.
