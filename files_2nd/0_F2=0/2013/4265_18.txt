Financial report continued Legacy In 2013, Legacy segment revenue was $238.4 million, compared to $364.3 million in 2012, a reduction of 35% which was slower than anticipated, mainly due to continued demand for legacy handset products which lasted longer than we expected.
Legacy consists of the discontinued home entertainment business lines acquired as part of the acquisition of Zoran in 2011, in addition to the revenue from the handset connectivity and handset location business lines which we retained following the Samsung Transaction.
As we are no longer developing further products using our Legacy technologies, we expect to see reducing revenues in this segment as customers switch to next-generation products and by the end of the 2015 financial year, we expect this segment to report minimal revenue streams.
Legacy products remain profitable to the Group, despite having margins lower than that of our Core business, as we do not incur any R&D costs in developing next-generation products and technologies.

In 2013, our revenue was $960.7 million, compared to $1,025.4 million in 2012, a reduction of $64.7 million 6%.
This year on year reduction was primarily due to handset customers switching to alternative suppliers for next-generation chips following the disposal of our handset connectivity and handset location development operations to the Samsung Group in 2012 see page 22 for details and declining demand for the Groups camera technologies adopted into point and shoot cameras.
This decrease was partially offset by growth in the Auto and, more importantly, the Voice & Music segments.
These factors are explained in more detail in the segmental review above.
Volume weighted average selling prices decreased by approximately 5% during 2013.
This decline was caused by usual product life cycle trends offset by a change in product mix, as lower priced handset chips became a smaller proportion of our business.
There is an established trend in our industry where individual products see declining average selling prices as they mature.
To mitigate this we invest in new technologies and products which can command higher prices for new innovative features.
Geographic analysis of revenue We operate in three principal geographic areas: Asia, the Americas and Europe, and we analyse our revenue based on the region of our customers manufacturing locations.
On this basis we consistently derive the significant majority of our revenue in Asia.
More information on our geographical splits of revenue can be found in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
Major customers In 2013 our top ten customers provided 39% of total revenue 2012 40% and 2011 46%.
Further information about our major customers can be found in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
Gross profit In 2013, our gross profit margin increased to 51.6% 2012 49.6% primarily due to a change in product mix where falling sales volumes of Legacy handset products were partially replaced by higher margin products from our Voice & Music and Auto segments.
The increase in gross margin profitability was not enough to offset the effect of declining revenues as explained above so, in absolute terms gross profit decreased to $495.3 million in 2013, from $509.1 million in 2012.
Gross profit includes $8.2 million of amortisation of intangible assets arising from historical acquisitions 2012 $11.3 million.
Excluding these charges the underlying gross profit for 2013 was $503.4 million, producing an underlying gross margin of 52.4%.
