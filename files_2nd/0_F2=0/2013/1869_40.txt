Intangible assets continued Notes to the Consolidated Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to Financial Statements benefit from the business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows: 2013 2012 $m $m Flight Support: Signature Flight Support 440.4 428.4 ASIG 183.9 185.7 Aftermarket Services: Engine Repair and Overhaul 142.0 141.6 Legacy Support 71.3 70.5 APPH 8.5 837.6 834.7 As at 31 December 2013, included with assets held for sale is $8.5million of goodwill relating to APPH see note 25.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The Group has determined the recoverable amount of each CGU from value in use calculations.
The value in use calculations are based on cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent budgets and strategic plans for the next three years, as approved by management.
Cash flows beyond three years are extrapolated using estimated growth rates.
The resultant cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate appropriate for the relevant CGU.
Key assumptions The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are as follows: Sales volumes, selling prices and cost increases over the three years covered by managements detailed plans Sales volumes are based on industry forecasts and management estimates for the businesses in which each CGU operates, including forecasts for business and general aviation B&GA flying hours, aircraft engine cycles, and US military spending.
Selling prices and cost increases are based on past experience and management expectations of future changes in the market.
Overall, a balanced approach to volume levels, selling prices and cost increases has been taken.
The extent to which these assumptions affect each principle CGU with a significant level of goodwill are described below.
Signature Flight Support and Engine Repair and Overhaul both operate in the business and general aviation market.
Signature Flight Support is the worlds largest and market leading fixed base operation FBO network for business aviation providing full services support for B&GA travel, focused on passenger handling and customer amenities such as refuelling, hangar and office rentals, and other technical services.
Engine Repair and Overhaul ERO is a leading independent engine repair service provider to the B&GA market with strong relationships with all major engine OEMs.
ASIG operates in the commercial aviation market.
It is a global provider of ground, fuel and airport facility services to airlines, airports, oil companies and industry partners, delivering flexible and comprehensive service solutions including refuelling, ground handling, aircraft technical support services, facilities equipment maintenance and fide-icing.
Legacy Support operates in the military and commercial sectors and is the leading provider of high quality, cost effective solutions in the continuing support of maturing aerospace platforms to the major aerospace OEMs and airframe operators.
APPH is a niche landing gear and hydraulic sub-systems manufacturer, designing, engineering, manufacturing and supporting systems and sub-systems for original equipment and aftermarket applications.
In B&GA, growth is measured principally in relation to B&GA flying hours.
Whilst B&GA flying hours have made some recovery from the trough experienced in 2009, they remain c20% below their peak in the core market of the United States.
Whilst full recovery is taking longer than in previous cycles, there is no sign of any structural change in the market and the outlook for the medium and long-term remains good, with overall US B&GA flying hours expected to grow at c1-2x GDP growth over the next ten years.
In the commercial sector, growth is measured in commercial aircraft movements and our forecasts reflect the impact of both increasing passenger demand and growth in fleets, with the long-term aircraft movement growth remaining at least in line with GDP in our core US market.
Stronger growth is expected within the Asia Pacific markets, to which BBA has some exposure.
In the military market, government budgetary constraints, in the US in particular, add uncertainty to overall military expenditure.
However, management believes these constraints have more impact on the demand for new equipment particularly on development of new platforms, with a knock-on increase in requirements in keeping the existing and ageing fleet flying for longer.
It is these planes which Legacy supports, thereby insulating the business from the impact of the budgetary constraints.
Growth rates used for the periods beyond those covered by managements strategic plan Growth rates are derived from managements estimates, which take into account the long-term nature of the industry in which each CGU operates, external industry forecasts of long-term growth in the aerospace and defence sectors, the maturity of the platforms supplied by the CGU and the technological content of the CGUs products.
For the purpose of impairment testing, a conservative approach has been used and where the derived rate is higher than the long-term GDP growth rates for the countries in which the CGU operates, the latter has been used.
As a result, an estimated growth rate of 2.7% has been used, which reflects forecast long-term 113 US GDP growth.

Intangible assets continued 93 Independent Auditors Report to Discount rates applied to future cash flows the members of BBA Aviation plc The Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC has been used as the foundation for determining the discount rates to 96 Consolidated Income Statement be applied.
The WACC has then been adjusted to reflect risks specific to the CGU not already reflected in the future cash flows for that 97 Consolidated Statement of CGU.
The discount rates used were in the range of 12.1% to 12.7% for the CGUs within Flight Support and 12.6% to 13.5% for the CGUs Comprehensive Income within Aftermarket Services.
98 Consolidated Balance Sheet 99 Consolidated Cash Flow Sensitivity analysis Statement A sensitivity analysis was carried out for each CGU to determine the extent to which its assumptions would need to change for the 100 Consolidated Statement of calculated recoverable amounts based on value in use, to fall below the carrying value of goodwill of the CGU.
To require an Changes in Equity impairment in the Group financial statements, one of the following would be required: 101 Accounting Policies of theGroup estimates of cash flows during the three year period, for which management estimates have been used, would need to reduce 106 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements by 30%: or 141 Company Balance Sheet estimates of long-term growth rates would need to reduce from a growth rate of 2.7% to a long-term decline of more than 3.0%: or the discount rate applied to future cash flows would need to increase to more than 16%.
142 Accounting Policies of theCompany 144 Notes to the Company Management has concluded that no reasonably foreseeable change in the key assumptions used in the impairment model would Financial Statements result in a significant impairment charge being recorded in the financial statements.

Loan notes have been accounted for at fair value through profit and loss as the fair value interest rate risk has been hedged from fixed to floating interest rates.
Under IFRS hedge accounting rules the fair value movement on the loan notes is booked to interest and is offset by the fair value movement on the underlying interest rate swaps.
The Group includes the fair value gain on the interest rate swaps in relation to the loan notes within net debt so that the net effect is to show the $300 million US private placement at face value and to reflect the fact that the liabilities will be in place until maturity.

Financial instruments continued Notes to the Consolidated Financial risk factors Financial Statements The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Overall the Groups risk management policies and procedures focus on the uncertainty of financial markets and seek to manage and minimise potential financial risks through the use of derivative financial instruments.
The Group does not undertake speculative transactions for which there is no underlying financial exposure.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors of BBA Aviation plc.
This department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with Group subsidiary companies.
The treasury policies cover specific areas such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and the investment of excess liquidity.
These policies are outlined on page 57.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt to equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent comprising capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Groups policy is to borrow centrally to meet anticipated funding requirements.
These borrowings, together with cash generated from the operations, are on-lent or contributed as equity to subsidiaries at market-based interest rates and on commercial terms and conditions.
The Group is subject to two financial covenant requirements within its borrowing facilities: maximum net debt to EBITDA of 3.5 times and minimum net interest cover of 3.0 times based on EBITDA.
The Group complied with these covenants during the year.
Market risk Market risk is the risk of adverse financial impact due to changes in fair values or future cash flows of financial instruments from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group has well defined policies for the management of these risks which includes the use of derivative financial instruments.
i Foreign exchange risk The Group has significant overseas businesses whose revenues, cash flows, assets and liabilities are mainly denominated in the currency in which the operations are located.
The Groups policy in relation to foreign exchange translation risk is not to hedge the income statement since such hedges only have a temporary effect.
In relation to the balance sheet, the Group seeks to denominate the currency of its borrowings in US dollars in order to match the currency of its cash flows, earnings and assets which are principally denominated in US dollars.

100 Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity The Group manages its transactional foreign currency risk by hedging significant currency exposures in accordance with foreign exchange policies that Group subsidiaries have in place which have been pre-agreed between Group Treasury and the subsidiary.
101 Accounting Policies of theGroup Each foreign exchange policy is individually tailored to the foreign exchange exposures within the relevant subsidiary.
Transaction 106 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements currency risk is managed through the use of spot and forward foreign exchange contracts.

Foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge foreign currency flows through the BBA Aviation plc company bank accounts and to ensure that the Group is not exposed to foreign exchange risk through the management of its international cash pooling structure.
Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts which have not been designated as cash flow hedges have resulted in a credit of $4.7 million 2012: a charge of $10.7 million to administrative expenses in the income statement.
The net impact on the Groups result for the period is immaterial, since the balances which these contracts relate to have had a similar but opposite effect on administrative expenses.
Financial instruments continued Notes to the Consolidated ii Interest rate risk Financial Statements The Groups borrowings are funded through a combination of bank debt and capital markets borrowings.
The Groups bank debt is funded through floating rate debt which exposes the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Groups capital markets borrowings are financed through US private placement fixed rate debt which exposes the Group to changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to changes in interest rates.
During 2011 the Board reviewed and updated the Groups interest rate risk policy addressing the portion of its debt obligations, which should be fixed through the use of fixed rate debt and or interest rate swaps, in order to protect the interest cover covenant.

A charge of $6.1 million 2012: charge $10.3 million has been booked against hedged interest payments made in the period.
The Group has designated $300 million interest rate swaps as fair value hedges and no fair value gain or loss 2012: gain of $27.2 million has been booked to the income statement.
This amount is offset against the change in fair value on the fixed rate debt, which has also been booked to the income statement, so that the net impact is immaterial.
Credit risk Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
As part of the Groups operations, cash management and risk management activities, the Group is exposed to counterparty risk arising on the financial assets held by the Group and the credit risk on outstanding derivative financial instruments.
During the year the Group restructured one interest rate swap with a notional value of $75 million, resulting in a cash receipt of $7.3 million.
In 2012, two cross-currency swaps of 50 million and $75 million were closed out at a cash cost of $4.4 million and $6.5 million respectively.
In addition, in 2012 the Group closed out two interest rate swaps totalling $100 million at a cost of $3.8 million.

These 101 Accounting Policies of theGroup exposures are continually monitored and reported and no individual exposure is considered significant in the ordinary course of 106 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements treasury management activity.
No significant losses are expected to arise from non-performance by these counterparties.
141 Company Balance Sheet Commercial related credit risk 142 Accounting Policies of theCompany The Groups exposure to commercial related credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and finance lease receivables and the 144 Notes to the Company amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
Sales to customers are settled by a number of Financial Statements different ways including cash, credit cards, cheques and electronic payment methods.
A customer or potential customer is assessed 149 Principal Subsidiary and on a case-by-case basis to determine whether credit terms will be provided.
The Group does not expect any significant losses of Associated Undertakings receivables that have not been provided for, as shown in note 12.
150 Five Year Summary 151 Shareholder Information Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity requirements through the use of short-term and long-term cash flow forecasts.
In addition to strong cash generation in the businesses, the Group maintains unsecured committed borrowing facilities from a range of banks to mitigate this risk further.
Headroom on the Groups facilities is regularly evaluated and consistently monitored to ensure that the Group has adequate headroom and liquidity.
The Groups committed facilities are a $250 million revolving credit facility maturing in 2014 and a $500 million revolving credit facility maturing in 2016.

Sensitivity analysis as at 31 December 2013 Financial instruments affected by market risk are derivative financial instruments.
The following analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the derivative portfolio and the proportion of derivatives hedging foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk are all constant and on the basis of hedge designations in place at 31 December 2013 and 2012 respectively.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the position at these dates and is not representative of the year then ended.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: the balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates relates only to cash flow interest rate derivatives.
Cash and floating rate debt balances are carried at amortised cost and so their carrying value does not change as interest rates move.
Fixed rate debt is also carried at amortised cost unless fair value interest rate hedges are entered into and hedge accounting achieved whereby the fixed rate debt is fair valued through the income statement to offset the movement in fair value of the swaps: fair value interest rate swaps are assumed to be fully effective and therefore there is no impact on the income statement or balance sheet from changes in interest rates: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges or net investment hedges are assumed to be recorded fully within other comprehensive income: the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, cash and derivative instruments: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the income statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the income statement: the floating rate leg of any swap or any floating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set, therefore a change in the interest rate affects a full 12 month period for the accrued interest portion of the sensitivity calculations: the sensitivity of foreign exchange rates only looks at the outstanding foreign exchange forward book and the currency bank account balances of the Company only as at the balance sheet date and assumes this is the position for a full 12 month period: the sensitivity of a 10% movement in foreign exchange rates has been used due to the fact that historically rates can move by approximately 10% per annum: and the sensitivity of a 1% movement in interest rates has been used due to the fact that historically floating US dollar interest rates have moved by on average 1% per annum.

The charges to the restructuring provision in 2012 relate principally to rationalisation costs within the APPH business.
Provisions in respect of discontinued operations represents a provision for environmental and other liabilities relating to businesses that have been disposed of by the Group in prior years.
The provision of $15.4 million 2012: $27.8 million is partially offset by expected recoveries from third parties of $4.4 million 2012: $21.2 million, which are included within trade and other receivables due after one year $3.7 million and trade and other receivables due within one year $0.7 million in note 12.
Previously, in respect of recoveries from one particular third party, BBA paid the entire amount due to the claimant and was reimbursed by the third party in respect of the latters share.
That third party now pays its share of the amount due, direct to the claimant.
To reflect this, the associated provision and receivables balances each have been reduced by $15.8 million.
As a result, the recoveries as at 31 December have decreased from $21.2 million in 2012 to $4.4 million in 2013.
The discontinued operations provision also includes $3.7 million in respect of further potential claims which are described in note 26.
The liabilities have an expected life of up to 40 years.

Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The Group has adopted IAS 19: Employee Benefits Revised 2011 IAS 19R for the year ended 31 December 2013, which introduces changes to the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of post employment benefits.
Comparative figures for the years ended 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011 in the tables below have been restated.
The Group operates a number of plans worldwide, of both the funded defined benefit type and the defined contribution type.
The normal pension cost for the Group, including early retirement costs, is $13.5 million 2012: $11.4 million of which $7.5 million 2012: $6.3 million is in respect of schemes outside of the United Kingdom.
This includes $9.1 million 2012: $8.0 million relating to defined contribution schemes.
The pension costs and defined benefit obligation are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries.
The Groups main UK pension commitments are contained within a defined benefit scheme, the BBA Income and Protection Plan IPP, with assets held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
Contributions to the scheme are made and the pension cost is assessed using the projected unit method.
As required by UK pension law, there is a board of Trustees that, together with the Group, is responsible for governance of the IPP.
During 2008, the Trustees of the UK defined benefit plan purchased from Legal & General Group plc an annuity to match the liabilities associated with pensioner members.
Since the initial buy-in, further tranches of annuities have been purchased periodically in respect of new pensioner liabilities, although there have been no new tranches purchased during 2013.
The annuity is an investment of the UK plan, and all pension liabilities and responsibility for future pension payments remain with the plan.
The income from the annuity matches the payments to be made to the pensioner members it covers and removes mortality risk in relation to those members which are the subject of the annuity purchase.
The IPP was closed to new members in 2002.
On 1 March 2010, the future service benefits provided by this plan were changed from a final salary to a career average re-valued earnings CARE basis.
At the same time, benefits accrued in the IPP prior to 1 March 2010 were changed so that these now increase in line with inflation rather than future salary increases.
The latest actuarial valuation of the IPP was carried out as at 31 March 2012.
Following this valuation the Company agreed to pay additional contributions of 3.75 million $6.01 million per annum from March 2012 to December 2012, 4.75 million $7.69 million in 2013 and 6.80 million $11.02 million per annum from January 2014 to March 2017 to repair the funding shortfall of 30.4 million $48.6 million calculated at 31 March 2012.
The split of the defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2013 is approximately 15% in respect of active members, 26% in respect of deferred members and 59% in respect of pensioner members.
The weighted average duration of the IPPs liabilities is approximately 16 years.
The Groups foreign pension schemes, which are all in North America, mainly relate to a funded defined benefit pension arrangement.
There is also a post-employment medical plan and a deferred compensation plan.
Pension costs have been calculated by independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit method and assumptions appropriate to the arrangements in place.
In accordance with IAS 19R, and subject to materiality, the latest actuarial valuations of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes and healthcare plan have been reviewed and updated as at 31 December 2013.
The following weighted average financial assumptions have been adopted: United Kingdom North America 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 Per annum % Discount rate 4.3 4.0 4.6 4.7 3.7 4.4 Rate of increase to pensionable salaries 3.7 3.1 3.3 4.0 4.0 4.0 Price inflation 3.2 2.6 2.8 2.3 2.3 2.3 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.1 2.6 2.7 2.3 2.3 2.3 IAS 19R requires that the discount rate used to discount the liability be determined by reference to market yields on high quality corporate bond investments at the reporting date.
The currency and terms of these should be consistent with the currency and estimated term of the post-employment obligations.
The discount rate for the IPP has been derived using a yield curve approach.
The yield curve is based on the yield available on Sterling AA rated corporate bonds of a term similar to the liabilities.
The RPI assumption for the IPP allows for the shape of the inflation spot curve and the duration of the Plans liabilities.
A deduction of 30 basis points has been made to the breakeven inflation assumption to allow for an inflation risk premium.

All of the assets in respect of the US plans were quoted on an active investment market.
2 In accordance with IAS 19R and IFRIC 14 a minimum funding liability arises where the statutory funding requirements are such that future contributions in respect of past service will result in an unrecognisable surplus in the future.
The funding policy for the IPP and majority of the North American schemes is reviewed on a systematic basis in consultation with the independent scheme actuary in order to ensure that the funding contributions from sponsoring employers are appropriate to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long-term.
Included within other receivables in the balance sheet are $3.8 million 2012: $4.2 million of listed investments which are held in trust for the benefit of members of the deferred compensation plan in North America.

To the extent that the IPP is partially funded through asset performance, and actual investment returns achieved are lower than those assumed, then this may result in a worsening of the funding position and higher future cash contribution requirements for the Group.
At 31 December 2013, the largest single category of investment held by the IPP is an annuity with a value of $432.2 million 58% of the asset holding at 31 December 2013 purchased from Legal and General which matches liabilities associated with pensioner members.
The purpose of the annuity is to help reduce asset liability mismatch risk.

Contingent liabilities The Group is party to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business, including specific product liability and environmental claims.
Any liabilities are likely to be mitigated by legal defences, insurance, reserves and third party indemnities.
Additionally, the Group has previously owned businesses that manufactured products containing asbestos.
No BBA company has manufactured or sold any products or materials containing asbestos for many years.
A small number of former BBA companies have been named as defendants to asbestos-related claims.
When these companies were sold, BBA retained certain obligations to indemnify the purchasers against such claims.
Notwithstanding such indemnity arrangements, the costs incurred by BBA in dealing with claims made against these former BBA companies have been immaterial to BBA.
During the period 1989 to 31 December 2013, BBAs aggregate costs of defending and disposing of all asbestos-related claims, net of insurance coverage, were approximately $16.7million.
BBA maintains a portfolio of insurance coverage in respect of the majority of such claims, including legal defence costs and liability cover.
State operated compensation programmes have also provided coverage.
On the basis of its past claims experience, as at 31 December 2013, BBA has provided $3.7 million 2012: $nil in respect of such claims.
Whilst the outcome of these claims are, by their nature, uncertain, the directors do not currently anticipate that the outcome of the proceedings and claims set out above either individually, or in aggregate, will materially exceed the insurance coverage or amounts provided as shown in note 18, and are not expected to have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.
