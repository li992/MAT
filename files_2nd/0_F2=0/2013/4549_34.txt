com Stock code: DPH Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
Accounting Policies Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 30 June 2013 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries.
a Statement of Compliance These consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP and they are separately presented on pages 147 to 155. b Basis of Preparation The Groups business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report and Operating Review on pages 3 to 47.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
Refer to the Corporate Governance Report on page 58 for details.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand.
They are prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, except where International Financial Reporting Standards require an alternative treatment.
The principal variations relate to derivative financial instruments, cash settled share-based transactions and contingent consideration that are stated at fair value.
The preparation for consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of accounting estimates and for management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
These judgements and estimates are based on historical experience and managements best knowledge of the amounts, events or actions under review and the actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.
Areas involving a high degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are, where necessary, disclosed separately.
Discontinued Operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that has been disposed of or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
Classification of a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier.
When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative income statement is presented as if the operation had discontinued from the start of the comparative period.
The disposal of the Services Division, as described in note 29, gives rise to a discontinued operation and restatement of comparatives.
Critical Judgements in applying the Groups Accounting Policies and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, the Directors have made the following judgements and estimates that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty which may cause a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are also discussed below.
Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets The Group determines whether goodwill and indefinite life assets are impaired at least on an annual basis.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which they are allocated.
Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
Further detail on the assumptions used in determining value in use calculations is provided in note 13.
Valuation of Intangible Assets Product rights and customer relationships that are acquired by the Group as part of a business combination are stated at fair value at the date of acquisition less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Fair value at the date of acquisition reflects managements judgement of the fair value of the individual intangible asset calculated by reference to the net present value of future benefits accruing to the Group from the utilisation of the asset, discounted at an appropriate discount rate.

Accounting Policies continued Impairment of Receivables The Group has estimated impairment of receivables by assessing recoverability of amounts due on a customer by customer basis.
As described in note 22, credit risk is not highly concentrated for continuing operations.
Capitalisation of Development Costs The Group applies judgement when assessing the probability that regulatory approval will be achieved for development projects and that those projects are commercially viable.
This enables management to ascertain whether the criteria for the capitalisation of development costs have been met.
Adoption of New and Revised Standards The following standards and interpretations are applicable to the Group and have been adopted in the current period as they are mandatory for the year ended 30 June 2013 but either have no material impact on the result or net assets of the Group or are not applicable.
Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income amends how components of other income are presented.
The amendments require the grouping of other comprehensive income into items that might be reclassified to the income statement in subsequent periods and items that will not be reclassified to the income statement in subsequent periods.
Amendment to IAS 12 Income Taxes Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets introduces a presumption for deferred tax purposes that recovery of the carrying amount of an investment property will normally be through sale.
In addition to the above, amendments to a number of standards under the annual improvements project to IFRS, which are mandatory for the year ended 30 June 2013, have been adopted in the year.
The adoption of these standards and amendments has not had a material impact on the Groups financial statements.
New Standards and Interpretations not yet Adopted The following standards and interpretations have been published, endorsed by the EU, and are available for early adoption, but have not yet been applied by the Group in these financial statements.

Accounting Policies continued c Basis of Consolidation Subsidiary Undertakings Subsidiary undertakings are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They cease to be consolidated from the date that the Group no longer has control.
All subsidiary undertakings have been consolidated.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
The financial statements of all subsidiary undertakings are prepared to the same reporting date as the Company.
During the 2012 2013 financial year the reporting dates of the previously acquired Eurovet companies have been brought in line with the Company.
d Foreign Currency Translation i Functional and Presentational Currency The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Groups presentational currency and are rounded to the nearest thousand, except where it is deemed relevant to disclose the amounts to the nearest pound.
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
ii Foreign Currency Translation Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, with the exception of differences on transactions that are subject to effective cash flow hedges, which are recognised in other comprehensive income.
iii Foreign Operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to Sterling at the closing rate at the reporting date.
The income and expenses are translated to Sterling at the average rate for the period being reported.
Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income in the foreign currency translation reserve, a separate component of equity.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
On disposal of a foreign entity, accumulated exchange differences previously recognised in other comprehensive income are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the gain or loss on disposal is recognised.
e Accounting for Financial Assets, Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities The Gr oup classifies its financial assets into the following categories: held for trading financial assets and loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the assets are held.
Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial r ecognition in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date for financial assets other than those held at fair value through the income statement.
Financial assets ar e derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Gains and losses both realised and unrealised arising from changes in the value of financial assets held at fair value through the income statement are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
The Gr oup assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
22581.04 10 September 2013 1:31 PM Proof 3 106 Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2013 Our Financials Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued Held for Trading Financial Assets This category has two sub-categories: financial assets held for trading and those designated at fair value thr ough the income statement at inception.
A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term or if so designated by management.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are also categorised as held for trading.
Held for trading financial assets are recognised and subsequently carried at fair value.
Derivative Financial Instruments The Gr oup uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivatives ar e initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date.
Cash Flow Hedges Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges ar e recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective.
To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expir es or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.
The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income remains there until the forecast transaction occurs.
When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the carrying amount of the asset when it is recognised.
In other cases, the amount recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement in the same period that the hedged item affects profit or loss.
Trade Receivables T rade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement in operating expenses.
Trade and Other Payables T rade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
Borrowings and Borrowing Costs Borr owings are recognised initially at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borr owings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.
Borr owing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.

Accounting Policies continued f Property, Plant and Equipment Owned Assets Items of pr operty, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy j.
Leased Assets Leases under the terms of which the Gr oup assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Assets acquired by finance leases are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation Depr eciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until the date the assets become available for use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: freehold buildings 25 years short leasehold buildings period of lease plant and fixtures 310 years motor vehicles 4 years The residual value, if not insignificant, is reassessed annually.
g Intangible Assets Goodwill All business combinations ar e accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 July 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the separable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
In r espect of acquisitions prior to this date, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under previous GAAP.
The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to 1 July 2004 were not reconsidered in preparing the Groups opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 July 2004.
For acquisitions prior to 1 July 2009, costs dir ectly attributable to business combinations formed part of the consideration payable when calculating goodwill.
Adjustments to contingent consideration, and therefore the consideration payable and goodwill, are made at each reporting date until the consideration is fully determined.
Acquisitions after this date fall under the pr ovisions of Revised IFRS 3 Business Combinations 2009.
For these acquisitions, transaction costs, other than share and debt issue costs, are expensed as incurred and subsequent adjustments to the fair value of consideration payable are recognised in the income statement.
Contingent consideration is measur ed at fair value based on an estimate of the expected future payments.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is not amortised but is allocated to cash generating units and is tested annually for impairment.

Accounting Policies continued Research and Development Costs Expenditur e on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as an expense is incurred.
The Gr oup is also engaged in development activity with a view to bringing new pharmaceutical products to market.
Internally generated costs of development are capitalised in the consolidated statement of financial position unless those costs cannot be measured reliably or it is not probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group, in which case the relevant costs are expensed to the income statement as incurred.
Due to the strict regulatory process involved, there is inherent uncertainty as to the technical feasibility of development projects often until regulatory approval is achieved, with the possibility of failure even at a late stage.
The Group considers that this uncertainty means that the criteria for capitalisation are not met unless it is highly probable that regulatory approval will be achieved and the project is commercially viable.
Wher e development costs are capitalised, the expenditure includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Capitalised development expenditur e is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Acquired Intangible Assets Intangible assets r ecognised as a result of a business combination are stated at fair value at the date of acquisition less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets that ar e acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and other intangibles is recognised in the income statement as an expense is incurred.
Subsequent Expenditure Subsequent expenditur e on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.
Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are systematically tested for impairment at each consolidated statement of financial position date.
Other intangible assets are amortised from the date that they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: software 5 years capitalised development costs 510 years or period of patent patent rights Period of patent marketing authorisations Indefinite life product rights 1015 years customer relationships 10 years h Inventories Inventories ar e stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in, first-out principle and includes expenditur e incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity.

Accounting Policies continued i Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank over drafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
j Impairment The carrying amounts of the Gr oups assets are reviewed at each consolidated statement of financial position date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
The r ecoverable amount of assets is the greater of their net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
For goodwill, assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that ar e not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each consolidated statement of financial position date and when there is an indication that the asset is impaired.
An impairment loss is r ecognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses r ecognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating units group of units, and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the units group of units on a pro-rata basis.
An impairment loss in r espect of goodwill is not reversed.
In r espect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is r eversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
k Dividends Dividends ar e recognised in the period in which they are approved by the Companys Shareholders or, in the case of an interim dividend, when the dividend is paid.
l Employee Benefits Pensions The Gr oup operates a stakeholder personal pension scheme for certain employees.
Obligations for contributions are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Dechra V eterinary Products SAS and Dechra Veterinary Products BV participate in state-run pension arrangements.
These are not considered to be material to the Group financial statements and are accounted for as defined contribution schemes, with contributions being recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
The Gr oup sponsors defined benefit arrangements in certain countries, the most material being a defined benefit pension plan in the Netherlands.
This is a funded career average pay arrangement, where pensionable salary is subject to a cap.
The arrangement is financed through an insurance contract.

Accounting Policies continued The Gr oups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
That benefit is discounted to determine its pr esent value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The liability discount rate is the yield at the Statement of Financial Position date using AA rated corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
All actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the Gr oups obligation in respect of a scheme are recognised immediately in reserves and reported in the consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the asset recognised is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Share-based Payment Transactions The Gr oup operates a number of equity settled share-based payment programmes that allow employees to acquire shares in the Company.
The Group also operates a Long Term Incentive Plan for Directors and Senior Executives.
The fair value of shar es or options granted is recognised as an employee expense over the vesting period on a straight-line basis in the income statement with a corresponding movement to equity reserves.
Fair values are determined by use of an appropriate pricing model and are determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted.
The amount to be expensed over the vesting period is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
At each consolidated statement of financial position date, the Gr oup revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest.
The impact of the revisions of original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves, over the remaining vesting period.
The fair values of grants under the Long T erm Incentive Plan have been determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model.
The fair values of options granted under all other shar e option schemes have been determined using the BlackScholes option pricing model.
National Insurance contributions payable by the Company on the intrinsic value of shar e-based payments at the date of exercise are treated as cash settled awards and revalued to market price at each consolidated statement of financial position date.
m Revenue Recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of goods sold and services pr ovided to external customers, net of value added tax, rebates, promotions and returns.
For both Pharmaceuticals and Services, revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer.
This is normally when the buyer takes delivery of the goods.
For services pr ovided, revenue is recognised when the contractual service has been provided to the customer.
No revenue is recognised where the recovery of the consideration is not probable or where there are significant uncertainties regarding associated costs or the possible return of goods.

Accounting Policies continued n Leases Operating Leases Payments made under operating leases ar e recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement evenly over the period of the lease, as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Finance Leases Minimum lease payments ar e apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability using the effective interest method.
o Net Financing Costs Net financing costs comprise inter est payable on borrowings, unwinding of discount on provisions, interest receivable on funds invested, gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement see accounting policy e and gains or losses on the retranslation of financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues.
The Group capitalises borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset.
The interest expense component of finance lease payments is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
p Basis of Charge for Taxation Income tax expense comprises curr ent and deferred tax.
Current and deferred taxes are recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to a business combination or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Curr ent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the consolidated statement of financial position date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferr ed tax is provided using the consolidated statement of financial position liability method and represents the tax payable or recoverable on most temporary differences which arise between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes the tax base.
Temporary differences are not provided on: goodwill that is not deductible for tax purposes: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and do not arise from a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, and is based upon tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the consolidated statement of financial position date.
A deferr ed tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is not probable that the related tax benefit will be realised against future taxable profits.
The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each consolidated statement of financial position date.
Curr ent and deferred tax credits received in respect of share-based payments are recognised in the Income Statement to the extent that they do not exceed the standard rate of taxation on the Income Statement charge for share-based payments.
Credits in excess of the standard rate of taxation are recognised directly in equity.

Accounting Policies continued q Earnings per Share The Gr oup presents basic and diluted earnings per share EPS data for its ordinary shares.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary Shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit attributable to ordinary Shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue, for the effects of all potential dilutive ordinary shares, which comprise share options granted to employees.
Ther e was a Rights Issue during the year ended 30 June 2012 and EPS figures have been restated to reflect the bonus element of this issue.
The Gr oup has also chosen to present an alternative EPS measure, with profit adjusted for non-underlying items.
A reconciliation of this alternative measure to the statutory measure required by IFRS is given in notes 4 and 5.
Operating Segments The Group has four reportable segments, as discussed below, which are based on information provided to the Board of Directors, which is deemed to be the Groups chief operating decision maker.
Several operating segments which have similar economic characteristics have been aggregated into the reporting segments.
The Services Segment comprises National Veterinary Services, Dechra Laboratory Services and Dechra Specialist Laboratories.
This Segment services UK veterinary practices in both the companion animal and livestock sectors.
On 10 July 2013, the Group announced its intention to dispose of the Services businesses.
The disposal is consistent with the Groups long term policy to focus its activities on the manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products.
The Segment was not a discontinued operation or classified as held for sale at 30 June 2012 and the comparative consolidated income statement has been represented to show the discontinued operation separately from continuing operations.
Refer to note 29 for further details, and segmental analysis in relation to the Services Division.
The European Pharmaceuticals Segment comprises Dechra Veterinary Products EU, Eurovet and Dechra Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing.
Dechra Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing manufactures the vast majority of our own branded licensed pharmaceutical products, which are marketed through DVP EU and Eurovet.
This Segment operates internationally and specialises in companion animal products and has expanded into the food producing animal market following the acquisition of Eurovet.
The US Pharmaceuticals Segment consists of Dechra Veterinary Products US which sells companion animal pharmaceuticals into that territory.
The Pharmaceuticals Research and Development Segment includes all of the Groups pharmaceutical research and development activities.
There are varying levels of intersegment trading.
Intersegment pricing is determined on an arms length basis.

A reduction in the rate from 24% to 23% effective from 1 April 2013 was substantively enacted on 3 July 2012, and further reductions to 21% effective from 1 April 2014 and 20% effective from 1 April 2015 were substantively enacted on 17 July 2013.
This will reduce the Groups future current tax charge accordingly and further reduce the deferred tax liability at 30 June 2013 which has been calculated based on the rate of 23% substantively enacted at 30 June 2013 by 3.4 million.
It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further rate reductions, although this will further reduce the Groups future current tax charge and reduce the Groups deferred tax liability accordingly.

The principal assets within acquired intangibles are the development costs and product rights recognised on the acquisitions of Dechra Veterinary Products Holding A S, DermaPet Inc. Genitrix Limited and Eurovet Animal Health B. V. The carrying value of these assets at 30 June 2013 was 141.6 million with a remaining amortisation period of 4 years, 12 years, 7 years and 9 years respectively.
The other significant assets within acquired intangibles are the product rights recognised on the acquisition of Pharmaderm Animal Health and HY-50.
The carrying value at 30 June 2013 was 1.5 million and 4.4 million with a remaining amortisation period of 10 years and 8 years respectively.
During the year the Company has completed a licensing, supply and distribution agreement for a branded veterinary generic pharmaceutical product from a US pharmaceutical development company.
Under the terms of the agreement Dechra has paid US$1.5 million upon signing and will pay a further US$1.5 million on approval.
There is a potential further contingent payment of US$2.0 million based on achieving US$20.0 million cumulative sales.
The principal asset within patent rights comprises payments to acquire the right to develop and market Trilostane, the active ingredient of Vetoryl Capsules, for animal health applications in the USA and Canada.
The carrying value at 30 June 2013 was 1.2 million with a remaining amortisation period of 5 years.
The rights to Equidone, which was launched in the US during 2011, has a carrying value of 0.9 million with an amortisation period of 8 years.
822,000 of the marketing authorisations relate to the Vetivex range of products.
The Vetivex marketing authorisations are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives and have not been amortised.
Ownership of the marketing authorisations rests with the Group in perpetuity.
There are not believed to be any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that limit their useful lives.
Vetivex is an established range of products which are relatively simple in nature and there are a limited number of players in the market.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that it is appropriate that the marketing authorisations are treated as having indefinite lives for accounting purposes.

Impairment Reviews Goodwill, indefinite life assets and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are indications that amounts might be impaired.
The impairment test involves determining the recoverable amount of the relevant asset or cash generating unit, which corresponds to the higher of the fair value less costs to sell or its value in use.
Value in use calculations are performed by forecasting the future cash flows attributable to the asset being tested or the relevant cash generating unit in respect of goodwill.
The forecast cash flows are discounted at an appropriate rate as described below.
Projected future cash flows have been derived from the business plan and extrapolated by applying a growth rate of 3% 2012: 5% per annum up to year five and thereafter a growth rate of 0% 2012: 0% per annum into perpetuity which is considered to be conservative compared to the long term average growth rate for the industry.
The business plan has been formulated based on various factors, including market growth forecasts, the experience of the impact of previous recessions and existing product growth.
These factors reflect past experience of the Group and, where applicable, are consistent with external sources of information.
The pre-tax discount rates have been estimated using the Groups weighted average cost of capital, which is adjusted for consideration of market information, and risk adjusted dependent upon the specific circumstances of each asset or cash generating unit.
Value in use calculations were performed at 30 June 2013 for the following assets: 2013 Goodwill Indefinite life Pre-tax carrying assets carrying Total discount value value value rate Cash generating unit 000 000 000 % Dechra Veterinary Products EU 55,794 822 56,616 8.8 Dermapet 330 330 10.4 Dales 2,231 2,231 8.7 2012 Goodwill Indefinite life Pre-tax carrying assets carrying Total discount value value value rate 000 000 000 % Dechra Veterinary Products EU 52,749 822 53,571 8.9 Dermapet 320 320 9.5 Laboratories 2,621 2,621 9.9 Dales 2,231 2,231 8.7 In all cases there was significant headroom between the carrying value and the value in use and no impairment provision is therefore required.
An increase in the pre-tax discount rate of 1% and a reduction in the growth rate to nil would still not result in the requirement for an impairment provision.

Under this contract, a market price for the assets in respect of this insurance contract is not available.
In accordance with IAS 19 for such insurance policies, an asset value has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows.
The discount rate used for this calculation reflects the risk associated with the scheme assets and the maturity or expected disposal date of those assets.
The fair value of the schemes assets is as follows: 2013 2012 000 000 Discount rate used to value assets 3.90% 4.60% Total fair value of assets 3,726 2,438 Actual return on scheme assets 123 10 The long term rate of return on pension plan assets is determined by aggregating the expected return for each asset class over the strategic asset allocation as at the year end.
This rate of return is then adjusted for any expected profit sharing based on market related returns on notional loans.
The schemes assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments or any property occupied by or other assets used by the Group.
The employer has a contract with the insurance company  to cover the committed pension benefits.
The employer contributions expected to be paid into the scheme for the next financial period amount to 571,000 2012: 480,000.

Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures The Groups financial instruments comprise cash deposits, bank loans and overdrafts, finance lease obligations, derivatives used for hedging purposes and trade receivables and payables.
Treasury Policy The Group reports in Sterling and pays dividends out of Sterling profits.
The role of the Groups treasury activities is to manage and monitor the Groups external and internal funding requirements and financial risks in support of the Groups corporate activities.
Treasury activities are governed by policies and procedures approved by the Board of Directors.
The Group uses a variety of financial instruments, including derivatives, to finance its operations and to manage market risks from these operations.
Derivatives, principally comprising forward foreign currency contracts, foreign currency options and interest rate swaps, are used to hedge against changes in foreign currencies and interest rates.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and the Groups treasury policy specifically prohibits such activity.
All transactions in financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities, not for speculation.
Capital Management The capital structure of the Group consists of net borrowings and Shareholders equity.
At 30 June 2013, net borrowings were 80.8 million, whilst Shareholders equity was 174.6 million.
The Group maintains a strong capital base so as to maintain investors, creditors and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Group monitors both the demographic spread of Shareholders, as well as the return on capital, which the Group defines as total Shareholder return.
The Group manages its capital structure to maintain a prudent balance between debt and equity that allows sufficient headroom to finance the Groups product development programme and appropriate acquisitions.
The Group operates globally, primarily through subsidiary companies established in the markets in which the Group trades.
The Groups operating subsidiaries are generally cash generative and none are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
There are financial covenants associated with the Groups borrowings which are cash flow cover, interest cover, net debt to EBITDA and consolidated net worth.
The Group comfortably complied with these covenants in 2013 and 2012.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Operating cash flow is used to fund investment in the development of new products as well as to make the routine outflows of capital expenditure, tax, dividends and repayment of maturing debt.
The Groups policy is to maintain borrowing facilities centrally which are then used to finance the Groups operating subsidiaries, either by way of equity investments or loans.

Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures continued Financial Risk Management The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: liquidity risk market risk credit risk This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, and the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk.
Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not have sufficient funds to meet liabilities as they fall due.
Cash forecasts identifying the liquidity requirements of the Group are produced quarterly.
These are reviewed to ensure sufficient financial headroom exists for at least a 12 month period.
The Group manages its funding requirements through the following lines of credit: 55 million term loan 65 million revolving credit facility 10 million working capital facility various finance leases The Groups undrawn borrowing facilities at 30 June 2013 are detailed in note 20.
Market Risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates or interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holding of financial instruments.
Interest Rate Risk Management The majority of the Groups borrowings bear interest at floating rates linked to base rate or LIBOR and are consequently exposed to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Group has hedged interest rate risk on a proportion of its term loan and revolving credit facility by means of an interest rate swap arrangement whereby the Groups exposure to fluctuations in LIBOR is fixed at a rate of 0.83% on the term loan and 0.88% on the revolving credit facility.
The amount of the term loan and revolving credit outstanding at 30 June 2013 was 115.1 million 2012: 120.8 million.
The hedge is in place until 31 October 2016 and the amount hedged matches the repayment profile of the loan.
Foreign Exchange Risk Management Foreign currency transaction exposure arising on normal trade flows is not hedged.
The Group matches receipts and payments in the relevant foreign currencies as far as possible.
To this end, bank accounts are maintained for all the major currencies in which the Group trades.
Translational exposure in converting the income statements of foreign subsidiaries into the Groups presentational currency of Sterling is not hedged.
The Group hedges selectively expected currency cash flows outside normal trading activities, principally using foreign currency options.

Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures continued Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Group considers its maximum credit risk to be 59,009,000 2012: 102,996,000 which is the total carrying value of the Groups financial assets.
Cash is only deposited with highly rated banks.
The Group offers trade credit to customers in the normal course of business.
Trade and bank references are obtained prior to extending credit.
The financial statements of corporate customers are monitored on a regular basis.
The principal customers of the Pharmaceuticals segments are European and US wholesalers.
The failure of a large wholesaler could have a material adverse impact on the Groups financial results.
The largest customer of the Group excluding assets relating to discontinued operations accounted for approximately 2.0% of gross trade receivables at 30 June 2013 2012: 1.5%.
No customer accounted for more than 10% of total Group revenues.
Receivables are written off against the impairment provision when management considers the debt to be no longer recoverable.
Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities The following table presents the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at 30 June 2013 and 30 June 2012.
The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: Cash and cash equivalents approximates to the carrying amount.
Forward exchange contracts based on market price and exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Interest rate swaps based upon the amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the instrument at the balance sheet date, being the market price of the instrument.
Receivables and payables approximates to the carrying amount.
Bank loans and overdrafts based upon discounted cash flows using discount rates based upon facility rates renegotiated after the 30 June 2012 year end.
Finance lease obligations based upon discounted cash flows using discount rates based upon the Groups cost of borrowing at the balance sheet date.

Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures continued Sensitivity Analysis Interest Rate Risk A 2.0% increase in interest rates compared to those ruling at 30 June 2013 would reduce Group profit before taxation and equity by 621,000 2012: 168,000.
Foreign Currency Risk The Group has significant cash flows and net financial assets and liabilities in Danish Krone, US Dollar and Euro.
The following table shows the impact on the Groups profit before taxation and net assets of a 10% appreciation of Sterling against each of these currencies: Profit before Net taxation assets 000 000 Danish Krone 50 15 US Dollar 111 359 Euro 3,195 12,286 Hedges Cash Flow Hedges The Group has entered into an interest rate swap on the term loan of 55 million and the revolving credit facility of 65 million.

The risk being hedged is the variability of cash flows arising from movements in interest rates.
No ineffectiveness arose on the hedge.
The hedge is in place until 31 October 2016.
The amounts recognised in equity are recycled to the income statement to offset gains and losses in the period in which the cash flows occurs.
The amount recognised in equity in the year ended 30 June 2013 was a liability of nil including an income tax credit of 15,000 2012: 286,000 including an income tax credit of 101,000.
