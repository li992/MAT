Acquisitions During the year a net cash outflow of 117.0m arose on the acquisitions set out below: m Enara Group Limited 110.8 Creativevents Limited 2.9 Dalkia FM in Norway 1.1 Non-controlling interests 1.4 Utilyx deferred consideration 1.2 Change in deferred contingent consideration for subsidiaries acquired prior to 31 March 2010 Note 13 0.9 Other 0.5 Net cash outflow on acquisitions 117.0 Current year acquisitions Entities acquired during the year contributed 57.1m to revenue and 6.4m to the groups headline operating profit for the period.
If the acquisitions had taken place at the start of the period, the groups headline revenue and operating profit would have been approximately 2,035m and 128m respectively.
The goodwill arising on the acquisitions is attributable to the underlying profitability of the companies in the acquired group, expected profitability arising from new business and the anticipated future operating synergies arising from assimilation into MITIE.
None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements revised 2008 requires transactions with non-controlling interests to be accounted for within equity.
As a result, the difference of 13.6m between the consideration paid for the purchase of non-controlling interests during the year and the change in non-controlling interests is recognised in retained earnings, along with 6.5m of earnout deferred consideration in respect of the acquisition of Creativevents Limited.
Prior to adoption of the revised standard in the year ended 31 March 2011 these amounts would have been recognised in goodwill.
