Annual financial statements Notes to the annual financial statements continued 14.
Reclassications of financial instruments During the year ended 31 March 2009 the group reclassied certain financial instruments out of fair value through profit or loss.
These assets were originally classied as held-for-trading but the groups intentions in regard to these assets changed and the group reclassied 112.3 million and 7.8 million to the loans and receivables and available-for-sale classications, respectively.
The amount reclassied reected the fair value of the financial assets at the date of reclassication.
The group did not undertake any further reclassications under the amendment to IAS 39 in the current year and in the prior year.
The following table shows carrying values and fair values of the assets reclassied: 2013 2012 Carrying Carrying At 31 March 000 value Fair value value Fair value Trading assets reclassied to loans and receivables 46 025 26 784 50 313 39 713 46 025 26 784 50 313 39 713 If the reclassications had not been made, the groups income before tax in 2013 would have reduced by 8.6 million 2012: an increase of 11.7 million.
In the current year the reclassied assets have contributed a 372 000 loss through the margin line and a loss of 4.9 million through impairments before taxation.
In the prior year, after reclassication, the assets contributed a 198 000 loss through the margin line and a loss of 1.4 million through impairments before taxation.
Fair value hierarchy IFRS 7 requires that an entity disclose for each class of financial instruments measured at fair value, the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurements are categorised in their entirety.
The fair value hierarchy reects the signicance of the inputs used in making fair value measurements.
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety shall be determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
The fair value hierarchy has the following levels: Level 1 quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs Assets and liabilities related to the long-term assurance business attributable to policyholders have been excluded from the analysis as the change in fair value of related assets is attributable to policyholders.
These are all level 1 assets.
