Underlying EBITDA has historically been presented as Adjusted EBITDA and defined as EBITDA before separately disclosed items and charges relating to equity-settled share-based payments.
For the year ended 30 April 2013, Adjusted EBITDA has been renamed Underlying EBITDA and includes charges relating to equity-settled share-based payments but excludes separately disclosed items.
Comparative periods have been amended accordingly.
Separately disclosed items in the prior year include results from High Rollers 2013: nil, 2012: 3.9m profit.
As any potential ordinary shares would have the effect of decreasing the loss per share, they have not been treated as dilutive: hence diluted loss per share has not been disclosed.
