The Scottish Western of the early days was very highly geared but it was mainly invested in bonds, though the international spread resembled todays, with countries such as Argentina, China, Japan, Canada and many others appearing in the portfolio.
Although the range of currencies was much smaller, multi currency or even gold-backed bonds were commonplace, as many of the eras bond certificates show.
The big move into equities came after the 1930s slump, when bond defaults forced the purchase of higher yielding equities to fund the costs of the Companys gearing.
The Managers were not slow to spot an opportunity, but it started as Hobsons choice, and was only later hailed as brilliant foresight.
In 1929 just under 20% of the assets were in equities, in 1940 38%, in 1948 51% of the assets, which were still only 2.65 million.
After deducting the preference shares which were repaid in 1999 and debentures, the Company was effectively over 100% geared into equities by the start of the great post war boom.
After a number of amalgamations, the Company emerged as a generalist investment trust.
However, there was an excess of trusts with a similar broad remit, so towards the end of the 1970s the Board defined the investment brief more narrowly as the achievement of growth in income and capital through a well diversified portfolio.
Symbolised by the name change from Murray Western to Murray International Trust PLC in 1984, the focus has since been on a relatively high yielding portfolio of equities in a well diversified mix of world markets.
In 2008 the Board circulated to all shareholders a short booklet to commemorate the centenary of the incorporation of the Company on 18 December 1907.
