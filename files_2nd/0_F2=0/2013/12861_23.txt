Significant accounting policies Accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in dealing with items that are considered material in relation to the Groups financial statements.
In the income statement, the Group presents specific adjusting items separately.
In the judgement of the Directors, for the reader to obtain a proper understanding of the financial information, specific adjusting items need to be disclosed separately because of their size and incidence.
Specific adjusting items include: amortisation of intangibles arising from acquisitions: pension curtailment gains losses: pension past service credits costs: pension net finance expense: gains losses on business divestments and disposal of investments: restructuring costs: gains losses on disposal of property: impairment of property: impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets: net gain in respect of previously capitalised DTR programme bid costs: and tax on the above items.
Pension finance income and pension finance expense were, prior to this accounting period, reported within underlying performance.
With effect from this accounting period the pension net finance expense is included within specific adjusting items in the middle column of the income statement and the comparative financial information has been restated accordingly.
In the judgement of the Directors the exclusion of this non-cash financial item which can swing from net expense to net income leads to a better understanding of the financial information, given its volatility.
Basis of preparation The Groups financial statements, approved by the Directors, have been prepared on a going concern basis as discussed in the Directors Report on page 44 and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRS and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 112-114.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets and other relevant financial assets and liabilities.
Non-current assets held for sale are held at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The Groups reporting currency is sterling and unless otherwise stated the financial statements are rounded to the nearest 100,000.
The Company has implemented IAS 19 revised Employee benefits in the year ended 31 March 2013, electing to adopt this standard early.
There are three specific impacts on the income statement, as outlined below: A reclassification of the administration costs of the defined benefit pension scheme, including the levy for the Pension Protection Fund, from finance expense to underlying operating profit: A change in the calculation of the interest income on plan assets.
This was previously based on the expected returns on the various asset types held within the investment portfolio.
It is now calculated at the same rate used to calculate the interest expense on the pension liability, being a discount rate derived from corporate bonds.
The difference between this calculated return and the actual return is reported as an actuarial gain loss through reserves: and The reporting of a combined net figure within finance expense, rather than showing the pension interest income and pension interest expense gross, within finance income and finance expense respectively.
Subsequent to the early adoption of IAS 19 revised Employee benefits, the Group has also elected to disclose the finance expense on the net pension liability as a specific adjusting item within the middle column of the consolidated income statement.
The comparative figures for the income statement for the year ended 31 March 2012 have been restated to show the effect of this early adoption and the reclassification as a specific adjusting item.
The effect of adopting IAS 19 revised on the Groups profit for the prior full-year period is to reduce both underlying and total reported profit after tax by 11.6m.
The subsequent effect of the reclassification of net finance expense from underlying performance to within specific adjusting items is to increase underlying profit by 5.5m, although it has no impact on total reported profit.
The combined effect of the two adjustments on the Groups profit for the full-year period to 31 March 2012 is therefore to reduce the underlying profit after tax by 6.1m to 88.7m and to reduce total reported profit after tax by 11.6m to 246.3m.
If the reclassification of pension finance income and pension finance expense had been made in isolation, without early adoption of IAS 19 revised, there would have been no impact on the Groups total reported profit for the period.
Underlying profit after tax for the year ended 31 March 2012 would have decreased by 4.9m, with an equal increase in profit after tax in respect of specific adjusting items in the middle column of the income statement.
70 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Overview Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Addi onal informa on The full impact on the income statement, for the year ended 31 March, is set out in the table below: 2012 restated 2012 reported Specific Specific adjusting adjusting all figures in million Total Underlying items Total Underlying items Operating profit 159.6 201.7 361.3 161.3 201.7 363.0 Gain on disposals 11.6 11.6 11.6 11.6 Finance income 2.2 2.2 69.8 69.8 Finance expense 51.6 7.2 58.8 112.8 112.8 Tax 21.5 48.5 70.0 23.5 50.2 73.7 Profit after tax 88.7 157.6 246.3 94.8 163.1 257.9 EPS basic 13.6p 37.9p 14.6p 39.6p EPS diluted 13.5p 37.6p 14.5p 39.4p For details of specific adjusting items refer to note 4 to the financial statements.
The impact on the statement of comprehensive income, for the year ended 31 March, is as follows: all figures in million 2012 restated 2012 reported Profit for the year 246.3 257.9 Other comprehensive income for the year, net of tax 79.1 90.7 Total comprehensive income for the year attributable to equity shareholders 167.2 167.2 There is no change to the net pension liability or to net assets as a result of the early adoption of IAS 19 revised.
As a result no restatement of the balance sheet is required.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings to 31 March 2013.
The purchase method of accounting has been adopted.
Those subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the period are included in the consolidated income statement from the date control is obtained to the date that control is lost usually on acquisition and disposal respectively.
A subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has the power to govern financial and operating policies in order to obtain benefits.
Potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when determining control.
An associate is an undertaking over which the Group exercises significant influence, usually from 20%-50% of the equity voting rights, in respect of financial and operating policy.
A joint venture is an undertaking over which the Group exercises joint control.
Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method from the date of acquisition to the date of disposal.
The Groups investments in associates and joint ventures are held at cost including goodwill on acquisition and any post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate less any impairment to the recoverable amount.
Where an associate or joint venture has net liabilities, full provision is made for the Groups share of liabilities where there is a constructive or legal obligation to provide additional funding to the associate or joint venture.
The financial statements of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are adjusted where necessary to ensure compliance with Group accounting policies.
On consolidation, all intra-Group income, expenses and balances are eliminated.
Revenue Revenue represents the value of work performed for customers, and is measured net of value added taxes and other sales taxes on the following bases: Service contracts The Groups service contract arrangements are accounted for under IAS 18 Revenue.
Revenue is recognised once the Group has obtained the right to consideration in exchange for its performance.
No profit is recognised on contracts until the outcome of the contract can be reliably estimated.
When the outcome of a contract can be reliably estimated, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
This is normally measured by the proportion of contract costs incurred for work performed to date compared with the estimated total contract costs after making suitable allowances for technical and other risks related to performance milestones yet to be achieved.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense.
The Group generally does not undertake construction contracts.
Goods sold Sales of goods are recognised in the income statement on delivery of the product or when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer and revenue and costs can be reliably measured.
Royalties and intellectual property Royalty revenue is recognised over the period to which the royalty relates.
Intellectual property revenue can be attributed either to perpetual licences or to limited licences.
Limited licences are granted for a specified period and revenue is recognised over the period of the licence.
Perpetual licences are granted for unlimited time frames and revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer.
QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 71 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Segmental information Segmental information is presented according to the Groups management structure and the markets in which it operates.
Segmental results represent the contribution of the different segments to the profit of the Group.
Corporate expenses are allocated to the corresponding segments.
Unallocated items mainly comprise specific adjusting items.
Specific adjusting items are referred to in note 4.
Eliminations represent inter-company trading between the different segments.
Segmental assets and liabilities information is not regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker.
Research and development expenditure Research and development costs incurred on behalf of a customer as part of a specific project are directly chargeable to the customer on whose behalf the work is undertaken.
These costs are recognised within operating costs and revenue is recognised in respect of the R&D services performed.
Internally funded development expenditure is capitalised in the balance sheet where there is a clearly defined project, the expenditures are separately identifiable, the project is technically and commercially feasible, all costs are recoverable by future revenue and the resources are committed to complete the project.
Such capitalised costs are amortised over the forecast period of sales resulting from the development.
All other research and development costs are expensed to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
If the research phase cannot be clearly distinguished from the development phase, the respective project-related costs are treated as if they were incurred in the research phase only and expensed.
Financing Financing represents the financial expense on borrowings accounted for using the effective rate method and the financial income earned on funds invested.
Exchange differences on financial assets and liabilities and the income or expense from interest hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement are included within finance income and finance expense.
Financing also includes the net finance expense in respect of defined benefit pension schemes.
Taxation The taxation charge is based on the taxable profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of temporary differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Current tax and deferred tax are charged or credited to the income statement, except where they relate to items charged or credited to equity, in which case the relevant tax is charged or credited to equity.
Deferred taxation is the tax attributable to the temporary differences that appear when taxation authorities recognise and measure assets and liabilities with rules that differ from those of the consolidated financial statements.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Any changes in the tax rates are recognised in the income statement unless related to items directly recognised in equity.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised on all taxable temporary differences excluding non-deductible goodwill.
Deferred tax assets are recognised on all deductible temporary differences provided that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only where there is a legally enforceable right to offset and there is an intention to settle balances on a net basis.
Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
The Group measures goodwill as the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred, including the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net of the acquisition-date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent liabilities as required by IFRS 3.
Consideration transferred includes the fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred by the Group to the previous owners of the acquiree, equity interests issued by the Group to the previous owners of the acquiree, equity interests issued by the Group, contingent consideration and share-based payment awards of the acquiree that are replaced in the business combination.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration that is not classified as equity are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
If a business combination relates to the termination of pre-existing relationships between the Group and the acquiree, then the lower of the termination amount, as contained in the agreement, and the value of the off-market element is deducted from the consideration transferred and recognised in other expenses.
Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination, such as finders fees, legal fees, due diligence fees, and other professional fees and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.
Non-controlling interests are measured either at the non-controlling interests proportion of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised or at fair value.
The method used is determined on an  basis.
Goodwill Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures and associates is included in the carrying value of equity accounted investments.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill related to the entity sold.
72 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Overview Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Addi onal informa on Intangible assets Intangible assets arising from business combinations are recognised at fair value and are amortised over their expected useful lives, typically between one and nine years.
Internally generated intangible assets are recorded at cost, including labour, directly attributable costs and any third-party expenses.
Purchased intangible assets are recognised at cost less amortisation.
Intangible assets are amortised over their respective useful lives on a straight-line basis as follows: Intellectual property rights 2-8 years Development costs 1-4 years Other 1-9 years Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other tangible non-current assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives to their estimated residual value as follows: Freehold buildings 20-25 years Leasehold land and buildings Shorter of useful economic life and the period of the lease Plant and machinery 3-10 years Fixtures and fittings 5-10 years Computers 3-5 years Motor vehicles 3-5 years Assets under construction are included in property, plant and equipment on the basis of expenditure incurred at the balance sheet date.
In the case of assets constructed by the Group, the value includes the cost of own work completed, including directly attributable costs and interest.
The useful lives, depreciation methods and residual values applied to property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually and, if appropriate, adjusted accordingly.
Impairment of tangible, goodwill, intangible and held for sale assets At each reporting date the Group assesses whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If the carrying amount of any asset exceeds its recoverable amount an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
In addition, goodwill is tested for impairment annually irrespective of any indication of impairment.
If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the respective asset or the assets in the cash generating unit CGU are written down to their recoverable amounts.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
The value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or CGU calculated using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.
Impairment losses are expensed to the income statement.
Investments in debt and equity securities Investments held by the Group are classified as either a current asset or as a non-current asset and those classified as available for sale are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss, other than impairment losses, being recognised directly in equity.
When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised directly in equity is recognised in the income statement.
The fair value of quoted financial instruments is their bid price at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of unquoted equity investments is based on the price of the most recent investment by the Group or a third party, if available, or derived from the present value of forecast future cash flows.
Inventories Inventory and work-in-progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Work-in-progress and manufactured finished goods are valued at production cost.
Production cost includes direct production costs and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
A provision is established when the net realisable value of any inventory item is lower than its cost.
Bid costs Costs incurred in bidding for work are normally expensed as incurred.
In the case of large multi-year government contracts the bidding process typically involves a competitive bid process to determine a preferred bidder and then a further period to reach financial close with the customer.
In these cases, the costs incurred after announcement of the Group achieving preferred bidder status are deferred to the balance sheet within work-in-progress.
From the point financial close is reached, the costs are amortised over the life of the contract.
If an opportunity for which the Group was awarded preferred bidder status fails to reach financial close, the costs deferred to that point will be expensed in the income statement immediately, when it becomes likely that financial close will not be achieved.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated net of provisions for doubtful debts.
Amounts recoverable on contracts are included in trade and other receivables and represent revenue recognised in excess of amounts invoiced.
Payments received on account are included in trade and other payables and represent amounts invoiced in excess of revenue recognised.
QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 73 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and short-term deposits that are readily convertible into cash.
In the cash flow statement overdraft balances are included in cash and equivalents.
Current and non-current liabilities Current liabilities include amounts due within the normal operating cycle of the Group.
Interest-bearing current and non-current liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and then stated at amortised cost with any difference between the cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis.
Costs associated with the arrangement of bank facilities or the issue of loans are held net of the associated liability presented in the balance sheet.
Capitalised issue costs are released over the estimated life of the facility or instrument to which they relate using the effective interest rate method.
If it becomes clear that the facility or instrument will be redeemed early, the amortisation of the issue costs will be accelerated.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event which can be reliably estimated, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Where appropriate, provisions are determined by discounting the expected cash flows at an appropriate discount rate reflecting the level of risk and the time value of money.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The fide-recognition of a financial instrument takes place when the Group no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, when the instrument expires, or when the instrument is sold, terminated or exercised.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and thereafter held at fair value, being the market value for quoted instruments or valuation based on models and discounted cash flow calculations for unlisted instruments.
Fair value hedging Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges of currency risk or interest rate risk are recognised in the income statement.
The hedged item is held at fair value with respect to the hedged risk with any gain or loss recognised in the income statement.
Cash flow hedging Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge that are regarded as highly effective are recognised in equity.
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where a hedged item results in an asset or a liability, gains and losses previously recognised in equity are included in the cost of the asset or liability.
Gains and losses previously recognised in equity are removed and recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction.
Leased assets Leases are classified as finance leases when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are held by the lessee.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and included in property, plant and equipment at the lower of the present value of minimum lease payments and fair value at the inception of the lease.
Assets are then depreciated over the shorter of their useful economic lives or the lease term.
Obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance charges arising in future periods, are included under financial liabilities.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at period-end rates.
Any resulting exchange differences are taken to the income statement.
Gains and losses on designated forward foreign exchange hedging contracts are matched against the foreign exchange movements on the underlying transaction.
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in its functional currency.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries, associated undertakings and joint ventures, including any related goodwill, are translated to sterling at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date.
The results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries, associated undertakings and joint ventures are translated to sterling using the average rates of exchange during the period.
Exchange adjustments arising from the re-translation of the opening net investment and the results for the period to the period-end rate are taken directly to equity and reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Post-retirement benefits The Group provides both defined contribution and defined benefit pension arrangements.
The liabilities of the Group arising from defined benefit obligations, and the related current service cost, are determined using the projected unit credit method.
Valuations for accounting purposes are carried out bi-annually.
Actuarial advice is provided by external consultants.
For the funded defined benefit plans, the excess or deficit of the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation are recognised as an asset or a liability respectively.
For defined benefit plans, the cost charged to the income statement consists of current service cost, net interest cost, and past service cost.
The finance element of the pension charge is shown in finance expense and the remaining service cost element is charged as a component of employee costs in the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses and re-measurement gains and losses are recognised immediately in full through the statement of comprehensive income.
Contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement as incurred.
74 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Overview Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Addi onal informa on Share-based payments The Group operates share-based payment arrangements with employees.
The fair value of equity-settled awards for share-based payments is determined on grant and expensed straight line over the period from grant to the date of earliest unconditional exercise.
The fair value of cash-settled awards for share-based payments is determined each period end until they are exercised or lapse.
The value is expensed straight line over the period from grant to the date of earliest unconditional exercise.
The charges for both equity and cash-settled share-based payments are updated annually for non-market-based vesting conditions.
Share capital Ordinary share capital of the Company is recorded as the proceeds received, less issue costs.
Company shares held by the employee benefit trusts are held at the consideration paid.
They are classified as own shares within equity.
Any gain or loss on the purchase, sale or issue of Company shares is recorded in equity.
Restatement of prior periods for finalisation of fair values arising on acquisitions The fair values of the net assets of acquired businesses are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
All fair value adjustments are recorded with effect from the date of acquisition and, consequently, may result in the restatement of previously reported financial results.
Recent accounting developments Significant developments adopted by the Group in 2013 IAS 19 revised Employee benefits.
The amendments became effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
QinetiQ has elected to early-adopt the revised standard during 2013.
The main impact on QinetiQ is the change in measurement of the expected return on scheme assets in the income statement: now measured with reference to the discount rate previously applied solely to scheme liabilities.
Under the previous requirements, expected return on assets was measured at an appropriately calculated rate which was normally higher than the discount rate.
As a result, there is likely to be an increase in the net pension finance expense in the profit and loss account, offset by changes in the actuarial gains losses recognised in other comprehensive income.
Other amendments include changes to the recognition and treatment of curtailment gains, presentation of scheme administration expenses and the removal of the corridor method.
The latter had not previously been applied by the Group.
Developments adopted by the Group in 2013 with no material impact on the financial statements The following EU-endorsed amendments, improvements and interpretations of published standards are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2012 and have been adopted with no material impact on the Groups financial statements: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments Disclosures.
The amendment introduces new requirements about transfers of financial assets including disclosure for financial assets that are not derecognised in their entirety: and financial assets that are derecognised in their entirety but for which the entity retains continuing involvement.
The amendment introduces an exception to the current measurement principles of deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from investment property measured using the fair value model in accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property.
IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of IFRS.
This change adds an exemption that an entity can apply at the date of transition to IFRSs after being subject to severe hyperinflation.
Developments expected in future periods of which the impact is being assessed FRS 100, 101 and 102.
FRS 100 sets out the application of financial reporting requirements in the UK and Republic of Ireland and FRS 101 or IFRS with reduced disclosures outlines the reduced disclosure framework available for use by qualifying entities choosing to report under IFRS.
FRS 102 is applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland and is known as the new UK GAAP.
The mandatory effective date for the new framework of reporting is for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015.
A qualifying entity is defined as a parent or subsidiary undertaking which is consolidated in publicly available consolidated financial statements.
QinetiQs subsidiaries meet the criteria: they currently report under UK GAAP and it is likely that the new FRS 102 will be the preferred option a full analysis is currently being undertaken.
Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
The Group awaits the final publication of the new IFRS standard Revenue from Contracts with Customers which is expected to be published by June 2013.
The new Standard will replace IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction Contracts.
It will become effective for accounting periods on or after 1 January 2017 and will therefore be applied for the first time to the Group accounts in 2018: the IASB have indicated that early adoption will not be permitted.
The Group has begun a systematic review of all existing major contracts to ensure that the impact and effect of the new Standard is fully understood and any changes to current accounting procedures are highlighted and acted upon well in advance of the effective date.
Following the issue of the first exposure draft in 2011, the IASB and FASB are reconsidering the proposed accounting standard for lease accounting.
A revised exposure draft is expected by June 2013.
The first exposure draft removes the distinction between finance leases and operating leases and requires all leased assets to be accounted for in a similar way to finance leases.
A right-of-use asset and matching liability will be recognised on the balance sheet, with lease expenditure and depreciation reported in the income statement.

Significant accounting policies continued Developments expected in future periods with no material impact on the Groups financial statements The Directors anticipate that the adoption of the following new, revised, amended and improved published standards and interpretations, which were in issue at the date of authorisation of these Financial Statements, will have no material impact on the Financial Statements of the Group when they become applicable in future periods: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of IFRS: IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Annual Improvements IFRS 2009-2011 cycle: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities: IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement: IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements: and IAS 28 Investments in Associates.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies The following commentary is intended to highlight those policies that are critical to the business based on the level of management judgement required in their application, their complexity and their potential impact on the results and financial position reported for the Group.
The level of management judgement required includes assumptions and estimates about future events that are uncertain and the actual outcome of which may result in a materially different outcome from that anticipated.
Revenue and profit recognition The estimation process required to evaluate the potential outcome of contracts and projects requires skill, knowledge and experience from a variety of sources within the business to assess the status of the contract, costs to complete, internal and external labour resources required and other factors.
This process is carried out continuously throughout the business to ensure that project and contract assessments reflect the latest status of such work.
No profit is recognised on a contract until the outcome can be reliably estimated.
Business combinations Intangible assets recognised on business combinations have been valued using established methods and models to determine estimated value and useful economic life, with input, where appropriate, from external valuation consultants.
Such methods require the use of estimates which may produce results that are different from actual future outcomes.
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment.
This process relies on the use of estimates of the future profitability and cash flows of its CGUs which may differ from the actual results delivered.
In addition, the Group reviews whether identified intangible assets have suffered any impairment.
Further details on the sensitivity of the carrying value of goodwill to changes in the key assumptions are set out in note 12.
Consolidation of US subsidiaries As described on page 49, the Group and the US Department of Defense DoD have entered into a proxy agreement that regulates the ownership, management and operation of the Groups 100% owned subsidiary, QinetiQ North America, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
Having considered the terms of the proxy agreement, the Directors consider that the Group has control over the operating and financial policies of QinetiQ North America and, therefore, consolidates the subsidiaries in the consolidated accounts.
Post-retirement benefits The Groups defined benefit pension obligations and net income statement costs are based on key assumptions, including discount rates, mortality, inflation and future salary and pension increases.
Management exercises its best judgement, in consultation with actuarial advisors, in selecting the values for these assumptions that are the most appropriate to the Group.
Small changes in these assumptions at the balance sheet date, individually or collectively, may result in significant changes in the size of the deficit or the net income statement costs.
Any change in these assumptions would have an impact on the retirement benefit obligation recognised.
Further details of these assumptions are set out in note 29.
Research and development expenditure Internally-funded development expenditure is capitalised when criteria are met and is written off over the forecast period of sales resulting from the development.
Management decides on the adequacy of future demand and the potential market for such new products in order to justify capitalisation of internally-funded development expenditure.
These can be difficult to determine when dealing with innovative technologies.
Actual product sales may differ from these estimates.
Tax In determining the Groups provisions for income tax and deferred tax, it is necessary to assess the likelihood and timing of recovery of tax losses created, and to consider transactions in a small number of key tax jurisdictions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
To the extent that the final outcome differs from the tax that has been provided, adjustments will be made to income tax and deferred tax provisions held in the period the determination is made.

The effective tax rate is expected to remain below the UK statutory rate in the medium term, subject to any tax legislation changes and the geographic mix of profits.
The 2013 Finance Bill allows the continued recognition of R&D tax credits in the tax line until April 2016, when mandatory Above The Line treatment is introduced, which could increase the Groups effective tax rate over time to a blend of the US and UK corporation tax rates.
The 2013 Budget delivered on 20 March 2013 announced that the UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 21% on 1 April 2014 and to 20% on 1 April 2015.
A reduction in the rate from 24% to 23% effective from 1 April 2013 was substantively enacted on 3 July 2012.
These changes will reduce the Groups future tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax asset at 31 March 2013 has been calculated based on the rate of 23% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced rate reductions in 2014 and 2015, although these will further reduce the Groups future tax charge and reduce the Groups deferred tax asset accordingly.
At 31 March 2013, the Group had unused tax losses of 202.7m 2012: 200.0m potentially available for offset against future profits.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The weighted average number of shares used excludes those shares bought by the Group and held as own shares see note 27.
For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares arising from unvested share-based awards including share options.
Underlying basic earnings per share figures are presented below, in addition to the basic and diluted earnings per share, because the Directors consider this gives a more relevant indication of underlying business performance and reflects the adjustments to basic earnings per share for the impact of specific adjusting items, amortisation of acquired intangible assets and tax thereon.

Goodwill continued Goodwill at 31 March 2013 was allocated across various CGUs in the following segments: UK Services two, Global Products two and US Services one.
Goodwill is attributable to the excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired and includes expected synergies, future growth prospects and employee knowledge, expertise and security clearances.
The Group tests goodwill impairment for each CGU annually, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Impairment testing is dependent on managements estimates and judgements, particularly as they relate to the forecasting of future cash flows, the discount rates selected and expected long-term growth rates.
Significant headroom exists in all CGUs with the exception of US Services, discussed below, and management considers that there are no likely variations in the key assumptions which would lead to an impairment being recognised in any of the other CGUs.
Key assumptions Cash flows The value-in-use calculations use discounted future cash flows based on financial plans approved by the Board covering a two-year period.
Cash flows for periods beyond this period are extrapolated based on the second year of the two-year plan, with a terminal growth-rate assumption applied.
Cash flows of the US Services division in 2013 were affected adversely by the continued budget uncertainty and reduced Federal spending which resulted in 12% organic reduction in revenue compared to the prior year.
Customers continue to defer decisions leading to delay of new and incremental orders, the fide-scoping of some existing work and the cancellation of some contract re-competes with shorter-term extensions being awarded in their place.
The cash flow assumptions for the US Services CGU reflect the challenges described above.
Terminal growth rates The specific plans for each of the CGUs have been extrapolated using a terminal growth rate of 2.0%-3.0% 2012: 2.0%-3.0%.
Growth rates are based on managements estimates which take into consideration the long-term nature of the industry in which the CGUs operate and external forecasts as to the likely growth of the industry in the longer term.
Discount rates The Groups weighted average cost of capital was used as a basis in determining the discount rate to be applied adjusted for risks specific to the market characteristics of CGUs as appropriate on a pre-tax basis.
This is considered to appropriately estimate a market participant discount rate.
The pre-tax discount rates applied for the two UK Services CGUs were 10.6% and 10.7%, for the US Services CGU 9.7%, and for the Global Products CGUs 9.7% and 10.4%.
Sensitivity analysis shows that both the discount rate and growth rate assumptions are key variables that have an impact on the outcome of the recoverable amount.
Significant CGUs The value in use of the US Services CGU, calculated using the key assumptions discussed above, was lower than the carrying value of the CGUs net operating assets which resulted in an impairment of 255.8m.
Sensitivity analysis shows that a decrease or increase of 1% in the discount rate assumption would result in an impairment of 180.2m or 301.2m respectively.
Sensitivity analysis also shows that a decrease or increase of 1% in the terminal growth rate would result in an impairment of 300.0m or 182.1m.
The carrying value of goodwill for this CGU as at 31 March 2013, after impairment, was 142.8m and its net operating assets excluding goodwill were 88.0m.
A reduction of 5% in the value of the terminal year cash flows would result in an additional 12.4m reduction in the carrying value of goodwill.
The Technology Solutions CGU in the US has significant headroom.
An increase in the discount rate or a decrease in the terminal growth rate of 1% would not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount.
The carrying value of goodwill for this CGU as at 31 March was 111.7m.
The Technology Solutions CGU in the UK and the individual CGUs within UK Services all have significant headroom.
An increase in the discount rate or a decrease in the terminal growth rate by 1% would not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount.
The carrying value of goodwill for the Technology Solutions CGU in the UK as at 31 March was 5.7m.
The carrying value of goodwill for the two UK Services CGUs as at 31 March was 27.5m and 2.7m.

Credit risk is limited as a result of the high percentage of revenue derived from UK and US defence and other government agencies.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that no credit provision in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts is required.
As at 31 March 2013 the Group carried a provision for doubtful debts of 1.9m 2012: 4.0m.
Other receivables decreased significantly from 2012 due to the receipt of 65m from MOD in respect of the recovery of prior year restructuring costs.

These assets no longer meet the criteria for disclosure under IFRS 5: the prospective buyer has withdrawn and hence the sale of these assets is no longer expected to complete within the forthcoming twelve months.

Redundancy provisions are expected to be utilised within 12 months and provisions in respect of vacant property will be utilised in line with the remaining lease period.
Lease periods extend out to 2019.
Property provisions, other than those relating to restructuring discussed above, relate to under-utilised properties in the UK.
The extent of the provision is affected by the timing of when properties can be sub-let and the proportion of space that can be sub-let.
Based on current assessment the provision will be utilised within 13 years.
Other provisions relate to environmental and other liabilities, the magnitude and timing of utilisation of which are determined by a variety of factors.

Financial risk management The Groups international operations and debt financing expose it to financial risks that include the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risks and liquidity risks.
Treasury and risk management policies, which are set by the Board, specify guidelines on financial risks and the use of financial instruments to manage risk.
The instruments and techniques used to manage exposures include foreign currency derivatives and interest rate derivatives.
Group treasury monitors financial risks and compliance with risk management policies.
A Fair values of financial instruments The fair value hierarchy is as follows: Level 1 measured using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 measured using inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data i. e. unobservable inputs.
The following table presents the Groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 31 March 2013: all figures in million Note Level 1 Total Level 2 Level 3 Assets Current other investments 18 1.4 1.4 Current derivative financial instruments 23 0.1 0.1 Non-current other investments 0.1 0.1 Liabilities Current derivative financial instruments 23 0.2 0.2 Non-current derivative financial instruments 23 0.1 0.1 Total 1.4 0.2 0.1 1.3 For cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and bank and current borrowings, the fair value of the financial instruments approximate to their carrying value as a result of the short maturity periods of these financial instruments.
For trade and other receivables, allowances are made within the carrying value for credit risk.
For other financial instruments, the fair value is based on market value, where available.
Where market values are not available, the fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows to net present value using prevailing market-based interest rates translated at the year-end rates, except for unlisted fixed asset investments where fair value equals carrying value.

Financial risk management continued B Interest rate risk The Group operates an interest rate policy designed to optimise interest costs and to reduce volatility in reported earnings.
The Groups current policy is to require rates to be fixed for 30-80% of the level of borrowings, which is achieved primarily through fixed-rate borrowings, and through the use of interest rate swaps.
Where there are significant changes in the level and or structure of debt, policy permits borrowings to be 100% fixed, with regular Board reviews of the appropriateness of this fixed percentage.
At 31 March 2013 100% 2012: 100% of the Groups borrowings were at fixed rates with no adjustment for interest rate swaps.

96 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Overview Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Addi onal informa on C Currency risk Transactional currency exposure The Group is exposed to foreign currency risks arising from sales or purchases by businesses in currencies other than their functional currency.
It is Group policy that when such a sale or purchase is certain, the net foreign exchange exposure is hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Hedge accounting documentation and effectiveness testing are undertaken for all the Groups transactional hedge contracts.
The table below shows the Groups currency exposures, being exposures on currency transactions that give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating company involved.
Functional currency of the operating company Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities all figures in millions Total US$ Euro AUS$ Other 31 March 2013 sterling 0.9 2.5 1.5 1.9 1.8 31 March 2012 sterling 13.4 1.7 6.6 2.2 23.9 The amounts shown in the table take into account the effect of the forward contracts entered into to manage these currency exposures.
The Group enters into forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the currency exposures that arise on sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies, as the transaction occurs.
The principal contract amounts of the outstanding forward currency contracts as at 31 March 2013 against sterling are net US dollars bought 2.5m US$4.0m and net euros sold 10.8m 12.8m.
Translational currency exposure The Group has significant investments in overseas operations, particularly in the United States.
As a result, the sterling value of the Groups balance sheet can be significantly affected by movement in exchange rates.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of these translational exposures by matching the net investment in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in their functional currencies unless the cost of such hedging activity is uneconomic.
This is achieved by borrowing in the local currency or, in some cases, indirectly through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
D Financial credit risk The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not currently expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
Credit risk is mitigated by a Board-approved policy of only selecting counterparties with a strong investment grade long-term credit rating for cash deposits.
In the normal course of business, the Group operates notional cash pooling systems, where a legal right of set-off applies.
The maximum credit-risk exposure in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations under financial assets, excluding trade and other receivables, totals 248.8m 2012: 133.0m.
The Group held cash and cash equivalents of 240.4m at 31 March 2013 2012: 117.8m, which represents the maximum credit exposure on these assets.
The cash and cash equivalents were held with different financial institutions which were rated single A or better, although 207.8m was invested in AAA-rated money funds at the year end.

Financial risk management continued H Sensitivity analysis The Groups sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates on financial assets and liabilities as at 31 March 2013 is set out in the table below.
The impact of a weakening in sterling on the Groups financial assets and liabilities would be more than offset in equity and income by its impact on the Groups overseas net assets and earnings respectively.
Sensitivity on Group assets other than financial assets and liabilities is not included in this analysis.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming that certain market conditions occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected as a result of developments in the global financial markets that may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the table below, which should not, therefore, be considered to be a projection of likely future events and losses.
The estimated changes for interest rate movements are based on an instantaneous decrease or increase of 1% 100 basis points in the specific rate of interest applicable to each class of financial instruments from the levels effective at 31 March 2013, with all other variables remaining constant.
The estimated changes for foreign exchange rates are based on an instantaneous 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all other currencies from the levels applicable at 31 March 2013, with all other variables remaining constant.
Such analysis is for illustrative purposes only in practice market rates rarely change in isolation.
The figures shown below relate primarily to the translational impact on the Groups US$ debt.
This debt is held in the US so there is no transactional impact.
The impact of transactional risk on the Groups monetary assets liabilities that are not held in the functional currency of the entity holding those assets liabilities is minimal.
A 10% weakening in sterling would result in a 0.1m increase in profit before tax.
