A potential and corresponding deferred tax asset existed but was un-provided at the prior year end and will now not arise.
Therefore, there is a credit of 5.1m to the groups tax charge for the period, with no corresponding deferred tax debit, reducing the groups tax charge by 7.9%.
In addition, a prior year credit of 2.4m arose following the agreement of loss availability and settlement of other tax positions during the year.
The group works in an open and transparent manner and maintains a regular dialogue with HM Revenue & Customs.
This approach is consistent with the low risk rating we have been awarded by HM Revenue & Customs and to which the group is committed.
