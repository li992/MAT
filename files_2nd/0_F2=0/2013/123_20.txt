Each ordinary share of 12.5 pence each was subdivided into three ordinary shares of 4 1 6 pence each.
The subdivision trebled the number of ordinary shares in issue and the board believes that the subdivision may improve liquidity and marketability of the shares.
During the year to 26 January 2013 the Companys employee benefit trusts purchased 600,491 2012: 741,708 shares.
The total amount paid to acquire the shares has been deducted from shareholders equity and is included within retained earnings.

The number of shares purchased and held by employee benefit trusts in the year to 28 January 2012 have been restated to reflect the share subdivision noted above.
106 A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2013 28 Share-based payments As disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report the Group runs a number of share award plans and share option plans: r Savings Related Share Option Scheme which is open to all employees r LTIP options which are granted to executive directors r AESOP awards that are available to all employees Savings Related Share Option Scheme SAYE All SAYEs outstanding at 26 January 2013 and 28 January 2012 have no performance criteria attached other than the requirement for the employee to remain in the employment of the Company and to continue contributing to the plan.
Options granted under the SAYE must be exercised within six months of the relevant award vesting date.
The SAYE is open to all qualifying employees in employment at the date of inception of the scheme.
Options are normally exercisable after five years from the date of grant.
The price at which options are offered is not less than 80% of the average of the middle-market price of the five dealing days immediately preceding the date of invitation.
The movements in the number of share options outstanding and their related weighted average exercise prices are as follows: 2013 2012 Average Average exercise exercise price in price in pence per pence per Options share Options share At start of the year 1,628,145 213p 1,872,114 214p Granted in the year 845,678 358p p Forfeited 46,517 262p 162,129 242p Exercised 727,935 163p 81,840 177p At end of the year 1,699,371 305p 1,628,145 213p At 26 January 2013 there were 10,908 options 2012: nil that were exercisable at an exercise price of 1.63.

The weighted average share price on the dates that options were exercised in the year to 26 January 2013 was 4.70.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of the outstanding share options at the year end is 3 years 2012: 3 years.
The number of options granted, forfeited and exercised, and the exercise prices for the year ended 28 January 2012 have been restated to reflect the share subdivision.
The restatement reflects the position as if the share subdivision had taken place on 30 January 2011.
LTIP During the year, an award of shares was made to the executive directors as disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The weighted average fair value of the share awards made during the period was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
The significant inputs to the model were as follows: Date of grant 4 April 2012 Number of share awards granted 257,334 Share price at date of grant 393p Contractual life in years 3.00 Dividend yield 2.97% Expected outcome of meeting performance criteria at grant date 75% Fair value determined at grant date 359p 85,778 share awards were granted under the LTIP on 4 April 2012 when the share price was 11.78.
These have been restated in the table above to reflect the share split which took place in the year note 27.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2013 107 Notes to the Accounts Continued 28 Share-based payments continued AESOP As described in the Directors Remuneration Report, there are two elements to the AESOP.
The partnership share element provides that for every three shares that a participant purchases in A. G. BARR p. l. c. up to a maximum contribution of 125 per month, the Company will purchase one matching share.
The matching shares purchased are held in trust in the name of the individual.
There are various rules as to the period of time that the shares must be held in trust but after five years, the shares can be released tax free to the participant.
The second element of free shares allows participants to receive shares to the value of a common percentage of their earnings, related to the performance of the Group.
The maximum value of the annual award is 3,000, and the shares awarded are held in trust for five years.
29 Subsequent events On 13 February 2013 the Office of Fair Trading OFT announced its decision to refer the proposed merger of A. G. BARR p. l. c. and Britvic plc to the Competition Commission.
As a result of the OFTs decision the merger has now lapsed and Britvic plc has confirmed that the Scheme will not proceed.
Under Rule 12.2 of the Takeover Code, the Offer Period in relation to Britvic plc has now ended and a competition reference period has now commenced.
The boards of A. G. BARR p. l. c. and Britvic plc intend to work together with the Competition Commission during its investigation with a view to seeking clearance of the proposed merger.
The Competition Commissions investigation is expected to take approximately six months.
If clearance is received from the Competition Commission on terms satisfactory to both A. G. BARR p. l. c. and Britvic plc, the boards of A. G. BARR p. l. c. and Britvic plc will each reconsider, at that time, the terms of a possible merger between A. G. BARR p. l. c. and Britvic plc.
There can be no certainty or assurance that, following such clearance, any such merger would be forthcoming or that any offer will be made by either A. G. BARR p. l. c. or Britvic plc.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. and Britvic plc consider there to be compelling rationale for clearance.
The view of the two boards on the benefits of the transaction is unchanged and they continue to believe that it is in the interests of the two shareholder groups.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. and Britvic plc will continue to work closely with the authorities to expedite clearance.

The Groups net debt position has increased from 6,711,000 at 28 January 2012 to 25,603,000 at 26 January 2013, however there is borrowing headroom of 14,397,000 at the year end.
There is no impact on profit before tax for any of the years presented.
The earnings per share for the years 2009 to 2012 have been restated to reflect the effect of the share subdivision approved at the annual general meeting on 21 May 2012.
Each ordinary share of 12.5 pence each was subdivided into three ordinary shares of 4 1 6 pence see note 27.

By order of the Board Registered Ofce A. G. BARR p. l. c. Westfield House 4 Mollins Road Julie A. Barr Cumbernauld Company Secretary G68 9HD 19 April 2013 Registered in Scotland SC005653 Shareholders should also read the notes to this Notice of Annual General Meeting which are set out on pages 113 to 116 of this document.
Those notes provide further information about shareholders entitlement to attend, speak and vote at the Annual General Meeting or appoint another person to do so on their behalf.
112 A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Explanatory Notes The following notes provide an explanation of the resolutions to be considered at the one hundred and ninth annual general meeting the AGM of A. G. BARR p. l. c. the Company.
Resolutions 1 to 12 inclusive will be proposed as ordinary resolutions.
This means that for each of those resolutions to be passed, more than half of the votes cast must be in favour of the resolution.
Resolutions 13 and 14 will be proposed as special resolutions.
This means that for each of those resolutions to be passed, at least threequarters of the votes cast must be in favour of the resolution.
Resolution 1 Receive and approve the reports and accounts Shareholders are being asked to receive and approve the audited accounts of the group and the Company as audited by KPMG Audit plc KPMG for the year ended 26 January 2013 together with the associated reports of the directors and auditors.
Resolution 2 Directors remuneration report Shareholders are being asked to approve the directors remuneration report for the year ended 26 January 2013 which is set out on pages 51 to58 of this document.
Resolutions 3 to 10 inclusive Re-election and election of directors The Companys articles of association require that all newly appointed directors retire at the first annual general meeting following their appointment.
Consequently, Mr John Nicolson will retire and offer himself for election.
The board of directors of the Company the Board complies with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code whereby all directors are subject to annual re-election.
Accordingly, all other directors of the Company are retiring and offering themselves for re-election.
Biographical details of the directors are set out on pages 40 and 41 of this document.
The Board has confirmed that, following formal performance evaluation, all of the directors continue to perform effectively and demonstrate commitment to their roles.
The Board therefore unanimously recommends the proposed re-election or election in the case of Mr John Nicolson of the directors.
Resolution 11 Re-appointment of auditors The Company is required to appoint auditors at each general meeting at which accounts are presented to shareholders and KPMG have indicated their willingness to continue in office.
Accordingly, shareholders are being asked to re-appoint KPMG as auditors of the Company to hold office until the conclusion of the next general meeting at which accounts are laid before the Company and to authorise the audit committee of the Board to fix their remuneration.
Resolution 12 Authority to allot shares The directors may not allot shares in the Company unless authorised to do so by shareholders in general meeting.
Sub-paragraph a of Resolution 12, if passed, will authorise the directors to allot shares having an aggregate nominal value of up to 1,621,788.50, representing approximately one third of the Companys issued share capital as at 18 April 2013 being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document.
The directors have no present intention to exercise this authority.
In line with guidance issued by the Association of British Insurers, sub-paragraph b of Resolution 12, if passed, will authorise the directors to allot additional shares in connection with a rights issue having an aggregate nominal value of up to 1,621,788.50, representing approximately one third of the Companys issued share capital as at 18 April 2013 being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document.
The directors have no present intention to exercise the authority sought under sub-paragraph b of this resolution, however, if such authority is obtained, it will give the Company greater flexibility to allot additional shares for the purpose of a pre-emptive rights issue.
This authority will be used when the directors consider it to be in the best interests of shareholders.
The authorities sought under Resolution 12 will expire on the earlier of 31 July 2014 being the latest date by which the Company must hold its annual general meeting in 2014 and the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the Company held in 2014.
Resolution 13 Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights If the directors wish to allot new shares for cash, the Companies Act 2006 the 2006 Act states that the shares must be offered first to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings.
For legal, regulatory and practical reasons, however, it might not be possible or desirable for shares allotted by means of a pre-emptive offer to be offered to certain shareholders, particularly those resident overseas.
Furthermore, it might in some circumstances be in the Companys interests for the directors to be able to allot some shares for cash without having to offer them first to existing shareholders.
To enable this to be done, shareholders statutory pre-emption rights must be disapplied.
Accordingly, Resolution 13, if passed, will empower the directors to allot a limited number of new equity securities without shareholders statutory pre-emption rights applying to such allotment.
The authority conferred by Resolution 13 would also cover the sale of treasury shares for cash.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2013 113 Explanatory Notes Continued Sub-paragraph a of Resolution 13 would confer authority on the directors to make any arrangements which may be necessary to deal with any legal, regulatory or practical problems arising on a rights issue, an open offer or any other pre-emptive offer in favour of ordinary shareholders, for example, by excluding certain overseas shareholders from such issue or offer.
Sub-paragraph b of Resolution 13 would disapply shareholders statutory pre-emption rights by empowering the directors to allot equity securities for cash on a non pre-emptive basis but only new equity securities having a maximum aggregate nominal value of 243,268, representing approximately 5% of the Companys issued share capital as at 18 April 2013 being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document.
The authority sought under Resolution 13 will expire on the earlier of 31 July 2014 being the latest date by which the Company must hold an annual general meeting in 2014 and the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the Company held in 2014.
Resolution 14 Purchase of own shares The 2006 Act permits a company to purchase its own shares provided the purchase has been authorised by shareholders in general meeting.
Resolution 14, if passed, would give the Company the authority to purchase any of its own issued ordinary shares at a price of not less than an amount equal to the nominal value of an ordinary share and not more than the higher of: i 5% above the average of the middle market quotations of the Companys ordinary shares as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the five dealing days before any purchase is made: and ii the higher of the last independent trade and the highest current independent trade on the London Stock Exchange plc.
The authority will enable the purchase of up to a maximum of 11,676,877 Ordinary Shares, representing 10% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital as at the date of the AGM, and will expire on the earlier of 31 July 2014 being the latest date by which the Company must hold an annual general meeting in 2014 and the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the Company held in 2014.
The directors will only exercise this buy back authority after careful consideration, taking into account market conditions prevailing at the time, other investment opportunities, appropriate gearing levels and the overall position of the Company.
Purchases would be financed out of distributable profits and shares purchased would either be cancelled and the number of shares in issue reduced accordingly or held as treasury shares.
The Company operates two share option schemes under which awards may be satisfied by the allotment or transfer of ordinary shares to a scheme participant.
However, in practice, the Company has always satisfied awards to participants by the transfer of ordinary shares from the trustee of each of the schemes.
As at 1 April 2013 being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document, options had been granted over 2,428,311 Ordinary Shares the Option Shares representing approximately 2.08% of the Companys issued share capital at that date.
If the authority to purchase the Companys ordinary shares as described in Resolution 14 were exercised in full, the Option Shares would represent approximately 2.31% of the Companys issued share capital as at 1 April 2013.
As at 1 April 2013, the Company did not hold any treasury shares.
