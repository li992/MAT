The valuation model used to calculate the fair value of the awards granted under this plan was a stochastic valuation model, the inputs of which are detailed below: 2013 2012 2011 2010 grants grants grants grants Weighted average share price 466.1p 275.8p 261.0p 236.5p Weighted average exercise price 0p 0p 0p 0p Expected volatility 26.4% 33.0% 49.0% 48.5% Expected life 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years Risk-free rate 0.3% 0.5% 1.6% 1.8% Expected dividend yield 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% Average fair value of award per share 348.6p 220.0p 231.9p 195.7p c sharesave scheme The Sharesave Scheme is an all-employee HMRC-approved share scheme.
The scheme involves employees saving a set amount from their salary for a period of three years.
At the end of the three-year period the employee is offered the opportunity to purchase shares based on the amount saved at an option price set at the start of the period.
The option price for the 2012 and 2013 grants was set at a 20% discount of the average share price over five days trading prior to the offer date of the scheme: the grants in previous years used a 10% discount.
