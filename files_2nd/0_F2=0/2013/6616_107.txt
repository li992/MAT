On disposal of investments, fair value movements are reclassified from equity to the income statement based on average cost for shares acquired at different times.
The impairment losses recorded above have been recognised in the income statement for the year within other operating income, together with amounts reclassified from the fair value reserve on recognition of the impairments.
These impairments initially result from prolonged or significant declines in the fair value of the equity investments below acquisition cost, subsequent to which any further declines in fair value are immediately taken to the income statement.
Other investments include assets that have been impaired.
