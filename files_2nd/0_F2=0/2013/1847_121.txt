Goodwill continued The conclusion of this impairment review was that the Groups goodwill and intangible assets related to the housebuilding segment was not impaired.
The impairment review of goodwill and intangible assets at 30 June 2013 was based upon current expectations regarding sales volumes, expected changes in selling prices and site costs to complete in the uncertain conditions within the UK housing market and used a discount rate considered appropriate to the position and risks of the Group.
The result of the impairment review was that the recoverable value of goodwill and intangible assets exceeded its carrying value by 1,140.6m 2012: 379.1m.
If the UK housing market and expectations regarding its future were to deteriorate with either operating margins reducing by 3.8% per annum 2012: 1.0% per annum or the appropriate discount rate were to increase by 2.6% 2012: 1.0% and all other variables were held constant, then the recoverable value of goodwill and intangible assets would equal its carrying value.
