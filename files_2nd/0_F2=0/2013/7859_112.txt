The 2012 Basic, Diluted and Adjusted earnings per share figures have been restated due to the Employee Benefit Trust shares being incorrectly included in the weighted average number of shares in issue.
The approach to calculating the taxation charge which is included in the adjusted earnings per share calculation has changed and has necessitated a restatement of the 2012 figures.
The tax effect of the income statement items which are stripped out of statutory operating profit to derive adjusted operating profit see note 2 has been assessed, and the statutory tax charge as disclosed in the consolidated income statement has been adjusted accordingly to provide a more relevant adjusted earnings per share calculation.
