At 31 December 2013, unremitted earnings of overseas Group companies amounted to 83.3m 2012: 82.0m.
Unremitted earnings may be liable to some overseas tax, but should not be liable to UK tax if they were to be distributed as dividends.
Certain of the Groups overseas operations have current and prior year tax losses, the future utilisation of which is uncertain.
Accordingly, the Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 7.4m 2012: 8.1m in respect of tax losses of overseas companies.
These tax losses are available to offset future taxable profits in the respective jurisdictions.
All of the deferred tax asset for losses of 3.3m is dependent on generating future taxable profits.
Of the recognised deferred tax asset, 0.2m is recognised within territories that were loss making in the current year.
