The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain items, principally land and buildings, derivative financial instruments, retirement benefits and share-based payments.
New standards and interpretations The International Accounting Standards Board IASB and IFRIC have issued the following new or revised standards and interpretations with an effective date for financial periods beginning on or after the dates disclosed below and therefore after the date of these financial statements: IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards Amendments for government loan with a below-market rate of interest when transitioning to IFRS 1 January 2013 IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Amendments relating to the offsetting of assets and liabilities 1 January 2013 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement New accounting standard 1 January 2015 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements New accounting standard 1 January 2013 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements New accounting standard 1 January 2013 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities New accounting standard 1 January 2013 IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement New accounting standard 1 January 2013 IAS 19 Employee Benefits Amended standard resulting from the Post-Employment Benefits and Termination Benefits projects 1 January 2013 IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements Reissued as IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements as amended in 2011 1 January 2013 IAS 28 Investments in Associates Reissued as IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures as amended in 2011 1 January 2013 IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation Amendments relating to the offsetting of assets and liabilities 1 January 2014 IAS 36 Impairment of Assets Amendments arising from Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets 1 January 2014 IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement Amendments for novations of derivatives 1 January 2014 IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine 1 January 2013 IFRIC 21 Levies 1 January 2014 The IASB have also issued a number of minor amendments to standards as part of their Annual Improvements to IFRS.
Adopting the amendments to IAS 19 will require the Group to recognise a single net interest component in respect of its defined benefit pension scheme, calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability asset.
If the Group had adopted the revised standard in the current period there would have been net expense of 2.2 million in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme rather than net income of 0.1 million.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of any of the other above new standards or amendments will have a material impact on the Groups reported income or net assets in the period of adoption.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the audited financial statements of Marstons PLC and all of its subsidiary undertakings.
The results of new subsidiary undertakings are included in the Group accounts from the date on which control transferred to the Group or, in the case of disposals, up to the effective date of disposal.
Transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
