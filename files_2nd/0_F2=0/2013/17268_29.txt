Share capital The Company has one class of shares, ordinary shares, which are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of tax.
Where the Company or one of the Companys trusts purchases the Companys equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of tax, is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
Where such shares are subsequently disposed or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
Share-based payments Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Companys executive share option, long-term incentive and share purchase and ordinary share plan schemes.
The Company recognises a compensation cost in respect of these schemes that is based on the fair value of the awards, measured using Black-Scholes, Binomial and Monte Carlo valuation methodologies.
For equity-settled schemes, the fair value is determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently re-measured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modified.
For cash-settled schemes, the fair value is determined at the date of grant and is re-measured at each balance sheet date until the liability is settled.
Generally, the compensation cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to the failure to satisfy service conditions or achieve non-market performance conditions.
Dividends payable Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in the Companys financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the shareholders of the Company generally in the case of the final dividend or paid in the case of interim dividends.
