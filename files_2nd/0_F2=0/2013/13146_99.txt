Impairment review Impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets is performed at least annually based on cash generating units CGUs.
A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other groups of assets.
Goodwill impairment testing is performed on the basis of 25 CGUs 2012: 22 CGUs.
CGUs which are not individually significant have been aggregated for presentation purposes.
Typically, acquisitions are fully integrated into existing business units, and the goodwill arising is allocated to the CGUs, or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition.
The carrying value of goodwill recorded in the major groups of CGUs is set out below: GOODWILL 2013 2012 m m Scientific, Technical & Medical 1,051 1,026 Risk Solutions 1,604 1,559 Business Information 374 408 Legal 1,121 1,150 Exhibitions 426 402 Total 4,576 4,545 Reed Elseviers goodwill impairment testing methodology, assumptions and sensitivity analysis are disclosed within critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty on pages 105 and 106.
