Sale of EU Sugars As previously announced, American Sugar Holdings ASR has raised a number of claims totalling in the region of 40 million that it believes it has under the Share and Business Sale Agreement relating to its acquisition of the Groups EU Sugars business.
These claims in large part relate to the turbulence in the supply of raw sugar to the EU during the period prior to closing and the increase in certain rolling re-export commitments of the business.
Some, but not all, of these issues were considered in the expert adjudication on the closing accounts in which, as noted in the Annual Report 2012, the expert strongly supported Tate & Lyles position.
ASR through its subsidiary T&L Sugars Limited has now commenced formal proceedings in respect of these claims which the Group intends to vigorously defend.
Whitefox Technologies The commercial dispute with Whitefox Technologies, which was the subject of proceedings in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in June 2012 has been settled, bringing this matter to a conclusion.
Other claims The Group is subject to claims and litigation generally arising in the ordinary course of its business, some of which are for substantial amounts.
All such actions are strenuously defended but provision is made for liabilities that are considered likely to arise on the basis of current information and legal advice and after taking into account the Groups insurance arrangements.
While there is always uncertainty as to the outcome of any claim or litigation, it is not expected that claims and litigation existing at the statement of financial position date will have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial position.
