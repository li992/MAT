6 Segment information AstraZeneca is engaged in a single business activity of biopharmaceuticals and the Group does not have multiple operating segments.
Our biopharmaceuticals business consists of the discovery and development of new products, which are then manufactured, marketed and sold.
All of these functional activities take place and are managed globally on a highly integrated basis.
We do not manage these individual functional areas separately.
The SET, established and chaired by the CEO, is the vehicle through which he exercises the authority delegated to him from the Board for the management, development and performance of our business.
We consider that the SET is AstraZenecas chief operating decision making body as defined by IFRS 8.
The operation of the SET is principally driven by the management of the commercial operations, R&D, and manufacturing and supply.
In addition to the CEO, CFO, the General Counsel and the Chief Compliance Officer, the SET comprises nine Executive Vice-Presidents representing IMED, MedImmune, Global Medicines Development, North America, Europe, International, GPPS, Operations & Information Services, and Human Resources & Corporate Affairs.
All significant operating decisions are taken by the SET.
While members of the SET have responsibility for implementation of decisions in their respective areas, operating decision making is at SET level as a whole.
Where necessary, these are implemented through cross-functional sub-committees that consider the Group-wide impact of a new decision.
For example, product launch decisions would be initially considered by the SET and, on approval, passed to an appropriate sub-team for implementation.
The impacts of being able to develop, produce, deliver and commercialise a wide range of pharmaceutical products drive the SET decision making process.
In assessing performance, the SET reviews financial information on an integrated basis for the Group as a whole, substantially in the form of, and on the same basis as, the Groups IFRS Financial Statements.
The high upfront cost of discovering and developing new products coupled with the relatively insignificant and stable unit cost of production means that there is not the clear link that exists in many manufacturing businesses between the revenue generated on an individual product sale and the associated cost and hence margin generated on a product.
Consequently, the profitability of individual drugs or classes of drugs is not considered a key measure of performance for the business and is not monitored by the SET.
Resources are allocated on a Group-wide basis according to need.
In particular, capital expenditure, in-licensing, and R&D resources are allocated between activities on merit, based on overall therapeutic considerations and strategy under the aegis of the Groups Early Stage Product Committees and a single Late Stage Product Committee.
The Groups acquisitions in the biologics area, including MedImmune, have been integrated into the existing management structure of AstraZeneca, both for allocation of resources and for assessment and monitoring of performance purposes.
As such, biologics does not operate as a separate operating segment.
Geographic areas The tables below show information by geographic area and, for revenue and property, plant and equipment, material countries.
The figures show the revenue, operating profit and profit before tax made by companies located in that area country, together with segment assets, segment assets acquired, net operating assets, and property, plant and equipment owned by the same companies: export sales and the related profit are included in the area country where the legal entity resides and from which those sales were made.
Intra-Group pricing is determined on an arms length basis.
1 2011 includes profit on disposal of Astra Tech see Note 22.
2 Non-current assets exclude deferred tax assets and derivative financial instruments.
3 Included in Assets acquired are those assets that are expected to be used during more than one period property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets.
4 Net operating assets exclude short-term investments, cash, short-term borrowings, loans, derivative financial instruments, retirement benefit obligations and non-operating receivables and payables.
5 Assets acquired in 2012 include those related to Amylin and Ardea see Notes 9 and 22.

The recoverable amount is based on value in use using discounted risk-adjusted projections of the Groups pre-tax cash flows over 10 years which is considered by the Board as a reasonable period given the long development and life-cycle of a medicine.
The projections include assumptions about product launches, competition from rival products and pricing policy as well as the possibility of generics entering the market.
In setting these assumptions we consider our past experience, external sources of information including information on expected increases and ageing of the populations in our established markets and the expanding patient population in newer markets, our knowledge of competitor activity and our assessment of future changes in the pharmaceutical industry.
The 10 year period is covered by internal budgets and forecasts.
Given that internal budgets and forecasts are prepared for all projections, no general growth rates are used to extrapolate internal budgets and forecasts for the purposes of determining value in use.
No terminal value is included as these cash flows are more than sufficient to establish that an impairment does not exist.
The methods used to determine recoverable amounts have remained consistent with the prior year.
In arriving at value in use, we disaggregate our projected pre-tax cash flows into groups reflecting similar risks and tax effects.
For each group of cash flows we use an appropriate discount rate reflecting those risks and tax effects.
In arriving at the appropriate discount rate for each group of cash flows, we adjust AstraZenecas post-tax weighted average cost of capital 7.0% for 2013, 2012 and 2011 to reflect the impact of relevant industry risks, the time value of money and tax effects.
The weighted average pre-tax discount rate we used was approximately 10% 2012: 10%: 2011: 10%.
As a further check, we compare our market capitalisation to the book value of our net assets and this indicates significant surplus at 31December 2013 and 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011.
No goodwill impairment was identified.
The Group has also performed sensitivity analysis calculations on the projections used and discount rate applied.
The Directors have concluded that, given the significant headroom that exists, and the results of the sensitivity analysis performed, there is no significant risk that reasonable changes in any key assumptions would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed its value in use.

Impairment charges and reversals In 2013, AstraZeneca commenced enrollment of the first patient in the first of several Phase III clinical programmes for olaparib.
As a result of the initiation of this programme, the impairment charge of $285m, taken in 2011 as detailed below, was reversed and the full historic carrying value of the asset restored to our balance sheet.
There are several indications currently under development for olaparib and, at the date of the reversal of the impairment, the recoverable value of the intangible asset relating to olaparib, determined using value in use calculations as detailed below, was estimated to be at least $650m above its carrying value.
The 2013 impairment charge of product, marketing and distribution rights includes a charge of $1,758m against the intangible asset for Bydureon, acquired as part of the 2012 collaboration with BMS on Amylin products as detailed below, following revised estimates for future sales performance as part of the annual budgeting process that are below AstraZenecas commercial expectations at that time of entering into the collaboration.
Impairment charges also include $136m following AstraZenecas decision not to proceed with regulatory filings for fostamatinib.
The 2012 impairment of product, marketing and distribution rights includes a charge of $50m following the decision by AstraZeneca not to pursue a regulatory filing for TC-5214, based on the final results of Phase III efficacy and tolerability studies of the compound as an adjunct therapy to an anti-depressant in patients with major depressive disorder who do not respond adequately to initial anti-depressant treatment.
The remaining $149m charge relates to the termination of other development projects during the year.
The 2011 impairment of product, marketing and distribution rights includes a full impairment charge of $285m following the termination of development of the investigational compound olaparib for the maintenance treatment of serous ovarian cancer.
The 2011 impairment of product, marketing and distribution rights also includes an impairment of $150m reflecting a lower probability of success assessment for TC-5214, based on the results of the first two of four Phase III efficacy and tolerability studies.
The remaining $117m charge relates to the termination of other development projects during the year.
The write downs in value of intangible assets, other than those arising from termination of R&D activities, were determined based on value in use calculations using discounted risk-adjusted projections of the products expected post-tax cash flows over aperiod reflecting the patent-protected lives of the individual products.
The full period of projections is covered by internal budgets and forecasts.
By their nature, the value in use calculations are sensitive to the underlying methods, assumptions and estimates.
Consequently, there is a significant risk that partial impairments recognised in this way may be subject to adjustments in future periods.
Those adjustments may be material.
In arriving at the appropriate discount rate to use for each product, we adjust AstraZenecas post-tax weighted average cost of capital 7.0% for 2013, 2012 and 2011 to reflect the impact of risks and tax effects specific to the individual products.
The weighted average pre-tax discount rate we used was approximately 13% 2012: 14%: 2011: 14%.

Collaboration with BMS on Amylin products On 8 August 2012, BMS completed its acquisition of Amylin.
On that date, AstraZeneca and BMS entered into collaboration arrangements, based substantially on the framework of the existing diabetes alliance, regarding the development and commercialisation of Amylins portfolio of products.
Under the terms of the collaboration, the companies jointly undertake the global selling and marketing activities in relation to the collaboration products.
BMS undertook all manufacturing activities with AstraZeneca receiving collaboration product at cost.
Profits and losses arising from the collaboration were shared equally.
The total consideration for AstraZenecas participation in the collaboration was $3.7bn.
AstraZenecas payment to BMS for its participation in the collaboration primarily resulted in the purchase of intangible assets, valued at $3,358m, related to the collaboration products: Byetta exenatide injection and Bydureon exenatide extended-release for injectable suspension exenatide 2mg powder and solvent for prolonged release suspension for injection that are approved for use in both the US and Europe, Symlin pramlintide acetate injection that is approved for use in the US, and metreleptin, a leptin analogue currently under review at the FDA for the treatment of diabetes and or  in patients with rare forms of inherited or acquired lipodystrophy.
In addition, a prepayment of $0.4bn was recognised representing payments in advance for collaboration products.
AstraZeneca accounts for the collaboration as a joint operation and recognises its share of revenue, costs, assets and liabilities.
As detailed in Note 28, subsequent to the year end in February 2014, AstraZeneca acquired BMSs interests in the diabetes alliance, including acquiring 100% of the share capital of Amylin.
Arrangements with Merck In 1982, Astra set up a joint venture with Merck & Co. Inc. now Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. a subsidiary of the new Merck & Co. Inc. that resulted from the merger with Schering-Plough Merck for the purposes of selling, marketing and distributing certain Astra products in the US.
In 1998, this joint venture was restructured the Restructuring.
Under the agreements relating to the Restructuring the Agreements, a US limited partnership the Partnership was formed, in which Merck is the limited partner and AstraZeneca is the general partner, and AstraZeneca obtained control of the joint ventures business subject to certain limited partner and other rights held by Merck and its affiliates.
These rights provide Merck with safeguards over the activities of the Partnership and place limitations on AstraZenecas commercial freedom to operate.
The Agreements provide, in part, for: annual contingent payments: termination arrangements which cause Merck to relinquish its interests in AstraZenecas products and activities in stages, some of which are mandatory and others optional.
The termination arrangements and payments include: the Advance Payment the Partial Retirement the True-Up the Loan Note Receivable the First Option the Second Option.
152 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 9 Intangible assets continued AstraZeneca considers that the termination arrangements described above represent the acquisition, in stages, of Mercks interests in the Partnership and Agreement products including Mercks rights to contingent payments.
Once all payments are made, AstraZeneca will have unencumbered discretion in its operations in the US market.
AstraZeneca anticipates that the benefits that accrue under all of the termination arrangements arise from: The substantial freedom over products acquired or discovered after the merger of Astra and Zeneca in 1999: and Enhanced contributions from, and substantial freedom over, those products that have already been launched for example, Prilosec, Nexium, Brilinta, Pulmicort, Symbicort, Rhinocort and Atacand and those that are in development.
Economic benefits include relief from contingent payments and other cost efficiencies, together with the strategic advantages of increased freedom to operate.
The intangible assets relating to purchased product rights are subject to impairment testing and would be partially or wholly impaired if a product is withdrawn or if activity in any of the affected therapy areas is significantly curtailed.
Annual Contingent Payments AstraZeneca makes ongoing payments to Merck based on sales of certain of its products in the US the contingent payments on the Agreement products.
Contingent payments in respect of Prilosec and Nexium will continue until the Second Option is exercised and consummated as discussed under Second Option below.
Contingent payments on all other Agreement products have ceased as discussed under First Option below.
Advance Payment The merger between Astra and Zeneca in 1999 triggered the first step in the termination arrangements.
Merck relinquished all rights, including contingent payments on future sales, to potential Astra products with no existing or pending US patents at the time of the merger.
As a result, AstraZeneca now has rights to such products and is relieved of potential obligations to Merck and restrictions in respect of those products including annual contingent payments, affording AstraZeneca substantial freedom to exploit the products as it sees fit.
At the time of the merger, the Advance Payment of $967m was made.
The Advance Payment has been accounted for as an intangible asset and is being amortised over 20 years.
Although the rights obtained apply in perpetuity, the period of amortisation of 20 years is used to reflect the typical timescale of development and marketing of a product.
Partial Retirement, True-Up and Loan Note Receivable On 17 March 2008, AstraZeneca made a net cash payment to Merck of approximately $2.6bn in connection with the Partial Retirement, the True-Up and the Loan Note Receivable.
This payment resulted in AstraZeneca acquiring Mercks interests in certain AstraZeneca products including Pulmicort, Rhinocort, Symbicort and Toprol-XL, AstraZeneca ceasing contingent payments on these products and AstraZeneca obtaining the ability to exploit these products and other opportunities in the Respiratory Therapy Area.
Intangible assets of $994m were recognised at the time with the balance of the net payment $1,656m representing payments on account for future product rights associated with the First Option and the Second Option as detailed below.
These non-refundable deposits were classified as intangible assets.
First Option On 26 February 2010, AstraZeneca exercised the First Option.
Payment of $647m to Merck was made on 30 April 2010.
This payment resulted in AstraZeneca acquiring Mercks interests in products covered by the First Option including Entocort, Atacand, Plendil and certain products in development at the time principally Brilinta and lesogaberan: development of lesogaberan was subsequently discontinued.
Also on 30 April 2010, contingent payments on these products ceased with respect to periods after this date and AstraZeneca obtained the ability to exploit these products and other opportunities in the Cardiovascular and Neuroscience Therapy Areas.
These rights were valued at $1,829m and were recognised as intangible assets from 26 February 2010 $1,182m having been transferred from non-refundable deposits to supplement the payment of $647m to Merck.
Of these rights, $689m was allocated to contingent payment relief and $1,140m to intangible assets reflecting the ability to fully exploit the products in the Cardiovascular and Neuroscience Therapy Areas.
The remaining non-refundable deposits of $474m relate to benefits that would be secured upon AstraZeneca exercising the Second Option.
Second Option The Agreements provided that AstraZeneca may exercise a Second Option to purchase Mercks interests in the Merck affiliates that hold the limited partner and other rights referred to above.
Exercise of the Second Option would result in the repurchase by AstraZeneca of Mercks interests in Prilosec and Nexium in the US.
This option was exercisable by AstraZeneca in May to October of 2012, or in 2017, or if combined annual sales of the two products fell below a minimum amount.
On 26 June 2012, AstraZeneca and Merck agreed to amend certain provisions of the Agreements with respect to the Second Option.
The principal areas covered by the amendments are a change in the timing for AstraZeneca to exercise the Second Option, and agreement on the valuation methodology for setting certain aspects of the option exercise price.
Under the amended Agreements, Merck has granted to AstraZeneca a new Second Option exercisable by AstraZeneca between 1 March 2014 and 30 April 2014, with closing on 30 June 2014.
Options exercisable in 2017 or if combined annual sales fall below a minimum amount also remain available to AstraZeneca.
In addition to this revised timing for the Second Option, AstraZeneca and Merck have also reached agreement on the valuation methodology for setting certain components of the option exercise price for a 2014 exercise.
In lieu of third party appraisals, the valuation for a 2014 exercise is now a fixed sum of $327m, based on a shared view by AstraZeneca and Merck of the forecasts for sales of Nexium and Prilosec in the US market.
The agreed amount that would be payable on 30 June 2014 is subject to a true-up in 2018 that replaces a shared forecast with actual sales for the period from closing in 2014 to June 2018.
In addition, the exercise price for the Second Option also includes a multiple of ten times Mercks average 1% annual profit allocation in the Partnership for the three years prior to exercise.
AstraZeneca currently expects this amount to be around $80m.
The component of the exercise price of the Second Option that includes the net present value of up to 5% of future US sales of Vimovo, with the precise amount dependent on anannual sales threshold that has not yet been achieved and the timing of the option exercise, will continue.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 153 Financial Statements |Notes to the Group Financial Statements 9 Intangible assets continued AstraZeneca believes that the amendments provide a greater degree of certainty to the valuation of the Second Option that is preferable to the previous arrangements and, barring unforeseen circumstances, AstraZeneca now intends to exercise the Second Option in 2014.
Under the amendments, if AstraZeneca exercises in 2014, Mercks existing rights to manufacture Nexium and Prilosec would cease upon closing.
In connection with the amendments, Merck also granted AstraZeneca flexibility to exploit certain commercial opportunities with respect to Nexium.
AstraZeneca now considers that exercise of the Second Option is virtually certain.
This judgement is supported by managements view that: AstraZeneca is fully committed to exercising the Second Option in 2014, barring unforeseen circumstances: external announcements of that intention constructively oblige AstraZeneca to exercise in 2014, barring unforeseen circumstances: and the Second Option price is highly favourable, giving economic compulsion for AstraZeneca to exercise in 2014.
As such, AstraZeneca has applied an accounting treatment to reflect the Second Option as if the date of exercise were 26 June 2012 the date of amendment of the Agreements, resulting in liabilities to Merck of approximately $1.5bn $1.1bn of which will be paid by way of monthly contingent payments between 1 July 2012 and 30 June 2014 and the balance as a lump sum on 30 June 2014, and a corresponding increase to intangible assets, from that date.
These intangible assets, and the $474m from the First Option detailed above, in aggregate, reflect the value of the ability to exploit opportunities in the Gastrointestinal Therapy Area and relief from contingent payments.

2 Instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss include the US dollar 5.4% callable bond repayable in 2014 and the US dollar 7% guaranteed debentures repayable in 2023.
3 Included within borrowings held at amortised cost are amounts designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations of $1,608m 2012: $1,551m: 2011: $1,505m held at amortised cost.
The fair value of fixed-rate publicly traded debt is based on year end quoted market prices: the fair value of floating rate debt is nominal value, as mark to market differences would be minimal given the frequency of resets.
The carrying value of loans designated at fair value through profit or loss is the fair value: this falls within the Level 1 valuation method as defined in Note 10.
For loans designated in a fair value hedge relationship, carrying value is initially measured at fair value and remeasured for fair value changes in respect of the hedged risk at each reporting date.
All other loans are held at amortised cost.
Fair values, as disclosed in the table above, are all determined using the Level 1 valuation method as defined in Note 10, with the exception of overdrafts and finance leases, where fair value approximates to carrying values.
156 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 14 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings continued A gain of $5m was made during the year on the fair value of bonds designated at fair value through profit or loss, due to increased credit risk.
A gain of $39m has been made on these bonds since designation due to increased credit risk.
Changes in credit risk had no material effect on any other financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value in the Groups Financial Statements.
The change in fair value attributable to changes in credit risk is calculated as the change in fair value not attributable to market risk.
The amount payable at maturity on bonds designated at fair value through profit or loss is $1,037m.

None of the derivatives have been reclassified in the year.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps is estimated using appropriate zero coupon curve valuation techniques to discount future contractual cash flows based on rates at current year end.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows using appropriate yield curves based on market forward foreign exchange rates at the year end.
The majority of forward foreign exchange contracts for existing transactions had maturities of less than one month from year end.

158 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 18 Post-retirement benefits Pensions Background The Company and most of its subsidiaries offer retirement plans which cover the majority of employees in the Group.
Many of these plans are defined contribution, where AstraZenecas contribution and resulting charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees pay.
However, several plans, mainly in the UK, the US, Sweden and Germany, are defined benefit, where benefits are based on employees length of service and average final salary typically averaged over one, three or five years.
The major defined benefit plans, apart from the collectively bargained Swedish plan which is still open to employees born before 1979, have been closed to new entrants since 2000.
During 2010, following consultation with its UK employees representatives, AstraZeneca introduced a freeze on pensionable pay at 30June 2010 levels for defined benefit members of the UK Pension Fund.
The major defined benefit plans are funded through legally separate,  funds.
The cash funding of the plans, which may from time to time involve special payments, is designed, in consultation with independent qualified actuaries, to ensure that the assets together with future contributions should be sufficient to meet future obligations.
The funding is monitored rigorously by AstraZeneca and appropriate fiduciaries specifically with reference to AstraZenecas credit rating, market capitalisation, cash flows and the solvency of the relevant pension scheme.
Financing Principles 97% of the Groups defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2013 are in schemes within the UK, the US, Sweden or Germany.
In these countries, the pension obligations are funded with reference to the following financing principles: The Group has a fundamental belief in funding the benefits it promises to employees.
The Group considers its pension arrangements in the context of its broader capital structure.
In general, it does not believe in committing excessive capital for funding while it has better uses of capital within the business nor does it wish to generate surpluses.
The pension funds are not part of the Groups core business.
The Group believes in taking some rewarded risks with the investments underlying the funding, subject to a medium to long-term plan to reduce those risks if opportunities arise.
The Group recognises that deciding to hold certain investments may cause volatility in the funding position.
The Group would not wish to amend its contribution level for relatively small deviations from its preferred funding level, because it is expected that there will be short-term volatility, but it is prepared to react appropriately to more significant deviations.
In the event that local regulations require an additional level of financing, the Group would consider the use of alternative methods of providing this that do not require immediate cash funding but help mitigate exposure of the pension arrangement to the credit risk of the Group.
These principles are appropriate to AstraZenecas business at the present date: should circumstances change they may require review.
AstraZeneca has developed a funding framework to implement these principles.
This determines the cash contributions payable to the pension funds, but does not affect the IAS 19 2011 liabilities.
To reduce the risk of committing excess capital to pension funds, liability valuations are based on the expected return on the actual pension assets, rather than a corporate bond yield.
At present, this puts a different, lower value on the liabilities than IAS 19 2011.
UK With regard to the Groups UK defined benefit fund, the above principles are modified in light of the UK regulatory requirements summarised below and resulting discussions with the Pension Fund Trustee.
Role of Trustees UK The UK Pension Fund is managed by a corporate Trustee which is legally separate from the Company.
The Trustee Directors are composed of representatives appointed by both the employer and employees, and include an independent professional Trustee Director.
The Trustee Directors are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and are responsible in particular for the asset investment policy plus the day to day administration of the benefits.
They also are responsible for jointly agreeing with the employer the level of contributions due to the UK Pension Fund see below.
Funding requirements UK UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently ie to a level in excess of the current expected cost of providing benefits.
The last funding valuation of the AstraZeneca Pension Fund was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 31 March 2010.
The latest funding valuation of the AstraZeneca Pension Fund as at 31 March 2013 is underway.
Within 15 months of each valuation, the Trustee and the Company must agree the contributions required if any to ensure the Fund is fully funded over time on a suitable prudent measure.
Contributions agreed in this manner constitute a minimum funding requirement.
In addition, AstraZeneca will make contributions to an escrow account which will be held outside of the UK Pension Fund.
The escrow account assets will be payable to the fund in agreed circumstances, for example, in the event of AstraZeneca and the Pension Fund Trustee agreeing on a change to the current long-term investment strategy.
At 31 December 2013, 446m $735m of escrow fund assets are included within other investments see Note 10.
Under the current funding plan, contributions of 264m $436m are required to be made towards the deficit no later than 31 January 2015.
In practice, it isexpected that these contributions will be made by transferring assets from the separate escrow account created for the purpose of managing funding of the UK Pension Fund.
Under this plan the fund is expected to be fully funded by 31 March 2017.
However, this recovery plan is under review as part of the 31 March 2013 valuation.
Under the agreed funding principles used to set the statutory funding target, the key assumptions as at 31 March 2010 were as follows: long-term UK price inflation set at 3.8% per annum, salary increases at 0% per annum as a result of pensionable pay levels being frozen in 2010, pension increases at 3.55% per annum and investment returns at 5.9% per annum.
The resulting valuation of the Funds liabilities on that basis were 3,950m $6,100m compared to a market value of assets at 31 March 2010 of 3,129m $4,832m.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 159 Financial Statements |Notes to the Group Financial Statements 18 Post-retirement benefits continued Under the governing documentation of the UK Pension Fund, any future surplus in the Fund would be returnable to AstraZeneca by refund assuming gradual settlement of the liabilities over the lifetime of the fund.
As such, there are no adjustments required in respect of IFRIC14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
Regulation UK The UK pensions market is regulated by the Pensions Regulator whose statutory objectives and regulatory powers are described on its website: www.
Rest of Group The IAS 19 2011 positions as at 31 December 2013 are shown below for each of the other countries with significant defined benefit plans.
These plans account for 90% of the Groups defined benefit obligations outside of the UK.
The US and Sweden pension funds are managed by fiduciary bodies with responsibility for the investment policies of those funds.
These plans are funded in line with the financing principles and contributions paid as prescribed by the funding framework.
The US defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2013, when plan obligations were $1,655m and plan assets were $1,651m.
This includes obligations in respect of the non-qualified plan which is largely unfunded.
The Swedish defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2013, when plan obligations were estimated toamount to $1,719m and plan assets were $1,238m.
The German defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2013.
In accordance with practice in Germany, the plan has a low level of funding: plan obligations amounted to $361m and plan assets were $23m.
On current bases, it is expected that contributions excluding those in respect of past service cost during the year ending 31 December 2014 to the four main countries will be $285m.
Post-retirement benefits other than pensions In the US, and to a lesser extent in certain other countries, AstraZenecas employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life assurance benefits for retired employees.
As at 31 December 2013, some 3,513 retired employees and covered dependants currently benefit from these provisions and some 8,098 current employees will be eligible on their retirement.
AstraZeneca accrues for the present value of such retiree obligations over the working life of the employee.
In practice, these benefits will be funded with reference to the financing principles.
The cost of post-retirement benefits other than pensions for the Group in 2013 was $16m 2012: $16m: 2011: $12m.
Plan assets were $314m and plan obligations were $331m at 31 December 2013.
These benefit plans have been included in the disclosure of post-retirement benefits under IAS 19 2011.
Financial assumptions Qualified independent actuaries have updated the actuarial valuations under IAS 19 2011 of the major defined benefit schemes operated by the Group to 31 December 2013.
The assumptions used by the actuaries are chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the long-term nature of the schemes, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
These assumptions were as follows: 2013 2012 UK Rest of Group UK Rest of Group Inflation assumption 3.5% 2.2% 3.1% 2.2% 1 1 Rate of increase in salaries 3.4% 3.4% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.3% 1.1% 2.9% 1.1% Discount rate 4.5% 4.3% 4.5% 3.6% 1 Pensionable pay frozen at 30 June 2010 levels following UK fund changes.
Demographic assumptions The mortality assumptions are based on country-specific mortality tables.
These are compared to actual AstraZeneca experience and adjusted where sufficient data is available.
Additional allowance for future improvements in life expectancy is included for all major schemes where there is credible data to support this continuing trend.
The table below illustrates life expectancy assumptions at age 65 for male members retiring in 2013 and members expected to retire in 2033 2012: 2012 and 2032 respectively.

A one year increase in life expectancy will result in $178m increase in pension fund assets.
Other risks There are a number of other risks of running the UK Pension Fund including operational risks such as paying out the wrong benefits and legislative risks such as the government increasing the burden on pension through new legislation.

Past service cost relates predominantly to enhanced pensions on early retirement in the UK and Sweden.
In addition, 2012 includes a $25m curtailment credit recognised in Sweden as a consequence of the Sdertlje site closure.
A settlement credit of $30m recognised in the US, in 2012, arose where a proportion of deferred inactive participants who were not yet eligible for retirement elected to exchange their plan benefit for immediate cash lump sums.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 165 Financial Statements |Notes to the Group Financial Statements 22 Acquisitions and disposals 2013 acquisitions Pearl Therapeutics On 27 June 2013, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Pearl Therapeutics.
Pearl Therapeutics is based in Redwood City, California, and is focused on the development of inhaled small molecule therapeutics for respiratory disease.
AstraZeneca acquired 100% of Pearl Therapeutics shares for an upfront consideration of $569m.
In addition, consideration of up to $450m will become payable if specified development and regulatory milestones in respect of any triple combination therapies and selected future products that AstraZeneca develops using Pearl Therapeutics technology platform are achieved.
Sales-related payments of up to a further $140m will become payable if pre-agreed cumulative sales thresholds are exceeded.
Contingent consideration has been fair valued using decision tree analysis, with key inputs including the probability of success and consideration of potential delays.
Goodwill of $44m is underpinned by a number of elements, which individually cannot be quantified.
Most significant among these is the synergistic benefit generated by acquiring Pearl Therapeutics workforce, whose skills and knowhow are critical to the best and most efficient completion of the ongoing development programmes.
Pearl Therapeutics results have been consolidated into the Companys results from 27 June 2013.
For the period from acquisition to 31 December 2013, Pearl Therapeutics revenues were immaterial, in the context of the Groups revenue, and its loss after tax was $49m.

Under the terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca has acquired 100% of Amplimmunes shares for an initial consideration of $225m and deferred consideration of up to $275m based on reaching predetermined development milestones.
The acquisition bolsters AstraZenecas oncology pipeline by obtaining multiple early-stage assets for its immune-mediated cancer therapy IMT-C portfolio, including AMP-514, an anti-programmed cell death 1 PD-1 monoclonal antibody mAb.
Other Amplimmune assets include multiple preclinical molecules targeting the B7 pathways.
Goodwill of $33m is underpinned by a number of elements, which individually cannot be quantified, but include Amplimmunes very early programmes of potential interest for oncology, immunology and infectious diseases, as well as research tools and animal models.
Amplimmunes results have been consolidated into the Companys results from 4 October 2013.
For the period from acquisition to 31December 2013, Amplimmunes revenues were immaterial, in the context of the Groups revenue, and its loss after tax was $5m.

Ifthe 2013 acquisitions had taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period 1 January 2013, on a pro forma basis, the revenue of the combined Group for 2013 would have been unchanged and the profit after tax would have been $2,458m.
This pro forma information has been prepared taking into account any amortisation, interest costs and related tax effects but does not purport to represent the results of the combined Group that actually would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on 1 January 2013 and should not be taken to be representative of future results.
2012 acquisitions Ardea On 19 June 2012, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Ardea.
Ardea is a US San Diego, California based biotechnology company focused on the development of small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of serious diseases.
AstraZeneca acquired 100% of Ardeas shares for cash consideration of $1,268m.
The acquisition strengthens our research and development capabilities in the Respiratory, Inflammation and Autoimmunity Therapy Area.
In most business acquisitions, there is a part of the cost that is not capable of being attributed in accounting terms to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired and is therefore recognised as goodwill.
In the case of the acquisition of Ardea, this goodwill is underpinned by a number of elements, which individually cannot be quantified.
Most significant among these is the premium attributable to a highly-skilled workforce and established experience in the field of gout.
Ardeas results have been consolidated into the Groups results from 20 June 2012.
For the period from acquisition to 31 December 2012, Ardeas revenues were immaterial, in the context of the Groups revenue, and its loss after tax was $43m.
If the acquisition had taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period 1 January 2012, on a pro forma basis, the revenue of the combined Group for 2012 would have been unchanged and the profit after tax would have been $6,245m.
This pro forma information has been prepared taking into account any amortisation, interest costs and related tax effects, but does not purport to represent the results of the combined Group that actually would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on 1 January 2012 and should not be taken to be representative of future results.

168 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 23 Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, finance leases, loans, current and non-current investments, cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Groups funding and liquidity requirements.
The Group has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of liquidity, interest rate, foreign currency and credit.
Each of these is managed in accordance with Board-approved policies.
These policies are set out below.
The Group uses foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps for the purpose of hedging its foreign currency and interest rate risks.
The Group may designate certain financial instruments as either fair value hedges or net investment hedges in accordance with IAS 39.
Key controls applied to transactions in derivative financial instruments are: to use only instruments where good market liquidity exists, to revalue all financial instruments regularly using current market rates and to sell options only to offset previously purchased options.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Capital management The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders equity Note 20, debt Note 14 and cash Note 13.
For the foreseeable future, the Board will maintain a capital structure that supports the Groups strategic objectives through: managing funding and liquidity risk optimising shareholder return maintaining a strong, investment-grade credit rating.
Funding and liquidity risk are reviewed regularly by the Board and managed in accordance with policies described below.
The Boards distribution policy comprises a regular cash dividend, and subject to business needs, a share repurchase component.
The Board regularly reviews its shareholders return strategy, and in 2012, decided to suspend share repurchases in order to retain strategic flexibility.
The Groups net funds position loans and borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents, current investments and derivative financial instruments has increased from a net debt position of $1,369m at the beginning of the year to a net funds position of $39m at 31 December 2013, as a result of increased cash inflows from operating activities offset by investment activities and dividends paid to shareholders in the year.
Liquidity risk The Board reviews the Groups ongoing liquidity risks annually as part of the planning process and on an ad hoc basis.
The Board considers short-term requirements against available sources of funding, taking into account forecast cash flows.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining access to a number of sources of funding which are sufficient to meet anticipated funding requirements.
Specifically, the Group uses US commercial paper, committed bank facilities and cash resources to manage short-term liquidity and manages long-term liquidity by raising funds through the capital markets.
The Group is assigned short-term credit ratings of P-1 by Moodys and A-1 by Standard and Poors.
The Groups long-term credit rating is A2 stable outlook by Moodys and AAnegative outlook by Standard and Poors.
In addition to cash and cash equivalents of $9,217m, fixed deposits of $15m, less overdrafts of $222m at 31 December 2013, the Group has committed bank facilities of $3bn available to manage liquidity.
At 31 December 2013, the Group has issued $1,608m under a Euro Medium Term Note programme and $7,674m under a SEC-registered programme.
The Group regularly monitors the credit standing of the banking group and currently does not anticipate any issue with drawing on the committed facilities should this be necessary.
The committed facilities of $3bn mature in April 2018 and were undrawn at 31 December 2013.

The portion of fixed rate debt was approved by the Board and any variation requires Board approval.
A significant portion of the long-term debt entered into in 2007 in order to finance the acquisition of MedImmune has been held at fixed rates of interest.
The Group uses interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to manage this mix.
At 31 December 2013, the Group held interest rate swaps with a notional value of $1.8bn, converting the 5.4% callable bond maturing in 2014 and the 7% guaranteed debentures payable in 2023 to floating rates and partially converting the 5.9% callable bond maturing in 2017 to floating rates.
No new interest rate swaps were entered into during 2013, 2012 or 2011.
At 31 December 2013, swaps with a notional value of $0.75bn were designated in fair value hedge relationships and swaps with a notional value of $1.0bn related to debt designated as fair value through profit or loss.
Designated hedges are expected to be effective and therefore the impact of ineffectiveness on profit is not expected to be material.
The accounting treatment for fair value hedges and debt designated as fair value through profit or loss is disclosed in the Group Accounting Policies section from page 136.
170 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 23 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued The majority of surplus cash is currently invested in US dollar liquidity funds earning floating rates of interest.
The interest rate profile of the Groups interest-bearing financial instruments, as at 31 December 2013, 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, is set out below.
In the case of current and non-current financial liabilities, the classification includes the impact of interest rate swaps which convert the debt to floating rate.
Foreign currency risk The US dollar is the Groups most significant currency.
As a consequence, the Group results are presented in US dollars and exposures are managed against US dollars accordingly.
Translational Approximately 62% of Group external sales in 2013 were denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, while a significant proportion of manufacturing, and research and development costs were denominated in pounds sterling and Swedish kronor.
Surplus cash generated by business units is substantially converted to, and held centrally in, US dollars.
As a result, operating profit and total cash flow in US dollars will be affected by movements in exchange rates.
This currency exposure is managed centrally, based on forecast cash flows.
The impact of movements in exchange rates is mitigated significantly by the correlations which exist between the major currencies to which the Group is exposed and the US dollar.
Monitoring of currency exposures and correlations is undertaken on a regular basis and hedging is subject to pre-execution approval.
Where there is non-US dollar debt and an underlying net investment of that amount in the same currency, the Group applies net investment hedging.
As at 31 December 2013, 5.5% of interest-bearing loans and borrowings were denominated in pounds sterling and 10.0% of interest-bearing loans and borrowings were denominated in euros.
Exchange differences on the retranslation of debt designated as net investment hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective.
Any ineffectiveness is taken to profit.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings not designated in a hedge relationship are taken to profit.
In 2012, the Group entered into a cross-currency swap to convert $750m of the 1.95% 2019 maturing bond into fixed Japanese yen debt.
During 2013, the Group entered into an additional cross-currency swap to convert the remaining un-hedged $250m of the 1.95% 2019 maturing bond into fixed Japanese yen debt.
Both these instruments were designated in net investment hedges against the foreign currency risk of the Groups Japanese yen net assets.
Also in 2013, the Group entered into a cross-currency swap to convert $151m into fixed Chinese renminbi debt maturing in 2018.
Thisinstrument was designated in a net investment hedge against the foreign currency risk of the Groups Chinese renminbi net assets.
Fairvalue movements on the revaluation of the cross-currency swaps are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective.
Any ineffectiveness would be taken to profit.
Transactional One hundred percent of the Groups major transactional currency exposures on working capital balances, which typically extend for up to three months, are hedged, where practicable, using forward foreign exchange contracts against individual Group companies reporting currency.
In addition, the Groups external dividend, which is paid principally in pounds sterling and Swedish kronor, is fully hedged from announcement to payment date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on forward contracts transacted for transactional hedging are taken to profit.
Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis set out below summarises the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to hypothetical changes in market rates and prices.
The range of variables chosen for the sensitivity analysis reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period.
Market values are the present value of future cash flows based on market rates and prices at the valuation date.
For long-term debt, an increase in interest rates results in a decline in the fair value of debt.
The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels at 31 December 2013, with all other variables held constant.
Based on the composition of our long-term debt portfolio as at 31 December 2013, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in an additional $30m in interest expense being incurred per year.
The exchange rate sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 31 December 2013, with all other variables held constant.
The 10% case assumes a 10% strengthening of the US dollar against all other currencies and the -10% case assumes a 10% weakening of the US dollar.

Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets, such as cash balances including fixed deposits and cash and cash equivalents, derivative instruments, trade and other receivables.
The Group is also exposed in its net asset position to its own credit risk in respect of the 2023 debentures and 2014 bonds which are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the customer.
The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government-backed agencies and large private wholesalers to privately owned pharmacies, and the underlying local economic and sovereign risks vary throughout the world.
Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risks by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance.
The Group establishes anallowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of specific trade and other receivables where it is deemed that a receivable may not be recoverable.
When the debt is deemed irrecoverable, the allowance account is written off against the underlying receivable.
In the US, sales to three wholesalers accounted for approximately 77% of US sales 2012: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 73%: 2011: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 75%.
The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was: 2013 2012 2011 $m $m $m Not past due 5,059 5,322 6,249 Past due 0-90 days 330 288 177 Past due 90-180 days 78 41 82 Past due 180 days 47 45 122 5,514 5,696 6,630 2013 2012 2011 $m $m $m Movements in provisions for trade receivables At 1 January 64 66 81 Income statement credit 5 10 Amounts utilised, exchange and other movements 5 2 5 At 31 December 64 64 66 The allowance for impairment has been calculated based on past experience and is in relation to specific customers.
Given the profile of our customers, including large wholesalers and government-backed agencies, no further credit risk has been identified with the trade receivables not past due other than those balances for which an allowance has been made.
172 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 23 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Other financial assets The Group may hold significant cash balances as part of its normal operations, with the amount of cash held at any point reflecting the level of cash flow generated by the business and the timing of the use of that cash.
The majority of excess cash is centralised within the Group treasury entity and is subject to counterparty risk on the principal invested.
This risk is mitigated through a policy of prioritising security and liquidity over return, and as such cash is only invested in high credit quality investments.
Counterparty limits are set according to the assessed risk of each counterparty and exposures are monitored against these limits on a regular basis.
The majority of the Groups cash is invested in US dollar AAA-rated liquidity funds and short-term bank deposits.
The most significant concentration of financial credit risk at 31 December 2013 was $8,409m invested in five US dollar AAA-rated liquidity funds.
The liquidity fund portfolios are managed by the related external third party fund managers to maintain the AAA rating.
No more than 15% of fund value is invested within each individual fund.
There were no other significant concentrations of financial credit risk at the reporting date.
All financial derivatives are transacted with commercial banks, in line with standard market practice.
The Group has agreements with some bank counterparties whereby the parties agree to post cash collateral, for the benefit of the other, equivalent to the market valuation of the derivative positions above a predetermined threshold.
The carrying value of such cash collateral held by the Group at 31 December 2013 was $326m 2012: $230m: 2011: $21m.
24 Employee costs and share plans for employees Employee costs The average number of people, to the nearest hundred, employed by the Group is set out in the table below.

The Directors believe that, together with the basic salary system, the Groups employee incentive schemes provide competitive and market-related packages to motivate employees.
They should also align the interests of employees with those of shareholders, as a whole, through long-term share ownership in the Company.
The Groups current UK, Swedish and US schemes are described below: other arrangements apply elsewhere.
Bonus plans The AstraZeneca UK Performance Bonus Plan Employees of participating AstraZeneca UK companies are invited to participate in this bonus plan, which rewards strong individual performance.
The Company also offers UK employees the opportunity to buy Partnership Shares Ordinary Shares.
Employees may invest up to 1,500 over a 12 month accumulation period and purchase Partnership Shares in the Company with the total proceeds at the end of the period.
The purchase price for the shares is the lower of the price at the beginning or the end of the 12 month period.
In 2010, the Company introduced a Matching Share element in respect of Partnership Shares, the first award of which was made in 2011.
Partnership Shares and Matching Shares are held in the HM Revenue & Customs HMRCapproved All-Employee Share Plan.
At the Companys AGM in 2002, shareholders approved the issue of new shares for the purposes of the All-Employee Share Plan.
The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme This scheme is a performance bonus scheme for Directors and senior employees who do not participate in the AstraZeneca UK Performance Bonus Plan.
Annual bonuses are paid in cash and reflect both corporate and individual performance measures.
TheRemuneration Committee has discretion to reduce or withhold bonuses if business performance falls sufficiently short of expectations in any year such as to make the payment of bonuses inappropriate.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 173 Financial Statements |Notes to the Group Financial Statements 24 Employee costs and share plans for employees continued The AstraZeneca Deferred Bonus Plan This plan was introduced in 2006 and is used to defer a portion of the bonus earned under the AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme into Ordinary Shares in the Company for a period of three years.
The plan currently operates only in respect of Executive Directors and members of the SET.
Awards of shares under this plan are typically made in February each year, the first award having been made in February 2006.
Sweden In Sweden, an all-employee performance bonus plan is in operation, which rewards strong individual performance.
Bonuses are paid 50% into a fund investing in AstraZeneca equities and 50% in cash.
The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme, the AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan all operate in respect of relevant AstraZeneca employees in Sweden.
US In the US, there are two all-employee short-term or annual performance bonus plans in operation to differentiate and reward strong individual performance.
Annual bonuses are paid in cash.
There is also one senior staff long-term incentive scheme, under which 80 participants may be eligible for awards granted as AstraZeneca ADSs.
AstraZeneca ADSs necessary to satisfy the awards are purchased in the market or funded via a share trust.
The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan operate in respect of relevant employees in the US.
Share plans The charge for share-based payments in respect of share plans is $156m 2012: $139m: 2011: $153m.
The plans are equity settled.
The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan This plan was approved by shareholders in 2005 for a period of 10 years.
Generally, awards can be granted at any time, but not during a close period of the Company.
The first grant of awards was made in June 2005.
The main grant of awards in 2013 under the plan was in June, with further smaller grants in August and November.
Awards granted under the plan vest after three years and can be subject to the achievement of performance conditions.
For awards to all participants in 2013, except employees of MedImmune, vesting is subject to a combination of measures focused on scientific leadership, revenue growth and financial performance.
A separate performance condition applies to employees of MedImmune.
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for agreeing any awards under the plan and for setting the policy for the way in which the plan should be operated, including agreeing performance targets and which employees should be invited to participate.
Further details of this plan can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report from page 102.
The AstraZeneca Investment Plan This plan was introduced in 2010 and approved by shareholders at the 2010 AGM.
The main grant of awards in 2013 under the plan was in June, with a further smaller grant in August.
Awards granted under the plan vest after eight years and are subject to performance conditions measured over a period of between three and eight years.
For awards granted in 2013, the performance conditions relate to the annual dividend paid to shareholders and dividend cover over a four year performance period.
The awards are then subject to a four-year holding period before they can vest.

Research and development collaboration payments The Group has various ongoing collaborations including in-licensing and similar arrangements with development partners.
Such collaborations may require the Group to make payments on achievement of stages of development, launch or revenue milestones, although the Group generally has the right to terminate these agreements at no cost.
The Group recognises research and development milestones as intangible assets once it is committed to payment, which is generally when the Group reaches set trigger points in the development cycle.
Revenue-related milestones are recognised as intangible assets on product launch at a value based on the Groups long-term revenue forecasts for the related product.
The table below indicates potential development and revenue-related payments that the Group may be required to make under such collaborations.

Revenue-related milestone payments represent the maximum possible amount payable on achievement of specified levels of revenue as set out in individual contract agreements, but exclude variable payments that are based on unit sales eg royalty-type payments which are expensed as the associated sale is recognised.
The table excludes any payments already capitalised in the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2013.
The future payments we disclose represent contracted payments and, as such, are not discounted and are not risk adjusted.
As detailed in the Principal risks and uncertainties section from page 200, the development of any pharmaceutical product candidate is a complex and risky process that may fail at any stage in the development process due to a number of factors including items such as failure to obtain regulatory approval, unfavourable data from key studies, adverse reactions to the product candidate or indications of other safety concerns.
The timing of the payments is based on the Groups current best estimate of achievement of the relevant milestone.
Environmental costs and liabilities The Groups expenditure on environmental protection, including both capital and revenue items, relates to costs which are necessary for implementing internal systems and programmes, and meeting legal and regulatory requirements for processes andproducts.
They are an integral part of normal ongoing expenditure for carrying out the Groups research, manufacturing and commercial operations and are not separated from overall operating and development costs.
There are no known changes in legal, regulatory or other requirements resulting in material changes to the levels of expenditure for 2011, 2012, or 2013.
In addition to expenditure for meeting current and foreseen environmental protection requirements, the Group incurs costs in investigating and cleaning up land and groundwater contamination.
In particular, AstraZeneca has environmental liabilities atsome currently or formerly owned, leased and third party sites.
In the US, Zeneca Inc. and or its indemnitees, have been named as potentially responsible parties PRPs or defendants at approximately 18 sites where Zeneca Inc. is likely to incurfuture environmental investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance costs under federal, state, statutory or common law environmental liability allocation schemes together, US Environmental Consequences.
Similarly, Stauffer Management Company LLC SMC, which was established in 1987 to own and manage certain assets of Stauffer Chemical Company acquired that year, and or its indemnitees, have been named as PRPs or defendants at 30 sites where SMC is likely to incur US Environmental Consequences.
AstraZeneca has also given indemnities to third parties for a number of sites outside the US.
These environmental liabilities arise from legacy operations that are not currently part of the Groups business and, at most of these sites, remediation, where required, is either completed or nearing completion.
AstraZeneca has made provisions for the estimated costs of future environmental investigation, remediation, operation andmaintenance activity beyond normal ongoing expenditure for maintaining the Groups R&D and manufacturing capacity and product ranges, where a present obligation exists, it is probable that such costs will be incurred and they can be estimated reliably.
With respect to such estimated future costs, there were provisions at 31 December 2013 in the aggregate of $87m 2012: $88m: 2011: $92m, mainly relating to the US.
Where we are jointly liable or otherwise have cost-sharing agreements with third parties, we reflect only our share of the obligation.
Where the liability is insured in part or in whole by insurance or other arrangements for reimbursement, an asset is recognised to the extent that this recovery is virtually certain.
It is possible that AstraZeneca could incur future environmental costs beyond the extent of our current provisions.
The extent of such possible additional costs is inherently difficult to estimate due to a number of factors, including: 1 the nature and extent of claims that may be asserted in the future: 2 whether AstraZeneca has or will have any legal obligation with respect to asserted or unasserted claims: 3 the type of remedial action, if any, that may be selected at sites where the remedy is presently not known: 4 the potential for recoveries from, or allocation of liability to, third parties: and 5 the length of time that the environmental investigation, remediation and liability allocation process can take.
Notwithstanding, and subject to the foregoing, we estimate the potential additional loss for future environmental investigation, remediation, remedial operation and maintenance activity above and beyond our provisions to be, in aggregate, between $50m to $90m 2012: $50m to $90m: 2011: $50m to $90m which relates solely to the US.

28 Subsequent events Acquisition of Bristol-Myers Squibbs share of global diabetes alliance assets On 1 February 2014, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of BMSs interests in the companies diabetes alliance.
The acquisition provides AstraZeneca with 100% ownership of the intellectual property and global rights for the development, manufacture and commercialisation of the diabetes business, which includes Onglyza saxagliptin, Kombiglyze XR saxagliptin and metformin HCl extended release, Komboglyze saxagliptin and metformin HCl, Farxiga dapagliflozin, marketed as Forxiga outside the US, Byetta exenatide, Bydureon exenatide extended release for injectable suspension, metreleptin and Symlin pramlintide acetate.
The transaction consolidates worldwide ownership of the diabetes business within AstraZeneca, leveraging its primary and specialty care capabilities and its geographical reach, especially in Emerging Markets.
The transaction included the acquisition of 100% of the share capital of Amylin Pharmaceuticals, LLC, and the asset purchase of the additional intellectual property and global rights not already owned by AstraZeneca, for the development, manufacture and commercialisation of Onglyza, Kombiglyze XR, Komboglyze and Farxiga.
In total, approximately 3,900 BMS employees are expected to transfer as part of the acquisition.
This combination of intangible product rights and manufacturing assets with an established workforce and their associated operating processes, principally those related to the global manufacturing and selling and marketing operations, requires that the acquisition is accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Upfront consideration for the acquisition of $2.7bn was paid on 1 February 2014, with further payments of up to $1.4bn being payable for future regulatory-launch and sales-related milestones.
AstraZeneca has also agreed to pay various sales-related royalty payments up until 2025.
The amount of royalties payable under the agreement is inherently uncertain and difficult to predict, given the direct link to future sales and the range of outcomes cannot be reliably estimated.
The maximum amount payable in each year is with reference to net sales and is therefore, theoretically, unlimited until royalties cease in 2025.
AstraZeneca may also make payments up to $225m when certain additional assets are subsequently transferred.
In accordance with IFRS 3, the fair value of contingent consideration, including future royalties, is recognised immediately as a liability.
In addition to the acquired interests, AstraZeneca has entered into certain agreements with BMS to maintain the manufacturing and supply chain of the full portfolio of diabetes products.
BMS will also continue to deliver specified clinical trials in line with the ongoing clinical trial plan, with an agreed number of R&D and manufacturing employees dedicated to diabetes remaining with BMS to progress the diabetes portfolio and support the transition for these areas.
These arrangements will be carried out over future periods and future payments by AstraZeneca to BMS in relation to these arrangements will be expensed as incurred.
No amounts have been recognised in the initial acquisition accounting in relation to these arrangements but have been separated, at fair value, from the business combination accounting in accordance with IFRS 3.
184 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 28 Subsequent events continued The terms of the agreement partially reflect settlement of the launch and sales-related milestones under the pre-existing Onglyza and Farxiga collaboration agreements, which have been terminated in relation to the acquisition.
The expected value of those pre-existing milestones is $0.3bn and has been recognised as a separate component of consideration and excluded from the business combination accounting in accordance with IFRS 3.
Separate intangible assets will be recognised.
Goodwill of $1.6bn is underpinned by a number of elements, which individually cannot be quantified.
Most significant among these are the synergies AstraZeneca expect to be able to generate through more efficient manufacturing processes and the incremental value accessible through strategic and operational independence upon taking full control of the alliance.
The fair value of receivables acquired as part of the acquisition approximates the gross contractual amounts receivable.
There are no significant amounts which are not expected to be collected.
The results from the additional acquired interests in the diabetes alliance will be consolidated into the Companys results from 1February 2014.
If the acquisition had taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period 1 January 2013, on a pro forma basis, the revenue of the combined Group for 2013 would have been $26,700m and the profit after tax would have been $1,750m.
This pro forma information has been prepared taking into account any amortisation, interest costs and related tax effects, but does not purport to represent the results of the combined Group that actually would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on 1 January 2013 and should not be taken to be representative of future results.
Given the proximity of the completion of the transaction to the date that the Financial Statements were approved, the finalisation of the accounting entries for this transaction has yet to be completed.
Our provisional assessment of the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired, and of the fair value of the consideration payable, is detailed below.
Our assessment will be completed in 2014.
