Acquisition of businesses On the 30 January 2013 the Group acquired 88.2% of the issued share capital of Solfex Energy Systems Limited Solfex.
Solfex is a specialist distributor of renewables technology.
The Group acquired the remaining 11.8% on 31 July 2013.
On the 24 July 2013 the Group acquired 51.0% of the issued share capital of Plumbnation Limited Plumbnation.
Plumbnation is an online heating products distribution business.
The Group has options to acquire the remaining 49.0% during the period until October 2016 and consequently a financial liability of the expected value of the put option of 1.8m has been recognised.
The call option currently has no fair value.
Plumbnation will prepare its financial statements to a 30 June year end.
The Group paid 0.3m for further immaterial acquisitions during the year and made fair value adjustments on prior year acquisitions resulting in further additions to goodwill of 0.7m.
All acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
Provisional fair values ascribed to identifiable assets as at the date of acquisition are shown in the table below: Fair value acquired Property, plant and equipment 0.4 Identifiable intangible assets 2.9 Inventories 1.8 Trade and other receivables 1.6 Cash at bank 4.0 Trade and other payables 2.7 8.0 Goodwill addition during the period 6.4 14.4 Satisfied by: Cash paid 13.3 Contingent consideration 1.1 14.4 Contingent consideration payable in 2014 and 2015 is calculated by reference to a multiple of EBITDA which is dependent upon future performance and expansion of the Solfex business over the period to December 2015.
After taking into account the requirements of the purchase and sale agreement the total cash payment is expected to be 1.3m.
International Financial Reporting Standard IFRS 3 2008 requires the consideration transferred in a business combination to be measured at fair value and therefore the future cash consideration has been discounted by 0.2m.
If the actual consideration paid in the earn out years differs from the current estimate of 1.1m, then IFRS 3 2008 will require the difference to pass through the income statement.
Given any such difference will not relate to trading, we anticipate it will be shown as an exceptional item.
In addition, it is currently expected that, dependent on future profits, a further 2.1m will be paid to the previous majority shareholders of the businesses who are still employed by the Group.
As required by IFRS 3 2008, this will be treated as remuneration and charged to the income statement as it is earned.
Total revenue and operating profit for the businesses acquired for the period from acquisition, total 19.8m and 0.8m respectively.
If the acquisitions had been completed on the first day of the financial year, group revenues would have been 5,159.0m and the Groups operating profit before amortisation would have been 347.9m.
Goodwill recognised consists of the benefits from forecast growth and the assembled workforce.
None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Acquisition costs charged in administration expenses in the period to 31 December 2013 amounted to 0.4m.
The fair value of the acquired receivables is 1.6m and all acquired receivables are expected to be collected in full.
