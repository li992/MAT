Financial statements Notes on the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2013 35.
Commitments and contingencies continued Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee indebtedness of the other companies within its group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make payment under the guarantee.
The Group has a contingent liability in respect of a contractual dispute with an electricity generation counterparty.
TheGroup has contested the validity of the dispute claim by the counterparty and believes its position is robust.
However the likelihood and extent ofany potential liability is not yet known and will only be confirmed following the conclusion of the dispute process.
