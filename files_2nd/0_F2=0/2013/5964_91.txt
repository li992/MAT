These policies are designed to reduce the financial risks being faced, which primarily relate to credit, interest, liquidity and currency risks, and arise in the normal course of business.
Credit risk Financial instruments which potentially expose Fidessa to credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
At the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of customer credit risk.
The largest customer accounts for less than 5% of revenue and the 10 largest customers account for approximately 25% of revenue.
Cash equivalents are deposited only with major financial institutions that satisfy certain credit criteria as specified in Fidessas treasury policy.
The policy limits the maximum deposit with a counterparty and the maximum duration of a deposit.
Fidessa group plc 79 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 The trade receivables as at 31st December are aged as in the table below.
2013 2012 000 000 Not due 41,244 47,747 Not more than three months past due 15,566 8,800 More than three months but not more than six months past due 4,620 2,487 More than six months past due 1,855 5,750 Total trade receivables 63,285 64,784 Material trade receivable balances relate to sales transactions with financial institutions.
Credit to customers is provided in the normal course of business and the amount that appears in the balance sheet is net of an allowance for specific doubtful receivables, the allowance generally being due to concerns regarding a customers solvency or the age of a receivable.
In most situations where a receivable is aged but no specific allowance has been made for it, no revenue has been taken and it forms part of the deferred revenue balance.
Collateral is not required in respect of financial assets.
Allowances are made when the settlement of a receivable becomes doubtful and the potential exposure is not covered by a related amount in deferred revenue.
The movement in the allowance for doubtful receivables is in the table below and it reflects the stability returning to market conditions and conclusion of some earlier insolvencies.
2013 2012 000 000 Allowance for doubtful receivables at 1st January 2,690 3,399 Exchange adjustment 27 89 Allowances released in the period 3,854 2,830 New allowances made in the period 2,613 2,210 Allowance for doubtful receivables at 31st December 1,422 2,690 Liquidity risk The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities.

Fidessa group plc 80 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Interest receivable and payable Fidessa holds net funds and hence its interest risks are associated with short-term cash deposits.
The overall objective with respect to these deposits is to maintain a balance between security of the funds, accessibility of funds and competitive rates of return.
In practice, this means that deposits are unlikely to be made with a maturity date greater than three months.
All deposits are at current market rates.
There are no borrowings due to the cash reserves and strong cash generation of the business.
Foreign currency risk Fidessa operates internationally and is exposed to foreign currency risk on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and on the translation of the balance sheet and income statement of foreign operations into Sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US Dollars and Japanese Yen.
Revenue is split 50% in US Dollars, 33% in Sterling, 5% in Japanese Yen, 5% in Canadian Dollars and 7% in other currencies.
The trade debtor currency exposure is consistent with the split of revenue by currency.
In managing currency risks the aim is to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the cash inflows and outflows in a foreign currency.
There are both cash inflows and outflows in these currencies that create a high level of natural hedge.
Hedging contracts have not been entered into for cash positions denominated in foreign currencies.
Over the longer term, permanent changes in foreign exchange would have an impact on consolidation of foreign subsidiaries earnings.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in the value of Sterling against other currencies would have decreased the profit before tax by approximately 236,000 for the year ended 31st December 2013 2012: 162,000.
Capital management The Board monitors the total equity, distributable reserves and the cash and cash equivalents balance in considering its retained capital along with when and how a return of capital to shareholders is appropriate.
A strong capital base is maintained so as to provide employee, customer, market, investor and creditor confidence in the business and to ensure that it continues to operate as a going concern.
Fidessa has strong cash generation due to being consistently profitable and non-acquisitive in nature.
The annual dividend has a pay-out ratio of approximately 45% which provides a reasonable return to shareholders whilst also providing funds for potential acquisitions and replenishing the cash balance.
However, in the absence of acquisitions, Fidessa has a track record of returning the additional cash to shareholders in the form of special dividends.
Fair values Unless otherwise disclosed, there is no significant difference between the carrying values shown in the balance sheet and the fair values of the financial instruments.
For current trade and other receivables and payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the amortised cost is deemed to reflect the fair value.
Fidessa does not have any derivative financial instruments and therefore no analysis is required in respect of financial instruments not measured at fair value.
