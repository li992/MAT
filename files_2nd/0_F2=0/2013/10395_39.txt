A sensitivity analysis has been performed and Management has concluded that no reasonably foreseeable change in the key assumptions would result in an impairment of the goodwill of any of the CGUs.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent one year financial budgets approved by the Board, extrapolated for four future years by a growth rate applicable to each unit with a terminal value using a 2% inflationary growth rate assumption.
The pre-tax rates used to discount the forecast cash flows from CGUs range from 8.2% to 8.6% 2012: 8.5% to 9.0% and are derived from the Companys post-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital, which was 6.8% 2012: 7.0% at 31 March 2013, and adjusted for the risks specific to the market in which the CGU operates.
All CGUs have the same access to the groups Treasury functions and borrowing lines to fund their operations.
