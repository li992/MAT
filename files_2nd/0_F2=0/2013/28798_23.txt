com 110 Report and Accounts December 2013 RIT Capital Partners plc Warning to Shareholders From time-to-time investment companies and their shareholders can be the subject of investment scams.
The perpetrators obtain lists of shareholders and make unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters, typically from overseas.
They may offer to sell worthless or high risk shares or, in the case of your RIT Capital Partners plc stock, may offer to buy your current shareholdings at an unrealistic price.
They will often also inform you of untrue scenarios to make you think that you need to sell your shares or to justify an offer that seems too good to be true.
