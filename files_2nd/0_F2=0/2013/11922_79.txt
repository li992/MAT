Through consultation, the committee received feedback from three institutional shareholders who between them accounted for one-third of the votes against to understand better why these shareholders voted against the resolution.
The committee subsequently discussed this at their July 2013 meeting.
In the light of the feedback, the committee concluded at that time that, notwithstanding any issues arising out of its regular review of executive remuneration policy, there was nothing fundamental or structural within our existing arrangements to cause particular concern to shareholders.
As in previous years and required by law, details of the voting on all resolutions at the 2014 AGM will be announced via the RNS and posted on the Pearson website following the AGM.
