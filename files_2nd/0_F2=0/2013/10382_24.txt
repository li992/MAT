The Group had six share schemes, all of which are equity-settled, in operation during the period.
The vesting of all awards or options is generally dependent upon participants remaining in the employment of a participating company during the vesting period.
Details of schemes in operation during the period are shown below: Sharesave Plan The Sharesave Plan is an HMRC approved savings scheme, whereby the proceeds from a savings contract, of either three or five years duration, may be used to purchase shares under option providing the employee remains in employment until the contract matures.
Options are typically granted in June or July of each year, at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares at the date of invitation.
There are no performance conditions.
The scheme is open to all UK employees provided that they have at least 12 months service at the date of invitation.
The vesting period is 39 months or 63 months and options may be exercised up to six months after the vesting date.
Share Incentive Plan The Share Incentive Plan is an HMRC approved savings scheme open to all UK employees with at least 12 months service at the date of invitation.
The plan awards free shares to participating employees up to a maximum award of 3,000 per employee per year, with individual value being pro-rated on salary.
There are no performance conditions other than remaining in employment for two years from the date of award: hence there is a vesting period of two years from the award date.
Shares are generally held in the Share Incentive Plan Trust for at least three years and are capable of being released to participants at any time thereafter.
Short Term Deferred Incentive Plan Under the Short Term Deferred Incentive Plan the annual bonuses of the Executive Directors and other eligible employees may be deferred into Mitchells & Butlers plc shares.
At the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, at least 50% of the annual bonus for the Executive Directors and any excess over 75% of base salary earned in the year for the other eligible employees, will normally be deferred and released in equal tranches 12 and 24 months after deferral.
Participants may receive Dividend Accrued Shares on vesting equal to the value of the ordinary dividends that would have been paid on the vested shares during the performance period.
If a participant leaves the employment of the Group before the Release Dates, then in certain circumstances they may lose entitlement to Bonus Shares and Dividend Accrued Shares.
All deferrals of bonuses into shares to date have been entirely at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 79 Notes to the financial statements For the 52 weeks ended 28 September 2013 continued 7.
Share-based payments continued Performance Restricted Share Plan The Performance Restricted Share Plan PRSP allows Executive Directors and other eligible employees to receive nominal cost options, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions, set by the Remuneration Committee, which are normally measured over a three year period.
Vesting is conditional upon the achievement of a Total Shareholder Return TSR performance condition and an adjusted earnings per share growth performance condition.
In respect of the TSR performance condition, Monte Carlo simulations incorporate the market condition in the measurement of the fair value, based on an index of competitors.
Participants will be entitled to receive Dividend Accrued Shares on vesting equal to the value of the ordinary dividends that would have been paid on the vested shares during the performance period.
Executive Share Option Plan The grant of options under the Executive Share Option Plan was discontinued following shareholder approval of changes to Executive Director remuneration in 2006.
The vesting period for these options is three years from grant, followed by a seven year exercise period.
The latest possible exercise date for any of these options outstanding at 28 September 2013, is 24 May 2015.
Long-Term Incentive Plan An award was made under the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP on 30 July 2010 with participants receiving a conditional right to receive Mitchells & Butlers plc shares with a value determined by their percentage of the LTIP pool.
Overall vesting of awards was dependent upon the achievement of an adjusted earnings per share underpin whereby the award would be capable of vesting only if adjusted EPS growth from financial year 2010 to 2013 was at least equal to RPI plus 12 percentage points.
If the EPS condition was not met no awards would vest.
During 2012 the Directors believed that it was unlikely that the performance condition would be achieved and a provision of 3.2m was released.
This award was subsequently cancelled without payment.
The Group has used separate option pricing models and assumptions for each plan.
The following tables set out weighted average information about how the fair value of each option grant was calculated: Performance Restricted Sharesave 2013 Share Plan Plan Valuation model Monte Carlo and Binomial Black-Scholes Weighted average share price 349.7p 370.9p a Exercise price 309.0p b Expected dividend yield Risk-free interest rate 0.97% 1.03% c Volatility 3.4% 31.4% d Expected life years 2.60 3.94 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan Sharesave Plan Valuation model Monte Carlo Black-Scholes Weighted average share price 264.8p 249.0p Exercise price 182.0p b Expected dividend yield 2.00% 2.00% Risk-free interest rate 0.73% 0.58% c Volatility 33.0% 36.2% d Expected life years 3.72 3.95 a.
The exercise price for the Performance Restricted Share Plan is 1 per participating employee.
The expected dividend yield for the Sharesave Plan and LTIP has used historical dividend information.
For details on the Groups current dividend policy refer to the Financial review on page 34.
The expected dividend yield for the Performance Restricted Share Plan options is zero as participants are entitled to Dividend Accrued Shares to the value of ordinary dividends paid during the vesting period.
c. The expected volatility is determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price commensurate with the expected term of the options and share awards.
d. The expected life of the options represents the average length of time between grant date and exercise date.
The fair value of awards under the Short Term Deferred Incentive Plan and the Share Incentive Plan are equal to the share price on the date of award as there is no price to be paid and employees are entitled to Dividend Accrued Shares.
The assumptions set out above are therefore not relevant to these schemes.

Pensions Background Retirement and death benefits are provided for eligible employees in the United Kingdom principally by the Mitchells & Butlers Pension Plan MABPP and the Mitchells & Butlers Executive Pension Plan MABEPP.
These plans are funded, HMRC approved, occupational pension schemes with defined contribution and defined benefit sections.
The defined benefit sections of the plans closed to new entrants during 2002 with new members provided with defined contribution arrangements.
On 13 March 2011, the defined benefit plan closed to future accrual.
At the same time Mitchells & Butlers plc implemented a revised defined contribution benefit structure.
The defined benefit liability relates to these funded plans, together with an unfunded unapproved pension arrangement the Executive Top-Up Scheme, or MABETUS in respect of certain MABEPP members.
The assets of the plans are held in self-administered trust funds separate from the Companys assets.
In addition, from 1 January 2013 Mitchells & Butlers plc implemented a workplace pension plan in line with the Workplace Pensions Reform Regulations.
This automatically enrols all eligible workers into a Qualifying Workplace Pension Plan.
Restatement in relation to IFRIC 14 and minimum funding requirements Following recent guidance from the FRRP regarding the treatment of a schedule of contributions in relation to a minimum funding requirement under IFRIC 14, the Group has reconsidered the appropriate accounting treatment for its pension funding obligations.
As a result the Group now includes the schedule of contributions within the overall pension liability recorded at the period end.
Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 82 Company overview 01 05 Strategic and business review 07 34 Governance 35 64 Financial statements 65 106 Shareholder information 107 108 The Group has restated the comparative amounts for the periods ended 29 September 2012 and 24 September 2011 which has the impact of increasing the pension liability by 188m and 266m respectively: increasing the deferred tax asset by 43m and 66m: and reducing brought forward retained earnings through a reduction in other comprehensive income by the net amount of 145m and 200m.

Scheme assets are stated at market value at 28 September 2013 and the liabilities of the schemes have been assessed as at the same date using the projected unit method.
IAS 19 requires that the scheme liabilities are discounted using market yields at the end of the period on high quality corporate bonds see discount rate assumption in the table below.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries.
Principal financial assumptions The principal financial assumptions adopted following the advice of independent qualified actuaries at the balance sheet date were: 2013 2012 Pensions increases 3.3% 2.8% Discount rate 4.4% 4.3% Inflation rate 3.4% 2.8% The discount rate applied to the pension schemes liabilities is a significant driver of the net balance sheet valuation of the schemes and is subject to a high degree of judgement and complexity.
It is estimated that a 0.1% increase or decrease in the discount rate used would, in isolation, reduce or increase the actuarial deficit by approximately 34m 2012 32m, 2011 26m, with no material impact on the income statement charge.
A similar increase or decrease of 0.1% in the inflation rate would, in isolation, increase or reduce the actuarial deficit by approximately 30m 2012 30m, 2011 24m.
Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 83 Notes to the financial statements For the 52 weeks ended 28 September 2013 continued 8.
Pensions continued Mortality assumptions The mortality assumptions were reviewed following the full actuarial valuation in March 2010 and are based on the S1NA mortality tables for the MABPP and S1NA light tables for the MABEPP.
An allowance was made for medium cohort projection with a 1% underpin.
Ages are rated up by one year for pensioners of the MABPP and rated down by two years for all members of the MABEPP.
Assumptions are consistent across both the current and previous period.
A summary of the average life expectancies assumed is as follows: 2013 2012 Executive Executive Main plan plan Main plan plan years years years years Male member aged 65 current life expectancy 20.3 24.6 20.3 24.6 Male member aged 45 life expectancy at 65 23.0 26.4 23.0 26.4 Female member aged 65 current life expectancy 23.1 26.0 23.1 26.0 Female member aged 45 life expectancy at 65 25.8 28.0 25.8 28.0 Amounts recognised in respect of defined benefit schemes The long-term rates of return on assets at 28 September 2013 shown below form the basis of the calculation of the expected return on pension scheme assets for the 2014 financial year.
The 2012 rates shown are used in calculating the 2013 expected return.
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class is weighted based on the asset allocation, to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio, resulting in a weighted average assumption of 4.2% 2012 4.5%, 2011 5.2%.
The actual investment return achieved on the scheme assets over the period was 9.2% 2012 11.2%, 2011 5.8%, which represented a gain of 145m 2012 162m, 2011 79m.
The combined assets of the MABPP and MABEPP, their expected rates of return and the value of the pension scheme assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date can be summarised as follows: 2013 2012 2011 Long-term Long-term Long-term rates rates rates of return of return of return a a expected Value expected Value expected Value % m % m % m Equities 7.4 545 6.9 488 6.9 420 Bonds 3.6 1,120 3.2 1,058 3.7 999 Other 5.0 67 4.9 64 5.5 53 Fair value of assets 1,732 1,610 1,472 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,849 1,698 1,509 Actuarial deficit in the schemes 117 88 37 Additional liability recognised due to minimum funding requirements 131 188 266 Total pension liability 248 276 303 Associated deferred tax asset 50 63 75 a.

Before movement in pension liability recognised due to minimum funding requirements.
The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised since 26 September 2004 in the Group statement of comprehensive income is a 251m loss 2012 186m loss, 2011 105m loss.
The Directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS and taken directly to equity is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the schemes.
Consequently, the Directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income before 26 September 2004.
Funding valuation and future funding obligations The results of the 2010 actuarial valuation showed a funding deficit of 400m, using a more prudent basis to discount the scheme liabilities than is required by IAS 19 and on 21 July 2010 the Company formally agreed a 10 year recovery plan with the Trustees to close the funding deficit in respect of its pension scheme liabilities.
The result of this was that the Group agreed to increase additional contributions from 24m to 40m per annum, commencing from 1 April 2010, in each of the financial years to 2019 and 20m in financial year 2020.
This agreement is subject to review following completion of the current ongoing actuarial valuation which commenced in March 2013.
The Group has therefore continued to make additional contributions of 40m per annum during the current period.
In the 52 weeks ended 28 September 2013 the Group paid 5m 2012 5m in respect of the defined contribution arrangements, with nil 2012 nil outstanding as at the period end.
At 28 September 2013 the MABPP owed 1m 2012 2m to the Group in respect of expenses paid on its behalf.
This amount is included in other receivables in note 16.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share EPS has been calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the period by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding own shares held in treasury and by employee share trusts.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share amounts are presented before exceptional items and other adjustments and the net pensions finance charge see note 9 in order to allow a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.

The impact of the property revaluation is a net book value increase of 48m 2012 decrease of 25m comprising an impairment of 12m 2012 35m net of a revaluation reserve credit of 60m 2012 10m shown in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
In addition, a review of the short leasehold and unlicensed property estate has resulted in an impairment of 17m 2012 12m see note 9.
Certain assets with a net book value of 37m 2012 33m owned by the Group are subject to a fixed charge in respect of liabilities held by the Mitchells & Butlers Executive Top-Up Scheme MABETUS.
Properties A policy of valuing the majority of the Groups freehold and long leasehold licensed properties, for accounting purposes, was adopted on 29 September 2007.
Short leasehold properties, unlicensed properties and fixtures, fittings and equipment are held at cost less depreciation and impairment.
The Group accounts for long leasehold land as an operating lease.
The freehold and long leasehold properties have been valued at market value, as at 28 September 2013 using information provided by CBRE, independent chartered surveyors.
The valuation was carried out in accordance with the provisions of RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards The Red Book assuming each asset is sold as part of the continuing enterprise in occupation individually as a fully operational trading entity.
The market value has been determined having regard to factors such as current and future projected income levels, taking account of location, quality of the pub restaurant and recent market transactions in the sector.
Changes in these assumptions such as the valuation basis applied in comparable market transactions, or the income level generated by a pub could materially impact the valuation of the freehold and long leasehold properties.
It is estimated that a 1 change in the EBITDA of the freehold and long leasehold properties would generate approximately an 8 movement in their valuation.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment which are not revalued to fair market value are reviewed on an outlet basis for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Included within property, plant and equipment are assets with a net book value of 3,569m 2012 3,541m, which are pledged as security for the securitisation debt and over which there are certain restrictions on title.
Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 89 Notes to the financial statements For the 52 weeks ended 28 September 2013 continued 14.
Property, plant and equipment continued a Net book value The split of the net book value of land and buildings is as follows: 2013 2012 2011 m m m Freehold 3,047 2,984 2,967 Long leasehold 263 253 260 Short leasehold 96 107 108 Total land and buildings net book value 3,406 3,344 3,335 a.
The carrying value of freehold and long leasehold land and buildings based on their historical cost or deemed cost at transition to IFRS is 2,068m and 167m respectively 2012 2,070m and 166m.
In addition to the above, premiums paid on acquiring a new lease are classified separately in the balance sheet.

All amounts fall due within one year.
Trade and other receivables are non-interest bearing and are classified as loans and receivables and are therefore held at amortised cost.
Trade and other receivables past due and not impaired are immaterial and therefore no further analysis is presented.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximately equates to their face value.

Non-current other payables comprise an amount held in respect of the Groups gaming machine VAT claim.
A decision was released during 2010 in respect of Rank plcs gaming claim and this ruling fell in the taxpayers favour.
As a result, the Group was able to further pursue its own gaming claim which was submitted in April 2006.
HMRC agreed to make a repayment of the existing claim, subject to the Group providing a guarantee to HMRC that, in the event that the existing decision is overturned in a higher court, the amount will be repayable in full.
The Rank case was appealed by HMRC to the European Court of Justice ECJ in 2011 however, no final decision was reached on gaming and the case was referred back to the UK Upper Tribunal.
The case is progressing through the UK courts and was heard in the Court of Appeal in May 2013.
The decision in this case was released on 30 October 2013 and found in favour of HMRC.
Rank has subsequently requested to appeal to the Supreme Court which has now been refused by the Court of Appeal.
It is expected that Rank will now appeal directly to the Supreme Court.
The Group continues to hold the original repayment amount of 12m as a liability as under the guarantee provided to HMRC in 2010 this amount could now be repayable in full.
Current trade and other payables are non-interest bearing.

c. A3N notes are US$ notes which are shown as translated to sterling at the hedged swap rate.
Values at the period end spot rate are 231m 2012 242m.
The notes are secured on the majority of the Groups property and future income streams therefrom.
All of the floating rate notes are hedged using interest rate swaps which fix the interest rate payable.
Interest and margin is payable on the floating rate notes as follows: Tranche Interest Margin A1N 3 month LIBOR 0.45% A3N 3 month US$ LIBOR 0.45% a A4 3 month LIBOR 0.58% a AB 3 month LIBOR 0.60% a C2 3 month LIBOR 1.88% a D1 3 month LIBOR 2.13% a.
The margin on the A4, AB, C2 and D1 notes increased in line with the agreed step-up on the note payment date in September 2013.
The overall cash interest rate payable on the loan notes is 6.1% 2012 5.9% after taking account of interest rate hedging and the cost of the provision of a financial guarantee provided by Ambac in respect of the Class A and AB notes.
Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 91 Notes to the financial statements For the 52 weeks ended 28 September 2013 continued 18.
Borrowings continued The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited, the Groups main operating subsidiary.
These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions on its ability to move cash, by way of dividends for example, to other Group companies.
At 28 September 2013, Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited had cash and cash equivalents of 99m 2012 133m which were governed by the covenants associated with the securitisation.
Of this amount 43m 2012 42m, representing disposal proceeds, was held on deposit in an account over which there are a number of restrictions.
The use of this cash requires the approval of the securitisation trustee and may only be used for certain specified purposes such as capital enhancement expenditure and business acquisitions.
The carrying value of the securitised debt in the Group balance sheet is analysed as follows: 2013 2012 m m Principal outstanding at beginning of period 2,192 2,255 Principal repaid during the period 55 52 Exchange on translation of dollar loan notes 11 Principal outstanding at end of period 2,137 2,192 Deferred issue costs 9 10 Accrued interest 4 4 Carrying value at end of period 2,132 2,186 Undrawn committed borrowing facilities The Group holds an undrawn 295m 2012 295m liquidity facility against the securitised arrangements, sized to cover 18 months debt service, which is not available for any other purpose.
This facility will expire on 29 August 2014.
Financial instruments Financial risk management Financial risk is managed by the Groups Treasury function.
The Groups Treasury function is governed by a Board Treasury Policy Statement which details the key objectives and policies for the Groups treasury management.
The Treasury Committee ensures that the Treasury Policy is adhered to, monitors its operation and agrees appropriate strategies for recommendation to the Board.
The Treasury Policy Statement is reviewed annually, with recommendations for change made to the Board, as appropriate.
The Group Treasury function is operated as a cost centre and is the only area of the business permitted to transact treasury deals.
It must also be consulted on other related matters such as the provision of guarantees or the financial implications of contract terms.
An explanation of the Groups financial instrument risk management objectives and strategies is set out below.
The main financial risks which impact the Group result from funding and liquidity risk, credit risk, capital risk and market risk, principally as a result of changes in interest and currency rates.
Derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate and foreign currency swaps, are used to manage market risk.
Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes.
Funding and liquidity risk In order to ensure that the Groups long-term funding strategy is aligned with its strategic objectives, the Treasury Committee regularly assesses the maturity profile of the Groups debt, alongside the prevailing financial projections.
This enables it to ensure that funding levels are appropriate to support the Groups plans.
The current funding arrangements of the Group consist of the securitised notes issued by Mitchells & Butlers Finance plc and associated liquidity facility.
The terms of the securitisation contain a number of financial covenants.
Compliance with these covenants is monitored by Group Treasury.
The Group prepares a rolling daily cash forecast covering a six week period and an annual cash forecast by period.
These forecasts are reviewed on a daily basis and are used to manage the investment and borrowing requirements of the Group.
A combination of cash pooling and zero balancing agreements are in place to ensure the optimum liquidity position is maintained.
The Group maintains sufficient cash balances or committed facilities outside the securitisation to ensure that it can meet its medium-term anticipated cash flow requirements.
The maturity table below details the contractual undiscounted cash flows both principal and interest for the Groups financial liabilities, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps.
Trade and other payables note 17 are short-term and excluded from the table.
Assumes no early redemption in respect of any loan notes.
Includes the impact of the cash flow hedges.
Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 92 Company overview 01 05 Strategic and business review 07 34 Governance 35 64 Financial statements 65 106 Shareholder information 107 108 Credit risk The Group Treasury function enters into contracts with third parties in respect of derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes and the investment of surplus funds.
These activities expose the Group to credit risk against the counterparties.
To mitigate this exposure, Group Treasury operates policies that restrict the investment of surplus funds and the entering into of derivative transactions to counterparties that have a minimum credit rating of A long-term and A1 P1 F1 short-term.
Counterparties may also be required to post collateral with the Group, where their credit rating falls below a predetermined level.
An amount of 13m 2012 7m of collateral was posted by a swap counterparty within the securitisation as at 28 September 2013.
The amount that can be invested or transacted at various ratings levels is restricted under the policy.
To minimise credit risk exposure against individual counterparties, investments and derivative transactions are entered into with a range of counterparties.
The Group Treasury function reviews credit ratings, as published by Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings, current exposure levels and the maximum permitted exposure at given credit ratings, for each counterparty on a daily basis.
Any exceptions are required to be formally reported to the Treasury Committee on a four-weekly basis.
Included in other receivables are amounts due from certain Group suppliers.
Included in trade and other payables at the period end are amounts due to some of these suppliers.
This reduces the Groups credit exposure.
The Groups credit exposure at the balance sheet date was: 2013 2012 m m a Cash and cash equivalents 340 311 Other cash deposits 25 25 Trade receivables 2 1 Other receivables 21 22 a Derivatives 5 4 a.
As disclosed in notes 16 and 17, the Group has 13m 2012 7m of cash collateral which is not included in this balance.
Capital management The Groups capital base is comprised of its net debt analysed in note 26 plus total equity disclosed on the face of the Group balance sheet.
The objective is to maintain a capital base which is sufficiently strong to support the ongoing development of the business as a going concern, including the amenity and cash flow generation of the pub estate.
By keeping debt see also Funding and liquidity risk above and headroom against its debt facilities at an appropriate level, the Group ensures that it maintains a strong credit position, whilst maximising value for shareholders and adhering to its covenants and other restrictions associated with its debt see note 18.
In managing its capital structure, from time to time the Group may realise value from non-core assets, buy back or issue new shares, initiate and vary its dividend payments and seek to vary or accelerate debt repayments.
The Groups policy is to ensure that the maturity of its debt profile supports its strategic objectives.
The Board considers the latest covenant compliance, headroom projections and projected balance sheet positions at each of its meetings, based on the advice of the Treasury Committee which meets on a four-weekly basis.
The Treasury Committee is chaired by the Group Treasurer and monitors Treasury performance and compliance with Board-approved policies.
The Group Finance Director is also a member of the Committee.
Total capital at the balance sheet date is as follows: 2013 2012 2011 m m m Net debt note 26 1,759 1,841 1,870 Total equity 1,219 943 892 Total capital 2,978 2,784 2,762 Market risk The Group is exposed to the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of its financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises foreign currency and interest rate risk.
Foreign currency risk The Group faces currency risk in two main areas: At issuance of the Class A3N floating rate notes, the Group entered into a cross currency interest rate swap to manage the foreign currency exposure resulting from both the US$ principal and initial interest elements of the notes.
The A3N notes form part of the securitised debt see note 18.
Further to the step-up on the A3N notes on 15 December 2010, the Group has additional foreign currency exposure as a result of the increase in US$ finance costs.
A movement of 10% in the US$ exchange rate would have nil 2012 nil impact on the reported Group profit and 5m 2012 4m impact on the reported Group net assets.
The Group has no significant profit and loss exposure as a result of retranslating monetary assets and liabilities at different exchange rates.
As the Group is predominantly UK based and acquires the majority of its supplies in sterling, it has no significant direct currency exposure from its operations.
Interest rate risk The Group has a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate debt instruments and manages the variability in cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates by using derivative financial instruments.
Where the necessary criteria are met, the Group minimises the volatility in its financial statements through the adoption of the hedge accounting provisions permitted under IAS 39.
The interest rate exposure resulting from the Groups 2.1bn securitisation is largely fixed, either as a result of the notes themselves being issued at fixed interest rates, or through a combination of floating rate notes against which effective interest rate swaps are held, which are eligible for hedge accounting.

c. The impact on total equity from movements in the fair value of cash flow hedges see below.
Derivative financial instruments Cash flow hedges Changes in cash flow hedge fair values are recognised in the hedging reserve in equity to the extent that the hedges are effective.
The cash flow hedges detailed below have been assessed as being highly effective during the period and are expected to remain highly effective over the remaining contract lives.
During the period a gain of 53m 2012 loss of 103m on cash flow hedges was recognised in equity.
A loss of 47m 2012 54m was recycled from equity and included in the Group income statement for the period.
Cash flow hedges securitised borrowings At 28 September 2013, the Group held 10 2012 10 interest rate swap contracts with a nominal value of 1,056m 2012 1,075m, designated as a hedge of the cash flow interest rate risk of 1,056m 2012 1,075m of the Groups floating rate borrowings, comprising the A1N, A3N, A4, AB, C2 and D1 loan notes.
The cash flows on these contracts occur quarterly, receiving a floating rate of interest based on LIBOR and paying a fixed rate of 4.8805% 2012 4.8856%.
The contract maturity dates match those of the hedged item.
The 10 interest rate swaps above are held on the balance sheet at fair market value, which is a liability of 228m 2012 325m.
At 28 September 2013 the Group held one 2012 one cross currency interest rate swap contract, with a nominal value of 223m 2012 233m, designated as a hedge of the cash flow interest rate and currency risk of the Groups A3N floating rate $373m 2012 $390m borrowings.
The cross currency interest rate swap is held on the balance sheet at a fair value asset of 5m 2012 4m.
The cash flows on this contract occur quarterly, receiving a floating rate of interest based on US$ LIBOR and paying a floating rate of interest at LIBOR in sterling.
The fair values of the derivative financial instruments were measured at 28 September 2013 and may be subject to material movements in the period subsequent to the balance sheet date.
The fair values of the derivative financial instruments are reflected on the balance sheet as follows: Derivative financial instruments fair value Non-current Current Current Non-current assets assets liabilities liabilities Total m m m m m Cash flow hedges: Interest rate swaps 46 182 228 Cross currency swap 5 5 28 September 2013 5 46 182 223 29 September 2012 4 45 280 321 24 September 2011 18 44 235 261 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 94 Company overview 01 05 Strategic and business review 07 34 Governance 35 64 Financial statements 65 106 Shareholder information 107 108 The fair value and carrying value of financial assets and liabilities by category is as follows: 2013 2012 Book Fair Book Fair value value value value m m m m Financial assets: Cash 365 365 336 336 Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships 5 5 4 4 Loans and receivables 23 23 23 23 Financial liabilities: Amortised cost 2,132 2,073 2,186 1,927 Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships 228 228 325 325 Other 166 166 177 177 2,133 2,074 2,325 2,066 The various tranches of the securitised debt have been valued using period end quoted offer prices.
As the securitised debt is traded on an active market, the market value represents the fair value of this debt.
The fair value of interest rate and currency swaps is the estimated amount which the Group could expect to pay or receive on termination of the agreements.
These amounts are based on quotations from counterparties which approximate to their fair market value and take into consideration interest and exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Other financial assets and liabilities are either short-term in nature or their book values approximate to fair values.
Fair value of financial instruments The Groups financial instruments are all categorised as level 2 as defined under IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.

A deferred tax asset has not been recognised on tax losses with a value of 1m 2012 1m because it is not certain that future taxable profits will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefit.
These tax losses can be carried forward indefinitely.

Employee share trusts The Company has established two employee share trusts: Share Incentive Plan SIP Trust The SIP Trust was established in 2003 to purchase shares on behalf of employees participating in the Companys Share Incentive Plan.
Under this scheme, eligible employees are awarded free shares which are normally held in trust for a holding period of at least three years.
After five years the shares may be transferred to or sold by the employee free of income tax and national insurance contributions.
The SIP Trust buys the shares in the market or subscribes for newly issued shares with funds provided by the Company.
During the holding period, dividends are paid directly to the participating employees.
At 28 September 2013, the trustees, Equiniti Share Plan Trustees Limited, held 1,592,802 2012 1,584,896 shares in the Company.

Its ability to distribute these reserves by way of dividends is restricted by the securitisation covenants see note 18.
Share premium account The share premium account represents amounts received in excess of the nominal value of shares on issue of new shares.
Capital redemption reserve The capital redemption reserve movement arose on the repurchase and cancellation by the Company of ordinary shares during prior periods.
Revaluation reserve The revaluation reserve represents the unrealised gain generated on revaluation of the property estate with effect from 29 September 2007.
It comprises the excess of the fair value of the estate over deemed cost, net of related deferred taxation.
