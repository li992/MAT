To facilitate the Admission, the entire issued share capital of HellermannTyton Alpha S.. r. l. was acquired by the Company.
Prior to this restructuring, the business was conducted solely through HellermannTyton Alpha S.. r. l. and its subsidiaries.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable UK Accounting Standards, and under the historical cost convention.
Under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare its own profit and loss account.
The Companys loss for the year before tax is 539,000.
The principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently throughout the year, are set out below.
Investments Investments are held at cost less provision for impairment where a permanent diminution in value has been identified.
Foreign currencies The Company has chosen to present the financial statements in Euros.
The functional currency of the Company is the Euro.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are measured in terms of historical costs using the exchange rate at the date of the initial transactions.
Share based payments The Company operates a number of equity settled share based compensation plans and has applied the requirements of IFRS 2, Share based payments.
Grants of shares to employees are measured at fair value at the grant date and expensed over the relevant vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimates with a corresponding adjustment to reserves.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiary undertakings, these awards are accounted for by the Company as an additional investment in its subsidiary.
Other debtors Other debtors are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
Pension contributions The Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme for employees.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company.
The annual contributions payable are charged to the profit and loss account.
Taxation Deferred taxation is provided on an undiscounted basis on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
Amounts provided are calculated with reference to tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Dividends Final dividends proposed by the Board and unpaid at the year end are not recognised in the financial statements until they have been approved by the shareholders at the AGM.
Interim dividends are recognised in the period that they are paid.
