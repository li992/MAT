Dividends continued 114 The Company is proposing a final dividend of 21.0p in respect of the year ended 31 December 2013.
Adjusted dividend cover of 3.3x 2012: 3.6x is calculated by dividing adjusted earnings per share note 11 of 103.6p 2012 restated : 90.6p by the total dividend for the year of 31.0p 2012: 25.0p.
There are no income tax consequences in respect of the dividends declared, but not recognised in the financial statements.
The dividends declared for 2013 at 31 December 2013 and for 2012 at 31 December 2012 were as follows: 2013 2012 Pence Pence Interim paid 10.0 8.0 Final proposed 21.0 17.0 Total dividend for the year 31.0 25.0 The anticipated cash payment in respect of the proposed final dividend is 51.1m 2012: 40.7m.

The Company has no goodwill.
Cash Generating Units The Directors consider that each branch in the Group is an individual Cash Generating Unit CGU.
Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives have been allocated and monitored for impairment testing purposes to groups of individual CGUs within the same brand.
The following analyses goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives by CGU grouping.
Goodwill continued 115 measuring Recoverable Amounts The Group tests goodwill and other non-monetary assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that impairment may have occurred.
The recoverable amounts of the goodwill and other non-monetary assets with indefinite useful lives are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and like-for-like market volume changes which impact sales and therefore cash flow projections.
management estimates pre-tax discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU groupings that are not reflected in the cash flow projections.
At the beginning and end of the financial year the recoverable amount of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives in all segments was in excess of their book value.
In the absence of a binding agreement to sell the assets and active reference market on which fair value can be determined the recoverable amount of the goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives was determined according to value in use.
The Directors calculations have shown that no impairments have occurred.
The key variables applied to the value in use calculations were: Cash flow forecasts, which were derived from the most recent board approved five-year strategic plans The sales market volume assumptions underlying the cash flow forecasts are the Directors estimates of likely future changes based on historic performance excluding future investment and enhancements and the current outlook for both the UK economy and the UK building materials industry.
This is viewed as the key operating assumption because the state of the building materials market determines the Directors approach to margin and cost maintenance A risk adjusted pre-tax discount rate is calculated by reference to the weighted average cost of capital WACC of the Group.
For 2013, the discount rate was 9.7% 2012: 8.8%, which is not significantly different for any individual CGU or CGU grouping.
That is because each CGU operates in the same market, selling the same product types therefore the risk profiles are not dissimilar For 2013, cash flows beyond the five-year plan 2019 and beyond have been determined using a growth rate of 2.1%, which is the average long-term forecast GDP growth outlined in the Economic and Fiscal Outlook report produced by the Office for Budget Responsibility in December 2013.
The Directors believe this is the most appropriate indicator of long-term growth rates that is available 2012 growth rate: 2.1% Sensitivity of results to changes in assumptions Whilst management believe the assumptions are realistic, it is possible that an impairment would be identified if any of the above key assumptions were changed significantly.
For instance factors which could cause an impairment are: Significant underperformance relative to the forecast results Changes to the way the assets are used or changes to the strategy for the business A deterioration in the UK economy The impairment review calculations are based upon anticipated discounted future cash flows.
For most of the CGU groupings, given the prudence already built into the Groups five-year plans and the level of headroom they show, the Directors do not envisage reasonably possible changes to the key operating assumptions that are sufficient to generate a different outcome to the impairment calculations undertaken.
However, for the CGU groupings listed in the table below this is not the case as the Directors consider that reasonably possible changes in key assumptions could result in discounted future cash flows being insufficient to allow full recovery of the carrying value of the CGUs goodwill and other intangible assets.
The Directors have conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine the specific value for each assumption, all other assumptions remaining the same, that would result in the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets equalling their recoverable amounts and these are shown in the tables below.
