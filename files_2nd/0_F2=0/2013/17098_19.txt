The Group has incurred overseas tax losses which, subject to any local restrictions, can be carried forward and offset against future taxable profits in the companies in which they arose.
The Group carries out an annual assessment of the recoverability of these losses and does not think it appropriate at this stage to recognise any deferred tax assets.
If the Group were to recognise these deferred tax assets in their entirety, profits would increase by 6.8m 2012: 5.1m.
The Group considers that receipts of unremitted earnings from overseas entities would be exempt from UK tax and therefore the temporary difference in relation to unremitted earnings is nil.
Tax relief on total interest capitalised amounts to 0.7m 2012: 0.8m.
Factors affecting the tax charge for future years The Finance Act 2012 reduced the main rate of UK corporation tax to 24% from 1 April 2012 and to 23% from 1 April 2013.
The effect of the new rate is to reduce the deferred tax provision by a net 8.9m, comprising a credit of 16.8m to the Consolidated income statement, a charge of 9.0m to the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, and a reserves movement of 1.1m.
In his budget of 20 March 2013, the Chancellor of the Exchequer confirmed the planned additional reduction in the rate of UK corporation tax to 21% from 1 April 2014 and announced a further reduction to 20% from 1 April 2015.
These changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and consequently are not included in these consolidated financial statements.
The effect of these proposed reductions would be to reduce the net deferred tax liability by 12.3m.

The diluted earnings per share figures allow for the dilutive effect of the conversion into ordinary shares of the weighted average number of options outstanding during the period.
Where the average share price for the year is lower than the option price the options become antidilutive and are excluded from the calculation.
The number of such options was nil 2012: nil.

The Hotels & Restaurants CGU and the Costa CGU are also operating segments and represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
There has been a small addition in the year, 0.7m, for the Costa CGU which relates to Coffeeheaven Poland, which acquired seven cafs operated by the Costa franchise partner, ECoffee in Poland, on 15 May 2012.
The brand intangible asset arose with the acquisition of Coffeeheaven in 2009 10.
It is being amortised over a period of 15 years.
The customer relationships asset arose with the acquisition of Coffee Nation in a previous financial year.
IT software and technology has been assessed as having finite lives and will be amortised under the straightline method over periods ranging from three to ten years from the date it became fully operational.
Other intangibles Other intangibles comprise Costa overseas trading licences and Costa Express operating rights agreements.
The trading licences, which have a carrying value of 1.8m 2012: 1.8m, are deemed to have an infinite life as there is no time limit associated with them.
The operating rights agreements are being amortised over periods of six years and ten years and have a carrying value of 2.3m 2012: nil.
The balance of 0.4m 2012: 0.4m relates to territory fees which are being amortised over 20 years.

These developments are dependant on the outcome of future events such as the granting of planning permission, and consequently do not represent a binding capital commitment at the yearend.
The directors consider that developments likely to proceed as planned will result in further capital investment of 177.5m over the next five years 2012: 179.3m.
Capitalised interest Interest capitalised during the year amounted to 2.7m, using an average rate of 4.5% 2011 12: 3.1m, using an average rate of 5.4%.
Assets held for sale During the year, certain property assets with a net book value of 2.1m 2011 12: nil were transferred to assets held for sale.
Property assets sold during the year had a net book value of 0.6m 2011 12: 3.4m, and five trading sites with a combined net book value of 1.5m 2011 12: 0.6m continued to be classified as assets held for sale at the yearend.
An impairment loss of 0.6m 2011 12: nil was recognised in the year.

In assessing whether an asset has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
In the absence of any information about the fair value of a CGU, the recoverable amount is deemed to be its value in use.
The Group estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model, which applies a pretax discount rate of 9.1% in the UK 2011 12: 9.3%, 10.2% in China 2011 12: 10.4% and 10.6% in Poland 2011 12: 10.8%.
The future cash flows are based on assumptions from the business plans and cover a fiveyear period.
These business plans and forecasts include managements most recent view of mediumterm trading prospects.
Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using a growth rate based upon the relevant countrys inflation target, ranging from 2.0% to 3.4% with the UK, the most significant country, being 2.0% 2011 12: 2.0%.
The events and circumstances that led to the impairment charge of 15.3m are set out below: Hotels & Restaurants The impairment of 13.6m at 16 sites in this strategic business unit was driven by a number of factors: changes in the local competitive environment in which the hotels are situated: the economic climate affecting some key regions: and high asset prices in the market at the point of acquisition for acquired sites which also anticipated higher growth rates at that time than are now expected.
Costa Five UK Costa sites, nine sites in Shanghai and nine in the Coffeeheaven business, all with an established trend of poor performance against the required capital investment, have been impaired by 1.7m where their expected future cash flows have fallen to such a level that their value in use is below carrying value.
Impairment reversals Following an improvement in trading performance and an increase in amounts of estimated future cash flows of previously impaired sites, reversals of 9.9m have been recognised, 9.7m in Hotels & Restaurants and 0.2m in Costa.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The level of impairment is predominantly dependent upon judgements used in arriving at future growth rates and the discount rate applied to cash flow projections.
The impact on the impairment charge of applying different assumptions to the growth rates used in the fiveyear business plans and in the pretax discount rates would be an incremental charge of: Hotels & Restaurants Costa Total Incremental impairment charge m m m Impairment if business plan growth rates were reduced by 1ppt 5.1 5.1 Impairment if discount rates were increased by 1ppt 4.8 4.8 Overview p1 7 Strategy Operational highlights p8 37 Governance p38 67 Consolidated accounts p69 114 Company accounts p115 122 Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2012 13 Consolidated accounts 2012 13 96 No Not te es t s to o t th he c e co onsolida nsolidat ted financial st ed financial sta at temen ements ts A At t 28 F 28 Februar ebruary y 20 201 13 3 14Impairment continued Goodwill Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to groups of CGUs at strategic business unit level, being the level at which management monitor goodwill.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In the absence of a recent market transaction the recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations.
Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using a 2.0% growth rate 2011 12: 2.0%.
The pretax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 9.1% 2011 12: 9.3%.
The resultant impairment review required no impairment of goodwill allocated to either Hotels & Restaurants CGU or the Costa CGU.

Provision is made for rent and other property related costs for the period that a sublet or assignment of the lease is not possible.
Where the property is deemed likely to be assigned, provision is made for the best estimate of the reverse lease premium payable on the assignment.
Where the property is deemed likely to be sublet, the rental income and the timing of the cash flows are estimated by both internal and external property specialists and a provision is maintained for the cost incurred by the Group.
Onerous lease provisions are discounted using a discount rate of 3.74% 2012: 3.74% based on an approximation for the time value of money.
The amount and timing of the cash outflows are subject to variations.
The Group utilises the skills and expertise of both internal and external property experts to determine the provision held.
Provisions are expected to be utilised over a period of up to 25 years.
Other Other provisions relate to warranties given on the disposal of businesses.
These are expected to be used over periods of up to four years.

The Groups financial instrument policies can be found in the accounting policies in Note 2.
The Board agrees policies for managing the risks summarised below: Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Groups longterm sterling debt obligations.
Interest rate swaps are used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt in conjunction with private placement loan notes.
The Groups policy is to fix, on a longterm basis, between 35% and 65% of projected net interest cost.
This policy reduces the Groups exposure to the consequences of interest rate fluctuations.
At the yearend, 310.8m 61.8% of Group debt was fixed for an average of 6.87 years at an average interest rate of 5.1% 2012: 407.4m, 74.8%, for 5.50 years, at 5.3%.
Although the private placement loan notes are US dollar denominated, crosscurrency swaps mean that the interest rate risk is effectively sterling only.
In accordance with IFRS 7 the Group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by changes in interest rates.
This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio of fixed to floating interest rates and on the basis of the hedging instruments in place at 28 February 2013 and 1 March 2012 respectively.
Consequently, the analysis relates to the situation at those dates and is not representative of the years then ended.
The following assumptions were made: balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt and deposits does not change as interest rates move: gains or losses are recognised in equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies set out in Note 2: and cash flow hedges were effective.
Based on the Groups net debt position at the yearend, a 1ppt change in interest rates would affect the Groups profit before tax by approximately 1.9m 2011 12: 1.3m and equity by approximately 6.6m 2012: 7.8m.
Liquidity risk In its funding strategy the Groups objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts and bank loans.
This strategy includes monitoring the maturity of financial liabilities to avoid the risk of a shortage of funds.
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interestbearing deposit with maturities fixed at no more than three months.
Shortterm flexibility is achieved through the use of shortterm borrowing on the money markets.
The tables below summarise the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 28 February 2013 and 1 March 2012 based on contractual undiscounted payments, including interest: On Less than More than demand 3 months 312 months 15 years 5 years Total 28 February 2013 m m m m m m Interestbearing loans and borrowings 9.0 0.4 11.7 316.5 259.3 596.9 Derivative financial instruments 2.3 2.3 16.2 9.1 29.9 Trade and other payables 159.2 17.6 176.8 Accrued financial liabilities 113.6 113.6 Provisions in respect of financial liabilities 2.6 7.7 14.7 17.2 42.2 9.0 164.5 135.3 365.0 285.6 959.4 On Less than More than demand 3 months 312 months 15 years 5 years Total 1 March 2012 m m m m m m Interestbearing loans and borrowings 14.2 0.7 12.7 322.6 298.0 648.2 Derivative financial instruments 3.3 3.3 13.7 7.6 27.9 Trade and other payables 159.3 16.4 175.7 Accrued financial liabilities 105.5 105.5 Provisions in respect of financial liabilities 2.7 8.0 18.5 18.6 47.8 14.2 166.0 129.5 371.2 324.2 1,005.1 Overview p1 7 Strategy Operational highlights p8 37 Governance p38 67 Consolidated accounts p69 114 Company accounts p115 122 Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2012 13 Consolidated accounts 2012 13 103 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 28 February 2013 24Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.
This is minimised by dealing with counterparties with high credit ratings.
The amounts included in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts, which have been estimated by management based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date which may indicate that a provision is required.
The Groups maximum exposure on its trade and other receivables is the carrying amount as disclosed in Note 19.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, the Groups exposure arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying value of these instruments.
The Group seeks to minimise the risk of default in relation to cash and cash equivalents by spreading investments across a number of counterparties.
In the event that any of the Groups banks get into financial difficulties the Group is exposed to the risk of withdrawal of currently undrawn committed facilities.
This risk is mitigated by the Group having a range of counterparties to its facilities and by maintaining headroom.
Foreign currency risk Foreign exchange exposure is currently not significant to the Group.
Although the Group has US dollar denominated loan notes these have been swapped into sterling thereby eliminating foreign currency risk.
Sensitivity analysis has therefore not been carried out.
The Group monitors the growth and risks associated with its overseas operations and will undertake hedging activities as and when they are required.
Capital management The Groups primary objective in regard to capital management is to ensure that it continues to operate as a going concern and has sufficient funds at its disposal to grow the business for the benefit of shareholders.
The Group seeks to maintain a ratio of debt to equity that balances risks and returns and also complies with lending covenants.
See pages 30 to 33 of this report for the policies and objectives of the Board regarding capital management, analysis of the Groups credit facilities and financing plans for the coming years.
The Group aims to maintain sufficient funds for working capital and future investment in order to meet growth targets.
The Group has adopted a framework to keep leverage debt divided by EBITDAR on a pensions lease adjusted basis at 3.5 times or below which was achieved for the year ended 28 February 2013.
This calculation takes account of net debt, pensions deficit and the capital value of leases.
The management of equity through share buy backs and new issues is considered as part of the overall leverage framework balanced against the funding requirements of future growth.
In addition, the Group may carry out a number of small sale and leaseback transactions to provide further funding for growth.
The Groups financing is subject to financial covenants.
These covenants relate to the measurement of EBITDA against consolidated net finance charges interest cover and total net debt leverage ratio, on a not adjusted for pensions and property leases basis.
The Group has complied with all these covenants.
The above matters are considered at regular intervals and form part of the business planning and budgeting processes.
In addition, the Board regularly reviews the Groups dividend policy and funding strategy.
25Financial instruments Fair values As in the prior year the fair value of financial assets and liabilities disclosed in Notes 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 26 are considered to be approximately the same as their carrying amounts.
The fair value of loan capital and derivative instruments is calculated by discounting all future cash flows by the market yield curve at the balance sheet date.

There are no material differences between the carrying values and fair values of derivative financial instruments.
Derivative financial instruments Hedges Cash flow hedges At 28 February 2013 the Group had interest rate swaps in place to swap a notional amount of 100.0m 2012: 200.0m whereby it receives variable interest rates based on LIBOR on the notional amount and pays fixed rates of between 5.145% and 5.372% 2012: 5.145% and 5.643%.
The swaps are being used to hedge the exposure to changes in future cash flows from variable rate debt.
The Group also had crosscurrency swaps in place whereby it receives fixed interest rates of between 3.92% and 4.86% 2012: 3.92% and 4.86% on a notional amount of US$210.0m 2012: US$210.0m and paid an average of 4.72% on a notional sterling balance of 158.2m 2012: 4.72% on 158.2m.
Fair value hedges At 28 February 2013, the Group had crosscurrency swaps in place whereby it received a fixed interest rate of 5.23% 2012: 5.23% on a notional amount of US$75.0m 2012: US$75.0m and paid a spread of between 1.715% and 1.755% 2012: 1.715% and 1.755% over 6m GBP LIBOR on a notional sterling balance of 50.1m 2012: 50.1m.
Cash flow and fair value hedges are expected to impact on the income statement in line with the liquidity risk table shown in Note 24.
The cash flow hedges were assessed to be highly effective at 28 February 2013 and a net unrealised gain of 8.3m 2011 12: net unrealised loss of 1.0m has been recorded in other comprehensive income.
The fair value hedges were also assessed to be highly effective at 28 February 2013 with a credit of 0.4m recorded within finance revenue in the income statement 2011 12: 0.7m.
During the year, a loss of 7.0m 2011 12: 16.9m was charged to the income statement in respect of hedged items affecting the net finance charge for the year.

The remainder are being held in the treasury reserve Note 28.
During the year to 28 February 2013 options over 0.2m ordinary shares, fully paid, were exercised by employees under the terms of various share option schemes 2011 12: 0.5m.
Shareholders were offered a scrip alternative to the 2011 12 cash final dividend of 33.75p and to the 2012 13 cash interim dividend of 19.50p.
Ordinary shares issued in respect of this totalled 840,852.
The issue of shares in lieu of cash dividends is treated as a bonus issue, with the nominal value of the shares being charged against the share premium account.
The total number of shares in issue at the yearend, as used in the calculation of the basic weighted average number of ordinary shares, was 193.0m less 13.8m treasury shares held by Whitbread PLC and 1.1m held by the ESOT 2012: 192.0m less 14.1m treasury shares held by Whitbread PLC and 0.9m held by the ESOT.

Capital redemption reserve A capital redemption reserve was created on the cancellation of the Groups B and C preference shares Note 27 and also includes the nominal value of cancelled ordinary shares.
Retained earnings In accordance with IFRS practice, retained earnings include revaluation reserves which are not distributable under UK law.
Currency translation reserve The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and other foreign currency investments.
Treasury reserve This reserve relates to shares held by an independently managed employee share ownership trust ESOT and treasury shares held by Whitbread PLC.
The shares held by the ESOT were purchased in order to satisfy outstanding employee share options and potential awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and other incentive schemes.
Merger reserve The merger reserve arose as a consequence of the merger in 2000 01 of Whitbread Group PLC and Whitbread PLC.

29Commitments and contingencies Operating lease commitments The Group leases various buildings which are used within the Hotels & Restaurants and Costa businesses.
The leases are non cancellable operating leases with varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
The Group also leases various plant and equipment under noncancellable operating lease agreements.
Contingent rents are the portion of the lease payment that is not fixed in amount but based upon the future amount of a factor that changes other than with the passage of time e. g. percentage of future sales, amount of future use, future price indices, future market rates of interest.
Future minimum rentals payable under noncancellable operating leases on an undiscounted basis are as follows: 2013 2012 m m Due within one year 163.1 132.1 Due after one year but not more than five years 554.6 465.5 Due after five years but not more than ten years 502.1 393.3 Due after ten years 1,240.7 996.3 2,460.5 1,987.2 Future minimum rentals payable under noncancellable operating leases disclosed above includes 123.0m in relation to privity contracts 2011 12: 127.7m.
Future lease costs in respect of these privity contracts are included within the onerous contracts provision Note 23.
Onerous contracts are under constant review and every effort is taken to reduce this obligation.
The weighted average lease life of future minimum rentals payable under noncancellable operating leases is 14.7 years 2012: 13.9 years.
Group companies have sublet space in certain properties.
The future minimum sublease payments expected to be received under noncancellable sublease agreements as at 28 February 2013 are 11.8m 2012: 16.6m.
Contingent liabilities In the financial year ended 3 March 2011 the Group received a 4.6m refund of VAT charged on gaming machine income, together with associated interest of 0.7m.
The refund was made following a ruling that the application of VAT to certain types of gaming machine income contravened the European Unions principle of fiscal neutrality.
HMRC have appealed against the ruling and if HMRCs appeal is upheld the refund and associated interest of 5.3m would be repayable.

Vesting of shares under the scheme will depend on continued employment and meeting total shareholder return TSR, earnings per share EPS performance and return on capital employed ROCE targets over a threeyear period.
Details of the performance targets for the LTIP awards can be seen in the remuneration report on pages 49 to 63.
The awards are settled in equity once exercised.
Movements in the number of share awards are as follows: 2013 2012 Awards Awards Outstanding at the beginning of the year 888,885 701,386 Granted during the year 339,816 336,402 Exercised during the year 227,087 115,735 Expired during the year 42,740 33,168 Outstanding at the end of the year 958,874 888,885 Exercisable at the end of the year 119,293 Deferred equity awards Awards are made under the Whitbread Leadership Group Incentive Scheme implemented during 2004 05.
The awards are not subject to performance conditions and will vest in full on the release date subject to continued employment at that date.
If the director or senior executive of the Group ceases to be an employee of Whitbread prior to the release date, normally three years after the award, by reason of redundancy, retirement, death, injury, ill health, disability or some other reason considered to be appropriate by the Remuneration Committee, the awards will be released in full.
If employment ceases for any other reason the proportion of awards which vests depends upon the year in which the award was made and the date that employment ceased.
If employment ceases in the first year after an award is made none of the award vests, between the first and second anniversary 25% vests and between the second and third anniversary 50% vests.

The riskfree rate is the rate of interest obtainable from government securities over the expected life of the equity incentive.
The expected dividend yield is calculated on the basis of publicly available information at the time of the grant date which, in most cases, is the historic dividend yield.
No other features relating to the granting of options were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT The Company funds an ESOT to enable it to acquire and hold shares for the LTIP and executive share option schemes.
All dividends on the shares in the ESOT are waived by the Trustee.
31Retirement benets Defined contribution schemes The Group operates a contractedin defined contribution scheme under the Whitbread Group Pension Fund.
Contributions by both employees and Group companies are held in externally invested trusteeadministered funds.
The Group also has a contractedout defined contribution pension scheme which was wound up during 2012.
The Group contributes a specified percentage of earnings for members of the above defined contribution schemes and thereafter has no further obligations in relation to the schemes.
The total cost charged to income in relation to defined contribution schemes in the year was 4.1m 2011 12: 3.6m.
At the yearend, 2,897 employees 2012: 1,812 were active members of the schemes, which also had 4,104 deferred members 2012: 6,777.
Defined benefit schemes The defined benefit final salary section of the principal Group pension scheme, the Whitbread Group Pension Fund, was closed to new members on 31 December 2001 and to future accrual on 31 December 2009.
The scheme is funded and contributions by both employees and Group companies are held in externally invested trusteeadministered funds.
Members of the scheme are contracted out of the State Second Pension.
At the yearend the scheme had no active members 2012: nil, 24,851 deferred pensioners 2012: 25,500 and 16,662 pensions in payment 2012: 16,511.
A scheme specific actuarial valuation for the purpose of determining the level of cash contributions to be paid into the Whitbread Group Pension Fund was undertaken as at 31 March 2011.
A deficit recovery plan and some protection whilst the scheme remains in deficit have been agreed with the Trustee.
The Group made a 35m payment in 2012 13 and will make the following payments to the Fund: 55m in August 2013, 65m in each of August 2014 and August 2015: 70m in August 2016: 80m in August 2017 and 75m in August 2018.
For the period of the deficit, the Group has agreed to give undertakings to the Trustee similar to some of the covenants provided in respect of its banking agreements, up to the value of any outstanding recovery plan payments or the remaining deficit, if lower.
Until the next valuation the Trustee has also been given a promise of participation in increases in ordinary dividends where these exceed RPI and the right to consultation before any special distribution can be made.
In addition to the scheduled deficit contribution payments described above, the Pension Scheme will receive a share of the income, profits and a variable capital payment from its investment in Moorgate Scottish Limited Partnership SLP, which was established by the Group in the year ended 4 March 2010 the share in profits is accounted for by the Group as contributions when paid.
The partnership interests in Moorgate SLP are held by the Group, the general partner and by the Pension Scheme.
Moorgate SLP holds an investment in a further partnership, Farringdon Scottish Partnership SP, which was also established by the Group during 2009 10.
Property assets with a market value of 221m have been transferred from other Group companies to Farringdon SP and leased back to Whitbread Group PLC and Premier Inn Hotels Limited.
The Group retains control over these properties, including the flexibility to substitute alternative properties.
However, the Trustee has first charge over the property portfolio and certain other assets with an aggregate value of 228m.
The Group retains control over both partnerships and as such they are fully consolidated in these consolidated financial statements.
Overview p1 7 Strategy Operational highlights p8 37 Governance p38 67 Consolidated accounts p69 114 Company accounts p115 122 Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2012 13 Consolidated accounts 2012 13 111 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 28 February 2013 31Retirement benets continued The Pension Scheme is a partner in Moorgate SLP and, as such, is entitled to an annual share of the profits of the partnership over the next 12 years.
At the end of this period, the partnership capital allocated to the Pension Scheme partner will, depending on the funding position of the Pension Scheme at that time, be transferred in cash to the Pension Scheme up to a value of 150m 2012: 150m.
Under IAS 19 the investment held by the Pension Scheme in Moorgate SLP, a consolidated entity, does not represent a plan asset for the purposes of the consolidated financial statements.
Accordingly the pension deficit position in these consolidated financial statements does not reflect the 141m 2012: 141m investment in Moorgate SLP held by the Pension Scheme.
During the year the Group agreed to enter into a charge in favour of Whitbread Pension Trustees Limited over properties with a market value totalling 180m at that date which was completed on 17 April 2013.
The charge was to secure the obligations of the Group to make payments to the Pension Fund as part of the recovery plan to reduce the deficit.
This together with the properties secured as a consequence of the arrangement in the Scottish Limited Partnerships, secures properties totalling 408m in favour of the pension scheme.
The total service cost contributions to the Whitbread Group Pension Fund in 2013 14 will be nil.
The IAS 19 pension cost relating to the defined benefit section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund is assessed in accordance with actuarial advice from Lane, Clark & Peacock and Towers Watson, using the projected unit credit method.
As the scheme is now closed to future accrual, there will be no service cost in the future.
The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in updating the most recent valuation, carried out as at 31 March 2011, of the UK schemes to 28 February 2013 for IAS 19 purposes were: At At 28 February 1 March 2013 2012 % % PreApril 2006 rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.20 3.00 PostApril 2006 rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.20 2.20 Pension increases in deferment 3.20 3.00 Discount rate 4.60 4.65 Ination assumption 3.35 3.15 The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 20.9 years 2012: 20.8 if they are male and for a further 23.4 years 2012: 23.3 if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2032 at age 65, the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 22.7 years 2012: 22.6 after retirement if they are male and for a further 25.2 years 2012: 25.1 after retirement if they are female.
The Group employs a building block approach in determining the longterm rate of return on pension plan assets.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The assumed longterm rate of return on each asset class is set out within this note.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each actual asset allocation for the Fund at 28 February 2013 rounded to the nearest 0.1% per annum.
The amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of the defined benefit scheme are as follows: Amounts recognised in operating profit for service costs or curtailment are nil 2011 12: nil.

The principal reason for this reduction was the actual asset performance being significantly better than expected while actual pension increases were also lower than assumed.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation are as follows: 2013 2012 m m Opening dened benefit obligation 1,939.7 1,745.0 Net interest cost 88.4 95.6 Actuarial losses on scheme liabilities 74.7 177.2 Benets paid 81.1 77.6 Benets settled by the Company in relation to an unfunded pension scheme 0.1 0.5 Closing dened benefit obligation 2,021.6 1,939.7 Changes in the fair value of the scheme assets are as follows: 2013 2012 m m Opening fair value of scheme assets 1,341.0 1,257.0 Expected return on scheme assets 70.4 81.6 Actuarial gains losses on scheme assets 104.0 14.9 Contributions from employer 37.2 86.8 Additional contributions from Moorgate SLP 8.4 8.1 Benets paid 81.1 77.6 Closing fair value of scheme assets 1,479.9 1,341.0 The analysis of the scheme assets and the expected rates of return at the balance sheet date were as follows: Expected return Fair value of assets 2013 2012 2013 2012 % % m m Equities n a 7.2 868.5 727.3 Government bonds n a 3.2 317.1 374.8 Corporate bonds n a 4.6 173.5 131.3 Property n a 5.7 68.6 45.8 Cash n a 3.2 52.2 61.8 1,479.9 1,341.0 As the Group is adopting IAS 19 2011 from 1 March 2013, there are no expected return on asset assumptions, and consequently no weighted average expected rate of return on the asset base at 28 February 2013, as these will no longer be required.
Expected returns will be replaced by recording interest income, calculated by using the discount rate used to measure the pension obligation.
