Fair value measurements are based on observable and unobservable inputs.
Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Groups view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information.
The Group utilises techniques that maximise the use of observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs.
The levels of fair value measurement bases are defined as follows: Level 1: fair values measured using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: fair values measured using valuation techniques for all inputs significant to the measurement other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: fair values measured using valuation techniques for any input for the asset or liability significant to the measurement that is not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
