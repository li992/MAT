Contingent liabilities Guarantees and assets pledged as collateral security: Guarantees and irrevocable letters of credit 874 238 779 027 874 238 779 027 The amounts shown above are intended only to provide an indication of the volume of business outstanding at the balance sheet date.
Guarantees are issued by Investec plc and Investec Limited on behalf of third parties and other group companies.
The guarantees are issued as part of the banking business.
Financial Services Compensation Scheme The Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS, the UK's statutory fund of last resort, provides compensation to customers of UK authorised financial institutions in the event that an institution which is a participating member of the FSCS is unable, or is likely to be unable, to pay claims against it.
The FSCS raises annual levies from participating members based on their level of participation in the case of deposits, the proportion that their protected deposits represent of total protected deposits as at 31 December of the year preceding the 1 scheme year.
In April 2012 the FSCS agreed revised terms on the loan facilities including a 70bps increase in the interest rate payable to 12-month LIBOR plus 100 bps.
This rate will be subject to a oor equal to the HM Treasurys own cost of borrowing.
The facilities are expected to be repaid wholly from recoveries from the failed deposit takers, except for an estimated shortfall of 0.8 billion.
The FSCS has announced it intends to recover this shortfall by levying the industry in instalments across 2013, 2014 and 2015, in addition to the ongoing interest charges on the outstanding loans.
Investec Bank plc is a participating member of the FSCS and the bank has accrued 6.1 million for its share of levies that will be raised by the FSCS.
The accrual is based on estimates of the interest the FSCS will pay on the loan and the level of the banks market participation in the relevant periods.
The bank has also accrued for its estimated share of the principal to be levied over each of the next three years.
Interest will continue to accrue to the FSCS on the HM Treasury loan and will form part of future FSCS levies.
At the date of these financial statements, it is not possible to estimate whether there will ultimately be additional levies on the industry, the level of Investecs market participation or other factors that may affect the amounts or timing of amounts that may ultimately become payable, nor the effect that such levies may have upon operating results in any particular financial period.

Contingent liabilities continued Legal proceedings Investec operates in a legal and regulatory environment that exposes it to litigation risks.
As a result, Investec is involved in disputes and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business.
Investec does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of the proceedings to which Investec is party to have a significant adverse effect on the financial position of the group.
These claims, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
Specically, a claim has been made in the Royal Court of Guernsey against Investec Trust Guernsey Limited, a subsidiary of Investec plc, for breach of equitable duty for skill and care with a related claim for liability for the debts of a client trust.
The outcome of these claims cannot reasonably be estimated at this time but Investec does not expect the ultimate resolution of the proceedings to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the group.
