The financial statements of Northern Rail Holdings Limited are for a period which is different from that of the Group, being for the 52 week period ended 4 January 2014.
The 52 week period reflects the joint ventures internal reporting structure and is sufficiently close so as to not require adjustment to match that of the Group.
Joint ventures continued Certain employees of the groups headed by AWE Management Limited and Northern Rail Holdings Limited are members of sponsored defined benefit pension schemes.
Given the significance of the schemes to understanding the position of the joint ventures the following key disclosures are made: AWE Northern Management Rail Holdings Main assumptions: 2013 Limited Limited Rate of salary increases % 3.5 3.4 Inflation assumption CPI, % 2.7 2.7 Discount rate % 4.8 4.7 Post-retirement mortality: Current male industrial pensioners at 65 years 22.7 N A Future male industrial pensioners at 65 years 24.5 N A Retirement benefit funding position 100% of results m m Present value of scheme liabilities 1,416.3 770.8 Fair value of scheme assets 962.7 564.2 Net amount recognised 453.6 206.6 Members share of deficit 82.6 Franchise adjustments 120.2 Related asset, right to reimbursement 453.6 Net retirement benefit obligation 3.8 The franchise adjustment represents the amount of scheme deficit that is expected to be funded outside the contract period.
The Northern Rail defined benefit pension scheme uses a mortality rate multiplier of 98% based on the S1 normal males heavy table, adjusted for the geographic location of members.
AWE Management Limited is not liable for any deficiency in the defined benefit pension scheme under current contractual arrangements.
The deficit reflected in the financial statements of Northern Rail Holdings Limited covers only that portion of the deficit that is expected to be funded over the term of the franchise arrangement the entity operates under.
In addition, the defined benefit position reflects an adjustment in respect of funding required to be provided by employees.
