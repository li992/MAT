NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 7 Earnings and cash flow per share Basic earnings per share have not been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of 46,188,000 2012: 44,567,000 by the weighted average number of shares in issue of 126,036,296 2012: 129,998,234. International reporting standards require that the weighted average number of shares be adjusted to exclude shares held in trust in respect of the employee Share Incentive Plan and the 2005 Deferred Bonus Scheme.
This has resulted in the number of shares used in the calculation of 120,684,262 2012: 125,085,248.
On this basis, earnings per share before exceptional items have been calculated before items detailed in note 3.
The weighted average number of shares held in trust of 5,352,034 2012: 4,919,213, which have a dilutive effect, has been excluded in the calculation of undiluted earnings per share in the table below.
Therefore, the weighted average number of ordinary shares used in this calculation is 120,684,262 2012: 125,085,248.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share in the table below is based on the weighted average number of shares in issue of 126,036,296 2012: 129,988,234, including those held in trust in respect of employee share schemes.
Adjusted earnings exclude an adjustment in respect of the corporation tax-rate change of 8,720,000 2012: 5,627,000 and exceptional items.
