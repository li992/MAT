interpretations that have been issued but are not yet effective for this accounting year and have not been adopted early.
The impact UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 39 231283 UKCPT pp37-pp40 21 03 2014 10:31 Page 40 Notes to the Accounts continued of these standards has not yet been assessed by the Group but will be in due course.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9, as issued in 2010, reflects the first phase of the IASBs work on the replacement of IAS 39 and applies to classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in IAS 39.
The standard was initially effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
In November 2013, Chapter 6 of IFRS 9 on hedge accounting was published.
At the same time, Chapter 7 containing the effective date and transition provisions was amended to remove the mandatory effective date of IFRS 9.
This was intended to provide sufficient time for preparers to make the transition to the new requirements.
Entities may still choose to apply IFRS 9 immediately, but are not required to do so with the effective date expected to be no earlier than 1 January 2017.
In subsequent phases, the IASB is addressing impairment of financial assets.
The adoption of the first phase of IFRS 9 will have an effect on the classification and measurement of the Groups financial assets, but will not have an impact on classification and measurements of financial liabilities.
The Group will quantify the effect in conjunction with the other phases, when the final standard including all phases is issued.
Investment entities Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 These amendments provide an exception to the consolidation requirement for entities that meet the definition of an investment entity under IFRS 10.
The exception to consolidation requires investment entities to account for subsidiaries at fair value through profit or loss.
These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
It is not expected that this amendment would be relevant to the Group, since none of the entities in the Group would qualify to be an investment entity under IFRS 10.
In addition to the above, IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement effective 1 Jan 2014, Annual Improvement to IFRSs 2010-2012 Cycle effective 1 July 2014 and Annual Improvement to IFRSs 2011-2013 Cycle effective 1 July 2014 have not been adopted early.
As at the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the latter two standards and interpretations have not yet been endorsed or adopted by the EU.

The Investment Manager is also entitled to an administration fee amounting to 165,000 which will increase annually in line with inflation.
In the current year this fee amounted to 168,000 see note 3.
Both fees are payable quarterly in arrears.
The fees of any managing agents appointed by the Investment Manager are payable out of the Investment Management fee.
The Investment Management agreement is terminable by any of the parties to it on 12 months notice.

Taxation UK Commercial Property Trust Limited owns four Guernsey tax exempt subsidiaries, UK Commercial Property GP Limited GP, UK Commercial Property Holdings Limited UKCPH, UK Commercial Property Estates Limited UKCPEL and UK Commercial Property Estates Holdings Limited UKCPEH.
GP and UKCPH are partners in a Guernsey Limited Partnership the Partnership and own six Jersey Property Unit Trusts.
UKCPEL owns 3 Jersey Property Unit Trusts.
The Partnership, UKCPH and UCKPEL own a portfolio of UK properties and derived rental income from those properties.
As the Partnership, GP, UKCPH, UKCPEL and UKCPEH are considered tax transparent in the UK, their taxable results are liable to UK income tax at the rate of 20 per cent on their respective net rental income.
A reconciliation of the income tax charge applicable to the results from ordinary activities at the statutory income tax rate to the charge for the year is as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 December 2013 31 December 2012 000 000 Net profit loss before tax 96,072 4,954 UK income tax at a rate of 20 per cent 19,214 991 Effect of: Capital gains losses on investment properties not taxable 8,377 10,786 Lease incentive adjustment not allowable for tax purposes 68 193 Capital gains losses realised not taxable 1,370 725 Income not taxable 98 74 Intercompany loan interest 12,754 12,520 Expenditure not allowed for income tax purposes 1,773 1,466 Deferred tax asset not provided for 1,544 415 Total tax charge - - The Group has unused tax losses carried forward of 23,238,833 2012: 24,964,059.
These will only be utilised if the Group has profits chargeable to income tax in the future.
The Company and its subsidiaries are exempt from Guernsey taxation under the Income Tax Exempt Bodies Guernsey Ordinance, 1989.
A fixed annual fee of 600 per company is payable to the States of Guernsey in respect of this exemption.
No charge to Guernsey taxation will arise on capital gains.
The Directors intend to conduct the Groups affairs such that management and control is not exercised in the United Kingdom and so that neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries carries on any trade in the United Kingdom.
Accordingly, the Company and its subsidiaries will not be liable for United Kingdom taxation on their income or gains other than certain income deriving from a United Kingdom source.
Dividends Year ended Year ended 31 December 2013 31 December 2012 000 000 Dividends on Ordinary Shares: 2012 Fourth interim of 1.3125p per share paid 28 February 2013 2011 Fourth interim: 1.3125p 15,715 15,715 2013 First interim of 1.3125p per share paid 31 May 2013 2012 First interim: 1.3125p 15,715 15,715 2013 Second interim of 1.3125p per share paid 30 August 2013 2012 Second interim: 1.3125p 15,715 15,715 2013 Third interim of 1.3125p per share paid 30 November 2013 2012 Third interim: 1.3125p 15,715 15,715 62,860 62,860 42 UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 231283 UKCPT pp41-pp53 21 03 2014 10:32 Page 43 A fourth interim dividend of 1.3125p was paid on 28 February 2014 to shareholders on the register on 14 February 2014.
Although this payment relates to the year ended 31 December 2013, under International Financial Reporting Standards it will be accounted for in the year ending 31 December 2014.
Basic and diluted Earnings per Share The earnings per share EPS are based on the net profit for the year of 96,072,000 2012: loss 4,954,000 and on 1,197,348,858 2012: 1,197,348,858 Ordinary Shares, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
As there are no dilutive instruments outstanding, basic and diluted earnings per share are identical.
The EPRA EPS for the year ended 31 December 2013 is 3.98p per share 2012: 4.47p.
This is calculated after excluding any gain loss on investment properties and losses arising on ineffective portions of interest rate swaps from the Net profit loss position for the year.
Investment Properties Year ended Year ended 31 December 2013 31 December 2012 000 000 Freehold and Leasehold properties Opening valuation 1,015,532 1,011,775 Purchases at cost 18,648 63,545 Capital expenditure 4,353 7,332 Gain loss on revaluation to market value 41,885 56,157 Disposals at prior year valuation 37,350 10,000 Adjustment for lease incentives 340 963 Fair value at 31 December 2013 1,042,728 1,015,532 Gains Losses on investment properties at fair value Comprise Valuation gains losses 41,885 56,157 Movement in provision for lease incentives 340 963 Gain loss on disposal 6,850 1,400 48,395 58,520 Losses on investment properties sold Original cost of investment properties sold 66,950 12,227 Sale proceeds 44,200 8,600 Losses on investment properties sold 22,750 3,627 Recognised in previous periods 29,600 2,227 Recognised in current period 6,850 1,400 22,750 3,627 Given the objectives of the Group and the nature of its investments, the Directors believe that the Group has only one asset class, that of Commercial Property.
CBRE Limited, Chartered Surveyors the Property Valuer completed a valuation of Group investment properties at 31 December 2013 on an open market basis in accordance with the requirements of the Valuation Standards issued by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which is deemed to equate to market value.
The Property Valuer, in valuing the portfolio, is acting independently and external to it.
Market value is determined by reference to market based evidence, which is the amount for which each asset could be exchanged between a knowledgeable, willing buyer and a knowledgeable, willing seller in an arms length transaction as at the valuation date.
The market value of these investment properties amounted to 1,048,705,000 2012 1,021,170,000.
The difference between the market value and the fair value at 31 December 2013 consists of accrued income relating to the pre-payment for rent-free periods recognised over the life of the lease totaling 5,977,000 2012 5,638,000 which is separately recorded in the accounts as a current asset.
The Group has entered into leases on its property portfolio as lessor See note 18 for further information.
No one property accounts for more than 15 per cent of the gross assets of the Group.
All leasehold properties have more than 60 years remaining on the lease term.
There are no restrictions on the realisability of the Groups investment properties or on the remittance of income or proceeds of disposal.
However, the Groups investments comprise UK commercial property, which may be difficult to realise.
Property and property related assets are inherently difficult to value due to the individual nature of such property.
As a result, valuations are subject to substantial UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 43 231283 UKCPT pp41-pp53 21 03 2014 10:32 Page 44 Notes to the Accounts continued uncertainty.
There is no assurance that the estimates resulting from the valuation process will reflect the actual sales price even where the actual sales occur shortly after the valuation date.
In addition to the above, the property portfolio market value as at 31 December 2013 is based on the following: The Estimated Net Annual Rent for each property, which is based on the current rental value of each of the properties, which reflects the terms of the leases where the property, or part of the property, are let at the date of valuation.
If the property, or parts thereof, are vacant at the date of valuation, the rental value reflects the rent the valuer considers would be obtainable on an open market letting as at the date of valuation.
The valuer has assumed that all rent reviews are to be assessed by reference to full current rents.
Also there is the assumption that all tenants will meet their obligations under their leases, and are responsible for insurance, payment of business rates, and all repairs, whether directly or by means of a service charge.
The valuer has not made any adjustments to reflect any liability to taxation that may arise on disposal, nor any costs associated with disposals incurred by the owner.
The valuer assumes an initial yield in the region of 4 to 7 per cent for the majority of the properties, with the reversionary yield being in the region of 5 to 7 per cent.
The property valuer takes account of deleterious materials included in the construction of the investment properties in arriving at its estimate of open market valuation when the Investment Manager advises of the presence of such materials.
The majority of the leases are on a full repairing basis and as such the Group is not liable for costs in respect of repairs or maintenance to its investment properties.
The following disclosure is provided in relation to the adoption of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
All properties are deemed as Level 3 for the purposes of fair value measurement and the current use of each property is considered the highest and best use.
The fair value of completed investment property is determined using a yield methodology.
Under this method, a propertys fair value is estimated using explicit assumptions regarding the benefits and liabilities of ownership over the assets life including an exit or terminal value.
As an accepted method within the income approach to valuation, this method involves the projection of a series of cash flows on a real property interest.
To this projected cash flow series, an appropriate, market-derived discount rate capitalisation rate is applied to establish the present value of the cash inflows associated with the real property.
The duration of the cash flow and the specific timing of inflows and outflows are determined by events such as rent reviews, lease renewal and related lease up periods, re-letting, redevelopment, or refurbishment.
The appropriate duration is typically driven by market behaviour that is a characteristic of the class of property.
In the case of investment properties, periodic cash flow is typically estimated as gross income less vacancy, nonrecoverable expenses, collection losses, lease incentives, maintenance cost, agent and commission costs and other operating and management expenses.
The series of periodic net cash inflows, along with an estimate of the terminal value anticipated at the end of the projection period, is then discounted.
Set out below are the valuation techniques used for each property sector plus a description and quantification of the key unobservable inputs relating to each sector.
There has been no change in valuation technique in the year.

This information is derived from the Investment Managers financial and property management systems and is subject to the Investment Managers overall control environment.
Assumptions and valuation models used by the valuers the assumptions are typically market related, such as yields.
These are based on their professional judgment and market observation.
The information provided to the valuers and the assumptions and valuation models used by the valuers are reviewed by the Investment Managers.
This includes a review of fair value movements over the period.

Bank Loan and Interest rate swaps 2013 2012 000 000 Total Facilities available 230,000 230,000 Drawn down: Lloyds facility 80,000 80,000 Barclays facility 150,000 150,000 Set up costs incurred 2,541 2,541 Accumulated amortisation of set up costs 1,091 728 Accrued variable rate interest on bank loan 702 647 Total due 229,252 228,834 i Lloyds Facility The Company has a seven year 80 million facility, maturing in June 2015, with Lloyds Banking Group plc, all of which is drawn down.
The bank loan is secured on a proportion of the property portfolio of the Group.
Under bank covenants related to the loan the Company is to ensure that at all times: The loan to value percentage does not exceed 50 per cent this is defined as the ratio of the loan compared to the aggregate of the open market property valuations plus any cash deposits : The qualifying adjusted net rental income for any calculation period any 3 month period is not less than 175 per cent of the projected finance costs for that period: 46 UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 231283 UKCPT pp41-pp53 21 03 2014 10:32 Page 47 No single tenant accounts for more than 30 per cent of the total net rental income: The five largest tenants do not account for more than 50 per cent of total net rental income: No single property accounts for more than 25 per cent of the gross secured asset value this is defined as the sum of the value of the properties as stated in the latest valuations plus any cash deposits.
The Company met all the covenant tests during the year.
Interest rate exposure has been hedged by the purchase of two interest rate swap contracts.
The hedge has been achieved by matching the notional amount of the swaps with the loan principal and matching the swap term to the loan term.
Interest on the swaps is receivable at a variable rate calculated on the same LIBOR basis as for the bank loan as detailed below but excluding margins and payable at a fixed rate of 3.0 per cent per annum on 42.1 million and 2.215 per cent per annum on 37.9 million respectively.
The fair value of the liability in respect of the two interest rate swap contracts at 31 December 2013 is 2.2 million 2012: 4 million which is based on the marked to market value.
Both swaps are deemed effective for accounting purposes.
Interest is payable by the Company at a rate equal to the aggregate of LIBOR, mandatory costs of the Bank and a margin.
The applicable margin depends on the ratio of all loans made available to the Company under the Bank Facility or otherwise to the Gross Assets Value, expressed as a percentage the LTV Percentage.
Gross Assets Value takes into account the value of the properties and any other assets held by the Company and the Guarantors currently UK Commercial Property Holdings Limited, UK Commercial Property GP Limited and UKCPT Limited Partnership as well as unsecured cash.
If the LTV percentage is greater than 5 per cent and does not exceed 10 per cent, the margin is 0.55 per cent per annum.
If the LTV percentage is greater than 10 per cent and does not exceed 40 per cent, the margin is 0.60 per cent per annum.
If the LTV percentage is greater than 40 per cent and does not exceed 50 per cent, the margin is 0.70 per cent per annum.
As at 31 December 2013 the applicable margin was 0.60 per cent 2012 0.60 per cent.
ii Barclays Facility The Group also has a seven year 150 million facility, maturing in May 2018, with Barclays Bank plc taken out in May 2011.
As at 31 December 2013 this entire loan was drawn down.
The bank loan is secured on the property portfolio held by UKCPEL.
Under bank covenants related to the loan UKCPEL is to ensure that at all times: The loan to value percentage does not exceed 60 per cent Interest cover at the relevant payment date is not less than 160 per cent UKPCEL met all covenant tests during the year.
Interest rate exposure has been hedged by the purchase of three interest rate swap contracts.
As at 31 December 2013 the Group had in place interest rate swaps totalling 150 million with Barclays bank plc 2012: 150 million.
All of these interest rate swaps effectively hedged the current drawn down loan with Barclays Bank plc.
Interest on the swap is receivable at a variable rate calculated on the same LIBOR basis as for the bank loan as detailed below but excluding margins and payable at a fixed rate of 2.9925 per cent per annum on the 100 million swap, 1.2 per cent per annum on the 30 million swap and 1.893 per cent per annum on the 20 million swap.
The fair value of the liability in respect of the interest rate swap contracts at 31 December 2013 is 4.7 million 2012: 12.7 million which is based on the marked to market value.
Interest is payable by UKPCEL at a rate equal to the aggregate of LIBOR, mandatory costs of the Bank and a margin.
The applicable margin depends on the ratio of all loans made available to the Company under the Bank Facility or otherwise to the market value of the property portfolio in UKCPEL expressed as a percentage the LTV Percentage as well as any cash generated from the sale of one of these properties.
If the LTV percentage is equal to or less than 25 per cent, the margin is 1.60 per cent per annum.
If the LTV Percentage is greater than 25 per cent and does not exceed 35 per cent, the margin is 1.70 per cent per annum.
If the LTV Percentage is greater than 35 per cent and does not exceed 40 per cent, the margin is 1.85 per cent per annum.
If the LTV Percentage is greater than 40 per cent and does not exceed 45 per cent, the margin is 1.95 per cent per annum.
If the LTV Percentage is greater than 45 per cent and does not exceed 60 per cent, the margin is 2.0 per cent per annum.
As at 31 December 2013 the applicable margin was 1.70 per cent 2012 1.70 per cent.
Swap Instruments As at 31 December 2013 the Group had in place interest rate swap instruments totalling 230 million all of which were deemed to be effective hedges as per note 1 q. UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 47 231283 UKCPT pp41-pp53 21 03 2014 10:32 Page 48 Notes to the Accounts continued The revaluation of these swaps at the year end resulted in a gain arising on interest rate swaps of 9.7 million 2012: loss 3.3 million.
Of the total gain arising on interest rate swaps, 9.7 million related to effective hedge instruments 2012: loss 3.3 million which is credited through Other Comprehensive Income in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The valuation techniques applied to fair value the derivatives include the swap models, using present value calculations.
The model incorporates various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties and forward rates.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps as at 31 December 2013 amounted to 6.9 million 2012: 16.6 million.
Based on current yield curves and non-performance risk, 4.4 million of this value relates to the next 12 months and is therefore classified as a current liability.
The remainder is classified as a long term liability.
Share capital accounts 2013 2012 000 000 Share capital Ordinary share capital of 25p each as at 31 December 2013 2012 482,703 482,703 number of shares in issue and fully paid at the year end being 1,238,794,000 Treasury shares Balance in Treasury account as at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 25,264 25,264 number of shares held in treasury being 41,445,142 Ordinary Shares of 25 pence each at 31 December 2013 Ordinary shareholders participate in all general meetings of the Company on the basis of one vote for each share held.

Financial Instruments and Investment Properties The Groups investment objective is to provide Ordinary Shareholders with an attractive level of income together with the potential for income and capital growth from investing in a diversified UK commercial property portfolio.
48 UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 231283 UKCPT pp41-pp53 21 03 2014 10:32 Page 49 Consistent with that objective, the Group holds UK commercial property investments.
The Groups financial instruments consist of cash, receivables and payables that arise directly from its operations and loan facilities and swap instruments.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and interest rate risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing its risk exposure.
These policies are summarised below and remained unchanged during the year.
Fair values The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is not materially different from the carrying value in the financial statements.
Fair value hierarchy The following table shows an analysis of the fair values of investment properties recognized in the balance sheet by level of the fair value hierarchy: 31 December 2013 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total fair value 000 000 000 000 Investment properties - - 1,042,728 1,042,728 31 December 2012 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total fair value 000 000 000 000 Investment properties - - 1,015,532 1,015,532 The lowest level of input is the underlying yield on each property which is an input not based on observable market data.
Bank loans 31 December 2013 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total fair value '000 '000 '000 '000 Bank loans - 229,730 - 229,730 31 December 2012 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total fair value '000 '000 '000 '000 Bank loans - 229,864 - 229,864 The lowest level of input is the interest rate payable on each borrowing which is a directly observable input.
The following table shows an analysis of the fair values of financial instruments recognised in the balance sheet by level of the fair value hierarchy: 31 December 2013 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total fair value 000 000 000 000 Interest rate swap - 6,919 - 6,919 31 December 2012 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total fair value 000 000 000 000 Interest rate swap - 16,634 - 16,634 The lowest level of input is the three month LIBOR yield curve which is a directly observable input.
Explanation of the fair value hierarchy: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 Use of a model with inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable market data.
Level 3 Use of a model with inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The fair value of investment properties is calculated using unobservable inputs as described in note 8.
The fair value of the derivative interest rate swap contract is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using current market interest rates and yield curves over the remaining term of the instrument.
UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 49 231283 UKCPT pp41-pp53 21 03 2014 10:32 Page 50 Notes to the Accounts continued The fair value of the bank loans are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using the current interest rates applicable to each loan.
Real Estate Risk The Group has identified the following risks associated with the real estate portfolio: The cost of any development schemes may increase if there are delays in the planning process.
The Group uses advisers who are experts in the specific planning requirements in the schemes location in order to reduce the risks that may arise in the planning process: A major tenant may become insolvent causing a significant loss of rental income and a reduction in the value of the associated property see also credit risk below.
To reduce this risk, the Group reviews the financial status of all prospective tenants and decides on the appropriate level of security required via rental deposits or guarantees: The exposure of the fair values of the portfolio to market and occupier fundamentals.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that the market value of properties and financial instruments will change.
A 10 per cent increase in the fair value of the investment properties held as at 31 December 2013 would have increased net assets available to shareholders and increased the net profit by 104.3 million 2012: 101.6 million.
A 10 per cent decrease in the fair value would have reduced net assets available to shareholders and net profit by 104.3 million 2012: 101.6 million.
The calculations above are based on investment property valuations at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole, nor reflective of future market conditions.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or counterparty will be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the Group.
At the reporting date, the maturity of the Groups financial assets was: Financial Assets 2013 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Cash 80,734 - - 80,734 Rent receivable 1,256 - - 1,256 Other debtors 1,612 - - 1,612 83,602 - - 83,602 Financial Assets 2012 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Cash 77,062 - - 77,062 Rent receivable 1,240 - - 1,240 Other debtors 1,027 63 - 1,090 79,329 63 - 79,392 In the event of default by a tenant, the Group will suffer a rental shortfall and incur additional costs, including legal expenses, in maintaining, insuring and re-letting the property until it is re-let.
The Board receives regular reports on concentrations of risk and any tenants in arrears.
The Investment Manager monitors such reports in order to anticipate and minimise the impact of defaults by tenants.
The Company has a diversified tenant portfolio.
The maximum credit risk from the rent receivables of the Group at 31 December 2013 is 1,256,000 2012: 1,240,000.
The Group holds rental deposits of 807,000 2012: 827,000 as collateral against tenant arrears defaults.
All tenant deposits are in line with market practice.
There is no credit risk associated with the financial assets of the Group.
No financial assets past due are impaired.
50 UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 231283 UKCPT pp41-pp53 21 03 2014 10:32 Page 51 All of the cash is placed with financial institutions with a credit rating of A or above.
38.8 million 2012: 14.9 million of the year end cash balance is held in the Ignis Liquidity Fund, which is a money market fund and has a triple A rating.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of a financial institution may cause the Groups ability to access cash placed on deposit to be delayed or limited.
Should the credit quality or the financial position of the banks currently employed significantly deteriorate, the Investment Manager would move the cash holdings to another financial institution subject to restrictions under the loan facility.
Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in realising assets or otherwise raising funds to meet financial commitments.
While commercial properties are not immediately realisable, the Group has sufficient cash resources to meet liabilities.
The Groups liquidity risk is managed on an ongoing basis by the Investment Manager and monitored on a quarterly basis by the Board.
In certain circumstances, the terms of the Groups bank loan entitles the lender to require early repayment, and in such circumstances the Groups ability to maintain dividend levels and the net asset value attributable to the ordinary shares could be adversely affected.
At the reporting date, the maturity of the Groups liabilities was: Financial Liabilities 2013 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Bank loan and interest rate swap 2,234 6,702 254,749 263,685 Other creditors 17,139 - 807 17,946 19,373 6,702 255,556 281,631 Financial Liabilities 2012 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Bank loan 2,252 6,755 264,389 273,396 Other creditors 18,678 - 827 19,505 20,930 6,755 265,216 292,901 The amounts in the table are based on contractual undiscounted payments.
Interest rate risk The cash balance as shown in the Balance Sheet, is its carrying amount and has a maturity of less than one year.
Interest is receivable on cash at a variable rate ranging from 0.2 per cent to 0.9 per cent at the year end and deposits are re-priced at intervals of less than one year.
An increase of 1 per cent in interest rates as at the reporting date would have increased the reported profit by 807,000 2012: increased the reported profit by 771,000.
A decrease of 1 per cent would have reduced the reported profit by 807,000 2012: decreased the reported profit by 771,000.
The effect on equity is nil excluding the impact of a charge in retained earnings as a result of a change in net profit.
As the Groups bank loans have been hedged by interest rate swaps, these loans are not subject to interest rate risk.
As at 31 December 2013 the Group had in place a total of 230 million of interest rate swap instruments 2012: 230 million.
The values of these instruments are marked to market and will change if interest rates change.
It is estimated that an increase of 1 per cent in interest rates would result in the swap liability falling by 7.0 million 2012: 9.2 million which would increase the reported profit by the same amount.
A decrease of 1 per cent in interest rates would result in the swap liability increasing by 7.0 million 2012: 9.2 million which would decrease the reported profit by the same amount.
The other financial assets and liabilities of Group are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 51 231283 UKCPT pp41-pp53 21 03 2014 10:32 Page 52 Notes to the Accounts continued Foreign Currency Risk There was no foreign currency risk as at 31 December 2013 or 31 December 2012 as assets and liabilities of the Group are maintained in pounds Sterling.
Capital Management Policies The Group considers that capital comprises issued ordinary shares, net of shares held in treasury, and long-term borrowings.
The Groups capital is deployed in the acquisition and management of property assets meeting the Groups investment criteria with a view to earning returns for shareholders which are typically made by way of payment of regular dividends.

The Group is permitted to invest cash, held by it for working capital purposes and awaiting investments, in cash deposits, gilts and money market funds.
The Group monitors capital primarily through regular financial reporting and also through a gearing policy.
Gearing is defined as gross borrowings divided by total assets less current liabilities.
The Groups gearing policy is set out in the Investment Policy section of the Report of the Directors.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed regulatory capital requirements but does have banking covenants on which it monitors and reports on a quarterly basis.
Included in these covenants are requirements to monitor loan to value ratios which is calculated as the amount of outstanding debt divided by the market value of the properties secured.
The Groups Loan to value ratio is shown below.

Capital Commitments The Group had no contracted capital commitments as at 31 December 2013 31 December 2012 nil.
Lease Length The Group leases out its investment properties under operating leases.
The future income under non-cancellable operating leases, based on the unexpired lease length at the year end was as follows based on total rentals : 31 December 2013 31 December 2012 000 000 Less than one year 63,511 70,492 Between one and five years 196,210 210,029 Over five years 264,955 336,781 Total 524,676 617,302 The largest single tenant at the year end accounted for 6.44 per cent 2012: 6.04 per cent of the current annual rental income.
The unoccupied property expressed as a percentage of annualised total rental value was 4.4 per cent 2012: 4.8 per cent at the year end.
52 UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 231283 UKCPT pp41-pp53 21 03 2014 10:32 Page 53 The Group has entered into commercial property leases on its investment property portfolio.
These properties, held under operating leases, are measured under the fair value model as the properties are held to earn rentals.
The majority of these non-cancellable leases have remaining non-cancellable lease terms of between 5 and 15 years.
Analysis of the nature of investment properties and leases are provided in Portfolio Statistics on page 15.
Service charge The Groups managing agents Jones Lang LaSalle manage service charge accounts for all the Groups properties.
The Group pays the service charge on any vacant units.
Service charges on rental properties are recharged to tenants.
The total service charge incurred in the year to 31 December 2013 was 8.5 million 2012: 7.3 million.
Of this figure, the service charge paid by the Group in respect of void units was 2.2 million 2012: 1.3 million and is included in direct property expenses.
Post Balance Sheet Events On 17 January 2014, the Group concluded conditional missives for the purchase of three properties by way of forward funding and forward purchase commitments on the Aberdeen Gateway Business Park, Old Wellington Road, Aberdeen.
The three predominantly industrial properties will extend to 265,000 sq.
The Groups maximum commitment will be up to 48.3 million on phased completion through to December 2014 and will initially generate a yield of 6.0% and a 19 year average weighted unexpired lease length.
All leases provide for fixed guaranteed uplifts.
On 4 February 2014, the Company announced that the annual dividend payable by the Company would reduce from 5.25p per share to 3.68p per share effective from the dividend payable in May 2014.
A reduction in the management fee charged by the Companys Investment Manager was also announced with the management fee reduced to 0.65% on total assets from 1 July 2014.
