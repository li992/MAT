Adjusted operating profit excludes amortisation of acquired intangible assets, acquisition related costs and the share of taxes in joint ventures.
Acquisition related costs relate to acquisition integration, transaction related fees, and those elements of deferred and contingent consideration required to be expensed under IFRS.
Adjusted profit before tax also excludes disposal related and other non operating items and the net financing charge or credit on defined benefit pension schemes.
The adjusted tax charge excludes the tax effect of these adjusting items, exceptional tax credits in 2012 only and movements on deferred tax assets and liabilities related to goodwill and acquired intangible assets.
It includes the benefit of tax amortisation where available on goodwill and acquired intangible assets.
Adjusted operating cash flow is measured after net capital expenditure and dividends from joint ventures but before payments in relation to prior year exceptional restructuring programmes and acquisition related costs.
