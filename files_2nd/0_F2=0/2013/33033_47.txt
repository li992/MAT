"Section 7 Review of Access Markets Section 7.10 - Wholesale Local Access WLA Definition Summary Market Performance Total CCA Ofcom determined in December 2004 and again in October 2010 that BT has SMP in the Operating Return on market for ""wholesale local access in the UK excluding the Hull Area""."

migrating their end users from WLR and SMPF to MPF.
In response to the finding that BT had SMP in the WLA market Ofcom imposed a variety of different access remedies.
These included maintaining the existing remedies of LLU and Sub-Loop Unbundling SLU, but also introducing two new remedies known as Virtual Unbundled Local Access VULA and Physical Infrastructure Access PIA.
Ofcom regard these new remedies as being important in controlling SMP in the evolving NGA space.
"VULA allows CPs equivalent access to BT's NGA network by purchasing Generic Ethernet Access GEA a ""virtually unbundled"" product, and PIA enables CPs to build their own NGA networks directly through the purchase of duct and pole sharing from BT."
Key Regulatory Changes The previous charge control that applied to LLU services expired on 31 March 2011.
In the absence of the new charge control being set by Ofcom from 1 April 2011, Openreach provided a voluntary commitment to Ofcom regarding the prices that it would charge for the period 1 April 2011 until 31 March 2012.
These prices were agreed and based upon the cost modelling that was used by Ofcom to calculate the previous charge controls and adjusted to reflect the Competition Appeal Tribunal CAT ruling, following the appeal by Carphone Warehouse Group of Ofcoms 2009 LLU and WLR charge controls statements.
On 7 March 2012, Ofcom published a new charge control for LLU services which will apply from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2014.
The new charge control was subsequently appealed by both BT and Sky TalkTalk Group during 2012 on a range of different issues.
Following detailed submissions by all parties and review by the Competition Commission CC and CAT some prices were changed with effect from 1 May 2013.
In parallel Ofcom has also commenced work on its next charge control which will apply from April 2014.
