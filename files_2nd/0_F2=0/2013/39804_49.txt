com OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION 83 BASE SALARY AND BENEFITS Salary: during 2013, the Chief Executives salary was 550,000 and the Group Finance Directors salary was 360,000.
On their appointment as Directors on 1 May 2013, the salaries of the Chief Investment officer and the Chief Operating officer were both 360,000.
With effect from 1 April 2014, each of the Executive Directors will receive an increase to base salary of three per cent.
The Executive Directors currently receive life assurance, private medical insurance, company car or car cash allowance and pension contributions or cash in lieu of pension, as applicable.
BONUS PAYMENT 2013 For the Executive Directors, the 2013 Bonus comprised three equally weighted components: EPRA PBT: relative TPR: and individual performance.
t profit EPRA PBT against budget For this element, a Bonus is earned for EPRA PBT performance against budget.
25 per cent is earned on achieving the threshold target, rising on a straight-line basis to 100 per cent for achieving the maximum target.
In 2013, on the basis of reported EPRA PBT of 134.1 million, 100 per cent of this element was achieved.
Targets under this performance condition have not been disclosed as the Committee considers them to be commercially sensitive.
t TPR Relative TPR against the IPD Benchmark For this element, 25 per cent is earned when the Companys TPR equals the relevant IPD benchmark.
100 per cent is earned when the Companys TPR exceeds the IPD benchmark by 1.5 per cent.
Payments are made on a straight-line basis between these points.
For 2013, the pan-European IPD data was not available at the date of this report.
Accordingly, the Committee has estimated that 50 per cent of the TPR element will be achieved based on the UK market data which was available.
t Individual performance The Directors personal objectives centre on the delivery of the key strategic priorities of: Reshaping the existing portfolio by divesting non-core assets which do not meet our strategic and financial criteria: Delivering profitable growth and reinvesting in core markets and asset types by taking advantage of the attractive development and acquisition opportunities: Reducing net debt and financial leverage over time and introducing further third party capital where appropriate: and Driving our operational performance across the business through greater customer focus, knowledge sharing, efficiency improvements and cost reductions.
Progress against these priorities is set out in the Chief Executives Strategic Report on pages 14 to 23.
50 per cent of the maximum amount available under this component is paid for on-target performance, 70 per cent is payable if objectives are exceeded and 100 per cent is payable for exceptional performance.
For the 2013 Bonus, in respect of individual performance, David Sleath received 100 per cent, Andy Gulliford received 70per cent, Justin Read received 70 per cent and Phil Redding received 100 per cent.
The profit and individual performance elements of the 2013 Bonus will be paid in April 2014, less a 50 per cent deduction for the DSBP.
Payment of the TPR element will be deferred until Summer 2014, when the pan-European IPD data becomes available.
Accordingly, the actual payment made under the TPR element of the 2013 Bonus, together with the deferral under the DSBP, may differ from the amounts disclosed in this Report.
The DSBP award will be made once the final Bonus gures can be calculated.
The vesting of the 2013 DSBP will be in April 2017, thethird anniversary of the payment of the profit and individual elements of the 2013 Bonus.
Any payments under the 2014 Bonus and the DSBP will be made in accordance with the Remuneration Policy.

The Committee will determine the TPR element as soon as the measurement can be completed based onactual data.
Any difference between the estimated and actual gures will be explained in next years Annual Report and Accounts.

com OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION 87 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SHARE SCHEME HOLDINGS AUDITED DSBP The DSBP was implemented for the 2010 Bonus payment onwards for the Executive Directors and certain other members of the Senior Leadership Team.
For the 2010, 2011 and 2012 Bonus, 25 per cent of any payment was deferred into shares.
For the Executive Directors 2013 Bonus payment, the deferral percentage has been increased to 50 per cent.
The shares held under the DSBP are shown in Chart 16 below.
On vesting, a cash sum equivalent to the value of dividends that would have been paid on shares during the three years they were under award may also be paid to participants.
Having achieved 19.3 pence EPS, 36 per cent of the shares subject to this performance condition vested.
The Company failed to meet its TPR targets, accordingly all shares in respect of this performance condition lapsed.
For more information, see Chart 17.
The three-year performance period for the 2011 LTIP award ended on 31 December 2013.
The Company failed to meet its EPS or TPR targets for this LTIP, accordingly no shares under this award will vest.
In 2012, shareholders approved an increase in the performance period for the 2012 and subsequent LTIP awards from three to four years to reect more closely the time horizon for value creation, in line with the Companys strategy.
LTIP awards made after 2011 are subject to TSR andTPR performance conditions, which are equally weighted and measured over a four-year performance period.
LTIP PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS The performance conditions for the 2012 and 2013 LTIP awards were based on TSR and TPR.
TSR this benchmark is based on the weighted mean TSR of other FTSE 350 REITs.
25 per cent of this element vests if the Companys four-year TSR is in line with benchmark TSR, rising on a straight-line basis to 100 per vesting if the benchmark is exceeded by 5 per cent per year.
TPR for the 2013 LTIP award the IPD benchmark based on UK European industrials weighted to reect the geographical mix of the Groups portfolio 75 25 UK Continental Europe for this cycle.
25 per cent of this element vests if the Companys four-year TPR is in line with the IPD benchmark, rising on a straight-line basis to 100 per cent if the IPD benchmark is exceeded by at least 1.5 per cent per year.
On vesting, calculations are reviewed by the auditor and are approved by the Committee.
The Committee retains the discretion to withhold vesting of awards should such payments be deemed inappropriate.
88 GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT Details of the LTIP awards granted to the Executive Directors are set out in Chart 17 below.
Any awards made under the LTIP in 2014 will be made in accordance with the Remuneration Policy.
CHART 17: LTIP AWARDS OUTSTANDING END OF PERFORMANCE NO.
OF SHARES MARKET SHARES NO.
OF OVER SHARE PRICE VALUE ON SHARES PERFORMANCE DATE OF UNDER CONDITIONS UNDER SHARES WHICH OF SHARES NO.
For the EPS element, 25 per cent of the award vests on the achievement of EPS growth of 4 per cent per year, rising on a straight-line basis for full vesting of EPS growth of 10 per cent.
For the TPR element 25 per cent of the award vests for performance equalling that of the IPD Index, rising on a straight-line basis to full vesting for outperformance of the IPD Index by 1.5 per cent per year or more.
Adjusted diluted EPS is calculated according to the applicable EPRA guidelines, excluding valuation gains losses and exceptional items.
Actual performance for EPS is calculated from the published gures in the Annual Report.
The Committee has the discretion to adjust awards downwards at vesting if it is not satisfied that the outcome is a fair reection of underlying performance, or in the event of excessive risk-taking or misstatement.
No such discretion was exercised in respect of the vesting of the 2010 or 2011 LTIP.
2 For 2012, the Committee made two reduced LTIP awards: the 2012 LTIP award and an LTIP transitionary award.
The 2012 LTIP award will vest, subject to performance conditions, based on four-year performance.
So as to prevent the lengthening of the performance period resulting in there being no potential LTIP vesting in 2015, the LTIP transitionary award will vest, subject to performance conditions, on three-year performance.
Each of these awards was based on the normal LTIP grant size, reduced by 25 per cent.
The same performance targets will apply to both awards.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE ADVISERS The Committee has access to sufficient resources to discharge its duties, which include access to independent remuneration advisors, the General Counsel and Group Company Secretary, the Group HR Director and other advisers as required.
It is responsible for appointing its external advisors and during the year it received advice from Kepler Associates, which is a founding member and signatory to the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants in the UK, in discharging its responsibilities.
Kepler Associates was appointed by the Remuneration Committee in 2011 following a competitive tender process.
During the year, Kepler Associates provided advice on Executive Directors remuneration, market and best practice guidance and attended meetings when major remuneration issues were discussed.
Their total fees for advice to the Remuneration Committee in 2013 were 47,750 onthe basis of time and materials.
The Committee evaluates the support provided by its advisers annually and is comfortable that Kepler Associates provides independent remuneration advice to the Committee and does not have any connections with SEGRO which may impair its independence.
To ensure a consistent approach to remuneration across the Group, Kepler Associates also provides advice to the Company in respect of matters relating to the remuneration of all employees.
Aon Hewitt Limited provided information to the Company in respect of pension-related matters.
During the year, Slaughter and May provided advice to the Company in respect of its share based incentive schemes as well as regulatory and pension matters.
