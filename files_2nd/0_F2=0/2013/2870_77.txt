116 | Capita plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 17 Business combinations continued Goodwill arose on the acquisitions because the fair value of the acquired assets was lower than the consideration paid: the goodwill represents the value to the Group that can be driven from these underlying assets over the life of the acquired businesses.
Contingent consideration In respect of the acquisitions made in 2012, the Group agreed to pay the vendors additional consideration dependent on the achievement of performance targets in the periods post acquisition.
These performance periods are of up to 3 years in duration and will be settled in cash and loan notes on their payment date on achieving the relevant target.
At 31 December 2012 the range of the additional consideration payment was estimated to be between 5m and 10m.
The Group had included 8.4m as contingent consideration related to the additional consideration, which represents its fair value at the acquisition date.
Contingent consideration had been calculated based on the Groups expectation of what it will pay in relation to the post-acquisition performance of the acquired entities by weighting the probability of a range of payments to give an estimate of the final obligation.
The fair value exercise had been completed on a provisional basis for acquisitions made in 2012.
The Group completed this review in 2013.
Acquisition related costs The Group incurred acquisition related costs of 10.3m related to professional fees paid for due diligence, general professional fees and legal related costs.
These costs were included in non-underlying administrative expenses in the Groups consolidated income statement.
