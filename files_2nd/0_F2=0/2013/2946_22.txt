These costs arose as a result of the Groups decision to review the operational structure of Carillions energy business in order to ensure that its business model is better aligned to the current market conditions which are being affected by the slow start to the Green Deal and Energy Company Obligation market as described in the Strategy review on page 9 and the Performance and financial review on page 26.
Eaga Partnership Trusts EPT related charges of 1.1 million 2012: 2.6 million relate to a Share Incentive Plan SIP under which certain employees are able to receive free shares at the discretion of the EPT.
The cost of these shares is borne by the EPT through the waiver of its entitlement to dividends from its holding of Carillion plc shares.
However, under International Financial Reporting Standard 2 Share-based payments, the Group is required to recognise a non-cash charge in its income statement in relation to awards made under the SIP.
Given that the Group does not control the timing and quantum of any awards made under the SIP and in view of the fact that the cost of these awards is borne by the EPT, charges in relation to the awards are classified as non-recurring operating items.
The acquisition of John Laing Integrated Services JLIS was completed on 18 October 2013 and 0.5 million 2012: Nil of costs have been incurred in integrating the business into the Group.
In addition, we have amended two provisions relating to obligations entered into prior to the Groups acquisition of Carillion Energy Services in 2011.
Following clarification of the tax treatment of certain potential distributions to beneficiaries by the EPT, and in particular those beneficiaries who are no longer employed by the Group, the provision has been reduced by 14.2 million during the year.
The impact of this release was however partially offset by a separate 13.9 million increase in liabilities on onerous contracts associated with the UK Governments old energy efficiency programmes.
An income tax credit of 9.2 million 2012: 0.6 million, relating to the above items, has been included within taxation in the income statement.

Intangible assets continued Each year, and whenever events or a change in the economic environment indicates a risk of impairment, the Group reviews the value of goodwill balances allocated to its cash-generating units.
In the absence of any identified impairment risks, tests are performed based on internal valuations of each cash-generating unit CGU.
Management consider Support services, Public Private Partnerships Projects, Middle East construction services and Construction services excluding the Middle East as distinct reporting segments.
Goodwill has been allocated to the applicable cash-generating units CGUs, within the Construction services excluding the Middle East and Support services reporting segments detailed above.
Our CGUs have been identified within our reporting segments as those businesses that generate cash inflows largely independently of other businesses within the Group, and which are subject to independent management.
Following a review of the operating structure of the business, the Infrastructure Services CGU has been combined with the Business Services CGU.
The combined CGU has been named the UK Services CGU and comprises the goodwill previously allocated to the Business Services CGU and Infrastructure Services CGU.
John Laing Integrated Services has been integrated into the Groups Support Services reporting segment and consequently the goodwill and customer contracts and lists recognised on this acquisition have been allocated to the UK services CGU.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The value-in-use in 2013 was determined on a similar basis to 2012.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to revenue and direct costs during the period.
These assumptions were reviewed in 2013 in the light of the challenging economic environment.
The impact of the Comprehensive Spending Review on the financial stability of our customers, partners and suppliers will be mitigated by continuing to apply rigorous selectivity criteria in relation to their financial stability, the security of project funding and contractual terms and conditions.
Discount rates have been estimated based on pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
Whilst the Group has four CGUs, the risks and rewards associated with Construction services excluding the Middle East are consistent, and therefore one discount rate has been applied to each CGU.
Similarly the risks and rewards encountered in the Support services CGUs are consistent and therefore one discount rate has been applied to each CGU.
Management has derived a Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC using the capital asset pricing model to determine the cost of equity and then weighting the overall cost of capital for the Group by equity and debt.
The WACC was then used to determine the pre-tax discount rates for each CGU.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for the CGUs in the Construction services excluding the Middle East was 10.0 per cent 2012: 11.7 per cent and for the CGUs in the Support services segment was 8.8 per cent 2012: 9.9 per cent.
The cash flows used to determine the value-in-use calculations are based upon the latest three year forecasts approved by management which are based upon secured and probable orders and the Groups overall strategic direction.
The cash flows are extrapolated from year four, with a terminal value using a growth rate of 2.5 per cent.
This growth rate does not exceed the long-term industry average and reflects the synergies from recent acquisitions.
Carillion plc management has undertaken sensitivity analysis on a number of the key assumptions in the value-in-use calculations.
Sensitivity analysis on the discount rate shows that the discount rate would have to increase to a minimum of 17.6 per cent for Construction services excluding the Middle East and to a minimum of 14.7 per cent for Support services before an impairment was triggered in any CGU.
Sensitivity analysis was applied to the cash flows used to determine the value in use by reducing the approved three year forecasts for the UK Construction CGU by 21% and by 30% for the UK Services CGU together with an assumption of no growth in cash flows from year four onwards.
On the basis of the sensitivity analysis undertaken in relation to cash flows, Carillion plc management concluded that there is a more than adequate amount of headroom in the value-in-use calculations before an impairment would be triggered.
In addition, Carillion plc management has also considered recoverable amounts on the basis of estimated cash flows for the CGUs that were reported in 2012 and concluded that they exceeded their recoverable amount.
Overall, as at 31 December 2013, based on internal valuations, Carillion plc management concluded that the recoverable value of the Groups CGUs exceeded their carrying amount.
Amortisation charge The amortisation charge of 22.8 million 2012: 35.1 million is recognised in administrative expenses in the income statement.
Amortisation of the intangible assets of 119.0 million arising on the acquisition of Mowlem in 2006 will be 79 per cent complete by 2016, with the remaining amortisation charge incurred over the following 25 years.
Amortisation of the intangible assets of 125.4 million arising on the acquisition of Alfred McAlpine in 2008 is 84 per cent complete at the end of 2013 with the remaining amortisation charge continuing until 2019.
Amortisation of the intangible asset of 29.4 million arising on the acquisition of Carillion Energy Services in 2011 will be completed in 2014.
Amortisation of the intangible asset of 27.2 million arising on the acquisition of John Laing Integrated Services in the year will be 74 per cent complete by 2023 with the remaining amortisation charge continuing until 2041.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses due to the lack of certainty concerning the quantum and timing of future years taxable profits of the companies concerned.

The provision created in the year of 25.9 million relates to the restructuring of the Groups energy services business following changes in the Energy market, including the slow start to the Green Deal market and the delayed start in the Energy Company Obligation ECO market, and the costs of integration of John Laing Integrated Services as disclosed in note 4.
The rationalisation provision created includes redundancy, restructuring and other costs relating to the Groups commitments under energy efficiency programmes.
These costs were incurred in the review of the operational structure of the energy business and the way it delivers services in order to ensure it is aligned to the size of markets in which it operates.
The majority of this provision was utilised during the year, with the remaining provision at 31 December 2013 of 11.0 million expected to be fully utilised in the next 12 months.
The onerous lease provision at 1 January and 31 December 2013 relates to a number of onerous leases acquired within Mowlem in 2006, Alfred McAlpine in 2008 and CES in 2011 and provisions created for property interests retained on the disposal of Carillion IT Services Limited and Enviros Group Limited in 2009.
The provision created in the year of 1.0 million relates to obligations arising from the restructuring of the Groups energy services business as described above.
The provision is expected to be utilised over a period of three years.
The Eaga Partnership Trust EPT NI provision at 1 January 2013 relates to the provision which was recognised on the acquisition of CES in 2011 in connection with future distributions to employees from the EPT which crystallises a National Insurance cost to the Company.
Following clarification of the tax treatment of certain potential distributions to beneficiaries by the EPT, and in particular those beneficiaries who are no longer employed by the Group, the provision has been reduced by 14.2 million during the year and is included within non-recurring operating items see note 4.
The onerous contracts provision created in the year of 13.9 million relates to onerous contractual obligations entered into by CES prior to acquisition by Carillion and are no longer continuing.
Whilst both the quantum and timing of settlement of these contracts is uncertain, the provision created reflects managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligations.
Both of these items are linked to obligations entered into by CES prior to acquisition and estimates for both of these obligations were initially made in the fair value acquisition balance sheet during 2011.
Given that these are substantial movements to these provisions, we have highlighted these items separately in the non-recurring operating items note see note 4.

Reserves Translation reserve The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Groups net investment in foreign operations.
The translation reserve also includes any related current taxation.
Hedging reserve The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred, together with any related deferred taxation.
Fair value reserve The fair value reserve includes the cumulative net change in the fair value of available-for-sale investments until the investment is derecognised, together with any related deferred taxation.
Merger reserve The merger reserve initially arose on the demerger from Tarmac plc on 29 July 1999.
The reserve increased on the acquisition of Mowlem on 23 February 2006, Alfred McAlpine on 12 February 2008 and Carillion Energy Services on 21 April 2011, whereby the consideration included the issue of Carillion plc shares.
The premium on the shares issued in relation to these acquisitions has been credited to the merger reserve rather than the share premium account in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The 18.6 million 2012: 31.4 million transfer to the retained earnings reserve during the year represents the amortisation of intangible assets recognised on the Mowlem, Alfred McAlpine and Carillion Energy Services acquisitions.
Retained earnings Retained earnings include the reserve for the Companys own shares which comprises of the cost of the Companys shares held by the Carillion Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP.
The shares held by the ESOP may subsequently be awarded to employees under the Groups share incentive schemes.
The movements in the reserve for own shares included within retained earnings are as follows: 2013 2012 m m At 1 January 0.2 Share options exercised transfer to retained earnings 1.4 1.4 Acquisition of own shares 1.4 1.2 At 31 December At 31 December 2013, the ESOP held 7 2012: 250 of the Companys shares and had a market value of 23 2012: 793.
During the year the Company acquired 471,407 of its own shares for 1.4 million to meet the plans commitments.
The ESOP has elected to waive all dividends except for a total payment of 1 pence at the time each dividend is paid.
In addition to the ESOP, the Company has also established a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST.
At 31 December 2013 the total number of shares held by the QUEST amounted to 84,593 2012: 129,979 and had a market value of 0.4 million 2012: 0.4 million.
The QUEST has elected to waive all dividends in excess of 0.01 pence per share.
During the year the Company also acquired 293,745 of its own shares for 0.8 million to facilitate an award under the Carillion Energy Services Share Incentive Plan SIP for UK partners as disclosed in note 4.
In addition cash payments totalling 0.3 million were made to good leavers who were entitled to receive shares under the terms of the SIP.
Awards under the SIP vest immediately in relation to UK partners and therefore the cost of these shares of 1.1 million has been charged directly to the retained earnings reserve.
The 0.8 million payment to acquire Carillion plc shares is included within acquisition of own shares in the cash flow statement and the 0.3 million paid to good leavers is included within payment to employees in settlement of share options in the cash flow statement.
Share-based payments The Group has established a share option programme that entitles key management personnel and senior employees to shares in the Company.
Full details of share option schemes can be found in the Remuneration report on pages 53 to 68.
In addition, under the terms of the Groups bonus arrangements, senior employees and Executive Directors receive a proportion of their bonus in shares, which vest a year after the award in respect of senior employees and three years after the award in respect of Executive Directors.

The weighted average share price during the year was 290.6 pence.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted is measured based on a Black-Scholes model using the following assumptions: 2013 2012 2012 LEAP SIP International LEAP Fair value of share options and assumptions Fair value at grant date 230.6p 214.0p 246.7p Share price at grant date 276.1p 252.9p 284.6p Exercise price Nil Nil Nil Expected volatility 12.16% 11.59% 11.84% Option life 3 years 3 years 3 years Expected dividend yield 6.00% 5.57% 4.76% Risk-free interest rate based on national government bonds 0.32% 0.19% 0.27% The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility calculated based on the weighted average remaining life of the share options, adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.

Shares awarded under the SIP to UK partners vest immediately and therefore the share-based payment charge is recognised in full at the date of award.
Shares awarded under the SIP to international partners have a three year vesting period and the share-based payment charge is recognised over the vesting period.
The expected life of the options is taken to be the full vesting period, as historical exercise patterns have shown this to be appropriate.
The estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest ignores the possibility that market conditions will or will not be achieved given that these market conditions are already included in the fair value of the options.

Financial instruments continued Financial risk management Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed.
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The overall aim of the Groups financial risk management policies are to minimise potential adverse effects on financial performance and net assets.
There has been no change to the Groups exposure to financial risk or the manner in which these risks are managed and measured.
The Groups treasury department manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the Board of Directors.
Treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
Foreign currency risk The Group operates in a number of overseas regions, primarily the Middle East and Canada.
In order to protect the Groups balance sheet from the impact of foreign exchange rate volatility, foreign currency denominated net assets that exceed 10 million equivalent are hedged, as a minimum, to at least 60 per cent of the net asset value.
Net investment hedging of overseas operations is achieved through borrowing denominated in the relevant foreign currencies, or where this is not practicable, in a currency which the relevant currency closely follows.
In 2012 the Group secured US$280 million of private placement finance at fixed interest rates from a number of United States of America based investors in order to provide greater flexibility in relation to the maturity profile of Group borrowing.
The Group has entered into a number of financial derivative contracts to hedge the exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility in relation to the associated capital and interest payments.
Group policy is to recognise gains and losses from the effective portions of hedges in equity and to recognise ineffective portions immediately in the income statement.
Profits arising within overseas operations are not hedged unless a distribution is planned.
Such distributions are then treated as currency transactions and hedged accordingly.
The Group has relatively small and infrequent transactional foreign currency exposures.
Any individual exposures that are significant are hedged using forward contracts or other appropriate risk management techniques.
Further details concerning the risks associated with the overseas regions in which the Group operates can be found in the Performance and financial review on page 32.
Foreign currency exposure The carrying amount of the Groups borrowing denominated in foreign currency is as follows: 2013 2012 m m United States of America Dollar 184.0 188.6 Canadian Dollar 80.5 90.7 United Arab Emirates Dirham 7.4 7.5 Other 3.0 3.0 274.9 289.8 Of the total foreign currency borrowing of 274.9 million 2012: 289.8 million, the amount of borrowing used for hedging overseas currency net asset amounts to 78.4 million 2012: 83.7 million.
The foreign exchange gain of 3.3 million 2012: 1.5 million gain on translation of the borrowing into sterling has been recognised in the translation reserve as these hedging loans are effective hedges.
Exposure to United States of America dollar denominated private placement borrowing included above amounting to 168.7 million 2012: 171.8 million is hedged by cross-currency derivative instruments as disclosed on page 105.
The Group does not have a significant amount of foreign currency exposure in respect of financial assets.
Each movement of five per cent in exchange rates against sterling would have changed reported profit before tax and equity as follows: Five per cent increase Five per cent decrease Profit Equity Profit Equity m m m m United States of America Dollar 0.7 0.8 Canadian Dollar 0.1 2.7 0.1 2.9 Euro 1.9 2.1 United Arab Emirates Dirham 0.1 3.0 0.1 3.4 Oman Rial 0.5 2.4 0.6 2.7 Other 0.2 1.2 0.2 1.3 Interest rate risk The Groups interest bearing debt is predominantly drawn from committed bank facilities to fund acquisitions and ongoing working capital requirements.
In addition, foreign currency denominated borrowings have been drawn under the facilities to hedge net assets of overseas operations.
Such borrowing is subject to floating rates of interest linked to London Interbank Offered Rate.
In addition the Group has secured additional finance of 303.7 million from private placements at fixed rates of interest, as disclosed in note 20.
The principal purpose of raising this finance at fixed interest rates was to ensure that a proportion of the Groups borrowing was not subject to floating rates of interest which may increase.
In addition, the Group entered into a fixed rate interest swap during the year which swaps the floating rate to a fixed rate on 40 million of the Groups principal bank facilities.
In addition, a number of Groups Public Private Partnership jointly controlled entities have entered into interest rate swaps.
A one percentage point rise in interest rates in respect of US dollar denominated borrowings would increase the annual net interest charge by approximately 0.2 million, in respect of Canadian dollar denominated borrowings an increase of 0.6 million, in respect of sterling denominated borrowings an increase of 2.9 million, and in respect of United Arab Emirates Dirham denominated borrowings an increase of 0.1 million.
104 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27.
Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The Groups policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient borrowing facilities are available to fund ongoing operations without the need to carry significant net debt over the medium term.
The Groups principal borrowing facilities are provided by a group of core relationship banks in the form of a syndicated loan, a bilateral facility, private placement financing and short-term overdraft facilities.
The quantum of committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.
The average net borrowing during 2013 was 490.6 million 2012: 344.1 million.

The remaining contractual maturity profile of the Groups derivative financial liabilities is shown below.
The Groups derivative financial liabilities relate to cross-currency derivatives that were entered into to hedge principal and interest repayments associated with US dollar private placement financing.
The maturity profile is based on the undiscounted gross payable and receivable amounts under the contracts.

Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history.
Short-term bank deposits and foreign currency hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major rating agencies.
Counterparty exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counterparty are approved at main Board level or within predetermined limits.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for receivables at 31 December by geographic region was: 2013 2012 m m United Kingdom 155.6 179.8 Middle East 33.0 9.6 Canada 29.6 45.8 Rest of the World 1.5 0.9 219.7 236.1 Overview 01-06 Strategy 06-22 Performance 23-37 Governance 38-72 Financials 73-124 105 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 27.

Trade receivables included in the balance sheet are net of an impairment provision which has been estimated by management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date.
Receivables are written off against the impairment provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
The ageing of trade receivables is as follows: 2013 2012 Net trade Net trade receivables Impairment receivables Impairment m m m m Not past due 122.4 103.4 Past due less than three months 54.3 0.2 93.2 0.7 Past due between three and six months 24.1 0.4 16.0 0.4 Past due between six and 12 months 11.5 0.8 9.2 1.2 Past due more than 12 months 7.4 6.5 14.3 8.0 219.7 7.9 236.1 10.3 The movement in the impairment provision is as follows: 2013 2012 m m At 1 January 10.3 10.3 Provision acquired with John Laing Integrated Services 0.1 Provision created 0.2 1.3 Provision utilised 2.7 1.3 At 31 December 7.9 10.3 Whilst uncertainty surrounding counterparty risk has increased due to the prevailing economic climate, on balance the Group believes that debtors will meet their payment obligations in respect of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are past due and unprovided as at 31 December 2013.
Overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to a significant amount of credit risk.

In addition to the above, a number of the Groups Public Private Partnership PPP jointly controlled entities have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk.
Interest bearing debts and the associated interest rate derivatives within these PPP jointly controlled entities are without recourse to the Group.
The life of these hedge arrangements track PPP contract terms and hedge future movements across a range up until February 2040.
The fair value of these derivatives is based on quoted prices in active markets, with the movement in fair value each year recognised in the share of change in fair value of effective cash flow hedges within jointly controlled entities in the statement of comprehensive income.
At 31 December 2013 the Groups share of the total net fair value liability of interest rate derivative in PPP jointly controlled entities amounted to 67.4 million 2012: 99.2 million of which 2.8 million 2012: 23.8 million and the related deferred tax asset of 0.7 million 2012: 5.5 million has been recognised in the hedging reserve.
106 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27.
Financial instruments continued Fair values Financial instruments carried at fair value in the balance sheet are non-quoted equity shareholdings within non-current asset investments and derivative financial instruments.
The fair value of non-current asset investments is determined based on a level 3 valuation method, using valuation techniques that include inputs that are not based on market data.
Fair value is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows using asset specific discount rates, with the movement in fair value each year recognised in the fair value movement on available for sale assets in the statement of comprehensive income.
The movement in the fair value of non-current asset investments derived using a level 3 valuation method is shown below: m At 1 January 2013 60.8 Additions 3.8 Fair value of equity interests retained on partial disposal 0.3 Disposals 57.6 At 31 December 2013 7.3 The fair value of non-current asset investments is most sensitive to movements in the discount rate used.
A one percentage point increase in the discount rate would reduce the fair value by 0.4 million.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is based on a level 2 valuation method, using inputs from quoted prices in active markets.
There are no material differences between the fair value and the carrying value of the Groups principal financial instruments.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal debt and equity structure.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of the dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Where the Group makes significant acquisitions, these are financed with a combination of debt and equity in order to maintain a balanced capital structure.
In order to have greater flexibility over the maturity profile of debt, the Group has secured around 304 million of private placement financing with maturity dates between 2017 and 2024.
The Group has a policy of progressively increasing dividends paid to shareholders broadly in line with earnings per share growth, after taking account of the investment needs of the business.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or process during the years ended 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012.

Acquisitions and disposals Acquisitions in 2013 On 18 October 2013, the Group acquired the entire share capital of John Laing Integrated Services JLIS for a cash consideration of 17.5 million.
The consideration paid is shown in the cash flow statement within acquisition of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired, after deducting cash on the acquisition balance sheet, amounting to 4.1 million.
The provisional assessment of goodwill and intangible assets arising on the acquisition amounts to 4.3 million and 27.2 million respectively.
The acquisition complements the Groups existing support services activities in the UK local government, education, police, health, rail and library sectors.
Due to the immaterial nature of this acquisition, the full disclosures required under International Financial Reporting Standard 3 Business combinations have not been presented.
During 2013 the Group paid in cash the second instalment relating to the acquisition of the Bouchier Group, which completed in 2012, amounting to 6.9 million.
This amount has been included in the cash flow statement within acquisition of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired.
Acquisitions in 2012 On 11 December 2012, the Group acquired a 49 per cent equity shareholding in the Bouchier Group.
Due to the proximity of the acquisition to the 2012 year end, a provisional assessment was made of the fair value of consideration payable and the net assets acquired leading to the recognition of provisional goodwill of 20.8 million.
Following the finalisation of the completion accounts process in 2013, the provisional amounts in 2012 have been adjusted leading to the recognition of revised goodwill on the acquisition of 16.7 million as shown below: m Provisional goodwill 20.8 Reduction in consideration payable 2.9 Changes to provisional fair value adjustments 1.8 Intangible assets identified 0.6 Revised goodwill 16.7 As the adjustments to the provisional amounts recognised in 2012 are within the measurement period, prior year comparatives have been restated accordingly leading to an increase in net assets with a corresponding increase in non-controlling interests amounting to 1.2 million.
Disposals in 2013 In 2013, the Group disposed of equity interests in a number of Public Private Partnership projects.
The disposals generated a cash consideration of 151.2 million of which 6.4 million was received on exchange of contracts in 2012, which together with disposal costs paid of 1.1 million is included in the cash flow statement within disposal of jointly controlled entity and other investments, and an operating profit of 44.6 million which is included in Group operating profit within the Public Private Partnership projects segment.
During 2013, the Group made cash payments of 0.3 million in relation to the disposal of businesses that occurred in prior years.
Disposals in 2012 In 2012, the Group disposed of equity interests in seven Public Private Partnership projects.
The disposals generated a cash consideration of 34.8 million which is included in the cash flow statement within disposal of jointly controlled entity and other investments, and a profit of 13.2 million which is included in Group operating profit within the Public Private Partnership projects segment.
In addition, on 29 June 2012 the Group received cash proceeds of 6.4 million on exchange of contracts for the sale of an equity interest in a Public Private Partnership project.
At 31 December 2012, all the conditions precedent had not been met in relation to the sale contract and therefore the disposal of this equity interest has not been recognised.
The proceeds received of 6.4 million have been recognised within disposal of jointly controlled entity and other investments in the cash flow statement.
Legal completion of the sale occurred in January 2013.
Proceeds of 2.6 million from the disposal of equity interests in land development jointly controlled entities in Canada and 1.4 million from the disposal of the Groups investment in HomeSun Holdings Limited are included in the cash flow statement within disposal of jointly controlled entity and other investments.
The Group disposed of its equity interests in two small wholly owned subsidiaries during 2012 for a total cash consideration of 1.0 million net of expenses paid of 0.2 million.
The net cash consideration received of 0.1 million net of 0.9 million of cash in the subsidiaries sold is included in the cash flow statement within disposal and closure of businesses, together with cash payments of 3.9 million in relation to business closures made in 2012 and 2011.
Retirement benefit obligations The Carillion Group operates 15 defined benefit pension schemes for eligible employees, of which 13 are in the UK, one is in Canada and one is in the Republic of Ireland.
In addition, the Group provides other post-retirement benefits under four separate arrangements in Canada.
The defined benefit schemes are administered by Trustee Boards which largely comprise independent Trustees together with Company and employee representatives.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from the Companys assets and are managed by the Trustee Boards.
Pension scheme valuations are carried out by independent actuaries to determine pension costs for pension funding every three years and bi-annually to calculate the IAS19 deficit included in the financial statements.
Eight of the 15 defined benefit schemes within the Group are closed to future accrual, with payments into these schemes made in line with deficit recovery plans, which have been agreed with pension scheme trustees.
The different scheme characteristics can be summarised below: 2013 2012 Assets Obligations Total Assets Obligations Total m m m m m m Schemes closed to future accrual 1,646.1 1,943.9 297.8 1,570.8 1,848.7 277.9 Open schemes 490.1 553.4 63.3 441.5 505.5 64.0 1 Unfunded schemes 9.0 9.0 9.1 9.1 Total 2,136.2 2,506.3 370.1 2,012.3 2,363.3 351.0 1 Unfunded schemes relate to other post-retirement benefits under four separate arrangements in Canada.

The total cost charged to the income statement of 23.2 million 2012: 20.0 million represents contributions payable to the schemes by the Group at rates specified by the scheme rules.
IAS 19 disclosures The weighted average of the principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in providing the IAS 19 position were: 2013 2012 UK Canada UK Canada Rate of increase in salaries 3.90% N A 3.40% N A Rate of increase in pensions 3.30% 2.25% 2.90% 2.25% Inflation rate Retail Price Index 3.40% 2.25% 2.90% 2.25% Inflation rate Consumer Price Index 2.35% N A 2.05% N A Discount rate 4.60% 4.60% 4.55% 4.35% The valuation of defined benefit pension scheme liabilities in particular, is most sensitive to changes in the discount, inflation and mortality rates.
A0.1per cent reduction in the the discount rate would increase scheme liabilities by approximately 44 million, whilst a 0.1 per cent increase in the inflation rate would increase scheme liabilities by approximately 36 million.
An increase of one year to the mortality rate would increase scheme liabilities by approximately 59 million, although this has been mitigated in part through the purchase of a longevity swap.
The overall weighted average duration of scheme liabilities as at 31 December 2013 is approximately 18 years.
Over the next five years benefits of 512.7 million are expected to be paid and benefits of 602.6 million are expected to be paid over the subsequent five year period.
The market values of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term, may be subject to significant change before they are realised.

Retirement benefit obligations continued The actual return on plan assets was 164.7 million 2012: 166.1 million.
The Group expects to make a contribution of 44.7 million 2012: 37.4 million to the defined benefit schemes during the next financial year.
A longevity swap has been entered into by five of the Groups defined benefit schemes which insures the Group against the financial risk of pensioners in payment living longer than currently expected.
The swap covers around 9,000 pensioners with a combined liability of some 1 billion, which represents around 40 per cent of the total liabilities in respect of the Groups defined benefit schemes.
The swap was entered into in December 2013 and in accordance with the amendment to IAS 19 Retirement benefits has been recognised as part of scheme assets.
At inception the swap is recognised at fair value using market longevity and discount rate assumptions in accordance with IFRS 13 Fair value measurement.
As such, at 31 December 2013 the fair value of the longevity swap was assessed as nil as the swap was entered into on an arms-length basis and no premium was paid.
In future periods the Group will re-evaluate the fair value of the longevity swap, with the movement in fair value recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Accounting estimates and judgements Management has discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Groups critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below: Revenue recognition In determining the revenue and costs to be recognised each year for work done on construction contracts, estimates are made in relation to final out-turn on each contract.
On major construction contracts, it is assessed, based on past experience, that their outcome cannot be estimated reliably during the early stages of the contract, but that costs incurred will be recoverable.
Once the outcome can be estimated reliably the estimates of final out-turn on each contract may include cost contingencies to take account of the specific risks within each contract that have been identified during the early stages of the contract.
The cost contingencies are reviewed on a regular basis throughout the contract life and are adjusted where appropriate.
However, the nature of the risks on contracts are such that they often cannot be resolved until the end of the project and therefore may not reverse until the end of the project.
Management continually reviews the estimated final out-turn on contracts and makes adjustments where necessary.
In respect of licensing revenue a number of judgements are made by management in determining whether the criteria as stated in the companys accounting policies note 1 have been met in order to allow for the full, immediate recognition of the sale income.
These judgements may involve the estimation of the fair value of future royalty income receivable, based on which management will assess whether the licence sale revenue should be recognised immediately or spread over a period consistent with the life of the technology or other appropriate measure.
The assessment of that future royalty revenue stream relies on forecast data and a number of variables which are outside of Carillions control, and hence judgemental.
The licence revenue recognised in the year see note 2 related to amounts recognised immediately, given that contingent revenues arising in future periods from these licensing activities were assessed as not significant.
Intangible assets In determining the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of businesses acquired, judgement is required in relation to final out-turn on contracts, discount rates and expected future cash flows and profitability.
Determining whether intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit to which the intangible assets are attached.
Note 11 provides details of the carrying value of intangible assets.
Retirement benefits In determining the valuation of defined benefit pension scheme assets and liabilities, a number of key assumptions, which are largely dependent on factors outside the control of the Group, have been made in relation to: Expected return on plan assets Inflation rate Mortality Discount rate Salary and pension increases.
Details of these assumptions used, together with sensitivity analysis on the discount rate and inflation rate, are included in note 31.
Deferred tax In determining the quantum of deferred tax assets to be recognised, judgement is required in assessing the extent to which it is probable that future taxable profit will arise in the companies concerned.
Management use forecasts of future taxable profits and make assumptions on growth rates for each entity at each year end in assessing the recoverability of assets recognised.
Off-balance sheet arrangements The Group is party to a number of contractual arrangements for the purposes of the Groups principal activities that are not required to be included on the Group balance sheet.
The principal off-balance sheet arrangements that the Group are party to are as follows: operating leases see note 28 pledged assets securing finance lease liabilities see note 10 and 11 contingent liabilities in respect of guarantees for deferred equity payments and performance contracts in PPP special purpose entities see note 26 capital commitments for capital expenditure and equity and subordinated debt in PPP special purpose entities see note 28 outsourcing contracts In respect of outsourcing contracts, the Group has entered into various arrangements to outsource the provision of certain back-office functions with a third-party provider.
These arrangements are on commercial terms and any penalty or termination clauses associated with these arrangements will not have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.

Change of accounting policy Upon the adoption of the amendment to IAS 19 on 1 January 2013, the Group has restated prior period information, which has had the following impact on reported profit and earnings per share: Income statement Year ended 31 December 2012 m m Profit before tax as previously reported 179.5 Impact of amendment to IAS 19 operating profit 4.5 net financial expense 10.2 14.7 Profit before tax restated 164.8 Taxation as previously reported 13.3 Impact of amendment to IAS 19 3.4 Taxation restated 9.9 Profit after tax restated 154.9 Pence per Earnings per share share Basic earnings per share as previously reported 37.2 Impact of amendment to IAS 19 2.6 Basic earnings per share restated 34.6 Diluted earnings per share as previously reported 37.0 Impact of amendment to IAS 19 2.6 Diluted earnings per share restated 34.4 The amendment to IAS 19 has also reduced underlying earnings per share by 2.6 pence for the year ended 31 December 2012.
Statement of comprehensive income Year ended 31 December 2012 Deferred Remeasurements Tax m m As previously reported 73.4 11.8 Impact of amendment to IAS 19 14.7 3.4 As restated 58.7 8.4 As described in note 1, the amendment to IAS 19 has changed the accounting for defined benefit schemes and termination benefits.
The interest cost and expected return on scheme assets used in the previous version of IAS 19 have been replaced with a net interest amount which is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit obligation.
This amendment has a corresponding impact on remeasurements recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, with no overall change to the net retirement benefit liability in the balance sheet.
Furthermore, certain costs previously recorded as part of finance expenses have now been presented within administrative expenses.
