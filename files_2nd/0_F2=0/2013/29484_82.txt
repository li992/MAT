CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Amortisation and recoverability of Deferred Acquisition Costs DAC and Deferred Income DIR Deferred acquisition costs on investment contracts are amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected lifetime of the underlying contracts.
The expected lifetime of the contracts has been estimated from the experienced termination rates and the age of clients at inception and maturity.
Deferred income is amortised on a straight line basis over the surrender penalty period as income is recognised from the policy.
Deferred acquisition costs and deferred income on insurance contracts are amortised over the period during which the costs are expected to be recoverable in accordance with the projected emergence of future margins.
Deferred acquisition costs relating to insurance and investment contracts are tested annually for recoverability by reference to expected future income levels.
Future income levels are projected using assumptions consistent with those underlying our embedded value calculation.
Acquired in-force business There have been no new business combinations generating acquired in-force business during the year.
The acquired value of the in-force business is amortised on a basis that reflects the expected profit stream arising from the business acquired at the date of acquisition.
This profit stream is estimated from the experienced termination rates, expenses of management and age of the clients under the individual contracts as well as global estimates of investment growth, based on recent experience at the date of acquisition.
The acquired value of in-force business relating to insurance and investment contracts is tested annually for recoverability by reference to expected future income levels.
Valuing capital losses in unit funds In line with IAS 12, the Group has recognised a deferred tax asset in relation to capital losses at the reporting date.
This asset has been tested for impairment against the level of capital gains realistically expected to arise in future.
Much of the benefit of the deferred tax asset on capital losses will be shared with policyholders.
The policyholder investment contract liability has therefore been increased to reflect the fair value of this additional benefit.
The assumptions that have a significant effect on the fair value of the liability are as follows: The assumed rate of investment return, which is based on current gilt yields.
The lapse assumption, which is set prudently based on experience during the year.
The assumed period for development of capital gains, which is estimated from recent experience.
Determining the value of deferred tax assets In line with IAS 12, the Group has recognised deferred tax assets for future tax benefits that will accrue.
The asset value has taken into consideration the likelihood of appropriate future income or gains against which the tax asset can be utilised.
In particular future investment income from the existing assets will be sufficient to utilise the unrelieved expenses and capital gains crystallising in the unit linked funds will utilise the capital losses.
Tax assets in relation to deferred income will be utilised as the underlying income is recognised.
SEGMENT REPORTING IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Board in order to allocate resources to the segment and to assess its performance.
