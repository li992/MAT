It will be paid on 19 July 2013 to shareholders who are on the Register of Members on 21 June 2013.
The final dividend is in addition to the third quarterly interim dividend of 7.4p or 57.8m paid on 17 April 2013 2012: 7.2p or 56.1m.
The total dividend paid and proposed in respect of the year ended 31 March 2013 is 29.8p 2012: 29.0p.
The Company operates a scrip dividend scheme which provides shareholders with the opportunity to receive their dividend in shares as opposed to cash.
Shares issued in lieu of dividends during the year, all of which were non-PID distributions, totalled 50.4m 2012: 66.6m.
The difference between the gross dividend of 228.8m and the amount reported in the consolidated cash flow for the year of 178.3m is the shares issued in lieu of dividends 50.4m, the timing of the payment of the related withholding tax 0.8m and unpaid dividends refunded during the year 0.9m.
A cash dividend may be paid as a PID, a non-PID, or a mixture of the two.
Following the enactment of the Finance No.
3 Act 2010, the issue of ordinary shares under the scrip in lieu of a cash dividend can also qualify as a PID, a non-PID, or a mixture of the two.
Confirmation of whether PID or non-PID treatment to a particular dividend will apply will be announced prior to the relevant ex-dividend date.
The scrip dividend alternative for the proposed final quarterly dividend will be a non-PID.

Prior to the acquisition, the Group held 92.5m units in X-Leisure a 12% holding, which was recorded within other investments.
As a result of this transaction, the Groups holding in X-Leisure increased to 54%.
The acquisition increases the proportion of leisure assets in the Groups business in line with the Groups strategic objectives for the Retail Portfolio.
X-Leisure owns 99.9% of the X-Leisure Limited Partnership, with the remaining 0.1% ownership being with X-Leisure GP Limited.
On the same day, the Group acquired 100% of both X-Leisure GP Limited and X-Leisure Limited previously owned 50% by Capital & Regional Property Management Limited and 50% by AREA X-L Management Limited.
The acquisition of additional units in X-Leisure, together with the acquisition of X-Leisure GP Limited and X-Leisure Limited resulted in the Group obtaining control of X-Leisure from 16 January 2013.
The transaction has therefore been accounted for as a business combination, achieved in stages.
The fair value of the consideration paid to acquire the 42% holding was 112.0m, being the cash consideration.
The previously held interest has been measured at fair value at the acquisition date.
As a result of this, a gain of 2.3m has been recognised in other comprehensive income and recycled to the income statement.
The fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired is set out in the table below: Fair value m Assets Investment property 545.0 Investment in joint venture 29.0 Finance lease receivable 18.4 Cash 25.2 Trade and other receivables 6.0 Total assets 623.6 Liabilities Borrowings 305.8 Trade and other payables 7.1 Accruals and deferred income 22.0 Derivative financial instruments 11.7 Total liabilities 346.6 Net assets 277.0 Fair value of previously held interest 32.9 Redemption liability 129.7 Fair value of consideration paid 112.0 Gain on acquisition of subsidiary 2.4 130 Land Securities Annual Report 2013 eSSenTIaL reaD DIrecTorS rePorT governance fInancIaL STaTemenTS InveSTor reSource fInancIaL STaTemenTS notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 march 2013 continued 29. business combination continued The fair value of the consideration, the redemption liability and the previously held interest are less than the value of the identifiable assets and, as a result, a gain of 2.4m has been recognised in the income statement on acquisition within net gain on business combination.
Also included within this line are transaction related costs of 3.3m and the gain on the revaluation of the previously held investment of 2.3m.
The gain on bargain purchase of 2.4m reflects the discount achieved on the purchase of the units, together with the impact of the net fair value adjustments recorded on acquisition.
The fair value of trade and other receivables is 6.0m and includes trade receivables with a fair value of 2.7m.
The gross contractual amount for trade receivables due is 3.9m, of which 1.2m is expected to be uncollectible.
In March 2013, the Group acquired a further 5% holding in X-Leisure for 16.3m, increasing the Groups total holding to 59%.
Pro forma information During the year the acquired companies contributed 10.7m to the revenue of the Group and 4.9m to the profit for the year.
The pro forma consolidated results of the Group, as if the acquisitions had been made on 1 April 2012, would show an increase to revenue of 39.2m and an increase to profit after taxation of 14.7m.
In calculating the pro forma information, the results of the acquired companies for the period before acquisition have been adjusted to reflect the Groups accounting policies and the fair value adjustments made on acquisition.
The information is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of the combined Group that would have occurred had the purchases actually been made at the beginning of the year, or indicative of future results of the combined Group.
30. derivative financial instruments 2013 2012 Group m m Current liabilities 9.1 Non-current liabilities 10.7 6.5 Total 19.8 6.5 Interest-rate swaps The Group uses interest-rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest-rate movements on its interest-bearing loans and investments.
The fair value of these contracts is recorded in the balance sheet and is determined by discounting future cash flows at the prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date.
The change in fair value of the contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments is taken to the income statement.
For contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges the change in the fair value of the contracts is recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income.
There was no ineffectiveness to be recognised from the designated cash flow hedges in either the current or prior year.

Debt investors benefit from security over a pool of investment properties, development properties and the Groups investment in the Bristol Alliance Limited Partnership, the Westgate Oxford Alliance Limited Partnership and the Victoria Circle Limited Partnership, valued at 9.3bn at 31 March 2013 2012: 8.8bn.
The Groups investment in the Victoria Circle Limited Partnership was charged to the Security Group in the year ended 31 March 2013.
The secured debt structure has a tiered operating covenant regime which gives the Group substantial flexibility when the loan to value and interest cover in the Security Group are less than 65% and more than 1.45 times respectively.
If these limits are exceeded the operating environment becomes more restrictive with provisions to encourage the reduction in gearing see note 32.
The interest rate is fixed until the expected maturity, being two years before the legal maturity date for each MTN, whereupon the interest rate for the last two years is LIBOR plus a step-up margin.
The effective interest rate includes the amortisation of issue costs.
The MTNs are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and their fair values are based on their respective market prices.
Syndicated bank debt At 31 March 2013 the Group had a 1.085bn authorised credit facility with a maturity of December 2016, which was 330.0m drawn.
This facility is committed and is secured on the assets of the Security Group.
Also included are bank facilities of 293.4m, arising on the acquisition of X-Leisure.
Undrawn facilities at 31 March 2013 were 28.6m and the facilities mature in December 2013 and March 2014.

In March 2013, the borrowing under this facility was repaid and the facility cancelled in full.
At the same time a new facility for the same amount was entered into, which matures in March 2018.
The new facility was 95.0m drawn at 31 March 2013.
A further committed bilateral facility of 165.0m, maturing in May 2014, is available to the Group and was 75.0m drawn at 31 March 2013 2012: nil.
The bilateral facilities are secured on the assets of the Security Group.
Also included in bilateral facilities is a 36.9m facility arising on the acquisition of X-Leisure.
The facility was fully drawn at 31 March 2013 and matures in June 2013.
Queen Annes Gate Bond On 29 July 2009, the Group issued a 360.3m bond secured on the rental cash flows from the commercial lease with the UK Government over Queen Annes Gate, QAG.
The QAG Bond is a fully amortising bond with a final maturity in February 2027 and a fixed interest rate of 5.253% per annum.
At 31 March 2013 the bond had an amortised book value of 329.0m 2012: 339.4m.

The new MTNs did not meet the IAS 39 requirement to be substantially different from the debt that it replaced.
Consequently the book value of the new debt is reduced to the book value of the original debt by the bond exchange fide-recognition adjustment which is then amortised to zero over the life of the new MTNs.
The amortisation is charged to net interest expenses in the income statement.
FiNaNcial risk maNagemeNt Introduction A review of the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing and monitoring risk is set out in the Financial review pages 26 to 31 and Our principal risks and how we manage them pages 32 to 35.
This note provides further detail on financial risk management and includes quantitative information on specific financial risks.
The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks: market risks principally interest-rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management strategy seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects of these on the Groups financial performance and includes the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Financial risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Capital structure The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders equity and net borrowings, including cash held on deposit.
The type and maturity of the Groups borrowings are analysed further in note 31 and the Groups equity is analysed into its various components in the Statement of changes in equity.
Capital is managed so as to promote the long-term success of the business and to maintain sustainable returns for shareholders.
The Groups strategy is to maintain an appropriate net debt to total equity ratio gearing and loan-to-value ratio LTV to ensure that asset level performance is translated into enhanced returns for shareholders whilst maintaining an appropriate risk reward balance to accommodate changing financial and operating market cycles.
As the Group came out of the last property downturn, its objective was to see rising asset values reduce gearing and LTV ratios.
The following table details a number of the Groups key metrics in relation to managing its capital structure: 134 Land Securities Annual Report 2013 ESSENTIAL rEAD DIrECTorS rEPorT govErNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INvESTor rESourCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts for the year ended 31 March 2013 continued 32.
This represents the 40.6% interest in X-Leisure which we do not own but is consolidated in the Group numbers.
The following table summarises the Groups financial assets and liabilities into the categories required by IFRS 7, Financial Instruments, Disclosure: 2013 2012 Group m m Available-for-sale financial assets 32.3 Loans and receivables 405.4 810.4 Financial liabilities at amortised cost 4,133.1 3,624.9 Net financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss 19.8 6.5 Other 118.1 3,865.6 2,788.7 Financial risk factors i Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, finance lease receivables, amounts due from joint ventures, loans to third parties and commercial property backed loan notes.
Further details concerning the credit risk of counterparties is provided in the note that specifically relates to each type of asset.
Bank and financial institutions One of the principal credit risks of the Group arises from financial derivative instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions.
In line with the policy approved by the Board of Directors, where the Group manages the deposit only independently-rated banks and financial institutions with a minimum rating of Aare accepted.
Group Treasury currently performs a weekly review of the credit ratings of all its financial institution counterparties.
Furthermore, Group Treasury ensures that funds deposited with a single financial institution remain within the Groups policy limits.
Land Securities Annual Report 2013 135 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts for the year ended 31 March 2013 continued 32.
FiNaNcial risk maNagemeNt coNtiNued Trade receivables Trade receivables are presented in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
Impairment is made where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables concerned.
The balance is low relative to the scale of the balance sheet and, owing to the long-term nature and diversity of the Groups tenancy arrangements, the credit risk of trade receivables is considered to be low.
Furthermore, a credit report is obtained from an independent rating agency prior to the inception of a lease with a new counterparty.
This report is used to determine the size of the deposit that is required from the tenant at inception.
In general these deposits represent between three and six months rent.
Finance lease receivables This balance relates to amounts receivable from tenants in respect of tenant finance leases.
This is not considered a significant credit risk as the tenants are generally of good financial standing.
Loans to third parties A loan maturing in 2035 was made to Semperian PPP formerly Trillium Investment Partners LP as part of the disposal of the Trillium business.
This loan is not considered a significant credit risk as it is repayable from dividends from investments in government infrastructure projects.
ii Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains a mixture of notes with final maturities between 2015 and 2036, and medium-term committed bank facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for its operations and its committed capital expenditure programme.
Management monitors the Groups available funds as follows: March December September June March 2013 2012 2012 2012 2012 Group m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 41.7 43.1 19.3 31.5 29.7 Undrawn committed credit lines 913.6 1,010.0 1,130.0 1,025.0 1,085.0 Available funds 955.3 1,053.1 1,149.3 1,056.5 1,114.7 As a proportion of drawn debt 23.0% 28.1% 31.7% 28.3% 30.3% The Groups core financing structure is in the Security Group, although the remaining Non-Restricted Group may also secure independent funding.
Security Group The Groups principal financing arrangements utilise the credit support of a ring-fenced group of assets the Security Group that comprises the majority of the Groups investment property portfolio.
These arrangements operate in tiers determined by LTV and Interest cover ratio ICR.
This structure is most flexible at lower tiers with a lower LTV and a higher ICR and allows property acquisitions, disposals and developments to occur with relative freedom.
In higher tiers, the requirements become more prescriptive.
No financial covenant default is triggered until the applicable LTV exceeds 100% or the ICR is less than 1.0x.
As at 31 March 2013, the reported LTV for the Security Group was 37.7% 2012: 37.6%, meaning that the Group was operating in Tier 1 and benefited from maximum operational flexibility.
Management monitors the key covenants attached to the Security Group on a monthly basis, including LTV, ICR, sector and regional concentration and disposals.
Non-Restricted Group The Non-Restricted Group obtains funding when required from a combination of inter-company loans from the Security Group, equity and external bank debt.
Bespoke credit facilities are established with banks when required for the Non-Restricted Group projects and joint ventures, usually on a limited-recourse basis.

FiNaNcial risk maNagemeNt coNtiNued The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the expected maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.
2013 Between Between Less than 1 and 2 2 and 5 Over 1 year years years 5 years Group m m m m Borrowings excluding finance lease liabilities 625.4 264.8 981.8 4,429.2 Finance lease liabilities 2.2 2.2 6.7 259.1 Derivative financial instruments 9.1 7.9 2.8 Trade payables 6.6 Capital payables 32.5 Redemption liability 118.1 675.8 393.0 991.3 4,688.3 2012 Less than Between Between Over 1 year 1 and 2 years 2 and 5 years 5 years Group m m m m Borrowings excluding finance lease liabilities 193.2 313.5 862.3 4,623.8 Finance lease liabilities 2.1 3.6 3.5 203.5 Derivative financial instruments 6.5 Trade payables 7.4 Capital payables 48.1 250.8 317.1 872.3 4,827.3 iii Market risk The Group is exposed to market risk through interest rates and availability of credit.
Interest rates The Group uses derivative products to manage its interest-rate exposure, and has a hedging policy that generally requires at least 80% of its existing debt plus increases in debt associated with net committed capital expenditure to be at fixed interest rates for the coming five years.
Due to a combination of factors, principally the high level of certainty required under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, hedging instruments used in this context do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Specific interest-rate hedges are also used within our joint ventures to fix the interest rate exposure on limited-recourse debt.
Where specific hedges are used in geared joint ventures to fix the interest exposure on limited-recourse debt, these may qualify for hedge accounting.
At 31 March 2013, the Group including joint ventures had 1.2bn 2012: 0.6bn of interest rate swaps in place, and its net debt was 90.7% fixed 2012: 94.8%.
Based on the Groups debt balances at 31 March 2013, a 1% increase in interest rates would increase the net interest payable in the income statement by 5.0m 2012: 3.0m.
The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the variable rate borrowings, net of interest-rate swaps and cash and cash equivalents.
Foreign exchange Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the Groups functional currency.
The Group does not normally enter into any foreign currency transactions as it is UK based.
However, where significant committed expenditure in foreign currencies is identified, it is the Groups policy to hedge 100% of that exposure by entering into forward purchases of foreign currency to fix the Sterling value.
Therefore the Groups foreign-exchange risk is low.
The Group had no foreign currency exposure at 31 March 2013 or at 31 March 2012.

Net peNsioN surplus deFicit Defined contribution scheme A defined contribution scheme was introduced on 1 January 1999 for all new administrative and senior property based employees, subject to eligibility, together with a separate similar scheme, effective 1 April 1998, for other property based employees.
Pension costs for defined contribution schemes are as follows: 2013 2012 Group m m Defined contribution schemes 2.1 2.0 Defined benefit scheme The Pension & Assurance Scheme of the Land Securities Group of Companies the Scheme is a wholly-funded scheme, and the assets of the Scheme are held in a self-administered trust fund which is separate from the Groups assets.
Contributions to the Scheme are determined by a qualified independent actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit credit method.
As the Scheme is closed to new members, the current service cost is expected to increase as a percentage of salary of the Scheme members, under the projected unit credit method, as members approach retirement.
A full actuarial valuation of the Land Securities Scheme was undertaken on 30 June 2012 by the independent actuaries, Hymans Robertson Consultants & Actuaries.
As a result of this valuation, the Trustees and the Group have agreed that, in order to address the deficit at that time, a combined employee and employer contribution rate of 44% of pensionable salary will be paid, together with additional employer contributions of 4m per annum, for a period of six years commencing on 1 July 2013.
Employees currently contribute 5% of this combined contribution rate.
This valuation was updated to 31 March 2013 using, where required, assumptions prescribed by IAS 19, Employee Benefits.
The next full actuarial valuation will be performed as at 30 June 2015.
All death-in-service and incapacity benefits arising during employment are wholly insured.
No post-retirement benefits other than pensions are made available to employees of the Group.
The major assumptions used in the valuation, were in nominal terms : 2013 2012 Group % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.50 3.50 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.50 3.50 Discount rate 4.30 4.80 Inflation Retail Price Index 3.50 3.50 Consumer Price Index 2.70 2.70 Expected return on scheme assets 4.83 5.25 Land Securities Annual Report 2013 139 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts for the year ended 31 March 2013 continued 34.
Net peNsioN surplus deFicit coNtiNued The expected return on scheme assets is based on expectations for bonds and equities.
At the year end, the expected return on bonds is based on market yields of long-dated bonds at that date.
The expected return on equities includes an additional equity-risk premium.
On 1 April 2013 an amendment to IAS 19 Employee Benefits will be adopted by the Group note 2, at which point the finance income on assets will be calculated with reference to the discount rate and not the expected rate of return on scheme assets.
The mortality assumptions used in this valuation were: 2013 2012 Group years years Life expectancy at age 60 for current pensioners Men 30.9 30.0 Women 32.2 31.7 Life expectancy at age 60 for future pensioners current age 40 Men 33.7 33.1 Women 34.0 34.9 The fair value of the assets in the scheme including annuities purchased to provide certain pensions in payment and the expected rate of return net of investment management expenses were: 2013 2012 2013 2012 Group % % m m Equities 7.00 7.50 66.4 59.6 Bonds and insurance contracts 4.30 3.98 125.6 101.8 Other 0.50 0.50 0.8 1.0 Fair value of scheme assets 192.8 162.4 Present value of scheme liabilities 186.9 164.8 Net pension surplus deficit 5.9 2.4 The major categories of scheme assets as a percentage of total scheme assets are as follows: 2013 2012 Group % % Equities 34 37 Bonds and insurance contracts 66 63 The scheme assets do not include any directly owned financial instruments issued by the Company.
Indirectly owned financial instruments had a fair value of less than 0.1m 2012: 0.1m.

The assumptions agreed with the Trustees of the Scheme for the triennial valuation and subsequent interim updates differ from those described by IAS 19, Employee Benefits.
Using the assumptions agreed with the Trustees would result in a balance sheet deficit for the Scheme of 22.8m at 31 March 2013 as opposed to a surplus of 5.9m.
