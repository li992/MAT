120 | Capita plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 26 Financial instruments Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments are comprised of cash, bank loans, bond issues, loan notes, finance leases and derivatives.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations and to manage the Groups financial risks.
The Group also has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions.
These are interest rate swaps, currency swaps, fixed rate interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts.
Their purpose is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Carrying values and fair values of financial instruments The following table analyses by classification and category the Groups financial instruments excluding short term debtors, creditors, fund payables receivables and cash in hand that are carried in the financial statements.
The values below represent the carrying amounts.
The carrying values are a reasonable approximation of fair value other than 2 fixed rate bonds totalling 125.0m, included below in the bond value of 1,267.3m, with a carrying value of 125.0m and a fair value of 125.9m.
The fair value of these bonds has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and this fair value measurement would be categorised within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

To remove the Groups exposure to currency fluctuations it has entered into currency swaps which effectively hedge the movement in the bonds fair value due to changes in prevailing foreign exchange and interest rates.
The interest rate swap is being used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of GBP denominated bonds.
The fair values of the currency and interest swaps are disclosed in note 16 Financial assets and in note 22 Financial liabilities in the current year.

The valuation models incorporate various inputs including foreign exchange spot and forward rates and interest rate curves.
Unlisted equity securities and investment loans are held at amortised cost.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with multiple counterparties, all of which are financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings.
Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
As at 31 December 2013, the Group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value: 2013 2012 m m Assets measured at fair value Non-designated foreign exchange forward contracts 0.1 Interest rate swaps in relation to GBP denominated bonds 7.7 15.9 Currency swaps in relation to US$ denominated bonds 139.4 206.5 Liabilities measured at fair value Bonds 1,142.3 1,320.1 Cash flow hedges 30.2 22.5 Non-designated foreign exchange forward contracts 1.8 0.4 Currency swaps in relation to US$ denominated bonds 13.5 0.3 Fixed rate interest rate swaps 26.6 52.9 Public sector subsidiary partnership payment 52.2 Put options of non-controlling interests 96.0 Contingent consideration 35.2 26.8 During both years the Group only had Level 2 assets or liabilities measured at fair value apart from contingent consideration, the public sector subsidiary partnership payment and the put options of non-controlling interests which are Level 3 liabilities.
It is the Groups policy to recognise transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred.
During the year ended 31 December 2013, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and no transfers into or out of Level 3 fair value measurements.
Contingent consideration arises in business acquisitions where the Group has agreed to pay the vendors additional consideration dependent on the achievement of performance targets in the periods post acquisition.
These performance periods are of up to 3 years in duration and will be settled in cash and loan notes on their payment date on achieving the relevant target.
The Group makes provision for such contingent consideration for each acquisition based on an assessment of its fair value at the acquisition date.
Contingent consideration has been calculated based on the Groups expectation of what it will pay in relation to the post-acquisition performance of the acquired entities by weighting the probability of a range of payments to give an estimate of the final obligation.
A sensitivity analysis was performed on the expected contingent consideration of 35.2m.
The sensitivity analysis performed adjusted the probability of payment of the contingent amounts.
A 10% increase in the probability of contingent consideration being paid results in an increase in potential contingent consideration of 1.6m.
A 10% decrease in the probability of the contingent consideration being paid results in a decrease in potential contingent consideration of 2.5m.
122 | Capita plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 26 Financial instruments continued The public sector subsidiary partnership payment liability is an estimate of the annual preferred payments to be made by Axelos Limited the partnership formed with the Cabinet Office to the Cabinet Office in years 4 to 10.
This payment is funded by Axelos Limited and is contingent on profits.
The fair value of 52.2m has been derived by discounting the expected payment at the Group cost of debt to arrive at its present value.
If the discount rate was to increase decrease by 1% the present value would decrease increase by 3m.
The put options of the non-controlling interests see note 22 are valued based on the expected redemption value of the shares that will be paid in cash by the Group.
This value is determined by reference to the expected date of exercise of the options, which is then discounted to arrive at a present value.
The sensitivity of the valuation to movements in both the discount rate and the cash flows that have been used to calculate it, are as follows: a 10% increase decrease in the earnings potential of the business results in a 9.0m increase decrease in the valuation: a 1% increase decrease in the discount rate applied to the valuation results in a 4.6m decrease 4.9m increase in the valuation.
The following table shows the reconciliation from the opening balances to the closing balances for Level 3 fair values.

The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate financial instruments to generate the desired interest rate profile and to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The Group has primarily issued fixed rate coupon US$ denominated bonds, which have been swapped to floating rate GBP liabilities at the date of issuance using currency swaps.
These currency swaps are designated as fair value hedges against changes in the fair value of the bonds due to changes in prevailing foreign currency exchange and interest rates.
In February 2008, Capita executed a series of fixed rate interest rate swaps to convert from paying floating rate GBP interest to fixed rate GBP interest on certain of its swapped bonds.
Up to June 2012, the counterparty held the option to cancel these swaps on each semi-annual coupon payment date.
In June 2012, the counterpartys option to cancel was removed, the duration of the swaps was extended and the fixed rate was reduced, taking advantage of the lower prevailing interest rate environment.
These fixed rate interest rate swaps are not designated in any hedge relationship so their change in fair value is recognised in net finance costs in the income statement see note 9 Net finance costs.
Following the fall in prevailing interest rates at the end of 2008 and the low base interest rates maintained thereafter, these fixed rate interest rate swaps show a negative mark to market value of 26.6m at 31 December 2013 2012: negative mark to market value of 52.9m.
This movement results in a non-cash accounting gain in the year of 26.3m 2012: loss of 8.2m.
In addition to the fixed rate bonds of 504.6m in issue as at 31 December 2013 underlying value not adjusted for the impact of the swaps, the Group had a further 630.1m of swapped bonds, a 200.0m 2-year term loan and a 425.0m undrawn committed revolving credit facility, all paying floating rate interest.
This gives the Group as a whole a balanced interest rate risk profile through the use of both fixed and floating rate financial instruments.
The interest rate profile of the interest-bearing financial assets and liabilities of the Group as at 31 December is as follows: Within Between Between Between Between More 1 year 12 years 23 years 34 years 45 years than 5 years Total At 31 December 2013 m m m m m m m Fixed rate Bonds 13.1 24.7 179.7 125.5 77.4 178.6 599.0 Obligations under finance leases 4.9 5.2 5.0 2.2 17.3 Foreign currency swaps in relation to US$ denominated bonds 2.7 38.8 35.1 21.8 3.1 95.3 Fixed rate interest rate swaps 0.2 0.9 7.6 6.0 3.7 8.2 26.6 Floating rate Cash in hand 610.8 610.8 Overdraft 453.0 453.0 Investment loan 0.3 3.5 4.0 5.0 8.0 20.8 Bonds 86.7 32.0 125.5 424.1 668.3 Term loan 200.0 200.0 Cash flow hedges 6.0 4.6 5.2 5.4 5.4 3.6 30.2 Non-designated foreign exchange forward contracts 0.4 0.5 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 1.7 Interest rate swap in relation to GBP denominated bonds 2.7 5.0 7.7 Foreign currency swaps in relation to US$ denominated bonds 12.0 1.8 28.1 7.7 30.6 Strategic report Governance Accounts Capita plc | 123 26 Financial instruments continued Within Between Between Between Between More than 1 year 12 years 23 years 34 years 45 years 5 years Total At 31 December 2012 m m m m m m m Fixed rate Bonds 95.0 13.7 24.7 190.7 134.3 74.3 532.7 Obligations under finance leases 1.1 0.8 0.5 0.3 2.7 Foreign currency swaps in relation to US$ denominated bonds 6.9 3.6 49.9 43.4 103.8 Fixed rate interest rate swaps 1.4 0.4 1.6 11.4 9.0 29.1 52.9 Floating rate Cash in hand 747.3 747.3 Overdraft 440.6 440.6 Investment loan 0.3 0.5 3.5 4.0 5.0 7.7 21.0 Bonds 91.0 33.5 712.9 837.4 Term loan 185.0 185.0 Cash flow hedges 2.6 3.8 2.8 3.6 4.0 5.7 22.5 Non-designated foreign exchange forward contracts 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.4 Interest rate swap in relation to GBP denominated bonds 4.2 11.7 15.9 Foreign currency swaps in relation to US$ denominated bonds 14.8 0.3 87.9 102.4 The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.

The Group is not generally exposed to significant foreign currency risk except in respect of its cash flows in overseas operations in India which generate exposure to movements in the INR GBP exchange rates.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of this exposure by entering forward currency contracts in the form of Non-deliverable Forward Contracts NDFs to fix the GBP cost of highly probable forecast transactions denominated in INR.
It is the Groups policy to negotiate the terms of the hedge derivatives to match the terms of the underlying cash flows in order to maximise hedge effectiveness.
At 31 December 2013, the Group had cash flow hedges in place against forecast monthly INR costs in 2014 and each year up to and including 2019.
These forecast INR costs have been determined on the basis of the underlying cash flows associated with the delivery of services under signed contracts which run to 2019.

The Group had interest rate swaps in place with a notional amount of 117.0m 2012: 117.0m whereby it receives a weighted average fixed rate of interest of 5.46% 2012: fixed rate of interest 5.46% and pays variable rates based on 6-month GBP LIBOR.
The swap is being used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of 117.0m 2012: 117.0m of the Groups bonds.
The Group had in place currency swaps whereby it receives a fixed rate of interest and pays a variable rate based on 6-month GBP LIBOR.
The currency swaps are being used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of 867.7m 2012: 905.8m of the Groups bonds, which have coupon rates ranging from 3.72% to 6.51%.
The currency swaps are being used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of its US dollar issued bonds.
The bonds, currency and interest rate swaps have the same critical terms including the amount and the date of maturity see note 22.
The total loss in the year on the fair value hedges of 90.0m 2012: total loss 37.8m, excluding credit risk, was equal to the gain on the hedged items resulting in no net gain or loss in the income statement.
The Group may, at its option, upon notice of not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days, repay at any time all or part of the notes at no more than the present value of future payments.
Cash flow hedges As noted above, the Group holds a series of forward exchange currency contracts in the form of NDFs designated as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions in INR of the Groups Indian operations.
2013 2012 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Forward exchange contracts m m m m Fair value 30.2 22.5 The terms of the forward currency contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the commitments.
The cash flow hedges are in respect of highly probable forecast monthly costs, based on long term contracts that the Group has in place, denominated in INR up to 2019.
These were assessed to be highly effective as at 31 December 2013 and a net unrealised loss of 30.2m 2012: loss of 22.5m less deferred tax of 6.0m 2012: 5.2m was recognised in equity.
The net loss recognised on cash flow hedges during the year was 10.3m 2012: net loss 11.3m whilst net losses of 2.6m 2012: gains of 1.2m were reclassified to the income statement and included in administrative expenses.
The tax effect of the net movement in cash flow hedges during the year was a credit of 0.8m 2012: credit of 2.7m.
Credit risk The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties.
It is the Groups policy that all clients who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, such as cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale financial investments, investment loan and certain derivative instruments, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
The Group manages its operations to avoid any excessive concentration of counterparty risk and the Group takes all reasonable steps to seek assurance from the counterparties to ensure that they can fulfil their obligations.
The Group has a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of the above receivables and instruments.
The mark to market movement on derivatives includes the extent to which the fair value of these instruments has been affected by the perceived change in the creditworthiness of the counterparties to those instruments and that of the Group itself own credit risk.
The Group is comfortable that the risk attached to those counterparties is not significant and believes that the currency swaps continue to act as an effective hedge against the movements in the fair value of the Groups issued US$ denominated bonds.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to hold cash and undrawn committed facilities at a level sufficient to ensure that the Group has available funds to meet its medium term capital and funding obligations, including organic growth and acquisition activities, and to meet any unforeseen obligations and opportunities.
The Group holds cash and undrawn committed facilities to enable the Group to manage its liquidity risk.
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a daily cash management process.
This process considers the maturity of both the Groups financial investments and financial assets e. g. accounts receivable, other financial assets and projected cash flows from operations.
The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of multiple sources of funding including bonds, bank loans, term loans, loan notes, overdrafts and finance leases over a broad spread of maturities to 2021.
Strategic report Governance Accounts Capita plc | 125 26 Financial instruments continued The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2013 based on contractual undiscounted payments.
In general, under such agreements the amounts owed to each counterparty on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same currency are aggregated into a single amount that is payable by 1 party to the other.
In certain circumstances e. g. when a credit event such as a default occurs, all outstanding transactions under the agreement are terminated, the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable in settlement of all transactions.
The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the statement of financial position.
This is because the Group does not have any currently enforceable right to offset recognised amounts, because the right to offset is enforceable only on the occurrence of future events such as a default on the bank loans or other credit events.
In addition, the Groups banks have the right to set off amounts owed to them under ISDA master netting agreements and loans against cash amounts held by the relevant Group member with that bank, but only in certain circumstances e. g. when a credit event such as a default occurs.
The Group also has notional cash pools with its banks under which the bank may net cash balances with overdrafts held by other members of the Group.

The Group has covenanted to maintain a specified consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated net interest expense coverage ratio, the terms of which have been adhered to during the year.
The Group manages its capital structure, and makes adjustments to it, in the light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012.
