Segment information continued Internal revenue and costs Intra group revenue generated from the sale of regulated products and services is based on market price.
Intra group revenue from the sale of other products and services is agreed between the relevant lines of business and therefore line of business profitability can be impacted by transfer pricing levels.
BT Global Services does not generate internal revenue from the other lines of business.
The majority of internal trading relates to Openreach and arises on rentals, and any associated connection or migration charges, of the UK access lines and other network products to the customer-facing lines of business.
This occurs both directly, and also indirectly, through BT TSO which is included within the Other segment.
Internal revenue arising in BT Retail relates primarily to BT Ireland and BT Enterprises.
Internal revenue arising in BT Wholesale relates mainly to the sale of line cards and access electronic services to Openreach.
