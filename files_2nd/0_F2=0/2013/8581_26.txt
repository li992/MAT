com Stock code: ITV Section 4: Capital Structure and Financing Costs In this section...
This section outlines how the Group manages its capital structure and related financing costs, including its balance sheet liquidity and access to capital markets.
The Directors determine the appropriate capital structure of ITV, specifically, how much is raised from shareholders equity and how much is borrowed from financial institutions debt in order to finance the Groups activities both now and in the future.
The Directors consider the Groups capital structure and dividend policy at least twice a year ahead of announcing results and do so in the context of its ability to continue as a going concern, to execute the strategy and to deliver its business plan.
During the year the Groups credit rating improved, and the Board continued to focus on improving the efficiency of the balance sheet through the partial repurchase of the bilateral loan and the repurchase and redemption of the 2016 convertible bond.
In 2014 the Board will further review its policies on capital structure to support the strategy.
Any potential courses of action will take into account the Groups liquidity needs, flexibility to invest in the business, pension deficit initiatives and impact on credit ratings.
4.1 Net cash Keeping it simple... Net cash is the Groups key measure used to evaluate total cash resources net of the current outstanding debt.
In defining total outstanding debt the Directors consider it appropriate to include: the currency impact of swaps held against those debt instruments: equity components of debt instruments principally the convertible bond which was settled in the year : and the amortised cost adjustment which reflects the increase in coupon rates for specific bonds caused by the change in ITVs credit status to and from investment grade in between August 2008 and August 2013.

A derivative is a type of financial instrument typically used to manage risk.
A derivatives value changes over time in response to underlying variables such as exchange rates or interest rates and is entered into for a fixed period.
A hedge is where a derivative is used to manage an underlying exposure.
The Group is exposed to changes in interest rates on its net borrowings and to changes in foreign exchange rates on its foreign currency transactions and net assets.
In accordance with Board approved policies, which are included in note 4.5, the Group uses derivatives to hedge these underlying exposures.
Derivative financial instruments are initially included in the balance sheet at their fair value, either as assets or liabilities, and are subsequently remeasured at fair value or marked to market at each reporting date.
Movements in instruments measured at fair value are recorded in the income statement in net financing costs.
An interest rate swap is an instrument to exchange a fixed rate of interest for a floating rate, or vice versa, or one type of floating rate for another.
A cross-currency interest rate swap exchanges a fixed or floating interest rate in one currency for a floating or fixed interest rate in another currency.
Analysis of the derivatives used by the Group to hedge its exposure and the various methods used to calculate their respective fair values are detailed in this section.

The financial instruments included on the ITV statement of financial position are measured at either fair value or amortised cost.
The measurement of this fair value can in some cases be subjective, and can depend on the inputs used in the calculations.
ITV generally uses external valuations using market inputs or market values e. g. external share prices and does not calculate its own fair values.
The different valuation methods are called hierarchies and are described below.
The tables below set out the financial instruments included on the ITV statement of financial position at fair value.
