Fidelity China Special Situations PLC Annual Report 2013 35 Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITY The principal activity of the Company is that of an investment trust company within the meaning of Section 1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Companys annual Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, to the extent that they have been adopted by the European Union, and with the AICs Statement of Recommended Practice SORP.
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these Financial Statements are summarised below.
All of the Companys activities are inter-related and each activity is dependent on the others.
Accordingly, all significant operating decisions are based upon analysis of the Company as one segment and therefore segmental information is not required.
a Basis of accounting The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of investments and derivative assets and liabilities, and on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will continue to be granted.
b Changes in accounting policy and disclosures At the date of authorisation of these Financial Statements, the following Standards and Interpretations were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015 : and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement effective periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
It is anticipated that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material financial effect on the Financial Statements of the Company.
However, additional disclosures may be necessary and will be considered on their application.
c Presentation of the Income Statement In order to better reflect the activities of an investment company and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Income Statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been prepared alongside the Income Statement.
The net profit loss after taxation is the measure the Directors believe appropriate in assessing the Companys compliance with certain requirements set out in Section 1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. d Income Income from equity investments is credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement on the date on which the right to receive the payment is established, normally the ex dividend date.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as a gain in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Where appropriate certain derivatives, such as contracts for difference CFDs, are used.
Income derived from these is included in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
e Special dividends Special dividends are treated as a revenue receipt or a capital receipt depending on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
f Expenses and finance costs All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged as follows: Any performance fee, if due, is allocated entirely to capital, as the Board believes it reflects the capital performance of the Companys investments: The investment management fee and finance costs are allocated equally between revenue and capital: and All other expenses are allocated in full to revenue with the exception of those directly attributable to share issues or other capital events.
Fidelity China Special Situations PLC Annual Report 2013 36 Notes to the Financial Statements 2.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued g Taxation The taxation expense represents the sum of taxation currently payable and deferred taxation.
Taxation currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before taxation, as reported in the Income Statement, because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductable.
The Companys liability for current taxation is calculated using taxation rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred taxation is the taxation expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and the corresponding taxation bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred taxation liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Companies which are approved as Investment Trusts under Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 are not liable for UK taxation on capital gains.
The carrying amount of deferred taxation assets is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred taxation is calculated at the taxation rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred taxation is charged or credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement, except when it relates to items of a capital nature, in which case it is charged or credited to the capital column of the Income Statement.
h Foreign currency The Directors, having regard to the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its investors operate, have determined the functional currency to be UK sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are calculated in UK sterling at the rate of exchange ruling as at the date of the transactions.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the Balance Sheet date.
All capital gains and losses, including exchange differences on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in capital reserve.
i Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of capital growth and income.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the portolio is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition, the investments are designated by the Company as at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value, which is taken to be their cost.
Subsequently, the investments are valued at fair value, which is measured as bid or last market prices depending upon the convention of the exchange on which they are listed, where available, or otherwise at fair value based on published price quotations.
Investments which are not quoted or are not frequently traded, are stated at the Directors best estimate of fair value, based on recognised valuation techniques which may take account of recent arms length transactions in the investments.
In accordance with the AIC SORP, the Company includes transaction costs, incidental to the purchase or sale of investments, within gains losses on investments and has disclosed them in Note 10 below.
j Derivative instruments Where appropriate, certain permitted transactions in derivative instruments are used.
Derivative transactions into which the Company may enter include forward currency contracts, CFDs, futures and options.
They are valued at fair value which is measured as the quoted trade price for the contract.
Where such transactions are used to protect or enhance income, if the circumstances support this, then the income and expenses derived from them are included in Net derivative income via the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Where such transactions are used to protect or enhance capital, if the circumstances support this, the gains and losses derived from them are included in Net losses gains on derivative instruments held at fair value through profit or loss via the capital column of the Income Statement.
Any positions on such transactions open at the year end are reflected in the Balance Sheet at their fair value within Current assets and Current liabilities.
As part of an established policy, premiums received on written options are taken to capital and are included in Net losses gains on derivative instruments held at fair value through profit or loss via the capital column of the Income Statement.
During the year the Company has obtained equivalent exposure to Chinese and Hong Kong equities through the use of long CFDs.
The gearing level is monitored and reviewed by the Board on an ongoing basis.
Fidelity China Special Situations PLC Annual Report 2013 37 Notes to the Financial Statements 2.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued CFDs are valued at fair value which is measured as the difference between the settlement price and the value, calculated in accordance with accounting policy 2 i, of the under lying shares in the contract.
All gains and losses in the fair value of the CFDs are included in Net losses gains on derivative instruments held at fair value through profit or loss via the capital column of the Income Statement.
Income received from dividends on the long CFDs is included in Net derivative Income in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
k Bank loans Loans are initially included in the Financial Statements at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received net of any issue costs relating to the borrowing.
After initial recognition, the loans are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
l Capital reserve The following are transferred to capital reserve: Gains and losses on the disposal of investments, including derivatives: Changes in the fair value of investments, including derivatives, held at the year end: Foreign exchange gains and losses of a capital nature: Performance fee: 50% of the investment management fee: 50% of finance costs: Dividends receivable which are capital in nature: and Taxation charged or credited relating to items which are capital in nature.
As a result of technical guidance by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in TECH 02 10: Distributable Profits, changes in the fair value of investments which are readily convertible to cash, without accepting adverse terms at the Balance Sheet date, can be treated as realised.
Capital reserves realised and unrealised are shown in aggregate as capital reserve in the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Balance Sheet.
At the Balance Sheet date all investments held by the Company were listed on a recognised stock exchange and were considered to be readily convertible to cash, with the exception of level 3 investments with a fair value of 19,366,000 2012: 3,903,000. m Dividends Dividends payable to equity shareholders are recognised when the Companys obligation to make payment is established.

Both the NAV per Ordinary Share and the MSCI China Index are calculated on a total return basis.
No performance fee is payable for the year ended 31 March 2013 2012: none.

Key risks identified fall into two broad categories.
The first, external risks, are stock market, share price and discount and the second, internal risks, are portfolio and governance, operational, financial, compliance, administration etc.
This Note is incorporated in accordance with IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and refers to the identification, measurement and management of risks potentially affecting the value of financial instruments.
The Companys financial instruments comprise: Equity shares and equity linked notes: Derivative instruments which comprise CFDs, forward currency contracts and options written on stocks and equity indices: Cash, liquid resources and short-term debtors and creditors that arise from its operations: and Bank borrowings.
The risks identified by IFRS 7 arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk which comprises other price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the accounting period.
Fidelity China Special Situations PLC Annual Report 2013 46 Notes to the Financial Statements 18.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Market price risk Other price risk Other price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through price movements in its investment positions.
The Manager is responsible for actively monitoring the portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Other price risks arising from derivative positions, mainly to do with underlying exposures, are estimated using Value at Risk and Stress Tests as set out in, and in accordance with, the Companys Derivative Risk Measurement and Management Document.
The Board meets quarterly to review the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objective.
Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through share capital raised.
In addition, financing has been obtained through a two year, multicurrency revolving credit facility for US$150,000,000 taken out on 17 February 2012.
The Company has drawn down the whole of this facility as disclosed in Note 13 above.
The Company is exposed to a fair value interest rate risk on this facility if interest rates change.
The Company is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on cash at bank and amounts held at futures clearing houses and brokers.
The Company is exposed to a fair value interest rate risk on the fixed rate bank loan of US$150,000,000 2012: US$150,000,000.
The cash at bank and amounts held at futures clearing houses and brokers are shown in the Balance Sheet on page 34.
Foreign currency risk The Companys total return and balance sheet can be affected by foreign exchange rate movements because the Company has income, assets and liabilities which are denominated in currencies other than the Companys functional currency which is UK sterling.
Three principal areas have been identified where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: movements in currency exchange rates affecting the value of investments and bank loans: movements in currency exchange rates affecting short-term timing differences: and movements in currency exchange rates affecting income received.
The Company will also be subject to short-term exposure from exchange rate movements, for example, between the date when an investment is bought or sold and the date when settlement of the transaction occurs.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to UK sterling on receipt.

The Companys financial liabilities comprise short positions on derivative instruments, US dollar denominated bank loans and other payables.
The currency profile of these financial liabilities is shown below.

Short-term flexibility is achieved by the use of overdraft facilities if required.
Details of the Companys borrowing commitments are shown in Note 13 above.
Counterparty risk All securities and derivative instruments are transacted with brokers and carry the risk that the counterparty to a transaction may not meet its financial obligations.
All counterparties for any type of trading are assessed by an independent Credit Research and Analysis function and approved for use by the Managers.
Exposures to counterparties are monitored and reported regularly by the Managers to the Board.
Margin on exchange-traded derivatives mitigates counterparty risk exposure in accordance with the terms outlined in market standard ISDA derivative legal contracts.
Fidelity China Special Situations PLC Annual Report 2013 49 Notes to the Financial Statements 18.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Credit risk Investments may be adversely affected if any of the institutions with which money is deposited suffers insolvency or other financial difficulties.
All transactions are carried out with brokers that have been approved by the Managers and are settled on a delivery versus payment basis.
Limits are established for each broker and are kept under review by the Managers.
Exposure to credit risk arises on cash at bank, outstanding investment transactions and the derivative instruments.
Derivative instruments risk A Derivative Instrument Charter, including an appendix entitled Derivative Risk Measurement and Management, details the risks and risk management processes used by the Managers.
This Charter was approved by the Board and allows the use of derivative instruments for the following purposes: to gain exposure to equity markets, sectors or individual investments: to hedge equity market risk in the Companys investments with the intention of mitigating losses in the event of market falls: to enhance portfolio returns by writing call and put options: and to take short positions in equity markets which would benefit from a fall in the relevant market price in instances where the Manager believes the investment is overvalued.
These positions therefore distinguish themselves from other short exposures held for hedging purposes since they are expected to add risk to the portfolio.
The risk and investment performance of these instruments are managed by an experienced, specialist derivative team of the Managers using portfolio risk assessment tools for portfolio construction.
RISK SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Other price risk sensitivity analysis Changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk, may also affect both the Companys net profit after taxation for the year and the Companys Net Assets.
Details of how the Board sets risk parameters and performance objectives can be found in the Directors Report on pages 17 to 19.
An increase of 10% in the share prices of the investments designated at fair value through profit or loss at 31 March 2013 would have increased both the profit after taxation for the year and the Net Assets of the Company by 71,290,000 2012: the loss after taxation for the year would have decreased and the Net Assets of the Company would have increased by 62,971,000.
A decrease of 10% in the share prices of the investments designated at fair value through profit or loss would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Derivative instruments exposure sensitivity analysis The Company invests in CFDs to gain exposure to the equity market.
An increase of 10% in the share prices of the investments underlying the CFDs at 31 March 2013 would have increased both the profit after taxation for the year and the Net Assets of the Company by 3,934,000 2012: the loss after taxation for the year would have decreased and the Net Assets of the Company would have increased by 3,778,000.

Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis Based on the financial assets and liabilities held and interest rates at the Balance Sheet date, an increase of 0.5% in interest rates throughout the year would have decreased both the profit after taxation for the year and the Net Assets of the Company by 381,000 2012: the loss after taxation for the year would have increased and the Net Assets of the Company would have decreased by 349,000.
A decrease of 0.5% in interest rates throughout the year would have increased both the profit after taxation for the year and the Net Assets of the Company by 475,000 2012: the loss after taxation for the year would have decreased and the Net Assets of the Company would have increased by 449,000.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Foreign currency risk sensitivity analysis Based on the financial assets and liabilities held and the exchange rates ruling at the Balance Sheet date, if the UK sterling exchange rate had strengthened by 10% against the other currencies, both the profit after taxation for the year and the Net Assets of the Company would have decreased 2012: the loss after taxation for the year would have increased and the Net Assets of the Company would have decreased by the following amounts: 2013 2012 000 000 Australian dollar 400 Canadian dollar 47 Chinese renminbi 6,707 3,729 Hong Kong dollar 41,399 38,143 Korean won 378 Singapore dollar 2,028 1,163 Taiwan dollar 410 US dollar 8,760 5,529 59,751 48,942 If the UK sterling exchange rate had weakened by 10% against the other currencies, both the profit after taxation for the year and the Net Assets of the Company would have increased 2012: the loss after taxation for the year would have decreased and the Net Assets of the Company would have increased by the following amounts: 2013 2012 000 000 Australian dollar 488 Canadian dollar 57 Chinese renminbi 8,198 4,557 Hong Kong dollar 50,599 46,619 Korean won 463 Singapore dollar 2,479 1,422 Taiwan dollar 501 US dollar 10,707 6,758 73,029 59,819 Fidelity China Special Situations PLC Annual Report 2013 51 Notes to the Financial Statements 18.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Financial assets and liabilities are stated in the Balance Sheet at values which are not materially different to their fair values.
As explained in Note 2 i and 2 j above, investments are shown at fair value which is bid or last market price.
In the case of cash, book value approximates to fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments.
The exceptions are the US dollar denominated bank loans whose fair value has been calculated by discounting future cash flows at current US dollar interest rates.

Classification Input Level 1 Valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets Level 2 Valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 Level 3 Valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the Accounting Policies Notes 2 i and 2 j above.
