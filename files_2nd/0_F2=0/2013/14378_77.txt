13 Trade and other receivables ACCOUNTING POLICY Trade and other receivables are carried at amortised cost, less any allowances for uncollectible amounts.
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date.
These are classified as non-current assets.
The Group manages credit risk through credit limits which require authorisation commensurate with the size of the limit and which are regularly reviewed.
Credit limit decisions are made based on available financial information and the business case.
Significant receivables are regularly reviewed and monitored at Group level.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers and geographies.
Furthermore the Groups principal customers are backed by government and public or private medical insurance funding, which historically represent a lower risk of default.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of receivable.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
