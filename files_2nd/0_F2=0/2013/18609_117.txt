Strategic report Governance Financials Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 129 A White Paper on the proposed High Speed Rail Network from London to Birmingham HS2, was presented to Parliament on 11 March 2010 by the Secretary of State for Transport.
This indicated that the potential route would cover at least part of our development site held in joint venture with Development Securities plc at Curzon Park in Birmingham.
In January 2012, the Government confirmed their intention to proceed with HS2.
In July 2013 the Appeal Court rejected all legal challenges to HS2.
The group, in conjunction with our joint venture partner, are liaising with HS2 and the Department of Transport to discuss the impact on, and a revised plan for, the site.
A provision was made in prior years against the carrying value of our joint venture investment to write down its value to nil.
During the current year the joint venture has commenced repayment of its bank loan, funded by loans from its shareholders.
Graingers loan of 2.6m made during the year ended 30 September 2013 is included within Investments in joint ventures.
In view of the continuing uncertainty relating to the future of the Curzon Park site, it is difficult to estimate the net realisable value of the site or the period over which value may be realised.
However the directors believe no further impairment provision is required at the statement of financial position date.
Should Graingers share of the value of the site, together with any compensation received, be insufficient to repay its share of the remaining bank loan in the joint venture entity and the carrying value of the groups investment, the group may incur further charges in respect of its obligations to the joint venture and the bank.
