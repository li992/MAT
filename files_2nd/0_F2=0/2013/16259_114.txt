If the effect is material, expected future cash flows are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability.
Provisions are estimates and the actual cost and timing of future cash flows are dependent on future events.
Management reassesses the amounts of these provisions at each balance sheet date in order to ensure that they are measured at the current best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Any difference between the amounts previously recognised and the current estimates is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.

The amounts recorded in the above tables are continually evaluated by management.
Reorganisation and restructuring The provision relates to the remaining costs incurred in relation to the restructuring of the UBM Tech business and other marketing services operations, as well as the onerous contract with the ExCel London Exhibition and Convention Centre as detailed in Note 3.5.
Vacant properties The provisions relate to obligations in respect of the continuing costs of vacant property.
The quantification of the provisions depends upon the ability to exit the leases early or sublet the properties.
The provisions also relate to obligations in respect of dilapidations on leasehold properties.
The quantification of these provisions are dependent on actual reinstatement costs on expiry of the leases.
The provisions at 31 December 2013 have been determined following external professional advice and will be utilised over the period of the leases, which range from one to five years.
The provision is discounted at an appropriate cost of capital.
Liabilities relating to disposals The provisions relate to obligations arising from warranty and other claims brought against the Group in relation to disposed businesses over periods of up to seven years after the date of disposal.
The provision in respect of these items has been determined based upon the contract terms of each disposal and are reassessed on an annual basis over the period during which claims may be brought against the Group.
