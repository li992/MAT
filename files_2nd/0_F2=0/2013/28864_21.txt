The financial statements comprise the accounting policies, the consolidated and company balance sheets as at 31 December 2013, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated and company statements of changes in equity and the consolidated and company cash flow statements for the year ended 31 December 2013, the related Notes 1 to 42 on the consolidated financial statements, the related Notes 1 to 16 on the company financial statements and the information identified as audited in the Risk and balance sheet management section of the Business review.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB As explained in the accounting policies the Group, in addition to complying with its legal obligation to apply IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, has also applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
In our opinion the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
Going concern As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors statement on page 96 that the Group is a going concern.
We confirm that we have not identified material uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Groups ability to continue as a going concern which we believe would need to be disclosed in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union: and we have concluded that the directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.

recoverable amount of deferred taxation, goodwill and intangible assets.
The Audit Committees consideration of these risks is set out on page 54.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures.
Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
Our application of materiality We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit and in evaluating the effect of misstatements on our audit and on the financial statements.
For the purposes of determining whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement we define materiality as the magnitude of misstatements that make it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person relying on the financial statements would be changed or influenced.
We determined planning materiality for the Group to be 350 million, which was calculated as 0.6% of the total equity of the Group which also represented 4% of the Groups loss for the year.
Our materiality was based on the equity of the Group as this was considered to provide a more normalised basis given the significant volatility over recent years in the Groups profits and losses.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of 10 million, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
An overview of the scope of our audit Our Group audit scope is based on an analysis of required work in each of the Groups divisions.
Within each division an assessment is made by geography and legal entity of those operations where full scope audits are required and those where the extent of our testing is more limited and focused on the risks of material misstatement in the Group financial statements.
As a result of these assessments audit work was undertaken in 19 countries, which accounted for 98% of the Groups total assets and 85% of its total revenue.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed so that the Senior Statutory Auditor or his designate visits each division at least once a year.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 In our opinion: the part of the Directors remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006: and the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit: or adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us: or the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
368 Independent auditors report to the members of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc Directors remuneration Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors remuneration report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review certain elements of the Directors remuneration report.
We have nothing to report arising from these matters or our review.
Corporate governance statement Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate governance statement relating to the companys compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report Under the ISAs UK and Ireland, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is: materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements: or apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit: or otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit and the directors statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the audit committee which we consider should have been disclosed.
We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor As explained more fully in the Statement of directors responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing UK and Ireland.
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Boards Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the companys members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the companys members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the companys members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Groups and the parent companys circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed: the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors: and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Kari Hale Senior Statutory Auditor for and on behalf of Deloitte LLP Chartered Accountants and Statutory Auditor London, United Kingdom 26 February 2014 Neither an audit nor a review provides assurance on the maintenance and integrity of the website, including controls used to achieve this, and in particular on whether any changes may have occurred to the financial information since first published.
These matters are the responsibility of the directors but no control procedures can provide absolute assurance in this area.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements differs from legislation in other jurisdictions.

The principal actuarial deficit, the Group agreed to pay additional contributions each year over assumptions at 31 December 2009 were: discount rate 5.25%: expected the period 2011 to 2018.
Contributions started at 375 million per annum return on plan assets weighted average 5.25%: rate of increase in in 2011, increasing to 400 million per annum in 2013 and from 2016 salaries 2.5%: rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.0%: and inflation onwards will be further increased in line with price inflation.
contributions are in addition to the regular annual contributions of around 250 million for future accrual of benefits.
A funding valuation as at 31 March 2013 is currently in progress and is expected to be concluded by 30 June 2014.
The Group expects to contribute a total of 785 million to its defined benefit pension schemes in 2014 Main scheme - 633 million.
Of the net liabilities of schemes in deficit, 155 million relates to unfunded schemes.
The sensitivity to pension costs liabilities is the difference between these calculations.

412 Notes on the consolidated accounts Valuation hierarchy There is a process to review and control the classification of financial Credit spreads - where available, these are derived from prices of instruments into the three level hierarchy established by IFRS 13.
Some credit default swaps or other credit based instruments, such as debt instruments may not easily fall into a level of the fair value hierarchy and securities.
For others, credit spreads are obtained from pricing judgment may be required as to which level the instrument is classified.
Initial classification of a financial instrument is carried out by the Business Interest rates - these are principally benchmark interest rates such Unit Control team following the principles in IFRS.

These initial classifications are reviewed and challenged by GPU and are also subject to senior management review.
Particular attention is paid to Equity and equity index prices - quoted prices are generally readily instruments crossing from one level to another, new instrument classes available for equity shares listed on the world's major stock or products, instruments that are generating significant profit and loss and exchanges and for major indices on such shares.

Price volatilities and correlations - volatility is a measure of the Non-modelled products tendency of a price to change with time.

In valuing prepayable instruments that are not quoted in active markets, the Group Inputs to valuation models considers the value of the prepayment option.
Values between and beyond available data points are obtained by interpolation and extrapolation.
When utilising valuation techniques, the Counterparty credit spreads - adjustments are made to market fair value can be significantly affected by the choice of valuation model prices or parameters when the creditworthiness of the counterparty and by underlying assumptions concerning factors such as the amounts differs from that of the assumed counterparty in the market price or and timing of cash flows, discount rates and credit risk.
inputs to these valuation techniques are as follows: Recovery rates loss given default - these are used as an input to Bond prices - quoted prices are generally available for government valuation models and reserves for asset-backed securities and other bonds, certain corporate securities and some mortgage-related credit products as an indicator of severity of losses on default.
Recovery rates are primarily sourced from market data providers or inferred from observable credit spreads.

5 Sensitivity represents the favourable and unfavourable effect on the income statement or the statement of comprehensive income due to reasonably possible changes to valuations using reasonably possible alternative inputs in the Groups valuation techniques or models.
Level 3 sensitivities are calculated at a sub-portfolio level and hence these aggregated figures do not reflect the correlation between some of the sensitivities.
In particular, for some portfolios, the sensitivities may be negatively correlated where a downward movement in one asset would produce an upward movement in another, but due to the additive presentation above, this correlation cannot be shown.
6 Transfers between levels are deemed to have occurred at the beginning of the quarter in which the instruments were transferred.
7 Level 1: valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets, for identical financial instruments.
Examples include G10 government securities, listed equity shares, certain exchange-traded derivatives and certain US agency securities.
Level 2: valued using techniques based significantly on observable market data.
Instruments in this category are valued using: a quoted prices for similar instruments or identical instruments in markets which are not considered to be active: or b valuation techniques where all the inputs that have a significant effect on the valuations are directly or indirectly based on observable market data.
The type of instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active, but are based on quoted market prices, banker dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency and those instruments valued using techniques include non-G10 government securities, most government agency securities, investment-grade corporate bonds, certain mortgage products, including CLOs, most bank loans, repos and reverse repos, less liquid listed equities, state and municipal obligations, most notes issued, and certain money market securities and loan commitments and most OTC derivatives.
Level 3: instruments in this category have been valued using a valuation technique where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation, is not based on observable market data.
Where inputs can be observed from market data without undue cost and effort, the observed input is used.
Otherwise, the Group determines a reasonable level for the input.
Financial instruments primarily include cash instruments which trade infrequently, certain syndicated and commercial mortgage loans, certain emerging markets instruments, unlisted equity shares, certain residual interests in securitisations, majority of CDOs, other mortgage-backed products and less liquid debt securities, certain structured debt securities in issue, and OTC derivatives where valuation depends upon unobservable inputs such as certain credit and exotic derivatives.

421 Notes on the consolidated accounts 11 Financial instruments - valuation continued Valuation techniques The table below shows a breakdown of valuation techniques and the ranges for those unobservable inputs used in valuation models and techniques that have a material impact on the valuation of Level 3 financial instruments.
The table excludes unobservable inputs where the impact on valuation is less significant.
Movements in the underlying input may have a favourable or unfavourable impact on the valuation depending on the particular terms of the contract and the exposure.
For example an increase in the credit spread of a bond would be favourable for the issuer and unfavourable for the note holder.
Whilst we indicate where we consider that there are significant relationships between the inputs, these inter-relationships will be affected by macro economic factors including interest rates, foreign exchange rates or equity index levels.

2 Price and yield: There may be a range of price based information used for evaluating the value of an instrument.
This may be a direct comparison of one instrument or portfolio with another or movements in a more liquid instrument may be used to indicate the movement in the value of less liquid instrument.
The comparison may also be indirect in that adjustments are made to the price to reflect differences between the pricing source and the instrument being valued, for example different maturity, credit quality, seniority or expected payouts.
Similarly to price, an instruments yield may be compared to other instruments either directly or indirectly.
Prices move inversely to yields.
3 Credit spreads and discount margins: Credit spreads and margins express the return required over a benchmark rate or index to compensate for the credit risk associated with a cash instrument.
A higher credit spread would indicate that the underlying instrument has more credit risk associated with it.
Consequently, investors require a higher yield to compensate for the higher risk.
The discount rate comprises credit spread or margin plus the benchmark rate: it is used to value future cash flows.
4 Recovery rate: Reflects market expectations about the return of principal for a debt instrument or other obligations after a credit event or on liquidation.
Recovery rates tend to move conversely to credit spreads.
5 Probability of default: This is a measure of the expected rate of losses in an underlying portfolio of mortgages or other receivables.
The higher the probability of default the lower the value of the underlying portfolio.
The cumulative losses tend to move conversely to prepayment rates and in line with constant default rates.
The higher the rate, the higher the expected number of defaults and therefore the expected losses.
An increase in the default rate is likely to reduce the value of an asset.
6 Volatility: A measure of the tendency of a price to change with time.
7 Conditional prepayment rate: The measure of the rate at which underlying mortgages or loans are prepaid.
An increase in prepayment rates in a portfolio may increase or decrease its value depending upon the credit quality and payment terms of the underlying loans.
For example an increase in prepayment rate of a portfolio of high credit quality underlying assets may reduce the value and size of the portfolio whereas for lower credit quality underlyings it may increase the value.
8 EBITDA earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation multiple: This is a commonly used valuation technique for equity holdings.
The EBITDA of a company is used as a proxy for the future cash flows and when multiplied by an appropriate factor gives an estimate for the value of the company.
9 Correlation: Measures the degree by which two prices or other variables are observed to move together.
If they move in the same direction there is positive correlation: if they move in opposite directions there is negative correlation.
Correlations typically include relationships between: default probabilities of assets in a basket a group of separate assets, exchange rates, interest rates and other financial variables.
10 Upfront points: These are similar to credit spreads in that a higher figure is a measure of increased credit risk.
A credit derivative price can be quoted on either credit spread or upfront points basis and the two can be considered a near equivalent from a risk perspective.
As with credit spreads higher upfront points indicate that the underlying entity has a higher credit risk associated with it.
11 The Group does not have any material liabilities measured at fair value that are issued with an inseparable third party credit enhancement.

This hurdle rate is that used in the IPV process to determine the IPV quality rating.
As part of the Groups IPV process, data are gathered at a trade level However, where an instrument is generally considered to be illiquid, but from market trading activity, trading systems, pricing services, consensus regular quotes from market participants exist, these instruments may be pricing providers, brokers and research material amongst other sources.

wide range of prices from different sources.
In these situations an assessment is made as to which source is the highest quality and this will The decision to classify a modelled asset as level 2 or 3 will be be used to determine the classification of the asset.
For example, a dependent upon the product model combination, the currency, the tradable quote would be considered a better source than a consensus maturity, the observability and quality of input parameters and other price.
All these need to be assessed to classify the asset.
Instruments that cross levels An assessment is made of each input into a model.
There may be Some instruments will predominantly be in one level or the other, but multiple inputs into a model and each is assessed in turn for observability others may cross between levels.
For example, a cross currency swap and quality.
As part of the process of classifying the quality of IPV results may be between very liquid currency pairs where pricing is readily the IPV quality classifications have been designed to follow the observed in the market and will therefore be classified as level 2.
The accounting level classifications, although with a further level of cross currency swap may also be between two illiquid currency pairs in granularity.
For example there are a number of different IPV quality levels which case the swap would be placed into level 3.

The number of complaints has been estimated from an analysis of the Groups portfolio of PPI policies sold by vintage and by product.
Estimates of the percentage of policyholders that will lodge complaints the take up rate and of the number of these that will be upheld the uphold rate have been established based on recent experience, guidance in the FSA policy statements and expected rate of responses from proactive customer contact.
The average redress assumption is based on recent experience and the calculation rules in the FSA statement.
The table below shows the sensitivity of the provision to changes in the principal assumptions all other assumptions remaining the same.
Sensitivity Change in Consequential Actual Current assumption change in provision Assumption to date assumptions % m Take up rate 36% 38% -5 -45 Uphold rate 1 84% 83% -5 -30 Average redress 1,733 1,646 -5 -26 Note: 1 Uphold rates exclude claims where no PPI policy was held.
Interest that will be payable on successful complaints has been included in the provision as has the estimated cost to the Group of administering the redress process.
The Group expects the majority of the cash outflows associated with this provision to have occurred by the end of 2014.
There are uncertainties as to the eventual cost of redress which will depend on actual complaint volumes, take up and uphold rates and average redress costs.
Background information in relation to PPI claims is given in Note 32.
451 Notes on the consolidated accounts 22 Accruals, deferred income and other liabilities continued 2 The Group has estimated 1,250 million for its liability in respect of the sale of Interest Rate Hedging Products based on experience, having now agreed a substantial number of outcomes with the independent skilled person appointed to review all decisions.
The provision includes redress that will be paid to customers, interest payable on customer redress, the cost to the Group of exiting the hedging positions and the cost of undertaking the review.
It does not include provision for any consequential losses that customers may have suffered as the Group is unable to reliably measure any liability it may have for such losses.
The principal assumptions underlying the Groups provision are: the proportion of relevant customers that will not opt in to the review the number of transactions that qualify for redress the nature of the redress in particular whether a product is terminated or replaced with an alternative product and or a different profile the cost of the review Sensitivity Change in Consequential assumption change in provision Assumption % m Proportion of relevant customers that will not opt in to the review -5 -47 Proportion of customer transactions qualifying for redress -5 -71 Average redress -5 -71 Uncertainties remain over the number of transactions that will qualify for redress and the nature and cost of that redress.
Background information in relation to Interest Rate Hedging Products claims is given in Note 32.
3 The Group has provided for customer redress in relation to certain other retail products.
None of these provisions are individually material.
4 On 6 February 2013, the Group reached agreement with the FSA, the US Department of Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in relation to the setting of LIBOR and other trading rates, including financial penalties of 381 million and a provision for this amount was recognised in 2012.
The Group continues to cooperate with other governmental and regulatory authorities and, as a result of progress on these matters in 2013, the provision was increased by 315 million.
For further details see Note 32.
5 The Group is subject to a number of investigations by regulatory and other authorities.
Details of these investigations and a discussion of the nature of the associated uncertainties are given in Note 32.
6 Arising out of its normal business operations, the Group is party to legal proceedings in the United Kingdom, the United States and other jurisdictions.
Litigation provisions at 31 December 2012 related to a number of proceedings: no individual provision was material.
An additional charge of 2,050 million was recorded in 2013 as a result of greater levels of certainty on expected outcomes, primarily in respect of matters relating to mortgage-backed securities and securities-related litigation following third party litigation settlements and regulatory decisions.
