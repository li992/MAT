5.6 Financial risk factors and fair value analysis Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group is impacted by changes in interest rates.
At 28 December 2013 the Group had floating rate debt in Sterling, Euros, US Dollars and Australian Dollars.
The Group hedges its cash flow exposure to its floating rate loans with interest rate swaps.
At the reporting date 85 per cent.
of the secured bank loans were hedged in this way.
The carrying amount of the Groups interest-bearing financial instruments was: Carrying amount 2013 2012 m m Fixed rate instruments Financial liabilities - finance leases 85 84 Financial liabilities - interest rate swaps 4 63 89 147 Variable rate instruments Financial assets - cash and cash equivalents 264 142 Financial liabilities - bank loans and overdrafts 1,179 1,334 915 1,192 Interest rate swaps have a fixed leg and a floating leg: they have been classified as fixed rate financial liabilities in the table above as the fair value of the swaps is dependent on the fixed rate.
The Group has performed sensitivity analysis on these balances as follows: Fair value sensitivity analysis This analysis shows the Groups sensitivity to changes in interest rates.
It is calculated by measuring the impact on profit and loss or equity of a change in the present value of derivatives.
This assumes a shift in the yield curve of - 50 basis points bp 2012: 50bp.
If interest rates had been 50bp higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the impact would be as follows: 2013 2012 Profit or Profit or loss Equity loss Equity m m m m 50bp increase in interest rates - 14 11 2 50bp reduction in interest rates - 14 11 2 117 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and accounts 2013 SECTION 5 CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING continued 52 weeks ended 28 December 2013 5.6 Financial risk factors and fair value analysis continued Cash flow sensitivity analysis This analysis shows the sensitivity of the Groups cash flows to changes in interest rates by comparing the expected annual interest expense income which would apply to year end balances at year end interest rates, to the annual expense income which would arise had interest rates been 50bp higher.
This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.

Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group would not have sufficient funds to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups Treasury Department produces short term and long term cash forecasts to identify liquidity requirements and headroom, which are reviewed by the Groups Chief Financial Officer.
Surplus cash is actively managed across Group bank accounts to cover local shortfalls or invested in bank deposits or liquidity funds.
In some jurisdictions bank cash pooling arrangements are in place to optimise the use of cash.
The Group has access to a revolving credit facility of 150 million 2012: 138 million in addition to its existing borrowings to meet any shortfalls.
At 28 December 2013, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of 264 million together with this revolving credit facility, which can be used to meet its contractual cash flows.
The following table sets out the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments and excluding the impact of netting agreements.
This analysis assumes that interest rates prevailing at the reporting date remain constant.

The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on cash flows that are not denominated in an entitys local currency and to the translation of non-Sterling earnings.
Net foreign exchange cash flow exposures, where material, are hedged by foreign exchange transactions.
The translation exposures to foreign currency earnings are hedged by bank debt denominated in the Groups principal currencies in ratios intended to provide a match between funding requirements and the cash generation capabilities of the Groups operations in each of its locations.
The principal currencies are Sterling, Euros, US Dollars and Australian Dollars.

At 28 December 2013 the Group had hedged 251 million 2012: 552 million in Euro denominated loans, 17 million 2012: 57 million in Sterling denominated loans and 149 million 2012: 40 million in US Dollar denominated loans.
Translation movements on these loans are therefore shown in other comprehensive income, see note 5.5.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The table below shows the sensitivity to a ten per cent.
strengthening weakening of Sterling against all foreign currencies at the reporting date.
The Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange rates is calculated by retranslating monetary assets and liabilities which are held in currencies other than the functional currencies of the reporting entities using exchange rates which have been flexed by - ten per cent.
from the Sterling exchange rates existing at the end of the reporting period.
Where the Group has designated specific monetary assets or liabilities as hedging instruments that are hedging underlying foreign exchange exposures, this has been taken account of.
The sensitivity analysis for forward foreign exchange contracts uses a discounted cash flow technique applying a ten per cent.
strengthening weakening of Sterling against Euros, US Dollars, Danish Kroner, Hong Kong Dollars, Australian Dollars and Singapore Dollars.

strengthening weakening of Sterling would have no impact on the hedging reserve.
Certain financial assets and liabilities of the Group are held by entities operating with a functional currency other than Sterling and do not have a base in local functional currency or Sterling.
Accordingly, these instruments are sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates but are not impacted by a strengthening or weakening of Sterling as presented above.
The impact on profit loss would be a loss of 3 million following a ten per cent.
strengthening of the relevant functional currency and would be a profit of 3 million following a ten per cent.
weakening of the relevant functional currency.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
Credit risk is limited to the carrying value of the Groups monetary assets.
The Group has credit policies in place with regard to its trade receivables.
Credit evaluations are performed on customers requiring credit over a certain amount.
The Group manages credit exposures in connection with financing and treasury activities including exposures arising from bank deposits, cash held at banks and financial and derivative transactions, by appraisal, formal approval and ongoing monitoring of the credit position of counterparties.
Counterparty exposures are measured against a formal transaction limit appropriate to that counterpartys credit position.
121 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and accounts 2013 SECTION 5 CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING continued 52 weeks ended 28 December 2013 5.6 Financial risk factors and fair value analysis continued Fair values Basis for determining fair values Derivatives Derivatives are carried at fair value, as defined in note 5.4.
Non-derivative financial assets The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
Non-derivative financial liabilities Where available, market values have been used to determine the fair values of secured bank loans.
Where market values are not available, or are not reliable, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
During 2013 market values became available for secured bank loans following the amendment to the facility.
In 2012 the discount rate used for determining the fair value of the secured bank loans was 7.8 per cent.
For finance leases the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements.
Fair value versus carrying amounts The fair values of financial assets and liabilities, together with the carrying amounts shown in the statement of financial position, are as follows: 2013 2012 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair amount value amount value m m m m Derivative assets and liabilities: Hedge accounted interest rate swaps 4 4 8 8 Non-hedge accounted interest rate swaps - - 55 55 Non-hedge accounted foreign exchange contracts 1 1 - - Non-derivative assets and liabilities: Investments 3 3 - - Trade and other receivables 37 37 24 24 Cash and cash equivalents 264 264 142 142 Secured bank loans 1,179 1,217 1,334 1,275 Finance lease liabilities 85 85 84 84 Trade and other payables 28 28 33 33 991 1,029 1,348 1,289 Fair value hierarchy The Group analyses financial instruments carried at fair value by valuation method.
The different levels have been defined as follows: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for assets or liabilities, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: inputs for assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
At 28 December 2013 the Group had 3 million 2012: 63 million of derivative financial liabilities classified as Level 2.
The Group has an investment in IDR Resorts Sdn.
acquired for 3 million as disclosed in note 6.1.
This investment is classified as a Level 3 investment in the fair value hierarchy.
At the reporting date there are no indicators the value is either impaired or above cost.
Accordingly, no valuation adjustments have been recorded.
There have been no transfers between levels in 2013 2012: nil.
No other financial instruments are held at fair value.
If the secured bank loans were held at fair value they would be classified as Level 1.
