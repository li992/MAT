Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 30th June 2013 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts the SORP issued by the Association of Investment Companies in January 2009.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of investments at fair value through profit or loss.
The policies applied in these accounts are consistent with those applied in the preceding year.
b Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy and information is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as held at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value which is taken to be their cost, excluding expenses incidental to purchase which are written off to capital at the time of acquisition.
Subsequently the investments are valued at fair value which are quoted bid market prices for investments traded in active markets.
For investments which are not traded in active markets, unlisted and restricted investments, the Board takes into account the latest traded prices, other observable market data and asset values based on the latest management accounts.
c Accounting for reserves Gains and losses on sales of investments including the related foreign exchange gains and losses, realised gains and losses on foreign currency, management fee and finance costs allocated to capital and any other capital charges, are included in the Income Statement and dealt with in capital reserves within Gains and losses on sales of investments.
Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end including the related foreign exchange gains and losses, are included in the Income Statement and dealt with in capital reserves within Holding gains and losses on investment.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
d Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are included in revenue on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is included in capital.
UK dividends are included net of tax credits.
Overseas dividends are included gross of any withholding tax.
Interest receivable on deposits is taken to revenue on an accruals basis.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in revenue.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital.
Special dividends are recognised on an ex-dividend basis and are treated as a capital item or an income item depending on the facts and circumstances of each dividend.
38 JPMorgan Emerging Markets Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 e Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are allocated wholly to revenue with the following exceptions: Performance related fees are allocated 100% to capital.
Expenses incidental to the purchase of an investment are included within the cost of the investment and those incidental to the sale are deducted from the sales proceeds.
These expenses are commonly referred to as transaction costs and include items such as stamp duty and brokerage commissions.
Details of transaction costs are given in note 10 on page45.
Subscription shares issue costs are charged to share premium.
f Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis and in accordance with the provisions of FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Presentation and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement.
Finance costs are allocated wholly to revenue.
g Financial instruments Cash and short term deposits may comprise cash and demand deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Other debtors and creditors do not carry any interest, are short term in nature and are accordingly stated at nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Finance costs, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method.
Short term forward currency contracts are classified as derivative financial instruments and the net unrealised gain or loss is included in debtors or creditors respectively.
h Foreign currency In accordance with FRS 23: The effects of changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates the Company is required to nominate a functional currency, being the currency in which the Company predominantly operates.
The Board, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its shareholders operate, has determined the functional currency to be sterling.
Sterling is also the currency in which the accounts are presented.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets, liabilities and equity investments held at fair value, denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.
Any gain or loss arising on monetary assets from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in revenue or capital, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a revenue or capital nature.
Gains and losses on investments arising from a change in exchange rates are included in the Income Statement within Gains or losses on investments held at fair value through profit or loss and charged or credited to capital reserves.

Accounting policies continued i Taxation Current tax is provided at the amount expected to be received or paid.
Deferred taxation is accounted for in accordance with FRS 19: Deferred Tax.
Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences but deferred taxation assets are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rate which is expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and is measured on an undiscounted basis.
j Dividends In accordance with FRS 21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date, dividends are included in the accounts in the year in which they are approved by shareholders.
k Value Added Tax VAT Irrecoverable VAT is included in the expense on which it has been suffered.
VAT recoverable is calculated using the partial exemption method based on the proportion of zero rated supplies to total supplies.

Taxation a Analysis of tax charge in the year 2013 2012 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 UK corporation tax for the year Overseas withholding tax 1,375 1,375 970 970 Current tax charge for the year 1,375 1,375 970 970 b Factors affecting current tax charge for the year The tax assessed for the year is lower 2012: higher than the UK corporation tax rate chargeable for the year of 23.75% 2012: 25.5%.
The factors affecting the current tax charge for the year are as follows: 2013 2012 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Net return loss on ordinary activities before taxation 9,512 73,267 82,779 8,243 98,128 89,885 Net return loss on ordinary activities before taxation multiplied by the applicable rate of corporation tax of 23.75% 2012: 25.5% 2,259 17,401 19,660 2,102 25,022 22,920 Effects of: Non taxable capital returns losses 18,164 18,164 24,563 24,563 Non taxable UK dividends 42 42 100 100 Non taxable scrip dividends 138 138 27 27 Non taxable overseas dividends 3,688 3,688 3,377 3,377 Tax attributable to expenses and finance costs charged to capital 763 763 455 455 Timing differences relating to the receipt of dividends 18 18 56 56 Overseas withholding tax 1,375 1,375 970 970 Expenses not allowable for tax purposes 44 Unrelieved expenses and charges 2,427 2,427 2,436 2,436 Brought forward excess expenses utilised 37 37 635 635 Current tax charge for the year 1,375 1,375 970 970 42 JPMorgan Emerging Markets Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 c Deferred taxation The Company has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 8,049,000 2012: 5,996,000 based on a prospective corporation tax rate of 23%.
The reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax was substantively enacted on 3rd July 2013 and is effective from 1st April 2013.
The Government has also enacted future reductions in the main rate of tax down to 21% by 1st April 2014 and 20% by 1st April 2015.
The deferred tax asset has arisen due to the cumulative excess of deductible expenses over taxable income.
Given the composition of the Companys portfolio, it is not likely that this asset will be utilised in the foreseeable future and therefore no asset has been recognised in the accounts.
Given the Companys status as an Investment Trust Company and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies As an investment trust company, the Company invests in equities and other securities for the long term so as to achieve its stated investment objective.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
These risks include market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors policy for managing these risks is set out below.
The Company Secretary, in close co-operation with the Board and the Manager, co-ordinates the Companys risk management strategy.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
The Companys financial instruments may comprise the following: investments in equity shares of overseas companies and a US Dollar liquidity fund which are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: and short term forward currency contracts for the purpose of settling short term liabilities.
JPMorgan Emerging Markets Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 51 Notes to the Accounts continued 22.
Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these three elements of market risk is given in parts i to iii of this note, together with sensitivity analyses where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and these policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Currency risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency and presentation currency.
As a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board, which meets on at least five occasions each year.
The Manager measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company may use short term forward currency contracts to manage working capital requirements.
It is currently not the Companys policy to hedge against foreign currency risk.
Foreign currency exposure The fair value of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 30th June are shown below.

Foreign currency sensitivity The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of return after taxation for the year and net assets with regard to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date and the income receivable in foreign currency and assumes a 10% 2012: 10% appreciation or depreciation in sterling against the US Dollar, Hong Kong Dollar, Indian Rupee, Brazilian Real, South African Rand, South Korean Won and other currencies to which the Company is exposed, which is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on the volatility of exchange rates during the year.
If sterling had weakened by 10% this would have had the following effect: 2013 2012 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 1,811 1,609 Capital return 3,524 2,915 Total return after taxation for the year 5,335 4,524 Net assets 5,335 4,524 JPMorgan Emerging Markets Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 53 Notes to the Accounts continued 22.

ii Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits and investments in liquidity funds.
Management of interest rate risk The Company does not normally hold significant cash balances.
Short term borrowings are used when required.
Interest rate exposure The exposure of financial assets and liabilities to floating interest rates, giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are re-set, is shown below.
2013 2012 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Cash and short term deposits 4,950 2,492 JPMorgan US Dollar Liquidity Fund 28,222 25,200 Total exposure 33,172 27,692 Interest receivable on cash balances is at a margin below LIBOR.
The target interest rate earned on the JPMorgan US Dollar Liquidity Fund is the 7 day US Dollar London Interbank Bid rate.
The exposure to floating interest rates has fluctuated during the year as follows: 2013 2012 000 000 Maximum credit exposure to floating rates net cash and liquidity fund balances 40,324 47,278 Minimum credit exposure to floating rates net cash and liquidity fund balances 17,712 22,982 54 JPMorgan Emerging Markets Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 Interest rate sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of return after taxation for the year and net assets to a 1% 2012: 1% increase or decrease in interest rates in regards to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities.
This level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary currency financial instruments held at the balance sheet date and the income receivable in foreign currency, with all other variables held constant.

iii Other price risk Other price risk includes changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk, which may affect the value of investments.
Management of other price risk The Board meets on at least five occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
The Companys exposure to changes in market prices at 30th June comprises its holdings in equity investments as follows: 2013 2012 000 000 Equity investments held at fair value through profit or loss 755,653 664,803 The above data is broadly representative of the exposure to other price risk during the current and comparative year.
Concentration of exposure to other price risk An analysis of the Companys investments is given on pages 11 to 15.
This shows that the investments value is in a broad spread of countries with no concentration of exposure to any one country.
It should also be noted that an investment may not be wholly exposed to the economic conditions in its country of domicile or of listing.

The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys equities and adjusting for change in the management fee, but with all other variables held constant.

Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the Companys assets comprise readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
Liquidity risk exposure Contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at the year end, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required are as follows: 2013 2012 Three Three months months or less Total or less Total 000 000 000 000 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year Performance fee payable 4,997 4,997 Other creditors and accruals 231 231 343 343 Securities purchased awaiting settlement 109 109 5,228 5,228 452 452 56 JPMorgan Emerging Markets Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction fails to discharge its obligations under that transaction which could result in loss to the Company.
Management of credit risk Portfolio dealing The Company invests in markets that operate DVP Delivery Versus Payment settlement.
The process of DVP mitigates the risk of losing the principal of a trade during the settlement process.
The Manager continuously monitors dealing activity to ensure best execution, a process that involves measuring various indicators including the quality of trade settlement and incidence of failed trades.
Counterparty lists are maintained and adjusted accordingly.
Cash Counterparties are subject to daily credit analysis by the Manager and trades can only be placed with counterparties that have a minimum rating of A1 P1 from Standard & Poors and Moodys respectively.
Exposure to JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan Chase is the custodian of the Companys assets.
The custody agreement grants a general lien over the securities credited to the securities account.
The Companys assets are segregated from JPMorgan Chases own trading assets.
Therefore these assets are designed to be protected from creditors in the event that JPMorgan Chase were to cease trading.
However, no absolute guarantee can be given to investors on the protection of all assets of the Company.
Credit risk exposure The amounts shown in the balance sheet under investment in liquidity fund, debtors and cash and short term deposits represent the maximum exposure to credit risk at the current and comparative year end.
The liquidity fund has a AAA 2012: AAA credit rating.
Cash and short term deposits comprises balances held at banks that have a minimum rating of A1 P1 2012: A1 P1 from Standard & Poors and Moodys respectively.
There have been no 2012: nil securities on loan at any time during the year.
d Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities All financial assets and liabilities are either included in the balance sheet at fair value or the carrying amount in the balance sheet is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

Capital management policies and procedures The Companys capital comprises the following: 2013 2012 000 000 Equity Share capital 30,650 28,907 Reserves 755,128 663,024 Total capital 785,778 691,931 The Companys capital management objectives are to ensure that it will continue as a going concern and to maximise capital return to shareholders.
The Boards policy is to employ gearing when the Manager believes it to be appropriate to do so.
Gearing will be in the range of 10% net cash to 20% geared in normal market conditions, at the discretion of the Manager.
Gearing for this purpose is defined as Total Assets including net current assets liabilities less cash cash equivalents and excluding bank loans, expressed as a percentage of net assets.
The Board, with the assistance of the Manager, monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: the need to buy back equity shares for cancellation or to hold in Treasury, which takes into account the share price discount or premium: the need for issues of new shares including issues from Treasury: and the ability to employ gearing when the Manager believes it to be appropriate.
