The group makes full provision for the future cost of decommissioning oil and natural gas wells, facilities and related pipelines on a discounted basis upon installation.
The provision for the costs of decommissioning these wells, production facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic liveshas been estimated using existing technology, at current prices or future assumptions, depending on the expected timing of the activity, and discounted using a real discount rate of 1% 2012 0.5%.
The amount provided in the year for new or increased decommissioning provisions was $2,092 million 2012 $3,766 million.
The weighted average period over which these costs are generally expected to be incurred is estimated to be approximately 20 years.
While the provision is based on the best estimate of future costs and the economic lives of the facilities and pipelines, there is uncertainty regarding both the amount and timing of these costs.
Provisions for environmental remediation are made when a clean-up is probable and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Generally, this coincides with commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or on closure of inactive sites.
The provision for environmental liabilities has been estimated using existing technology, at current prices and discounted using a real discount rate of 1% 2012 0.5%.
The weighted average period over which these costs are generally expected to be incurred is estimated to be approximately five years.
The extent and cost of future remediation programmes are inherently difficult to estimate: they depend on the scale of any possible contamination, the timing and extent of corrective actions, and also the groups share of the liability.
The litigation category includes provisions for matters related to, for example, commercial disputes, product liability, and allegations of exposures of third parties to toxic substances.
Included within the other category at 31 December 2013 are provisions for deferred employee compensation of $602 million 2012 $618 million.
These provisions are discounted using either a nominal discount rate of 3.25% 2012 2.5% or a real discount rate of 1% 2012 0.5%, as appropriate.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits Most group companies have pension plans, the forms and benefits of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benefits may be provided through defined contribution plans money purchase schemes or defined benefit plans final salary and other types of schemes with committed pension payments.
For defined contribution plans, retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee.
For defined benefit plans, retirement benefits are based on such factors as the employees pensionable salary and length of service.
Defined benefit plans may be funded or unfunded.
The assets of funded plans are generally held in separately administered trusts.
In particular, the primary pension arrangement in the UK is a funded final salary pension plan under which retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity.
This pension plan is governed by a trustee board composed of four member-nominated and four company-nominated representatives, an independent chairman, an independent director and a chief executive officer appointed by the chairman.
The trustee board is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment policies of theplan.
178 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2013 Financial statements 30.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued The UK plan is closed to new joiners but remains open to ongoing accrual for current members.
New joiners in the UK are eligible for membership of a defined contribution plan.
In the US, a range of retirement arrangements is provided.
This includes a funded final salary pension plan for certain heritage employees and a cash balance arrangement for new joiners.
Retired US employees typically take their pension benefit in the form of a lump sum payment.
The plans assets are overseen by a fiduciary investment committee composed of seven company employees appointed by the appointing officer, who is the president of BP Corporation North America Inc.
The investment committee is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as the investment policies, of the plan.
US employees are also eligible to participate in a defined contribution 401k plan in which employee contributions are matched with company contributions.
The level of contributions to funded defined benefit plans is the amount needed to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due.
During 2013, contributions of $597 million 2012 $884 million and 2011 $429 million and $386 million 2012 $153 million and 2011 $777 million were made to the UK plans and US plans respectively.
In addition, contributions of $289 million 2012 $238 million and 2011 $223 million were made to other funded defined benefit plans.
The aggregate level of contributions in 2014 is expected to be approximately $1,250 million, and includes contributions in all countries that we expect to be required to make by law or under contractual agreements as well as an allowance for discretionary funding.
For the primary UK plan there is an agreement between the group and the trustee under which contributions are determined annually based on the funding level of the plan.
Under this agreement a proportion of any deficit and the service cost is funded in the following year.
Contributions in the US are determined by legislation and are supplemented by discretionary contributions.
Certain group companies, principally in the US, provide post-retirement healthcare and life insurance benefits to retired employees and their dependants.
The entitlement to these benefits is usually based on the employee remaining in service until retirement age and completion of a minimum period of service.
The obligation and cost of providing pensions and other post-retirement benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method.
The date of the most recent actuarial review was 31 December 2013.
The groups principal plans are subject to a formal actuarial valuation every three years in the UK, with valuations being required more frequently in many other countries.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the UK pension plans was as at 31 December 2011.
The material financial assumptions used to estimate the benefit obligations of the various plans are set out below.
The assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year, and are used to evaluate accrued pension and other post-retirement benefits at 31 December and pension expense for the following year.

The inflation rate assumptions for our UK and US plans are based on the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds.
In other countries we use either this approach, or the central bank inflation target, or advice from the local actuary depending on the information that is available to us.
The inflation assumptions are used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions where there is such an increase.
Our assumptions for the rate of increase in salaries are based on our inflation assumption plus an allowance for expected long-term real salary growth.
These include allowance for promotion-related salary growth, of between 0.3% and 1.0% depending on country.
In addition to the financial assumptions, we regularly review the demographic and mortality assumptions.
The mortality assumptions reflect best practice in the countries in which we provide pensions, and have been chosen with regard to the latest available published tables adjusted where appropriate to reflect the experience of the group and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future.
BPs most substantial pension liabilities are in the UK, the US and Germany where our mortality assumptions are as follows: Years a Mortality assumptions UK US Germany 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 60 27.8 27.7 27.6 24.9 24.9 24.8 23.3 23.1 23.0 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 40 30.7 30.6 30.5 26.4 26.3 26.3 26.1 26.0 25.8 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 60 29.5 29.4 29.3 26.5 26.4 26.4 27.8 27.7 27.5 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 40 32.2 32.1 32.0 27.3 27.3 27.3 30.5 30.3 30.2 a Minor amendments have been made to comparative amounts.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued Our assumption for future US healthcare cost trend rate for the first year after the reporting date reflects the rate of actual cost increases seen in recent years.
The ultimate trend rate reflects our long-term expectations of the level at which cost inflation will stabilize based on past healthcarecost inflation seen over a longer period of time.
The assumed future US healthcare cost trend rate assumptions are as follows: % 2013 2012 2011 First years US healthcare cost trend rate 7.3 7.3 7.6 Ultimate US healthcare cost trend rate 5.0 5.0 5.0 Year in which ultimate trend rate is reached 2021 2020 2020 Pension plan assets are generally held in trusts.
The primary objective of the trusts is to accumulate pools of assets sufficient to meet the obligations of the various plans.
The assets of the trusts are invested in a manner consistent with fiduciary obligations and principles that reflect current practices in portfolio management.
A significant proportion of the assets are held in equities, owing to a higher expected level of return over the long term with an acceptable level of risk.
In order to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security has an unwarranted impact on the total portfolio, the investment portfolios are highly diversified.
The current long-term asset allocation policy for the major plans is as follows: % Asset category UK US Other Total equity 70 60 17-65 Bonds cash 23 40 25-78 Property real estate 7 0-10 The groups main pension plans do not invest directly in either securities or property real estate of the company or of any subsidiary.
Some of the groups pension plans use derivative financial instruments as part of their asset mix to manage the level of risk.
For the primary UK pension plan there is an agreement with the trustee to reduce the proportion of plan assets held as equities and increase the proportion held as bonds at certain market trigger points, over time, with a view to better matching the pension liabilities.
During 2013 the first trigger point was reached.
There is a similar agreement in place in the US where trigger points were reached in 2011 and 2013.
BPs main plans in the UK and US do not currently follow a liability driven investment LDI approach, a form of investing designed to match the movement in pension plan assets with the movement in projected benefit obligations over time.
