ii Net restructuring charges: 2012 13 2011 12 million million Asset impairments 35.1 8.8 Property charges 18.2 2.9 Other charges 36.1 4.6 89.4 16.3 Dixons Retail plc 73 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 13 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 4 Non-underlying items continued 2012 13: Charges related predominantly to the reorganisation of the PIXmania business and the remaining retained UK B2B operations following the sale of Equanet for which the charges are 64.6 million and 22.9 million, respectively.
For PIXmania, such charges comprise mainly asset write offs arising from property restructuring, lease provisions, employee severance and inventory write downs following on from the exit from certain markets.
In addition, following the acquisition of full control of the PIXmania business in August 2012 and against the backdrop of especially challenging trading and increasingly difficult markets in which PIXmania operates, the carrying value of certain assets has been written down.
In respect of the UK B2B operations, the charges relate mainly to an onerous lease in respect of the former Equanet operations and related fixed asset write offs.
2011 12: Charges related predominantly to the renewal and transformation of the UK & Ireland business which has been focused mainly on the reformatting and reorganisation of the store portfolio and the reorganisation of the service offering as well as a reorganisation of the PIXmania photo processing operations.
In the UK, asset impairments related mainly to items of property, plant & equipment, some of which comprised incremental accelerated depreciation charges which arose from restructuring initiatives which commenced in 2007 08.
Property charges comprised onerous lease costs and charges related to vacating properties.
Other charges predominantly comprised employee severance.
The PIXmania restructuring charges amounted to 6.6 million and related to the closure and ensuing reorganisation of its photo processing operations.
The charge comprised 1.7 million for asset impairments, 1.7 million for onerous property charges and 3.2 million of other charges.
iii Business impairment charges: 2012 13 Goodwill Other assets Property Other impairment impairment charges charges Total million million million million million PIXmania 45.2 25.1 70.3 Other businesses 6.6 2.5 9.1 51.8 27.6 79.4 2011 12 Goodwill Other assets Property Other impairment impairment charges charges Total million million million million million Italian business 109.4 5.6 15.1 1.0 131.1 PIXmania 28.4 28.4 Greek business 36.5 36.5 174.3 5.6 15.1 1.0 196.0 2012 13: PIXmania business: Following on from the weaknesses identified for the 52 weeks ended 28 April 2012, a lower than anticipated result in the first part of the year together with a change in management control from 77.1% to 99.2% during the period which caused a strategic review to be undertaken for this business, this led to the conclusion that both the acquisition goodwill and the brand name of PIXmania should be fully impaired to nil.
Other businesses: This relates to the impairment of goodwill of a small UK B2B operation following the re-organisation and significant reduction in the UK & Irelands B2B operations following the sale of Equanet as well as the full write down of the investment in an associate following continued declining results, further information of which is shown in note 12.
2011 12: Italian business: The increased macro-economic uncertainties, which contributed to further weakness in the Italian economy which was particularly evident over the Peak trading period, together with an expectation that growth in the Italian economy would be significantly less than previously forecast, led to an impairment to the goodwill of Unieuro, as well as impairment charges to property, plant & equipment and property charges comprising onerous lease costs.
PIXmania and Greek business: Continuing weakness in the Southern European economies in which PIXmania operates, which includes Greece, and which was again particularly evident over the Peak trading period, together with further delays to anticipated economic recovery, resulted in profit performance continuing to fall further behind that envisaged in the prior periods forecasts.
This therefore led to an impairment to the goodwill in these businesses.
Dixons Retail plc 74 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 13 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 4 Non-underlying items continued iv Other items comprise the following: 2012 13 2011 12 million million Exceptional provisions and charges 6.8 Profit on disposal of property 37.2 UK Riot related income net costs 0.9 3.2 Revaluation of associate shares 1.6 5.9 35.6 2012 13: Exceptional provisions and charges relate predominantly to claims for certain investment initiatives in PIXmania, whereby retrospective changes in the authorities interpretations of legislation have resulted in uncertainty regarding the funding previously agreed and or received in prior years.
UK Riot related income comprises insurance recoveries in respect of charges incurred in 2011 12.
2011 12: Profit on disposal of property related to the sale and leaseback of the Groups Nordic distribution centre in Jnkping in Sweden.
The sale completed on 23 June 2011 for SEK 602 million 58.1 million.
Owing to the size of the gain as well as the significance of the property in relation to the Groups operations, the profit was treated as a non-underlying item.
UK Riot related net costs comprised mainly inventory write offs and reinstatement costs together with certain other incremental costs arising from the riots which occurred in August 2011 and which amounted to 3.5 million.
These amounts were offset by insurance recoveries received of 0.3 million.
Revaluation of associate shares: Related to gain arising on the revaluation of a previous small associate shareholding following the acquisition of the remaining shares during the period.
v Loss on sale of business: On 28 March 2013, the Group completed the disposal of its Equanet B2B operations Equanet to Kelway UK Limited for consideration of 4.2 million.
The loss on disposal is analysed as follows: million Net assets disposed: Goodwill 10.7 Other assets 1.7 12.4 Loss on disposal 9.6 Consideration and costs 2.8 Consideration 4.2 Disposal fees and exit costs 1.4 Consideration and costs 2.8 vi Net non-cash financing costs on defined benefit pension schemes: Under IAS 19 Employee Benefits, the cost of providing defined benefit pension benefits in the future is discounted to a present value at the corporate bond yield rates applicable on the last day of the previous financial year and the effects of this discounting are charged into finance costs.
Corporate bond yield rates vary over time which in turn creates volatility in the income statement and balance sheet.
In respect of scheme assets, a finance income is generated in the income statement based on the expected rate of return on scheme assets again determined on the last day of the previous financial year.
The sum of these two effects is a non-cash remeasurement cost which can be volatile due to corporate bond yield rates prevailing on a particular day and is also unrepresentative of the actual investment gains or losses made or the liabilities paid and payable.
Starting in the current year with comparatives being re-presented and consistent with a number of other companies, the accounting effects of these noncash revaluations of assets and liabilities have been excluded from underlying earnings.
Dixons Retail plc 75 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 13 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 4 Non-underlying items continued vii Net fair value remeasurement gains and losses on revaluation of financial instruments: Items excluded from underlying finance income and expense represent the gains and losses arising from the revaluation of derivative financial instruments under methodologies stipulated by IAS 39 compared with those on an accruals basis the basis upon which all other items in the financial statements are prepared.
Such a treatment is a form of revaluation gain or loss created by an assumption that the derivatives will be settled before their maturity.
Such gains and losses are unrealised and in the directors view also conflict with both the commercial reasons for entering into such arrangements as well as Group Treasury policy whereby early settlement in the majority of cases would amount to speculative use of derivatives.
viii On 20 September 2012, the Group repurchased 15.6 million in nominal amount of its 6.125% Guaranteed Bonds due November 2012 the 2012 Bonds as well as 49.4 million in nominal amount of its 8.75% Guaranteed Notes due August 2015 the 2015 Notes.
The latter repurchase was funded by part of a new issue of 150 million 8.75% Guaranteed Notes due September 2017 the 2017 Notes and for which the proceeds were received on the same date.
The issue of the 2017 Notes has resulted in the Groups revolving facility agreement being reduced from 300 million down to 225 million as part of the terms of this facility whereby if new debt financing was raised, a reduction in the amount of this facility would ensue.
ix 2012 13: As a result of the repurchases of the 2012 Bonds and 2015 Notes on 20 September 2012, charges have been incurred relating to the acceleration of the amortisation of fees from the 2012 Bonds and the 2015 Notes which would otherwise have been charged evenly over the period to the 2012 Bonds maturity in November 2012 and the 2015 Notes maturity in August 2015, together with a redemption premium.
2011 12: On 24 May 2012, the Group signed an amendment and restatement agreement implementing a revised revolving facility agreement the Amended Facility for 300 million.
This agreement is described further in note 17.
The renegotiation of this facility triggered the acceleration of the amortisation of fees for the 360 million revolving credit facility the 360 million Facility which would otherwise have been charged evenly over the period to the pre-existing facilitys maturity in August 2013 and which were therefore charged in 2011 12. x 2012 13: Such items relate to the impairment of net deferred tax assets in PIXmania following the strategic review of the business described in note iii where such impairment represents the prudent assessment of the ability to utilise tax losses within an appropriate timeframe.
2011 12: Tax specific non-underlying items comprise adjustments in respect of prior years which relate mainly to the recognition and remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities on historical acquisitions in the Northern Europe division for which differences between the tax written down value and the book value of goodwill from acquisition have been identified and for which IAS 12 requires such recognition.
Because these items relate to historical acquisitions from prior years and the liabilities created will not give rise to any actual payment of tax either in the current or future periods in any of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates, the ensuing charge required to create the liability has been treated as nonunderlying.
The liability which has been recorded and which arises due to accounting standard requirements is expected to remain for the foreseeable future.

A. Unieuro 27.7 26.6 PIXmania S. A. S. PIXmania 46.1 Others 17.1 704.2 740.7 The non-underlying impairment charges predominantly comprise PIXmania 2011 12 PIXmania, Unieuro and Kotsovolos.
Further details of impairment charges are shown in note 4.
2012 13: In respect of PIXmania, the macro-economic uncertainties which continue in southern Europe together with a further underperformance in the current period, coupled with a strategic review being undertaken at PIXmania following the change in management control in August 2012, have led to the conclusion that the more conservative outlook for the business now causes the original acquisition goodwill from 2006 07 to be fully impaired.
The disposals predominantly comprise the Equanet business which is described further in note 4.
2011 12: For all three businesses impaired, increasing weaknesses in the Southern European economies which were particularly evident over the Peak trading period, together with the ensuing expectations that the achievability of targets will be considerably less than previously forecast and recovery may be prolonged, caused the directors to revise projections for the five year period referred to below significantly downwards when compared to previous periods, thereby giving rise to impairment charges.
The revised projections for Unieuro incorporated managements actions on costs as well as improving the estate and competitiveness in the market.
In respect of PIXmania, this business had been evolving its business model through growth in new product categories, its E-merchant e-commerce platform, as well as other initiatives.
Such actions were considered by management, through the impairment modelling described below, to appropriately support the remaining carrying value of the goodwill for Unieuro and PIXmania.
The projections for Kotsovolos demonstrated a robust market position, however, the uncertainty concerning the outlook for the economy in Greece had suppressed the projections such that the remaining value of goodwill was impaired down to nil.
Further details of these charges is shown in note 4 and the methodology used in their calculation is set out below.
Dixons Retail plc 83 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 13 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 9 Goodwill continued b Impairment testing As required by IAS 36, goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews.
These reviews are carried out using the following criteria: business acquisitions generate an attributed amount of goodwill: the manner in which these businesses are run and managed is used to determine the Cash Generating Unit CGU grouping as defined in IAS 36 Impairment of Assets: the recoverable amount of each CGU group is determined based on calculating its value in use VIU : the VIU is calculated by applying discounted cash flow modelling to managements own projections covering a five year period: cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using a long term growth rate equivalent to the relevant markets Gross Domestic Product GDP : and the VIU is then compared to the carrying amount in order to determine whether impairment has occurred.
The key assumptions used in calculating value in use are: managements five year projections: the growth rate beyond five years: and the pre-tax adjusted discount rate.
The five year projections, which have been approved by management, have been prepared using risk adjusted strategic plans which have regard to the relative performance of competitors and knowledge of the current market together with managements views on the future achievable growth in market share and impact of the committed initiatives.
The cash flows which derive from these five year projections include ongoing capital expenditure required to develop and upgrade the store network in order to maintain and operate the businesses and to compete in their markets.
In forming the five year projections, management draws on past experience as a measure to forecast future performance.
Key assumptions used in determining the five year projections comprise the growth in sales and costs over this period.
The compound annual growth rate in sales and costs can rise as well as fall year on year depending not only on the year five targets, but also on the current financial year base.
These targets, when combined, accordingly drive the resulting profit margins and the profit in year five of the projections which is in turn used to calculate the terminal value in the VIU calculation.
Historical amounts for the businesses under impairment review as well as from other parts of the Group are used to generate the values attributed to these assumptions.
The growth rate beyond five years is based on the GDP for the territories in which these businesses operate.
The discount rates applied to cash flows are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital having regard to the strategic five year plans themselves already being risk adjusted to take account of specific risks in the relevant market or region.
The values attributed to these assumptions are as follows: 2013 2012 Compound Compound Growth rate Compound Compound Growth rate annual growth annual growth beyond Pre-tax annual growth annual growth beyond Pre-tax in sales in costs five years discount rate in sales in costs five years discount rate Elkjp 6.6% 6.6% 2.5% 10.7% 6.1% 6.1% 2.5% 11.4% Unieuro 10.0% 9.5% 1.2% 11.8% 6.9% 6.0% 1.5% 11.8% PIXmania n a n a n a n a 10.5% 9.4% 2.0% 11.1% Kotsovolos n a n a n a n a 3.1% 1.8% 1.5% 10.7% c Sensitivities A sensitivity analysis had been performed on each of the base case assumptions used for assessing the goodwill with other variables held constant.
Consideration of sensitivities to key assumptions can evolve from one financial year to the next.
The directors have concluded that in the case of Elkjp there are no reasonably possible changes in any key assumption which would cause the carrying amount of goodwill to exceed its value in use.
In the case of Unieuro it is reasonably possible that a change in a key assumption could occur despite the continuing improvements in performance as referred to in the Performance Review section of the Directors Report.
The following sensitivities are therefore presented, which are calculated independently, leaving all other variables constant: decrease in the compound annual growth rate in sales: increase in the compound annual growth rate in costs: decrease in the growth rate beyond five years: and increase in the pre-tax discount rate.
In addition to the above, a further sensitivity is presented which shows the effect of a decrease in the compound annual growth rate in sales combined with an equivalent reduction in the compound annual growth rate in costs in order to reflect how sales and costs are interconnected.

21 Retirement and other post-employment benefit obligations 2013 2012 million million Retirement benefit obligations UK 406.4 261.9 Northern Europe 2.7 4.1 409.1 266.0 The Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
The principal scheme which operates in the UK includes a funded defined benefit section whose assets are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The scheme is valued by a qualified actuary at least every three years and contributions are assessed in accordance with the actuarys advice so as to spread the pension cost over the normal expected service lives of members.
Since 1 September 2002, the defined benefit section of the scheme has been closed to new entrants and on 30 April 2010 was closed to future accrual with automatic entry into the defined contribution section being offered to those active members of the defined benefit section at that time.
Membership of the defined contribution section is offered to eligible employees.
In the Northern Europe division, the Group operates two funded secured defined benefit pension schemes with assets held by a life insurance company as well as an unsecured pension arrangement.
In addition, contributions are made to a state pension scheme.
The net movement in the obligation comprises a charge to operating profit of 0.9 million 2011 12 0.6 million with the remaining movements relating to the benefits paid in the period, actuarial gains losses and currency retranslation.
In other territories, the Group also provides other post-employment benefits which are largely governed by statute, in particular in Italy and Greece.
a Defined contribution pension schemes The pension charge in respect of defined contribution schemes was 16.9 million 2011 12 12.6 million.
Dixons Retail plc 92 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 13 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 21 Retirement and other post-employment benefit obligations continued b UK Defined benefit pension scheme actuarial valuation and assumptions A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was last carried out as at 31 March 2010 and showed a shortfall of assets compared with liabilities of 239.0 million.
A recovery plan based on this valuation, agreed with the trustee, commenced in 2010 11 with special contributions of 12.0 million, which rose to 16.0 million and 20.0 million in 2011 12 and 2012 13 respectively.
Contributions will remain at 20.0 million for 2013 14 and will rise approximately annually thereafter to 35.0 million by 2020 21.
The next triennial valuation has commenced and will be as at 31 March 2013.
The principal actuarial assumptions as at 31 March 2010 were: Rate per annum Discount rate for accrued benefits Pre-retirement 6.4% Post-retirement 5.1% 5.3% Rate of increase to pensions Guaranteed Minimum Pension 0% 2.8% Pension in excess of Guaranteed Minimum Pension 2.4% 4.1% Inflation 3.7% Expected return on assets 6.6% At 31 March 2010, the market value of the schemes investments was 672.0 million and, based on the above assumptions, the value of the assets was sufficient to cover 74% of the benefits accrued to members with the liabilities amounting to 911.0 million.
c UK Defined benefit pension scheme IAS 19 The following summarises the components of net benefit expense recognised in the consolidated income statement, the funded status and amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet.
The methodologies set out in IAS 19 are different from those used by the scheme actuaries in determining funding arrangements.
i Principal assumptions adopted The assumptions used in calculating the expenses and obligations are set by the directors after consultation with the independent actuaries.
2013 2012 Rates per annum Discount rate 4.3% 5.2% Rate of increase in pensions in payment deferred pensions pre post April 2006 accrual 3.2% 2.1% 3.1% 2.1% Inflation 3.3% 3.2% The Group uses certain demographic assumptions when calculating scheme obligations which are those underlying the last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 31 March 2010.
In particular, post-retirement mortality has been assumed to follow the standard mortality tables S1 All Pensioners tables published by the CMI, based on the experience of SelfAdministered Pension Schemes SAPS from 2000 to 2006 with medium cohort improvements up to 2009 and multipliers of 105% for males and 110% for females.
In addition, an allowance has been made for future improvements in longevity by using the new CMI 2009 Core projections with a long term rate of improvement of 1.5% per annum for men and 1.0% per annum for women.
Applying such tables results in an average expected longevity of between 87.2 years and 88.8 years for men and between 88.6 years and 89.7 years for women 2012 between 87.1 years and 88.7 years for men and between 88.5 years and 89.6 years for women for those becoming 65 at the measurement date.

Changes in assumptions used for determining retirement benefit costs and liabilities may have a material impact on the 2012 13 income statement and the balance sheet.
The main assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of inflation and the assumed mortality rate.
The following table provides an estimate of the potential impacts of each of these variables if applied to the current period consolidated income statement and balance sheet.
Net finance costs Net deficit 2012 13 2011 12 2013 2012 million million million million Positive negative effect: Discount rate: 0.25% increase 0.2 0.2 62.5 53.3 Inflation rate: 0.25% increase 2.4 2.4 53.5 47.6 Mortality rate: 1 year increase 1.4 1.3 36.2 25.8 The increase in scheme benefits provided to members on retirement is subject to an inflation cap.
e Other post-employment benefits IAS 19 The Group offers other post-employment benefits to employees in overseas locations.
At 30 April 2013 the net obligation in relation to these benefits was 12.6 million 2012 11.1 million.
The net movement in the obligation comprises a charge to operating profit of 5.5 million 2011 12 3.8 million with the remaining movements relating to the benefits paid in the period, actuarial gains losses and currency retranslation.
22 Financial instruments a Financial risk management objectives and policies Treasury operations are managed centrally within policies approved by the Board and are subject to periodic independent internal and external reviews.
Group Treasury reports regularly to the Tax & Treasury Committee and as required, to the Board.
The major treasury risks to which the Group is exposed relate to market risks movements in foreign exchange and interest rates, liquidity risk and credit risk.
Areas where risks are most likely to occur are evaluated regularly.
The Group uses financial instruments and derivatives to manage these risks in accordance with defined policies.
Throughout the period under review, in accordance with Group policy, no speculative use of derivatives, foreign exchange or other instruments was permitted.
The Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives are set out in note 1.16.
Exchange rate risk The Group is exposed to exchange movements on recognised assets and liabilities, overseas earnings and translated values of foreign currency assets and liabilities.
The Groups principal translation currency exposures are the euro and Norwegian krone.
Taking into account the cost of hedging, the Groups policy is to match, in whole or in part, currency earnings with related currency costs and currency assets with currency liabilities through the use of appropriate hedging instruments.
The Group is also exposed to certain transactional currency exposures.
Such exposures arise from purchases in currencies other than in the functional currency of the entity.
The Groups principal transactional currency exposures are the US dollar and euro.
It is Group policy to minimise the currency exposures on such purchases through the use of appropriate hedging instruments such as forward exchange contracts.
Such contracts are designed to cover exposures ranging from one month to one year.
Interest rate risk The principal interest rate risks of the Group arise in respect of sterling cash, investments and euro and sterling borrowings.
Potential exposure to interest rate movements is mitigated by the Groups policy to match to the extent possible the profile of interest payments with that of its interest receipts.
Liquidity risk It is Group policy to maintain a balance of funds, borrowings, committed bank and other facilities sufficient to meet anticipated short term and long term financial requirements.
In applying this policy the Group continuously monitors forecast and actual cash flows against the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Uncommitted facilities are used if available on advantageous terms.
It is Group Treasury policy to ensure that a specific level of committed facilities is always available based on forecast working capital requirements.
Cash forecasts identifying the Groups liquidity requirements are produced and are stress tested for different scenarios including, but not limited to, reasonably possible decreases in profit margins and increases in interest rates on the Groups borrowing facilities and the weakening of sterling against other functional currencies within the Group.
Dixons Retail plc 95 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 13 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 22 Financial instruments continued Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk on liquid funds, investments mainly bank deposits and floating rate notes and derivative financial instruments arises from the risk of non-performance of counterparties, with a maximum exposure equal to the book value of these assets.
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk through application of Group Treasury policy which limit the credit exposure to counterparties with a Moodys long term credit rating below A1, bank financial strength rating below C and short term credit rating below P1.
The Group also has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any single financial institution.
The Group continuously reviews the credit quality of counterparties, the limits placed on individual credit exposures and categories of investments.
The Group does not anticipate non-performance of counterparties and believes it is not subject to material concentration of credit risk given the policies in place.
The Groups receivable balances comprise a large number of individually small amounts from unrelated customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas.
Concentration of risk is therefore limited and maximum exposure is equal to the book value of receivables.
Sales to retail customers are made predominantly in cash or via major credit cards.
It is Group policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
New credit customers are assessed using an external rating report which is used to establish a credit limit.
Such limits are reviewed periodically on both a proactive and reactive basis, for example, when a customer wishes to place an order in excess of their existing credit limit.
Receivable balances are monitored regularly with the result that the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant.
Management therefore believe that there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful receivables.
Capital risk management It is the Groups policy to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain the future development of the business.
The Group is subject to certain externally imposed capital requirements in the form of banking covenants involving borrowing ratios which it met throughout the period.
The Board has delegated responsibility for routine capital expenditure to a Capital Committee, which has approval responsibility for: Group long term and budgeted capital spend, setting capital assessment criteria, new store capital approval, subsidiary company funding, business acquisitions, business disposals and contingent liabilities such as guarantees.
The Committee also approves routine statutory and internal delegated powers of authority in relation to capital expenditure.
The Group considers the manner in which funds are distributed to shareholders by assessing the performance of the business, the level of available net funds and the short to medium term strategic plans concerning future capital spend as well as the need to meet banking covenants and borrowing ratios.
Such assessment will influence the level of dividends payable as well as consideration from time to time of market purchases of the Groups own shares.
The Group monitors available net funds on a regular basis and this is affected by Free Cash Flow, one of the Groups key performance indicators as defined further in the Strategic Summary section of the Directors Report.
b Fair values of financial assets and liabilities For receivables and payables classified as financial assets and liabilities in accordance with IAS 32, fair value is estimated to be equivalent to book value.
These values are shown in notes 14 and 19, respectively.
The categories of financial assets and liabilities and their related accounting policy are set out in notes 1.11 and 1.15.
For those financial assets and liabilities which bear either a floating rate of interest or no interest, fair value is estimated to be equivalent to book value.
These values are shown in note 22 d. The 2012 Bonds were repurchased during the year.
At 28 April 2012, the fair value of the 2012 Bonds was 160.4 million and they were carried at amortised cost, plus a fair value adjustment, as a result of the fair value hedge discussed below.
Excluded from the fair value was 4.4 million of accrued interest which was included in trade and other payables.
The fair value of the 2015 Notes is 112.4 million 2012 147.4 million.
The 2015 Notes are carried at amortised cost.
Excluded from the fair value is 2.2 million 2012 3.2 million of accrued interest which is included in trade and other payables.
The 2017 Notes were issued during the period and the fair value is 169.1 million.
The 2017 Notes are carried at amortised cost.
Excluded from the fair value is 1.6 million of accrued interest which is included in trade and other payables.
Fair value of derivatives is predominantly determined using observable market data such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
As such, derivatives are classified as Level 2 under the requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.

c Hedging activities The Group manages exposures that arise on purchases and sales denominated in foreign currencies predominantly by entering into forward foreign exchange currency contracts.
It also uses swaps and options to manage its interest rate and foreign exchange translation exposure.
During the year, the Group had interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges for the 2012 Bonds with a notional amount of 125 million whereby it received a fixed interest rate of 6.125% and paid a floating rate of interest based on LIBOR, which matured in November 2012.
The Group also had interest rate swaps in place with a notional amount of 125 million whereby the Group received a fixed interest rate of 6.125% and paid a floating rate of interest based on LIBOR, and which acted as a hedge for the 2015 Notes until August 2012.
These swaps were not designated as hedges under IAS 39.
During 2011 12 forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into which reduced the hedge against euro denominated net investments to 100 million at 28 April 2012.
These derivative contracts matured in November 2012.
The Group designates financial instruments as hedges under IAS 39 as follows: Cash flow hedges At 30 April 2013 the Group had forward foreign exchange contracts in place with a notional value of 381.3 million 2012 415.5 million that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges.
These contracts are expected to cover exposures ranging from one month to one year.
The fair value movement on these currency derivatives which has been taken to equity in the year amounts to a 12.7 million loss 2011 12 3.3 million gain.
In respect of contracts which matured during the period, losses of 5.4 million and losses of 3.4 million have been transferred out of equity into inventory and out of equity into operating profit, respectively 2011 12 losses of 4.7 million and gains of 5.3 million.
No hedge ineffectiveness was recorded in the income statement 2011 12 0.2 million gain.
Fair value hedges As mentioned above the Group had interest rate swaps in place for the 2012 Bonds whereby it received a fixed interest rate of 6.125% and paid a floating rate of interest based on LIBOR.
The interest rate swaps were used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of 125 million of the 2012 Bonds and had the same critical terms.
At 28 April 2012, the fair value of interest rate swaps entered into as fair value hedges was an asset of 5.3 million.
These swaps matured in November 2012.
A fair value loss on the interest rate swaps of 2.4 million 2011 12 loss of 4.4 million has been recognised in the income statement and offset by an equivalent fair value gain on the 2012 Bonds.
Hedge ineffectiveness of 0.2 million loss was recorded in the income statement 2012 0.6 million gain.
Dixons Retail plc 97 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 13 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 22 Financial instruments continued Hedge of net investments in foreign operations The Group had forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps in place which matured in November 2012 with a notional value of 100 million which were designated as a hedge of the net investments in foreign operations.
Gains and losses on the retranslation of these derivatives were transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the foreign operations.
At 28 April 2012, the fair value of currency derivatives entered into as net investment hedges was a 62.6 million liability.
No hedge ineffectiveness was recorded in the income statement 2011 12 nil.
d Interest rate profile of financial assets and financial liabilities by currency The following table sets out the interest rate exposure of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group.
The financial instruments not included in the table are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.

Cash at bank earns interest at floating rates based either on daily bank deposit rates or central bank lending rates.
Floating rate notes have an effective yield of 0.99% 2012 1.19%.
Fixed rate cash and cash equivalents and short term investments are predominantly money market deposits as shown in note 16 and earn interest at an average effective rate of 0.42% 2012 0.80%.
Floating rate borrowings include bank overdrafts and fixed rate bonds after taking into account the effect of interest rates swaps entered into by the Group.
The weighted average effective interest rate on bank overdrafts approximates 5.7% 2012 9.9%.
At 28 April 2012, the Groups interest rate swaps which related to the 2012 Bonds and the 2015 Notes had a nominal value of 250 million.
During the period to maturity of these swaps in November 2012, the Group received fixed interest rates of 6.125% 2011 12 6.125% and paid floating rates of LIBOR plus margins which ranged from 1.68% to 2.37% 2011 12 1.76% to 2.37%.
At 28 April 2012, the Groups currency swaps had a nominal value of 200 million, received LIBOR plus a margin and paid EURIBOR plus a margin.

Dixons Retail plc 98 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 13 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 22 Financial instruments continued The other major component of floating rate borrowings is drawings under the Amended Facility 2011 12 the 360 million Facility.
Interest on drawn amounts on the Amended Facility is payable at LIBOR plus a margin of 3.75%.
The commitment fee on undrawn amounts is 1.6875%.
A utilisation fee of 0.25% is payable on drawings greater than one third of the maximum but less than two thirds of the maximum and a rate of 0.5% on drawings greater than two thirds of the maximum.
The Amended Facility is guaranteed by a number of UK and Irish subsidiary undertakings of the Group, including DSG Retail Limited.
In the event of a change of control, the syndicated banks have the option to terminate the Amended Facility.
The terms of the 360 million Facility were similar and further information on both the Amended Facility and the 360 million Facility are shown in note 17.
At 28 April 2012, sterling fixed rate borrowings related to 35 million of the 2012 Bonds and 25 million of the 2015 Notes whereby the remainder had been swapped into floating rate borrowings as described in note 22 c. Amounts in respect of other currencies relate to funds held within subsidiary companies, operating in the Nordic region and Central Europe.
Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
e Sensitivity analysis The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, shows the sensitivity of profit before tax and total equity to changes in specified market variables on monetary assets and liabilities and derivative financial instruments as listed below.
As a consequence, the sensitivity reflects the position as at 30 April 2013 and 28 April 2012, and is not necessarily representative of actual or future outcomes.
Changes in exchange rates affect the Groups profit before tax due to changes in the value of monetary assets and liabilities and derivative financial instruments.
Changes in exchange rates affect the Groups total equity due to changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and net investment hedges.
The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the Groups key currencies of US dollar, euro and Norwegian krone with other variables held constant.
A 10% decrease would have an equal and opposite effect.

The Groups principal floating rate interest rate exposures are based on LIBOR and EURIBOR.
The numbers below shows the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates uniform across all currencies, with other variables held constant.
A 1% decrease would have an equal and opposite effect.
A 1% increase in interest rates would increase profit before tax and equity by 0.5 million 2011 12 a 2.3 million decrease in profit before tax and equity.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: The balance of borrowings, investments and the derivative portfolio are all held constant for the whole year.
All net investment, fair value and cash flow hedges are assumed to be highly effective.
The effect of changes in interest rates on fixed rate bonds is calculated after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps.
In combination these financial instruments are floating in nature.
Changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges arising from movements in interest rates are recorded in the income statement.
The impact of movements in exchange rates is recorded directly in equity.
Changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments that are not in hedging relationships arising from movements in interest rates and exchange rates only affect the income statement to the extent that they are not offset by changes in an underlying transaction.

The Group reviews regularly its available cash resources and undrawn committed borrowing facilities required to fulfil its objectives and strategy.
Cash flow forecasts are prepared covering a five year period and these are updated annually.
Shorter term forecasts are reviewed and monitored on a regular basis in varying degrees of granularity including, in some cases, daily review.
These forecasts are used in determining both the level of borrowings required for funding purposes as well as planning for repayments of borrowings either at their maturity or sooner where practical.
An appropriate level of headroom is maintained to provide against unexpected outflows or an unforeseen downturn in trading.
Further details of committed borrowing facilities are shown in note 17.

Options granted after this date have only been granted under the new ESOP.
The ESOS and ESOP permit making awards with a market value on the date of grant of not more than twice the recipients salary and three times in exceptional circumstances.
Vesting of options is based upon remaining in service with the Group over a three year period, unless specific circumstances apply to a participant as determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Depending on grade, vesting may also be dependent on various performance measures as agreed by the Remuneration Committee at the date of grant.
Options are generally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
Reward Sacrifice Scheme Reward Sacrifice options were offered to senior executives in September 2009 and do not have any performance conditions.

Other equity settled share plans Performance Share Plan PSP, Retention and Recruitment Share Plan and Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Up to 2010 11, LTIP and PSP shares were provisionally awarded to executive directors and certain other participating senior executives and were based upon performance measured in terms of the Total Shareholder Return TSR achieved by the Company.
For 2008 09 and 2009 10 TSR performance was based on a bespoke weighted index comprising UK and European retailers.
For 2010 11 TSR performance was based on constituents of the FTSE 250 Index comprising FTSE 101-350 companies excluding investment trusts.
During 2011 12 and 2012 13, PSP shares were provisionally awarded to executive directors and other senior executives.
Vesting of these awards is based upon remaining in service with the Group over a three or four year period.
For awards to executive directors in 2011 12, vesting is also dependent on the level of EPS achieved at the end of a three year period and TSR performance on the same terms as the 2010 11 awards.
In 2012 13, for all awards to executive directors and some awards to other senior executives, vesting is also dependent on absolute share price with an EPS underpin.
