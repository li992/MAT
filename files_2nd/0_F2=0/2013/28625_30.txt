The companys principal exposure to cash flow interest rate risk arises from the mismatch between the repricing of its financial assets and liabilities.
The table below shows the repricing profile of the companys financial assets and liabilities, stated at their carrying amounts, categorised by the earlier of contractual repricing or maturity dates.

The table below summarises the companys exposure to foreign currency translation risk at 31 December 2013.
Included in the table are the companys financial assets and liabilities, at carrying amounts, categorised by currency.

A 10% strengthening of the US dollar or euro would have had an equal and opposite effect.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other exchange rates, remain constant.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2013 147 Company financial statements Notes to the company financial statements 49 Financial instruments iii Market risk Price risk Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or foreign exchange risk.
The company is exposed to price risk through its holdings of equity investment securities, which are reported at their fair value note 42.
At 31 December 2013, the fair value of equity securities recognised on the balance sheet was 6,333,000 2012: 4,198,000.
A 10% fall in global equity markets would, in isolation, result in a pre-tax impact on net assets of 617,000 2012: 420,000 : there would be no impact on profit after tax.
A 10% rise in global markets would have had an equal and opposite effect.
Fair values The fair values of the companys financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values, with the exception of equity investments in subsidiaries which are carried at historical cost note 40.
The table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique used to determine the fair value.
Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2013 000 000 000 000 Available for sale equity securities 5,642 691 6,333 Money market funds 35,000 35,000 Derivative financial instruments 1,030 1,030 Total financial assets 5,642 35,000 1,721 42,363 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2012 000 000 000 000 Available for sale equity securities 3,584 614 4,198 Derivative financial instruments 784 784 Total financial assets 3,584 1,398 4,982 The group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.
There have been no transfers between levels during the year 2012: none.
Details of the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values of the financial assets in the above table, along with how reasonably possible changes to the assumptions affect these fair values, are provided in note 30 to the consolidated financial statements.
Level 3 financial instruments Changes in the fair values of financial instruments categorised as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy were as follows: 2013 2013 2012 2012 Available for Derivative Available for Derivative sale equity financial 2013 sale equity financial 2012 securities instruments Total securities instruments Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 At 1 January 614 784 1,398 569 569 Total unrealised gains and losses recognised in: profit or loss 246 246 other comprehensive income 77 77 45 45 Acquired during the year 784 784 At 31 December 691 1,030 1,721 614 784 1,398 148 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2013 Company financial statements Notes to the company financial statements 50 Capital management The companys objectives when managing capital are to: safeguard the companys ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders: and maintain a strong capital base to support the development of its business.
For monitoring purposes, the company defines capital as equity shareholders funds.
The group monitor the level of distributable reserves on a monthly basis and compare this to forecast dividends.
Capital is distributed to the company from operating subsidiaries on a timely basis to ensure sufficient capital is maintained.
The board of directors considers the level of capital held in relation to forecast performance, dividend payments and wider plans for the business, although formal quantitative targets are not set.
The companys total capital at 31 December 2013, together with movements during the year then ended, is set out in the company statement of changes in equity.
There were no changes in the companys approach to capital management during the year.
51 Contingent liabilities and commitments a Indemnities are provided in the normal course of business to a number of directors and employees who provide tax and trust advisory services in connection with them acting as trustees directors of client companies and providing other services.
As reported in the 2012 report and accounts, a claim relating to the management of a Jersey trust has been filed against a former employee and director of Rathbone Trust Company Jersey Limited RTCJ and others.
Hawksford Trust Company Jersey Limited as RTCJ is now known has also recently been joined in as a defendant.
RTCJ was a subsidiary of the company from March 2000 until October 2008.
Although the board believes that this claim will be unsuccessful, a possible material obligation may arise.
Due to the complexity of the claim, the number of parties involved and the impact of the insurance cover available, it is not practicable to estimate reliably the value of any possible obligation for the company.
Professional indemnity cover of 50 million under the relevant year of the companys civil liability insurance policy is made up of a first layer of 5 million and an excess layer of a maximum of 45 million.
The limit of the indemnity given jointly by RTCJ and the company to the employee in question is 40 million per event.
The group has sought to confirm the position of the companys civil liability professional indemnity insurers in relation to the claim and issued proceedings to confirm insurance cover against the excess insurers.
The trial of those proceedings took place in October 2013 and judgment was handed down on 8 November 2013.
In the judgment, the judge ruled in favour of the company and the employee on all the substantive coverage points on the insurance policy, confirming that the employee was covered by the policy in respect of liability for the wrongful acts alleged in the Jersey proceedings.
However, he also ruled that the insurers should have a right of subrogation whereby they could, upon payment of any sums to the employee, take over any rights of action which the employee might have against the company pursuant to an indemnity granted to him jointly by RTCJ and the company.
The company and the former employee in question have filed notices to appeal subrogation aspects of the judgment, and insurers have filed notices to cross-appeal coverage aspects of the judgment.
The hearing of these appeals before the Court of Appeal is expected to take place in the second half of 2014.
There is therefore a risk that the groups insurance cover for the year in question will not be effective in relation to the Jersey claim or will prove insufficient to cover losses, in which case any obligation could be material.
The board believes that it is more likely than not that any final judgment in relation to the above claims will result in no liability to the company, and accordingly no provision has been made.
b The company leases various offices and other assets under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
