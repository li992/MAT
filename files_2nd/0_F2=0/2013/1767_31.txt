The majority of the projected cash flows within these CGUs are underpinned by expected levels of primarily UK government spending on defence, aerospace and security, and the Groups ability to capture a broadly consistent market share.
In the case of Applied Intelligence, the future cash flow projections are based on the expectation of growth in cyber and intelligence, in the UK and overseas government markets, together with increasing demand for products and services in commercial markets.
Impairment goodwill In 2013, the impairment charge of 865m comprises the US Intelligence & Security 417m and Land & Armaments 448m CGUs.
The impairments in respect of both of these businesses have arisen as a result of the increase in the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital and a reduction in the future cash flow projections which include an estimate of reductions in US defence spending.
In 2012, the impairment charge of 57m comprised the Safariland 27m and Tensylon 12m businesses disposed of during 2012 and the Commercial Armored Vehicles business 18m disposed of during 2013, all within the Land & Armaments CGU.
Impairment intangible assets In 2013, the impairment charge of 22m relates to the Electronic Systems 4m, Cyber & Intelligence 8m and Platforms & Services US 10m reporting segments.
In 2012, the impairment charge of 29m primarily related to the Land & Armaments business within the Platforms & Services US reporting segment and included 21m in respect of the Safariland business disposed of during 2012.

Curtailment gains 26 16 42 The sensitivity of the valuation of the liabilities to changes in the inflation assumption presented above assumes that a 0.1 percentage point Interest expense 932 163 6 1,101 change to expectations of future inflation results in a 0.1 percentage point change to all inflation-related assumptions used to value the Foreign exchange gain 157 6 163 liabilities.
However, upper and lower limits exist on the majority of inflation-related benefits such that a change in expectations of future inflation Benefits paid 845 164 7 1,016 may not have the same impact on the inflation-related benefits, and hence will result in a smaller change to the valuation of the liabilities.
Defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2012 21,406 3,751 134 25,291 Accordingly, extrapolation of the above results beyond the specific sensitivity figures shown may not be appropriate.
To illustrate this, the Current service cost 205 12 1 218 increase decrease in the defined benefit pension obligation resulting from larger changes in the inflation assumption would be as follows: Increase decrease Contributions by employer in respect of employee salary sacrifice arrangements 104 104 bn Total current service cost 309 12 1 322 Inflation: Members contributions including Department for Work and Pensions rebates 13 13 0.5 percentage point increase 1.5 Past service cost plan amendments 11 11 0.5 percentage point decrease 1.5 Actuarial loss gain due to changes in financial assumptions 896 330 11 555 1.0 percentage point increase 2.9 Experience gains 146 21 5 172 1.0 percentage point decrease 2.9 Interest expense 945 152 5 1,102 Three of the Groups schemes are invested in longevity swap arrangements insuring against longevity risk for the current pensioner Foreign exchange gain 49 2 51 population see page 163.

Financial risk management Fair value of financial instruments Interest rate risk Certain of the Groups financial instruments are held at fair value.
The Groups objective is to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on borrowings through varying the proportion of fixed rate debt relative to floating rate debt with derivative instruments, mainly interest rate swaps.
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the balance sheet date.
The Groups interest rate management policy is that a minimum of 50% 2012 50% and a maximum of 90% 2012 90% of gross debt is maintained at fixed interest rates.

Loans 909 300 300 Due to the variability of the valuation factors, the fair values presented at 31 December may not be indicative of the amounts the Group would expect to realise in the current market environment.
The floating rate debt has been predominantly achieved by entering into interest rate swaps which swap the fixed rate US dollar interest payable on debt into either floating rate sterling or US dollars.
