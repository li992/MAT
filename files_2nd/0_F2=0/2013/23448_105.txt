Statement of Directors Responsibilities The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors Remuneration Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law the Directors have prepared the Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements: prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The financial statements are published on www.
com, which is a website maintained by Electra Partners.
The maintenance and integrity of the website is, so far as it relates to the Company, the responsibility of Electra Partners.
The work carried out by the Auditors does not involve consideration of the maintenance and integrity of this website and, accordingly the Auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on the website.
Visitors to the website need to be aware that legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of the financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Companys transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the Board of Directors section of the Annual Report, confirms that, to the best of their knowledge: The Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group: and The Strategic Report contained in the Annual Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and position of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces: So far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Companys auditors are unaware: and They have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Companys Auditors are aware of that information: The Group financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable, and provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Companys performance, business model and strategy.
