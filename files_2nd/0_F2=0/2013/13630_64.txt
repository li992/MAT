The Group continues to expect its effective rate of corporation tax to be higher than the standard UK rate due to higher rates of tax in the USA, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and India.
A credit of 3,611,000 2012: 2,399,000 in respect of acquired intangible asset amortisation is included in the deferred tax credit of 4,385,000 2012: 2,215,000.
There is an unrecognised deferred tax liability for temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries.
Rotork plc controls the dividend policies of its subsidiaries and subsequently the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences.
It is not practical to quantify the unprovided temporary differences as acknowledged within paragraph 40 of IAS 12.
