Having been at a small premium for most of the year, on 31 March 2013, the discount of the Companys share price relative to net asset value debt at fair value, cum income was 3.1%.
As you will read in the investment managers report that follows, significant headwinds have had to be negotiated to achieve this level of out-performance of the benchmark and your manager is to be congratulated for his skill and stock selection.
Further details can be found in the Investment Managers Report on page 6. Dividend For the year ended 31 March 2013, three interim dividends of 2.55p each were paid to shareholders in September and December 2012, and March 2013, and a fourth interim dividend of 3.55p will be paid on 28 June 2013.
This gives a total dividend for the year of 11.2p, representing an increase of 7.7% on the previous year.
The Board continues to recognise the importance of dividends to shareholders and is seeking to maintain its policy of real dividend growth over the medium to longer term.
Gearing The Companys Manager continued to demonstrate faith in his portfolio during the year, maintaining a geared position throughout.
The gearing of the Company was 14.1% at the year end 2012: 18%.
The Boards policy is to permit gearing to a maximum of 25%, allowing the manager some discretion up to that level.
During the year, gearing was provided by bank borrowings of 100 million and a debenture of 30 million.
Further information relating to the Companys gearing policy can be found on page 16.
Your Board On 20 November 2012 Richard Laing was appointed as a Director of the Company and I would like to take this opportunity to welcome him to the Board.
Directors consider that, with his considerable knowledge and experience, Richard will make a valuable contribution to the Boards deliberations and therefore, recommend that shareholders support resolution 7 at the Companys AGM.
Further information in relation to the appointment, re-election and tenure of Directors can be found on page 20.
Final Exercise of Subscription Shares Subscription shareholders are reminded that on 31 August 2013 they have the final opportunity to exercise their right to subscribe for fully paid ordinary shares on the basis of one ordinary share for every subscription share held, at a price of 218.94p per share.
The market price of the ordinary shares at the latest practical date prior to publication was 345p.
Subscription shareholders will shortly receive notification and, as this is the final exercise opportunity, the Board recommends that shareholders respond accordingly and take appropriate advice if necessary.
Those subscription shareholders that do not exercise their rights will automatically receive any value for their subscription rights in cash if they can be sold at a premium to the exercise price plus any costs.
This process is explained in greater detail on pages 13 and 26.
Annual General Meeting AGM Shareholders attention is drawn to the special business in the Notice of AGM which includes the usual renewal of powers to issue and buy back shares and to allow application of the minimum notice required for general meetings other than the annual general meeting by the Companies Act 2006.
The Directors have carefully considered all the resolutions proposed in the Notice of the AGM as set out on pages 52 to 55 and, in their opinion, consider them all to be in the interests of shareholders as a whole.
The Directors therefore recommend that shareholders vote in favour of each resolution.
The Companys AGM will be held at Phyllis Court Members Club, Phyllis Court Drive, Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire RG9 2HT on Thursday, 11 July 2013 at 11 am.
I do hope that as many shareholders as possible are able to attend.
The Directors and the Investment Manager, Mark Barnett, will be available at the meeting to answer shareholder questions.
