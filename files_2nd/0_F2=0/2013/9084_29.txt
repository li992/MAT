Pension liabilities The Company operates a defined benefit pension scheme, and also makes payments into defined contribution schemes for employees.
The liability in respect of the defined benefit scheme is the present value of the defined benefit obligations at the balance sheet date, calculated using the projected unit credit method, less the fair value of the schemes assets.
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 17 recognising the current service cost and interest on scheme liabilities in the profit and loss account, and actuarial gains and losses in reserves.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.
Deferred taxation Except where otherwise required by FRS 19, full provision without discounting is made for all timing differences which have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets principally consist of leasehold improvements which are depreciated over the term of the lease.
Accounting developments FRS 100, 101 and 102 were recently issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
FRS 100 sets out the application of financial reporting requirements in the UK and FRS 101, IFRS with reduced disclosures outlines the reduced disclosure framework available for use by qualifying entities choosing to report under IFRS.
FRS 102 is applicable in the UK and is known as new UK GAAP.
The mandatory effective date for the new framework of reporting is for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015.
The Company will apply either FRS 101 IFRS with reduced disclosures or FRS 102 new UK GAAP.
An analysis is currently being undertaken to identify the most appropriate option.
