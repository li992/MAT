ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES PHOSPHATES estimates as at 31 December 2013 ANGLO AMERICAN FOSFATOS BRASIL LIMITADA The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates were compiled in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves The JORC Code, 2012 as a minimum standard.
The figures reported represent 100% of the Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources, the percentage attributable to Anglo American plc is stated separately.
Rounding of figures may cause computational discrepancies.

Mine Life the extraction period in years for scheduled Ore Reserves comprising Proved and Probable Reserves only.
Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to some Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will necessarily be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Resource after continued exploration.
Chapado Mine is the formal name of the Anglo American Fosfatos Brasil Limitada Phosphate mining operation near Ouvidor reported as Ouvidor in 2012.
1 Chapado Oxide Ore Reserves: The decrease is primarily due to reallocation of Ore Reserves to Mineral Resources which occurred when the new resource classification methodology balanced scorecard was applied resulting in the downgrade of confidence of portions of the reserve.
The Mine Life is also reduced as a result.
The decrease is offset by the inclusion of new drilling information in the updated geological model and a re-assay and drilling program is planned to upgrade confidence in future model updates.
2 Chapado Oxide Mineral Resources: Mineral Resources are quoted above a 6 %P O cut-off and a CaO P O ratio between 1 and 1.5.
The increase and 2 5 2 5 downgrading of the Mineral Resources is as a result of the application of the new resource classification methodology balanced scorecard which resulted in reallocation of Ore Reserves to Mineral Resources.
3 Coqueiros: The Oxide mineralisation is defined by a cut-off grade of 7 %P O and a CaO P O ratio between 1 and 1.4.
The Fresh Rock resources are 2 5 2 5 defined by a cut-off grade of 5% P O.
The exploration drilling report submitted to Brazils Departamento Nacional fide Produo Mineral DNPM was approved 2 5 late in 2013 and the updated estimates will be published in 2015.
