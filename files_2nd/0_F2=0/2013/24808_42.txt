Contingent liabilities, guarantees and financial commitments There were no contingent liabilities, guarantees or financial commitments at 31 December 2013.
The Companys commitment to participate in Herald Ventures II Limited Partnership was fully drawn down by 31 December 2012.
Capital management The Company does not have any externally imposed capital requirements.
The capital of the Company is the Ordinary share capital and reserves as detailed in notes 13 and 14.
It is managed in accordance with its investment policy in pursuit of its investment objective, both of which are detailed on page 22, and shares may be repurchased as explained on pages 27 and 28.
Financial instruments In accordance with the corporate objective of maximising capital appreciation the Company invests in securities on a worldwide basis.
The Company makes use of gearing to achieve improved performance in rising markets and has an interest rate swap, the purpose of which is to hedge the variability in cash flows arising from interest rate fluctuations on bank loans.
The Companys other financial instruments consist of cash, short term debtors and creditors.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are: A.
Market Risk i Other price risk, being the risk that the value of investment holdings will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices caused by factors other than interest rate or currency rate movement: ii Interest rate risk, being the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates: and iii Foreign currency risk, being the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
Credit Risk Being the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation.

Financial instruments continued C. Liquidity Risk Being the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
These risks and the policies for managing them have been applied throughout the year and are summarised below.
Further detail is contained in the Strategic Report on page 23.
Market Risk i Other Price Risk The Companys investment portfolio is exposed to market price fluctuations which are monitored by the Manager in pursuance of the corporate objective.
Securities held by the Company are valued at bid prices, whereas material unlisted investments are valued by the Directors on the basis of the latest information in line with the relevant principles of the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines Accounting Policy b.
These valuations also represent the fair value of the investments, see note 9 on pages 46 and 47.
A full list of the Companys investments is given on pages 16 to 20.
In addition, a geographical analysis of the portfolio, an analysis of the investment portfolio by broad industrial or commercial sector and a review of the 20 largest equity investments by their aggregate market value, are shown on pages 12 to 15.
Other Price Risk Sensitivity 26.5% of the Companys equity investments at 31 December 2013 2012 29.9% were listed on the main list of the London Stock Exchange and a further 38.2% 2012 38.0% on AIM.
The NASDAQ Stock Exchange accounts for 16.7% 2012 20.9% and other stock exchanges 18.6% 2012 8.3%.
A 10% increase in stock prices at 31 December 2013 would have increased total net assets and net return on ordinary activities after taxation by 62,500,000 2012 51,100,000.
A decrease of 10% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
The portfolio does not target any exchange as a comparative index, and the performance of the portfolio has a low correlation to generally used indices.
The shares of Herald Investment Trust plc have an underlying NAV per share.
The NAV per share of Herald Investment Trust plc fluctuates on a daily basis.
In addition, there is volatility in the discount premium the share price has to NAV.
ii Interest Rate Risk The majority of the Companys assets are equity shares and other investments which neither pay interest nor have a maturity date.
However, the Company does hold Convertible Bonds and Government Securities, the interest rate and maturity dates of which are detailed below.
Interest is accrued on sterling cash balances at a rate linked to the UK base rate.
The aim of the use of gearing is to enhance long term returns to shareholders by investing borrowed funds in equities and other assets.
How and where borrowings are invested is reviewed by the Board in consultation with the Manager at every Board meeting.
In light of the decisions made, appropriate adjustments to the gearing position are then made by the Manager.
At the year end the Company had borrowings of 25 million 2012 50 million.
Under the terms of an interest rate swap, the interest payable on the bank loans has been fixed.
The interest rate risk profile of the financial assets and financial liabilities at 31 December was: Financial Assets 2013 2012 2013 Weighted 2012 Weighted Weighted average Weighted average average period average period 2013 interest until 2012 interest until Fair rate maturity Fair rate maturity value interest maturity value interest maturity 000 rate date 000 rate date Fixed rate: UK bonds 17,816 4.7% 4 years Euro bonds 19,281 4.2% 3 years 14,015 5.0% 4 years UK convertible bonds 256 8.0% 3 years 729 7.5% 2 years Cash: Other overseas currencies 10,271 6,341 Sterling 7,737 1.0% 22,609 0.7% 18,008 28,950 HERALD INVESTMENT TRUST plc 51 106988 Herald AR 1213-v10.

The effective fixed rate of interest on the loans of 6.25% 2012 6.1% reflects a weighted average variable interest rate paid of 1.87% 2012 2.1%, with a further weighted average of 4.38% paid on the swap 2012 4.0%.
The Companys facility is rolling on a quarterly basis with the facility expiring in December 2014.
While the 30 year swap remains in place, the net interest payable will effectively be fixed for the duration of the term of the loan facilities at 4.8975% plus margin cost of 1.35% making a total of 6.2475%.

Based on the position at 31 December 2013, over a full year, an increase of 100 basis points would have increased the net return on ordinary activities after taxation by 180,000 2012 290,000 and would have increased the net asset value per share by 0.23p 2012 0.36p.
The calculations are based on the cash balances as at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole.
b Fixed rate bonds An increase of 100 basis points in bond yields as at 31 December 2013 would have decreased total net assets and total return on ordinary activities by 576,000 2012 980,000 and would have decreased the net asset value per share by 0.74p 2012 1.24p.
A decrease in bond yields would have had an equal and opposite effect.
The Convertible loan stocks having an element of equity are not included in this analysis as given the nature of the businesses and the risk profile of the balance sheets they are considered to have more equity like characteristics.
c Bank loans The effect of an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in 3 month LIBOR interest rates as at 31 December 2013 on the interest cost of the bank loans and the net income return has been eliminated through a 30 year floating interest rate to fixed interest rate swap.
The swap generates payments or charges that offset changes in the 3 month LIBOR interest rate, so that the interest payable on the bank loans is effectively converted to a fixed rate loan at 4.8975% 2012 4.8975% plus margin cost.
The initial term of the swap on commencement at 30 years did not match the term of the loans, therefore, hedge accounting is not used and changes in the fair value of the swap are captured in the net return on ordinary activities as set out in d below.

Based on the position as at 31 December 2013, over a full year, a decrease of 100 basis points would have decreased the gains on investments and net return on ordinary activities after taxation by 10,181,000 2012 11,941,000 and would have decreased the net asset value per share by 13.11p 2012 15.05p.
An increase of 100 basis points would have had an equal but opposite effect.
iii Foreign Currency Risk The Companys reporting currency is sterling, but investments are made in overseas markets as well as the United Kingdom and the asset value can be affected by movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
Furthermore many companies trade internationally both through foreign subsidiaries, and through exports.
The greatest foreign currency risk occurs when companies have a divergence in currencies for costs and revenues.
A much less risky exposure to currency is straight translation of sales and profits.
The List of Investments on pages 16 to 20 breaks down the portfolio by geographic listing.
However the location of the stock market quote only has a limited correlation to the costs, revenues and even activities of those companies, and so this note should not be regarded as a reliable guide to the sensitivity of the portfolio to currency movements.
For example, the holdings in the portfolio that have suffered most from US$ weakness are UK companies with dollar revenues and sterling costs.
The Company does not hedge the sterling value of investments that are priced in other currencies.
Overseas income is subject to currency fluctuations.
The Company does not hedge these currency fluctuations because it is impossible to quantify the effect for the reasons stated above.
However, from time to time the Manager takes a view by holding financial assets or liabilities in overseas currencies.
Exposure to currency risk through asset allocation by currency of listing is indicated below: At 31 December 2013 Other debtors Cash and and Net Investments deposits Loans creditors exposure 000 000 000 000 000 US dollar 134,738 8,305 8 143,051 Norwegian krone 19,281 502 19,783 Korean won 14,489 110 14,599 Taiwan dollar 10,911 1,964 12,875 Euro 20,842 2 10 20,854 Other overseas currencies 10,930 11 10,941 Exposure to currency risk on translation of valuations of securities listed in overseas currencies 211,191 10,271 641 222,103 Sterling 432,875 7,737 25,000 14,112 401,500 644,066 18,008 25,000 13,471 623,603 Includes net non-monetary assets of 0.

Foreign currency risk sensitivity At 31 December 2013, had sterling strengthened by 10% 2012 10% in relation to all currencies, with all other variables held constant, total net assets and net return on ordinary activities after taxation would have decreased by the amounts shown below based solely on translation of securities quoted in currencies overseas.
A 10% 2012 10% weakening of sterling against all currencies, with all other variables held constant, would have had an equal but opposite effect on the financial statement amounts.
However, companies whose cost base diverges in currency terms from its sales will in the longer term have a significantly greater effect on valuation than simple translation.
In the short term investee companies generally cover their currency exposure to varying degrees.
There is insufficient publicly disclosed information to quantify this, but in the long term this effect is expected to dwarf simple translation of foreign listings in terms of both risk and reward, because many investee companies trade globally.
Furthermore, the country of listing is not necessarily an indication of the geography of some or even any operational activities for investee companies.
The Manager does not use financial instruments to protect against currency movements.
From time to time financial leverage has been made using debt in overseas currencies.
Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment which it has entered into with the Company.
The Manager monitors counterparty risk on an ongoing basis.
The Company has investments in convertible loan stocks that have an element of equity.
These securities are viewed as having a risk profile similar to the equity holdings.
This is because the convertibles held are in nascent technology companies that may be loss making and may have weak balance sheets.
For this reason these stocks are categorised as equity holdings.
The fixed interest securities held are UK and Norwegian Government securities and UK corporate bonds.

Credit Risk continued Credit Risk Exposure The exposure to credit risk at 31 December was: 2013 2012 000 000 Fixed interest investments 19,281 31,831 Cash and short term deposits 18,008 28,950 Debtors and prepayments 1,554 1,985 38,843 62,766 The maximum exposure in fixed interest investments was 38,570,000 2012 33,170,000 and the minimum 19,281,000 2012 26,228,000.
None of the Companys financial assets are past due or impaired.
C. Liquidity Risk The Companys policy with regard to liquidity is to provide a degree of flexibility so that the portfolio can be repositioned when appropriate and that most of the assets can be realised without an excessive discount to the market price.
a Equity Securities The Companys unlisted investments are not readily realisable, but these only amount to 1.5% of the Companys total assets at 31 December 2013 2012 2.1%.
In practice, liquidity in investee companies is imperfect, particularly those with a market value of less than 100 million.
To reduce this liquidity risk it is the policy to diversify the holdings and generally to restrict the holding in any one company to less than 10% of the share capital of that company.
Furthermore the guideline is for no single investment to account for more than 5% of the assets of the Company.
The market valuation of each underlying security gives an indication of value, but the price at which an investment can be made or realised can diverge materially from the bid or offer price depending on market conditions generally and particularly to each investment.
29% 173 million 2012 34% 182 million of the portfolio is invested in listed stocks with a market capitalisation below 100 million, where liquidity is expected to be more limited.
If these stocks had on average a realisable value 20% below the bid price the value of the total fund would be adversely affected by 5.5% 2012 6.7%.
b Floating interest rate to fixed interest rate swap The fair value of the swap is estimated by the Administrator and is compared to the swap providers RBS valuation.
We believe the RBS valuation to be reasonable.
The RBS valuation methodology and assumptions may change at any time.
The swap valuation gives an indication of fair value, but the price at which the swap can be unwound or realised may diverge materially from this valuation depending on market conditions and liquidity.
Liquidity Risk Exposure Contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at the year end, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required are as follows: 2013 2012 One year One year or less or less 000 000 Bank loans 25,120 50,492 Derivative financial instruments 14,481 24,136 Other creditors 597 470 40,198 75,098 HERALD INVESTMENT TRUST plc 55 106988 Herald AR 1213-v10.

Financial instruments continued Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair values are measured using the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1: reflects financial instruments quoted in an active market.
Level 2: reflects financial instruments whose fair value is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets.
Level 3: reflects financial instruments whose fair value is determined in whole or in part using a valuation technique based on assumptions that are not supported by prices from observable market transactions in the same instrument and not based on available observable market data.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies on pages 43 and 44.
