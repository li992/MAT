Business Overview Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Company Information 71 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2013 Notes to the Financial Statements year ended 31 March 2013 1 Non-GAAP measures The Directors present the following non-GAAP measures as they consider that they give a better indication of the underlying performance of the business.
Reconciliation between profit before income tax and adjusted profit Year to Year to 31 March 31 March 2013 2012 m m Profit before income tax 29.6 36.1 Reversal of acquisition related fair value adjustments to inventory 0.5 1.7 Gain on disposal of product line 7.0 Acquisition related costs 2.1 1.5 Amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles 13.8 11.2 Unwind of discount in respect of deferred consideration 0.2 Mark to market loss gain in respect of derivative financial instruments 2.0 1.5 Adjusted profit before income tax 48.2 42.0 Share of taxation 9.9 8.8 Adjusted profit for the year 38.3 33.2 The reversal of acquisition related fair value adjustments to inventory are excluded from adjusted profit to provide a measure that includes results from acquired businesses on a consistent basis over time to assist comparison of performance.
Acquisition related costs comprise professional fees incurred in relation to mergers and acquisitions activity and any consideration which, under IFRS3 revised, falls to be treated as a post-acquisition employment expense.
In common with a number of other companies adjusted profit excludes the non-cash amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets.
Under IAS 39, all derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are also measured at fair value.
In respect of instruments used to hedge foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk the Group does not take advantage of the hedge accounting rules provided for in IAS 39 since that standard requires certain stringent criteria to be met in order to hedge account, which, in the particular circumstances of the Group, are considered by the Board not to bring any significant economic benefit.
Accordingly, the Group accounts for these derivative financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
To the extent that instruments are hedges of future transactions, adjusted profit for the year is stated before changes in the valuation of these instruments so that the underlying performance of the Group can be more clearly seen.
In calculating the share of tax attributable to adjusted profit before tax in 2011 a one-off recognition of deferred tax assets relating to the Groups UK businesses of 11.3m was excluded.
At that time theGroup announced its intention to exclude the reversal of this deferred tax from the calculation of the share of tax attributable to adjusted profit before tax in the years in which it reverses.
In the current period deferred tax of 3.3m 2012: 4.6m has reversed and consequently been excluded from the tax attributable to adjusted profit before tax.
During the prior year the Group: disposed of a product line for a consideration of 8.1m.
1.0m of the consideration was deferred for one year.
The product line waspart of the Industrial Products segment.
The profit on disposal was 7.0m: and transferred its ownership of Technologies and Devices Inc TDI to Ostendo, a privately owned company based in California.
TheGroup has received 650,000 shares of Ostendo common stock plus $0.9m in cash.
The Group considers the fair value oftheshares to be nil.
The profit on disposal was nil.
Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2013 72 Notes to the Financial Statements continued year ended 31 March 2013 2 Segment information The Group has six operating segments.
These operating segments have been combined into three aggregated operating segments to the extent that they have similar economic characteristics, with relevance to products and services, type and class of customer, methods of sale and distribution and the regulatory environment in which they operate.
Each of these three aggregated operating segments is a reportable segment.
The Groups internal management structure and financial reporting systems differentiate the three aggregated operating segments on the basis of the economic characteristics discussed below: the Nanotechnology Tools segment contains a group of businesses supplying similar products, characterised by a high degree of customisation and high unit prices.
These are the Groups highest technology products serving research customers in both the public and private sectors: the Industrial Products segment contains a group of businesses supplying high technology products and components manufactured in medium volume for industrial customers: and the Service segment contains the Groups service business as well as service revenues from other parts of the Group.
Reportable segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those which can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arms length basis.
The operating results of each are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker, which is deemed to be the Board of Directors.
Discrete financial information is available for each segment and used by the Board of Directors for decisions on resource allocation and to assess performance.
No asset information is presented below as this information is not presented in reporting to the Groups Board of Directors.

This has been corrected in the above table resulting in an increase of cash spent on R&D by 1.0m in the year to 31 March 2012.
This has had no impact on the primary Financial Statements.

The exercise prices are determined according to the mid-market closing share price on the day before the date of grant.
Options have a life of ten years and a vesting period of three years.
Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Scheme SELTIS Options awarded under the Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Scheme are made annually to certain senior managers.
Options have a life of seven years and a vesting period of three years.
Both the Executive Share Option Scheme and Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Scheme are subject to performance conditions which can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 43 to 52.
All employee Share Incentive Plan SIP All UK employees are eligible to participate in the Groups HM Revenue and Customs approved SIP.
Participating employees make a cash contribution to the plan each month.
The Group contributes a further amount equal to 20% of the employees contribution.
Independent trustees then purchase matching shares in the market on behalf of the employees.
The matching shares vest on thecompletion by the participating employee of a further three years service and can be withdrawn from the plan tax-free after fiveyears service.
Administrative expenses include a charge of 1.4m 2012: 1.0m in respect of the cost of providing share options.
The cost iscalculated by estimating the fair value of the option at grant date and spreading that amount over the vesting period after adjusting for an expectation of non-vesting.
Fair values are determined using an internal calculation based on a modified Black-Scholes model.
Expected volatility has been based on historical volatility over a period of time of the same length as the expected option life and ending on the grant date.
Half of the ESO options issued before 2009 and all SELTIS options use Total Shareholder Return TSR as a performance condition.
As TSR is a market based performance condition, the accounting treatment differs from that for shares subject to non-market performance conditions.
This means that the TSR performance conditions have been incorporated into the calculation of the fair value as a discount in calculating the fair value.

A reduction in the rate from 25% to 24% effective from 1 April 2012 was substantively enacted on 26 March 2012 and a further reduction to 23% effective from 1 April 2013 was substantively enacted on 3 July 2012.
It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further 3% rate reduction, although this willfurther reduce the Groups future current tax charge and reduce the Groups deferred tax assets and liabilities accordingly.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31 March 2013 have been calculated using the rate of 23% which was substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
10 Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit for the period as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Income divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Trust, as follows: 2013 2012 Shares Shares million million Weighted average number of shares outstanding 56.4 54.2 Less shares held by Employee Share Ownership Trust 0.2 0.2 Weighted average number of shares used in calculation of earnings per share 56.2 54.0 The following table shows the effect of share options on the calculation of diluted earnings per share: 2013 2012 Shares Shares million million Weighted average number of ordinary shares per basic earnings per share calculations 56.2 54.0 Effect of shares under option 0.6 1.1 Weighted average number of ordinary shares per diluted earnings per share calculations 56.8 55.1 11 Dividends per share The following dividends per share were paid by the Group: 2013 2012 pence pence Previous year interim dividend 2.772 2.52 Previous year final dividend 7.228 6.48 10.000 9.00 The following dividends per share were proposed by the Group in respect of each accounting year presented: 2013 2012 pence pence Interim dividend 3.05 2.772 Final dividend 8.15 7.228 11.20 10.000 The interim dividend was not provided for at the year end and was paid on 8 April 2013.
The payment of the interim dividend remains discretionary until it is paid.

This relationship no longer exists and as a result management have reviewed the carrying value ofthe intangible asset and concluded that it is of no value.
Accordingly, an impairment of 2.6m has been charged to the Income Statement.
It is recorded as an adjusting item within administration and shared service costs in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
There were no further impairments recognised in the current or prior year.
Business Overview Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Company Information 83 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2013 13 Intangible assets continued Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected tobenefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill was allocated to individual CGUs as follows: 2013 2012 m m Nanotechnology Tools NanoScience 2.3 2.3 NanoAnalysis 4.2 3.9 Asylum 9.9 Omicron 0.3 0.3 Industrial Products Industrial Analysis 3.2 3.2 Magnetic Resonance 2.3 2.3 Austin Scientific 1.7 1.7 Service OI Service 0.6 0.4 24.5 14.1 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Accounting standards require an impairment test to be carried out by determining the recoverable amount of each cash generating unit which contains goodwill.
The recoverable amount is calculated as the higher of the fair value less costs to sell or the value in use of the CGU.
In the Groups case the recoverable amount is based on value in use calculations.
Value in use is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows and in particular Board-approved three year cash flow forecasts, prepared by the management of each CGU, are used together with 2.5% 2012: 2.5% per annum growth for each CGU for the subsequent 20 years.
This growth rate is considered to be at or below long term market trends for the Groups businesses.
Key assumptions The key assumptions are those regarding discount rates, growth rates, expected selling volumes and prices and direct costs during the period.
The growth rates are based on industry growth factors.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices andexpectations of future changes in the market.
The pre-tax weighted average costs of capital used for Nanotechnology Tools, Industrial Products and Service in impairment testing are 12.25% 2012: 11.1%, 11.75% 2012: 10.6% and 11.25% 2012: 10.1% respectively in line with the risk associated with each of the business segments.
Management have estimated these discount rates by reference to past experience and an industry average weighted cost of capital as adjusted for appropriate risk factors reflecting current economic circumstances and the risk profiles ofeach CGU.
Sensitivity analysis The Groups estimate of impairments are most sensitive to changes in the discount rate and forecast cash flows.
Sensitivity analysis has been carried out by reference to both of these assumptions.
This demonstrated that, ignoring the recently acquired Asylum business where management consider the recent arms length transaction to be reflective of the business fair value, animpairment would only be required if there were an increase in the discount rates by 23% 2012: 13% or more or a greater than 19% 2012: 10% reduction in forecast cash flows on the CGU with the lowest level of headroom.
Sensitivity testing on the other CGUs shows an even greater level of headroom.
Based on the above, the Group considers that its impairment calculations are not sensitive to any reasonable change to the keyassumptions.

In the prior year 0.7m related to a loss making subsidiary in China.
Management have reviewed a detailed forecast for the Japanese subsidiary which shows that it is highly probable that future profits will arise and on that basis it is considered appropriate to recognise the deferred tax asset.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items: 2013 2012 m m Deductible temporary differences 1.0 6.5 Tax losses 10.4 9.5 11.4 16.0 The tax losses and the deductible temporary differences do not expire under current tax legislation.
Deferred tax assets have notbeen recognised in respect of these items as it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available in the subsidiaries concerned against which the Group can utilise the brought forward tax losses.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of 46.6m 2012: 50.2m of undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries since the majority of such distributions would not be taxable.
In other cases the Group considers that it is able to control the timing of remittances so that any tax is not expected to arise in the foreseeable future.
On 20 March 2013 the Chancellor announced that the UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 20% by 1 April 2015.
The deferred tax asset at 31 March 2013 has been calculated on the rate of 23% which was substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2013 86 Notes to the Financial Statements continued year ended 31 March 2013 17 Financial risk management The Groups multinational operations and debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks.
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, commodity risk and credit risk.
Financial risk management policies are set by the Board of Directors.
These policies are implemented by a central treasury function that has formal procedures to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk, including, where appropriate, the use of derivative financial instruments.
Commodity risk is managed locally by the operating businesses.
The Group has clearly defined authority and approval limits.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Such instruments are only used to manage the risks arising from operating or financial assets or liabilities or highly probable future transactions.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates andcertain commodity prices.
The Group has adopted hedge accounting for a limited number of related commodity contracts as outlined below.
However, in common with a number of other companies, the Group has decided that the additional costs of meeting the extensive documentation requirements of IAS 39 to apply hedge accounting to derivative financial instruments used for hedging exposure to foreign currency and interest rate volatility cannot be justified.
Accordingly the Group does not use hedge accounting for such derivatives.
Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk arises both where sale or purchase transactions are undertaken in currencies other than the respective functional currencies of Group companies transactional exposures and where the results of overseas companies are consolidated into the Groups reporting currency of Sterling translational exposures.
The Group has operations around the world which record their results in a variety of different local functional currencies.
In countries where the Group does not have operations, it invariably has some customers or suppliers that transact in a foreign currency.
The Group is therefore exposed to the changes in foreign currency exchange rates between a number of different currencies but the Groups primary exposures relate to the US Dollar, the Euro and the Japanese Yen.
To reduce uncertainty the Group maintains a rolling hedge equivalent to 80% of the exposure expected to arise over the following 12 months.
The hedge comprises a mixture of fixed forward contracts and option based products.
The remaining 20% is sold on the spot market as it arises.
The fair value of outstanding currency contracts recognised as a liability asat 31 March 2013 amount to 2.5m 2012: 1.0m and those recognised as an asset amount to 2.2m 2012: 2.4m.
Movements in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income immediately.
However, in order to facilitate a more meaningful comparison of the Groups performance year on year the element of these movements that relate to hedges in respect of future sales are treated as an adjusting item in the calculation of adjusted earnings see Note 1.
The Groups translational exposures to foreign currency risks can relate both to the Consolidated Statement of Income and net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
The Groups policy is not to hedge the translational exposure that arises on consolidation of the Consolidated Statements of Income of overseas subsidiaries.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises both the interest rate price risk that results from borrowing at fixed rates of interest and also the interest cash flow risk that results from borrowing at variable rates.
At this time, the Group has no borrowings and consequently isnot exposed to interest rate risk.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk represents the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing this risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group manages this risk by maintaining adequate committed lines of funding from high quality lenders.
The facilities committed to the Group as at 31 March 2013 are set out in Note 20. Credit risk Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its obligations.
The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets such as cash balances, derivative financial instruments, trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables and cash balances.
The amounts recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position are net of appropriate allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Trade receivables are subject to credit limits and control and approval procedures in the operating companies.
Due to its large geographic base and number of customers, the Group is not exposed to material concentrations of credit risk on its trade receivables.
Credit risk associated with cash balances and derivative financial instruments is managed by transacting with financial institutions with high quality credit ratings.
In particular a Board approved policy sets out guidelines for which categories of institutions may be used and the maximum amount which may be invested with each institution within a particular category.
Accordingly the Groups associated credit risk is limited.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the Group Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
Business Overview Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Company Information 87 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2013 17 Financial risk management continued Credit risk continued Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31March 2013 was 107.1m 2012: 93.9m.
2013 2012 m m Trade receivables 59.8 51.9 Other receivables 5.9 4.5 Cash and cash equivalents 39.2 35.1 Forward exchange contracts 2.2 2.4 107.1 93.9 The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables is discussed in Note 16.
Other receivables include 0.8m 2012: 1.0m in respect of VAT and similar taxes which are not past due date.
Commodity risk The Group is exposed to changes in commodity prices, particularly in respect of copper used as a major component in one of the Groups USA operations.
It manages this exposure using derivative commodity hedging instruments.
At 31 March 2013, the Group had outstanding commodity hedge contracts with a fair value liability of 0.1m 2012: 0.1m liability that were designated and effective as cash flow hedges of committed and highly probable forecast transactions.
Fair value movements of these contracts have been deferred in equity until the hedged transaction takes place.
These contracts all mature within one year of the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date.
A 0.1m loss net of tax 2012: 0.1m loss has been deferred in equity as at 31 March 2013 in respect of these contracts.
A loss of 0.2m 2012: 0.3m gain has been recycled to current assets inventory in respect of contracts designated as cash flow hedges that have matured during the year to 31 March 2013.
Capital management The Board considers capital to comprise share capital, reserves and the net cash or net debt position of the Company.
The Company was in a net cash position at the year end.
The Boards long term objective is to have an efficient capital structure by maintaining a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
This is monitored by reference to the ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA and the Board has set itself internal limits, which are well inside any covenants the Group has with lenders.
The Group maintains the right to purchase its own shares in the market: the timing of these purchases would depend on market prices.
Buy and sell decisions are made on a specific transaction basis by the Board.
The Board carefully considers dividend payments and the Company moved from a fixed dividend policy to a progressive one in the year ended March 2011.
In doing this the Board will look to increase dividends as adjusted earnings per share increase although there will not be a direct correlation.
The Board does not have a policy to pay a fixed dividend yield or to maintain a fixed rate of dividend cover, but assess both of these metrics together with dividends paid by peers when assessing what dividend to recommend.
The Group outlined its medium term targets on 14 June 2011 in its 14Cubed plan.
Part of this plan calls for bolt-on acquisitions.
Inline with the objective of maintaining a balance between borrowings and equity, the Group decided to seek to repay the debt drawn down to finance the first two acquisitions of the 14Cubed plan through an equity issue, improving the net debt to EBITDA ratio, thereby allowing it to finance any future bolt-on acquisitions from its Statement of Financial Position and existing committed facility without recourse to further equity issues.
The Board encourages employees to hold shares in the Company.
As well as various share option plans full details of which are given in Note 8, from April 2008 all UK employees have been offered the opportunity to take part in a Share Incentive Plan SIP.
Under this plan, employees are able to invest up to 1,500 each tax year in shares in the Company.
The Company awards one additional free share a matching share for every five shares bought by each employee.
There were no changes to the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are marked to market using listed market prices.
Fixed and floating rate borrowings The fair value of fixed and floating rate borrowings is estimated by discounting the future contracted principal and interest cashflows using the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the carrying amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
Allother receivables payables are discounted to determine their fair value.
Advances received are excluded from other payablesabove as these are not considered to be financial liabilities.
Contingent consideration The fair value of contingent consideration is estimated based on the forecast future performance of the business, which isdependent on the acquired business performance over a specific future timeframe.
Fair value hierarchy The table above gives details of the valuation method used in arriving at the fair value of financial instruments.
The different levels have been identified as follows: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly ie.
derived from prices : Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data: and There have been no transfers between levels during the year.

The outputs from the sensitivity analysis are estimates of the impact of market risk assuming that the specified changes occur net of any hedging in place at the year end.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimates due to commercial actions taken to mitigate any potential losses from such rate movements, to the interaction of more than one sensitivity occurring and to further developments in global financial markets.

20 Borrowings The Groups principal source of long term funding is its unsecuredfour year 50m revolving credit facility, which expires in December 2014.
The Group also benefits from an unsecured term loan facility from the European Investment Bank which is currently undrawn and which expires if not drawn before December 2013.
The drawing, at the Groups option, can be on either afixed or a floating rate basis with a maximum term of seven years.
The Groups undrawn committed facilities available at 31March 2013 were 75m 2012: 50m of which nil 2012: nil mature within one year, 50m 2012: 50m between two and fiveyears and 25m after more than five years.
Short term operational funding is provided by cash generated from operations and by local bank overdrafts.
These overdraft facilities are uncommitted and are generally renewed on an annual or ongoing basis and hence the facilities expire within one year or less.
