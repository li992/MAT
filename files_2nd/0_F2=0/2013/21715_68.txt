BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2013 2 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY In the application of the Company accounting policies, which are described in Note 1, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements in applying the Companys accounting policies The following are the critical judgements and estimates that the Directors have made in the process of applying the Companys accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements.
Valuation of non-current investments The Directors consider that the confirmed NAV of AllBlue and AllBlue Leveraged, as produced by the administrator of AllBlue and AllBlue Leveraged, represents the fair value of the investments of the Company.
Fair value can be confirmed through redemptions, which can occur on a quarterly basis.
These can only be suspended at the discretion of the Board of AllBlue or AllBlue Leveraged as appropriate.
To further satisfy the fair value of the investments, the Directors attend site visits and scrutinise independent reports prepared by reputable Audit firms relating to the existence of assets and their valuation as well as checks and procedures in place within the underlying funds and administrator of AllBlue.
Different assumptions regarding the valuation techniques of AllBlue and AllBlue Leveraged could lead to different valuations of the investments produced by different parties.
