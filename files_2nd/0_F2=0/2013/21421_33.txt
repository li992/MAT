Notes to the financial statements 1 Statement of accounting policies Beazley plc is a company incorporated in Jersey and domiciled in Ireland.
The group financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 comprise the parent company and its subsidiaries and the groups interest in associates.
Both the financial statements of the parent company, Beazley plc, and the group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs.
On publishing the parent company financial statements together with the group financial statements, the company is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these group financial statements.
All new standards and interpretations released by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB have been considered and of these the following new and amended standards have been adopted by the group during the period: IFRS 7: Amendment: Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities: IFRS 13: Fair value measurement: IAS 1: Amendment: Presentation of other items of comprehensive income: and IAS 19: Amendment: Defined benefit plans.
IFRS 7 was amended to provide expanded disclosures relating to offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities.
In particular, the disclosures focus on quantitative information about recognised financial instruments that are offset in the statement of financial position, as well as those recognised financial instruments that are subject to master netting or similar arrangements.
IFRS 13 establishes a single framework for measuring fair value and making disclosures about fair value measurements, when such measurements are required or permitted by other IFRSs.
In particular, it unifies the definition of fair value as the price at which an orderly transaction to sell an asset or to transfer a liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date.
It also replaces and expands the disclosure requirements about fair value measurements in other IFRSs.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 13, the group has applied the new fair value measurement guidance prospectively.
Notwithstanding the above, the change had no significant impact on the measurements of the groups assets and liabilities.
However, additional disclosures have been made in these financial statements.
As a result of the amendments to IAS 1, the group has modified the presentation of items of other comprehensive income in its consolidated statement of comprehensive income, to present separately items that would be reclassified to profit and loss in the future from those that would never be and have renamed the income statement to the statement of profit or loss.
Comparative information has also been re-presented accordingly.
The adoption of the amendment to IAS 1 has no impact on the recognised assets, liabilities and comprehensive income of the group.
IAS 19 was amended effective 1 January 2013, the applicable impact being that actuarial gains and losses that have previously not been recognised in accordance with the corridor method permitted in the old standard must be reflected in financial statements for both the current and prior reporting periods.
The impact of this change is a restatement of the pension asset, in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme, in the statement of financial position with a corresponding restatement in the statement of comprehensive income and statement of changes in equity to the value of $7.2m as at 31 December 2012 $5.4m as at 1 January 2012.
The restatement results in the pension asset being disclosed as a pension liability in the statement of financial position from 1 January 2012.
The impact of the amendment to IAS 19 is the only change to the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2011 and the impact is highlighted above.
Accordingly, no statement of financial position as at 31 December 2011 have been prepared and presented.
Under the amended IAS 19, the group also determines the net interest expense income for the period on the net defined benefit liability asset by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit liability asset at the beginning of the annual period, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability asset during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments.
Consequently, the net interest on the defined liability asset now comprises: interest cost on the defined benefit obligation: interest income on plan assets: and interest on the effect of the asset ceiling.
Previously, the group determined interest income on plan assets based on their long-term rate of expected return.
The impact of this change is not large enough to change the numbers reported in the statement of profit or loss for the year ended 31 December 2012 and therefore no restatement have been disclosed.
com Annual report 2013 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 1 Statement of accounting policies continued The following is a list of standards that are in issue but are not effective in 2013, but have been endorsed for use in the EU, together with the effective date of application to the group: IFRS 10: Consolidated financial statements effective 1 January 2014 : IFRS 11: Joint arrangements effective 1 January 2014 : IFRS 12: Disclosure of interests in other entities effective 1 January 2014 : IAS 19: Amendment: Defined benefit plans: Employee Contributions effective 1 July 2014 IAS 27: Amendment: Separate financial statements effective 1 January 2014 : IAS 28: Amendment: Investments in associates and joint ventures effective 1 January 2014 : IAS 32: Amendment: Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities effective 1 January 2014 : IAS 36: Amendment: Recoverable amount disclosures for non-financial assets effective 1 January 2014 : IAS 39: Amendment: Novation of derivatives and continuation of hedge accounting.
effective 1 January 2014 : and IFRIC 21: Levies.
In addition, improvements to IFRSs effective 1 January 2014 are in issue but are not effective in 2013, and have not yet been endorsed for use in the EU.
The implications of these standards and interpretations are under review.
Basis of presentation The group financial statements are prepared using the historical cost convention except that financial investments and derivative financial instruments are stated at their fair value.
All amounts presented are stated in US dollars and millions, unless stated otherwise.
The financial statements of Beazley plc have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The directors of the company have a reasonable expectation that the group and the company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are described in this statement of accounting policies and specifically in the following notes: note 12: Intangible assets assumptions underlying recoverable amounts : note 16: Financial assets and liabilities valuations based on models and unobservable inputs : note 23: Equity compensation plans assumptions used to calculate fair value of share options granted : note 24: Insurance liabilities and reinsurance assets estimates for losses incurred but not reported : and note 27: Retirement benefit obligations actuarial assumptions.
The most critical estimate included within the groups financial position is the estimate for insurance losses incurred but not reported.
The total estimate net of reinsurers share as at 31 December 2013 is $1,872.8m 2012: $1,833.9m and is included within total insurance liabilities in the statement of financial position.
Consolidation a Subsidiary undertakings Subsidiary undertakings, which are those entities over which the group, directly or indirectly, has the power to exercise control over financial and operating policies so as to obtain benefits from their activities, have been consolidated.
They are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control ends.
com Beazley 111 Annual report 2013 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Statement of accounting policies continued The group has used the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations arising on the purchase of subsidiaries.
Under this method, the cost of acquisition is measured as the fair value of assets given, shares issued or liabilities undertaken at the date of acquisition directly attributable to the acquisition.
The excess of the cost of an acquisition over the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary acquired is recorded as goodwill.
The accounting treatment of acquisition expenses per IFRS 3 2008 has changed: however as the group applies the revised standard prospectively to all business combinations from 1 January 2010 there is no impact on accounting for the acquisition of subsidiaries made in previous periods.
For all business combinations from 1 January 2010: i Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the group incurs in connection with a business combination, are expensed as incurred.
ii In addition, any consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships.
Such amounts are recognised in profit or loss.
iii Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date.
Equity financial investments made by the parent company in subsidiary undertakings and associates are stated at cost in its separate financial statements and are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired.
Certain group subsidiaries underwrite as corporate members of Lloyds on syndicates managed by Beazley Furlonge Limited.
In view of the several liability of underwriting members at Lloyds for the transactions of syndicates in which they participate, only attributable shares of transactions, assets and liabilities of those syndicates are included in the group financial statements.
b Associates Associates are those entities in which the group has power to exert significant influence but which it does not control.
Significant influence is generally presumed if the group has between 20% and 50% of voting rights.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Under this method the investments are initially measured at cost and the groups share of post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
Therefore the cumulative post-acquisition movements in the associates net assets are adjusted against the cost of the investment.
When the groups share of losses equals or exceeds the carrying amount of the associate, the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition for the losses is discontinued except to the extent that the group has incurred obligations in respect of the associate.
Equity accounting is discontinued when the group no longer has significant influence over the investment.
c Intercompany balances and transactions All intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains or losses on transactions between group companies are eliminated in the group financial statements.
Transactions and balances between the group and associates are not eliminated.
Foreign currency translation a Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of the parent and the subsidiaries are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the relevant entity operates the functional currency.
The group financial statements are presented in US dollars, being the functional and presentation currency of the parent and its main trading subsidiaries.
b Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using average exchange rates applicable to the period in which the transactions take place and where the group considers these to be a reasonable approximation of the transaction rate.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from translation at the period end of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
Non-monetary items recorded at historical cost in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate on the date of the initial transaction.
com Annual report 2013 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 1 Statement of accounting policies continued c Group companies The results and financial position of the group companies that have a functional currency different from the group presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate ruling at the statement of financial position date: income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss are translated at average exchange rates for the reporting period where this is determined to be a reasonable approximation of the actual transaction rates: and all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income as a separate component of equity.
On disposal of foreign operations cumulative exchange differences previously recognised in other comprehensive income are recognised in the statement of profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Insurance contracts Insurance contracts including inwards reinsurance contracts are defined as those containing significant insurance risk.
Insurance risk is considered significant if, and only if, an insured event could cause Beazley to pay significant additional benefits in any scenario, excluding scenarios that lack commercial substance.
Such contracts remain insurance contracts until all rights and obligations are extinguished or expire.
Net earned premiums a Premiums Gross premiums written represent premiums on business commencing in the financial year together with adjustments to premiums written in previous accounting periods and estimates for premiums from contracts entered into during the course of the year.
Gross premiums written are stated before deduction of brokerage, taxes, duties levied on premiums and other deductions.
b Unearned premiums A provision for unearned premiums gross of reinsurance represents that part of the gross premiums written that is estimated will be earned in the following financial periods.
It is calculated using the daily pro-rata method where the premium is apportioned over the period of risk.
Deferred acquisition costs DAC Acquisition costs comprise brokerage, premium levy and staff-related costs of the underwriters acquiring new business and renewing existing contracts.
The proportion of acquisition costs in respect of unearned premiums is deferred at the reporting date and recognised in later periods when the related premiums are earned.
Claims These include the cost of claims and claims handling expenses paid during the period, together with the movements in provisions for outstanding claims, claims incurred but not reported IBNR and claims handling provisions.
The provision for claims comprises amounts set aside for claims advised and IBNR, including claims handling expenses.
The IBNR amount is based on estimates calculated using widely accepted actuarial techniques which are reviewed quarterly by the group actuary and annually by Beazleys independent syndicate reporting actuary.
The techniques generally use projections, based on past experience of the development of claims over time, to form a view on the likely ultimate claims to be experienced.
For more recent underwriting years, regard is given to the variations in the business portfolio accepted and the underlying terms and conditions.
Thus, the critical assumptions used when estimating provisions are that past experience is a reasonable predictor of likely future claims development and that the rating and business portfolio assumptions are a fair reflection of the likely level of ultimate claims to be incurred for the more recent years.
Liability adequacy testing At each reporting date, liability adequacy tests are performed to ensure the adequacy of the claims liabilities net of DAC and unearned premium reserves.
In performing these tests, current best estimates of future contractual cash flows, claims handling and administration expenses as well as investment income from the assets backing such liabilities are used.
Any deficiency is immediately charged to the statement of profit or loss initially by writing off DAC and subsequently by establishing a provision for losses arising from liability adequacy tests unexpired risk provision.
Ceded reinsurance These are contracts entered into by the group with reinsurers under which the group is compensated for losses on contracts issued by the group and that meet the definition of an insurance contract.
Insurance contracts entered into by the group under which the contract holder is another insurer inwards reinsurance are included with insurance contracts.
com Beazley 113 Annual report 2013 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Statement of accounting policies continued Any benefits to which the group is entitled under its reinsurance contracts held are recognised as reinsurance assets.
These assets consist of balances due from reinsurers and include reinsurers share of provisions for claims.
These balances are based on calculated amounts of outstanding claims and projections for IBNR, net of estimated irrecoverable amounts, having regard to the reinsurance programme in place for the class of business, the claims experience for the period and the current security rating of the reinsurer involved.
Reinsurance liabilities are primarily premiums payable for reinsurance contracts and are recognised as an expense when due.
The group assesses its reinsurance assets for impairment.
If there is objective evidence of impairment, then the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount and the impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
Revenue Revenue consists of net earned premium, net investment income, profit commissions earned and managing agents fees.
Managing agents fees are recognised as the services are provided.
Profit commissions are recognised as profit is earned.
Dividends paid Dividend distribution to the shareholders of the group is recognised in the period in which the dividends are paid, as a first interim dividend, second interim dividend or special dividend, and approved by the groups shareholders at the groups annual general meeting.
Plant and equipment All plant and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of the assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives as follows: Fixtures and fittings Three to ten years Computer equipment Three years.
These assets residual value and useful lives are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.
The carrying values of plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
If any such condition exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment and the difference is charged to the statement of profit or loss.
Intangible assets a Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the groups share of the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill has an indefinite life and is annually tested for impairment.
Goodwill is allocated to each cash-generating unit being the groups operating segments for the purpose of impairment testing.
Goodwill is impaired when the net carrying amount of the relevant cash-generating unit CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, being the higher of its value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
Value in use is defined as the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the CGU.
On transition to IFRS at 1 January 2004, any goodwill previously amortised or written off was not reinstated.
In respect of equity accounted associates, the carrying amount of any goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the associate, and any impairment is allocated to the carrying amount of the associate as a whole.
b Syndicate capacity The syndicate capacity represents the cost of purchasing the groups participation in the combined syndicates.
The capacity is capitalised at cost in the statement of financial position.
It has an indefinite useful life and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment.
It is annually tested for impairment by reference to the expected future profit streams to be earned by those syndicates in which the group participates, namely 2623, 3622 and 3623, and provision is made for any impairment.
c Licences Licences have an indefinite useful life and are initially recorded at fair value.
Licences are annually tested for impairment and provision is made for any impairment when the recoverable amount, being the higher of its value in use and fair value, is less than the carrying value.
com Annual report 2013 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 1 Statement of accounting policies continued d IT development costs Costs that are directly associated with the development of identifiable and unique software products and that are anticipated to generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets.
Costs include external consultants fees, certain qualifying internal staff costs and other costs incurred to develop software programs.
These costs are amortised over their estimated useful life three years on a straight-line basis subject to impairment.
Other non-qualifying costs are expensed as incurred.
e Renewal rights Renewal rights comprise future profits relating to insurance contracts acquired and the expected renewal of those contracts.
The costs directly attributable to acquire the renewal rights are recognised as intangible assets where they can be measured reliably and it is probable that they will be recovered by directly related future profits.
These costs are subject to impairment and are amortised on a straight-line basis, based on the estimated useful life of the assets, which is estimated to be between five and ten years.
Financial instruments Financial instruments are recognised in the statement of financial position at such time as the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument.
Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date, which is the date the group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets expire, or where the financial assets have been transferred, together with substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
Financial liabilities are derecognised if the groups obligations specified in the contract expire, are discharged or cancelled.
a Financial assets On acquisition of a financial asset, the group is required to classify the asset into one of the following categories: financial assets at fair value through the statement of profit or loss, loans and receivables, assets held to maturity and assets available for sale.
The group does not make use of the held to maturity and available for sale classifications.
b Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Except for derivative financial instruments and other financial assets listed below, all financial assets are designated as fair value through the statement of profit or loss upon initial recognition because they are managed and their performance is evaluated on a fair value basis.
Information about these financial assets is provided internally on a fair value basis to the groups key management.
The groups investment strategy is to invest and evaluate their performance with reference to their fair values.
c Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost less any impairment losses.
d Fair value measurement Fair value is the price at which an orderly transaction to sell an asset or to transfer a liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date.
When available, the group measures the fair value of an instrument using quoted prices in an active market for that instrument.
A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available and represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
If a market for a financial instrument is not active, the group establishes fair value using a valuation technique.
Valuation techniques include using recent orderly transactions between market participants if available, reference to the current fair value of other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analyses and option pricing models.
The chosen valuation technique makes maximum use of market inputs, relies as little as possible on estimates specific to the group, incorporates all factors that market participants would consider in setting a price, and is consistent with accepted economic methodologies for pricing financial instruments.
Inputs to valuation techniques reasonably represent market expectations and measures of the risk-return factors inherent in the financial instrument.
The group calibrates valuation techniques and tests them for validity using prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on other available observable market data.
com Beazley 115 Annual report 2013 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 S tatement of accounting policies continued The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price, ie the fair value of the consideration given or received, unless the fair value of that instrument is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument ie without modification or repackaging or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets.
When transaction price provides the best evidence of fair value at initial recognition, the financial instrument is initially measured at the transaction price and any difference between this price and the value initially obtained from a valuation model is subsequently recognised in profit or loss depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the transaction but not later than when the valuation is supported wholly by observable market data or the transaction is closed out.
Assets and long positions are measured at a bid price: liabilities and short positions are measured at an asking price.
Where the group has positions with offsetting risks, mid-market prices are used to measure the offsetting risk positions and a bid or asking price adjustment is applied only to the net open position as appropriate.
Fair values reflect the credit risk of the instrument and include adjustments to take account of the credit risk of the group entity and counterparty where appropriate.
Fair value estimates obtained from models are adjusted for any other factors, such as liquidity risk or model uncertainties, to the extent that the group believes a third-party market participant would take them into account in pricing a transaction.
Upon initial recognition, attributable transaction costs relating to financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in the statement of profit or loss when incurred.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are continually measured at fair value, and changes therein are recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
Net changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss exclude interest and dividend income, as these items are accounted for separately as set out below.
e Hedge funds and regulated equity linked funds The group invests in a number of hedge funds and regulated equity linked funds for which there are no available quoted market prices.
The valuation of these hedge funds is based on fair value techniques as described above.
The fair value of our hedge fund portfolio is calculated by reference to the underlying net asset values NAVs of each of the individual funds.
Consideration is also given to adjusting such NAV valuations for any restriction applied to distributions, the existence of side pocket provisions, and the timing of the latest available valuations.
f Insurance receivables and payables Insurance receivables and payables are recognised when due.
These include amounts due to and from agents, brokers and insurance contract holders.
Insurance receivables are classified as loans and receivables as they are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market.
Insurance receivables are measured at amortised cost less any impairment losses.
Insurance payables are stated at amortised cost.
g Other receivables Other receivables are carried at amortised cost less any impairment losses.
h Investment income Investment income consists of dividends, interest, realised and unrealised gains and losses and foreign exchange gains and losses on financial assets at fair value through the statement of profit or loss.
Dividends on equity securities are recorded as revenue on the ex-dividend date.
Interest is recognised separately on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest rate method for financial assets at fair value through the statement of profit or loss.
The realised gains or losses on disposal of an investment are the difference between the proceeds and the original cost of the investment.
Unrealised investment gains and losses represent the difference between the carrying value at the reporting date, and the carrying value at the previous period end or purchase value during the period.
com Annual report 2013 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 1 S tatement of accounting policies continued i Borrowings Borrowings are initially recorded at fair value less transaction costs incurred.
Subsequently borrowings are stated at amortised cost and interest is recognised in the statement of profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Finance costs comprise interest, fees paid for the arrangement of debt and letter of credit facilities and commissions charged for the utilisation of letters of credit.
These costs are recognised in the statement of profit or loss using the effective interest method.
In addition, finance costs include gains on the early redemption of the groups borrowings.
These gains are recognised in the statement of profit or loss, being the difference between proceeds paid plus related costs and the carrying value of the borrowings redeemed.
j Other payables Other payables are stated at amortised cost determined on the effective interest rate method.
k Hedge accounting and derivative financial instruments Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The best evidence of fair value of a derivative at initial recognition is the transaction price.
The method of recognising the resulting fair value gains or losses depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
Fair values are obtained from quoted market prices in active markets, recent market transactions, and valuation techniques which include discounted cash flow models.
All derivatives are carried as assets when fair value is positive and as liabilities when fair value is negative.
The group has not designated any derivatives as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
l Impairment of financial assets The group considers evidence of impairment for financial assets measured at amortised cost at both a specific asset and collective level.
The group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a specific financial asset measured at amortised cost is impaired.
A financial asset is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that have occurred after the initial recognition of the assets and that event has an impact on the estimated cash flows of the financial asset that can be reliably estimated.
Assets that are not individually significant are collectively assessed for impairment by grouping together assets with similar risk characteristics.
If there is objective evidence that impairment exists, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate.
The amount of the loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
In assessing collective impairment, the group uses historical trends of the probability of default, the timing of recoveries and the amount of loss incurred, adjusted for managements judgement as to whether current economic and credit conditions are such that the actual losses are likely to be greater or lesser than those suggested by historical trends.
m Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank and in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition.
Cash and cash equivalents are classified as loans and receivables and carried at amortised cost less any impairment losses.
com Beazley 117 Annual report 2013 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Statement of accounting policies continued Operating leases Leases where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made for operating leases are charged to the statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Employee benefits a Pension obligations The group operates a defined benefit pension plan that is now closed to future service accruals.
The scheme is generally funded by payments from the group taking account of the recommendations of an independent qualified actuary.
All employees now participate in a defined contribution pension funded by the group.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors like age, years of service and compensation.
The pension costs are assessed using the projected unit credit method.
Under this method the costs of providing pensions are charged to the statement of profit or loss so as to spread the regular costs over the service lives of employees in accordance with the advice of the qualified actuary, who values the plans annually.
The net pension obligation is measured at the present value of the estimated future net cash flows and is stated net of plan assets.
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets excluding interest and the effect of the asset ceiling if any, excluding interest, are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income.
The group also determines the net interest expense income for the period on the net defined benefit liability asset by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit liability asset at the beginning of the annual period, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability asset during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments.
Net interest expense income is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
For the defined contribution plan, the group pays contributions to a privately administered pension plan.
Once the contributions have been paid, the group has no further obligations.
The groups contributions are charged to the statement of profit or loss in the period to which they relate.
b Share-based compensation The group offers option plans over Beazley plcs ordinary shares to certain employees, including the SAYE scheme, details of which are included in the directors remuneration report.
The grant-date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant-date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
When the options are exercised and new shares are issued, the proceeds received, net of any transaction costs, are credited to share capital nominal value and retained earnings.
When the options are exercised and the shares are granted from the employee share trust, the proceeds received, net of any transaction costs, are credited to the employee share trust reserve and retained earnings.
com Annual report 2013 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 1 Statement of accounting policies continued Income taxes Income tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the statement of profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case it is recognised respectively, in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the year end reporting date and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of prior periods.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised in the statement of financial position to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing profit after tax available to shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares such as share options granted to employees.
Share options with performance conditions attaching to them have been excluded from the weighted average number of shares to the extent that these conditions have not been met at the reporting date.
The shares held in the employee share options plan ESOP and treasury shares are excluded from both the calculations, until such time as they vest unconditionally with the employees.
Provisions and contingencies Provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made.
Where the group expects a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
Contingent liabilities are present obligations that are not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to meet the liabilities or because the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.
2 Risk management The group has identified the risks arising from its activities and has established policies and procedures to manage these items in accordance with its risk appetite.
The group categorises its risks into eight areas: insurance, market, credit, liquidity, operational, group, regulatory and legal, and strategic risk.
The sections below outline the groups risk appetite and explain how it defines and manages each category of risk.
The symbol by a heading indicates that the information in that section has not been audited.
com Beazley 119 Annual report 2013 Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Risk management continued 2.1 Insurance risk The groups insurance business assumes the risk of loss from persons or organisations that are directly exposed to an underlying loss.
Insurance risk arises from this risk transfer due to inherent uncertainties about the occurrence, amount and timing of insurance liabilities.
The four key components of insurance risk are underwriting, reinsurance, claims management and reserving.
Each element is considered below.
a Underwriting risk Underwriting risk comprises four elements that apply to all insurance products offered by the group: cycle risk the risk that business is written without full knowledge as to the in adequacy of rates, terms and conditions: event risk the risk that individual risk losses or catastrophes lead to claims that are higher than anticipated in plans and pricing: pricing risk the risk that the level of expected loss is understated in the pricing process: and expense risk the risk that the allowance for expenses and inflation in pricing is inadequate.
We manage and model these four elements in the following three categories: attritional claims, large claims and catastrophe events.
The groups underwriting strategy is to seek a diverse and balanced portfolio of risks in order to limit the variability of outcomes.
This is achieved by accepting a spread of business over time, segmented between different products, geography and size.
The annual business plans for each underwriting team reflect the groups underwriting strategy, and set out the classes of business, the territories and the industry sectors in which business is to be written.
These plans are approved by the board and monitored by the monthly underwriting committee.
Our underwriters calculate premiums for risks written based on a range of criteria tailored specifically to each individual risk.
These factors include but are not limited to the financial exposure, loss history, risk characteristics, limits, deductibles, terms and conditions and acquisition expenses.
The group also recognises that insurance events are, by their nature, random, and the actual number and size of events during any one year may vary from those estimated using established statistical techniques.
To address this, the group sets out the exposure that it is prepared to accept in certain territories to a range of events such as natural catastrophes and specific scenarios which may result in large industry losses.
This is monitored through regular calculation of realistic disaster scenarios RDS.
The aggregate position is monitored at the time of underwriting a risk, and reports are regularly produced to highlight the key aggregations to which the group is exposed.
The group uses a number of modelling tools to monitor its exposures against the agreed risk appetite set and to simulate catastrophe losses in order to measure the effectiveness of its reinsurance programmes.
Stress and scenario tests are also run using these models.
The range of scenarios considered includes natural catastrophe, marine, liability, political, terrorism and war events.
com Annual report 2013 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 2 Risk management continued One of the largest types of event exposure relates to natural catastrophe events such as windstorm or earthquake.
Where possible the group measures geographic accumulations and uses its knowledge of the business, historical loss behaviour and commercial catastrophe modelling software to assess the expected range of losses at different return periods.
Upon application of the reinsurance coverage purchased, the key gross and net exposures are calculated on the basis of extreme events at a range of return periods.
The groups high-level catastrophe risk appetite is set by the board and the business plans of each team are determined within these parameters.
The board may adjust these limits over time as conditions change.
In 2013 the group operated to a catastrophe risk appetite for a probabilistic 1-in-250 year US event of $574m net of reinsurance.
The catastrophe risk appetite increased by 6% in 2013 from $541m in 2012, in line with the groups five year strategic plan.
Lloyds has also defined its own specific set of realistic disaster scenario RDS events for which all syndicates with relevant exposures must report.
Of these the three largest, net of reinsurance, events which impact Beazley in 2012 and 2013 are: Unaudited 2013 Modelled Modelled PML before PML after reinsurance reinsurance Lloyds prescribed natural catastrophe event $m $m San Francisco quake 2013: $78bn 633.5 263.2 Gulf of Mexico windstorm 2013: $112bn 515.5 274.9 US Northeast windstorm 2013: $78bn 478.1 291.1 Unaudited 2012 Modelled Modelled PML before PML after reinsurance reinsurance Lloyds prescribed natural catastrophe event $m $m Los Angeles quake 2012: $78bn 721.2 273.2 Gulf of Mexico windstorm 2012: $112bn 475.2 276.3 US Northeast windstorm 2012: $78bn 418.4 283.3 The net of reinsurance exposures to the above Lloyds RDS events have remained stable during 2013 across the account as a whole.
In our reinsurance division, additional business written has led to an increase in gross and net exposures.
In the property division, the exposures net of reinsurance have reduced as the catastrophe reinsurance programme purchased in 2013 was one single tower, instead of two towers in 2012, which has reduced the overall net retention.
The largest movement in our top RDS events is the Los Angeles quake event which has reduced from $273.2m in 2012 to $246.7m in 2013 as a result of a reduction in exposure in our property division.
The net exposure of the group to each of these modelled events at a given point in time is a function of assumptions made about how, where and the magnitude of the event that occurs, the amount of business written that is exposed to each event and the reinsurance arrangements in place.
com Beazley 121 Annual report 2013 Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Risk management continued To manage underwriting exposures, the group has developed limits of authority and business plans which are binding upon all staff authorised to underwrite and are specific to underwriters, classes of business and industry.
In 2013, the normal maximum line that any one underwriter could commit the managed syndicates to was $100m.
In most cases, maximum lines for classes of business were much lower than this.
These authority limits are enforced through a comprehensive sign-off process for underwriting transactions including dual sign-off for all line underwriters and peer review for all risks exceeding individual underwriters authority limits.
Exception reports are also run regularly to monitor compliance.
All underwriters also have a right to refuse renewal or change the terms and conditions of insurance contracts upon renewal.
Rate monitoring details, including limits, deductibles, exposures, terms and conditions and risk characteristics are also captured and the results are combined to monitor the rating environment for each class of business.
Binding authority contracts A proportion of the groups insurance risks are transacted by third parties under delegated underwriting authorities.
Each third party is thoroughly vetted by our coverholder approval group before it can bind risks, and is subject to rigorous monitoring to maintain underwriting quality and confirm ongoing compliance with contractual guidelines.
Operating divisions In 2013, the groups business consisted of six operating divisions.
The following table provides a breakdown of gross written premiums by division, and also provides a geographical split based on placement of risk.
UK US 2013 Lloyds non-Lloyds Total Life, accident & health 5% 5% Marine 16% 16% Political risks & contingency 7% 7% Property 19% 19% Reinsurance 11% 11% Specialty lines 34% 8% 42% Total 92% 8% 100% UK US 2012 Lloyds non-Lloyds Total Life, accident & health 5% 5% Marine 16% 16% Political risks & contingency 6% 6% Property 20% 20% Reinsurance 10% 10% Specialty lines 35% 8% 43% Total 92% 8% 100% 122 Beazley www.
com Annual report 2013 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 2 Risk management continued b Reinsurance risk Reinsurance risk to the group arises where reinsurance contracts put in place to reduce gross insurance risk do not perform as anticipated, result in coverage disputes or prove inadequate in terms of the vertical or horizontal limits purchased.
Failure of a reinsurer to pay a valid claim is considered a credit risk which is detailed separately below.
The groups reinsurance programmes complement the underwriting team business plans and seek to protect group capital from an adverse volume or volatility of claims on both a per risk and per event basis.
In some cases the group deems it more economic to hold capital than purchase reinsurance.
These decisions are regularly reviewed as an integral part of the business planning and performance monitoring process.
The reinsurance security committee RSC examines and approves all reinsurers to ensure that they possess suitable security.
The groups ceded reinsurance team ensures that these guidelines are followed, undertakes the administration of reinsurance contracts and monitors and instigates our responses to any erosion of the reinsurance programmes.
c Claims management risk Claims management risk may arise within the group in the event of inaccurate or incomplete case reserves and claims settlements, poor service quality or excessive claims handling costs.
These risks may damage the group brand and undermine its ability to win and retain business, or incur punitive damages.
These risks can occur at any stage of the claims life cycle.
The groups claims teams are focused on delivering quality, reliability and speed of service to both internal and external clients.
Their aim is to adjust and process claims in a fair, efficient and timely manner, in accordance with the policys terms and conditions, the regulatory environment, and the business broader interests.
Prompt and accurate case reserves are set for all known claims liabilities, including provisions for expenses.
d Reserving and ultimate reserves risk Reserving and ultimate reserves risk occurs within the group where established insurance liabilities are insufficient through inaccurate forecasting, or where there is inadequate allowance for expenses and reinsurance bad debts in provisions.
To manage reserving and ultimate reserves risk, our actuarial team uses a range of recognised techniques to project gross premiums written, monitor claims development patterns and stress-test ultimate insurance liability balances.
An external independent actuary also performs an annual review to produce a statement of actuarial opinion for reporting entities within the group.
The objective of the groups reserving policy is to produce accurate and reliable estimates that are consistent over time and across classes of business.
The estimates of gross premiums written and claims prepared by the actuarial department are used through a formal quarterly peer review process to independently test the integrity of the estimates produced by the underwriting teams for each class of business.
These meetings are attended by senior management, senior underwriters, and actuarial, claims, and finance representatives.
2.2 Market risk Market risk arises where the value of assets and liabilities or future cash flows changes as a result of movements in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and market prices.
a Foreign exchange risk The functional currency of Beazley plc and its main trading entities is the US dollar and the presentation currency in which the group reports its consolidated results is the US dollar.
The effect of this on foreign exchange risk is that the group is mainly exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates for non-dollar denominated transactions and to net asset translation risk on non-dollar functional currency entities.
The group operates in four main currencies: US dollars, sterling, Canadian dollars and euros.
Transactions in all currencies are converted to US dollars on initial recognition with any resulting monetary items being translated to the US dollar spot rate at the reporting date.
Remaining foreign exchange risk is still actively managed as described below.
com Beazley 123 Annual report 2013 Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Risk management continued In 2013, the group managed its foreign exchange risk by periodically assessing its non-dollar exposures and hedging these to a tolerable level while targeting to have net assets that are predominantly denominated in US Dollar.
As part of this hedging strategy, exchange rate derivatives were used to rebalance currency exposure across the group.
Details of all foreign currency derivative contracts entered into with external parties are disclosed in note 17.
On a forward looking basis an assessment is made of expected future exposure development and appropriate currency trades put in place to reduce risk.
The groups underwriting capital is matched by currency to the principal underlying currencies of its written premiums.
This helps to mitigate the risk that the groups capital required to underwrite business is not materially affected by any future movements in exchange rates.
The group also has subsidiaries with functional currencies that are different from the groups presentation currency.
The effect of this on foreign exchange risk is that the group is exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates for US dollar denominated transactions and net assets arising in those foreign currency subsidiaries.
It also gives rise to a currency translation exposure for the group to sterling, Hong Kong dollars, Singapore dollars and Australian dollars on translation to the groups presentational currency, although these exposures are minimal.
The following table summarises the carrying value of total assets and total liabilities categorised by the groups main currencies: UK CAD $ EUR Subtotal US $ Total 31 December 2013 $m $m $m $m $m $m Total assets 886.8 117.3 371.4 1,375.5 5,209.1 6,584.6 Total liabilities 888.8 116.3 345.1 1,350.2 3,895.7 5,245.9 Net assets 2.0 1.0 26.3 25.3 1,313.4 1,338.7 UK CAD $ EUR Subtotal US $ Total 31 December 2012 $m $m $m $m $m $m Total assets 801.9 130.1 376.8 1,308.8 5,140.1 6,448.9 Total liabilities 806.9 133.1 374.5 1,314.5 3,929.9 5,244.4 Net assets 5.0 3.0 2.3 5.7 1,210.2 1,204.5 Sensitivity analysis Fluctuations in the groups trading currencies against the US dollar would result in a change to profit after tax and net asset value.
The table below gives an indication of the impact on profit after tax and net assets of a percentage change in the relative strength of the US dollar against the value of sterling, the Canadian dollar and the euro, simultaneously.
The analysis is based on current information.

com Annual report 2013 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 2 Risk management continued b Interest rate risk Some of the groups financial instruments, including certain financial assets at fair value, cash and cash equivalents and borrowings, are exposed to movements in market interest rates.
The group manages interest rate risk by primarily investing in short-duration financial assets and cash and cash equivalents.
The investment committee monitors the duration of these assets on a regular basis.
The group also entered into interest rate futures contracts to manage the interest rate risk on bond portfolios.
The following table shows the average duration at the reporting date of the financial instruments that are exposed to movements in market interest rates.
Duration is a commonly used measure of volatility and we believe gives a better indication than maturity of the likely sensitivity of our portfolio to changes in interest rates.
If the debt is settled when due in October 2026 the duration of the debt falls within the 10 yrs category.
If the debt is called in October 2016, the duration of the debt falls within the 2-3 yrs 2012: 3-4 yrs category.
Also included in borrowings is $18m of a subordinated debt facility raised in 2004 which is unsecured.
The subordinated notes are due in 2034 and have been callable at the groups option since 2009.
Sensitivity analysis Changes in interest yields, with all other variables constant, would result in changes in the capital value of debt securities and borrowings as well as subsequent interest receipts and payments.
This would affect reported profits and net assets as indicated in the table below: Impact on profit after income tax for the year Impact on net assets 2013 2012 2013 2012 $m $m $m $m Shift in yield basis points 150 basis point increase 68.3 72.8 68.3 72.8 100 basis point increase 45.4 48.6 45.4 48.6 50 basis point increase 22.9 24.3 22.9 24.3 50 basis point decrease 22.9 24.3 22.9 24.3 100 basis point decrease 45.4 48.6 45.4 48.6 www.
com Beazley 125 Annual report 2013 Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Risk management continued c Price risk Financial assets and derivatives that are recognised in the statement of financial position at their fair value are susceptible to losses due to adverse changes in prices.
This is referred to as price risk.
Financial assets include fixed and floating rate debt securities, hedge funds and regulated equity linked funds depending on the groups appetite for risk.
The fixed income securities are well diversified across high quality, liquid securities.
The price risk associated with these securities is predominantly interest, foreign exchange and credit risk related.
The sensitivity to price risk that relates to the groups hedge fund investments and regulated equity linked funds are presented below.
The groups hedge funds and regulated equity linked funds are limited to a small and manageable part of the total investment portfolio and the investment committee has established comprehensive guidelines, with investment managers setting out maximum investment limits, requirements for diversification across industries and limits to concentrations in any one industry or company.
Listed investments that are quoted in an active market, are recognised in the statement of financial position at quoted bid price.
If the market for the investment is not considered to be active, then the group establishes fair value using valuation techniques refer to note 16.
This includes comparison of orderly transactions between market participants, reference to current fair value of other investments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow models and other valuation techniques that are commonly used by market participants.
Impact on profit after income tax for the year Impact on net assets 2013 2012 2013 2012 $m $m $m $m Change in fair value of hedge fund and regulated equity linked fund portfolios 30% increase in fair value 130.5 107.1 130.5 107.1 20% increase in fair value 87.0 71.4 87.0 71.4 10% increase in fair value 43.5 35.7 43.5 35.7 10% decrease in fair value 43.5 35.7 43.5 35.7 20% decrease in fair value 87.0 71.4 87.0 71.4 30% decrease in fair value 130.5 107.1 130.5 107.1 2.3 Credit risk Credit risk arises where counterparties fail to meet their financial obligations in full as they fall due.
The primary sources of credit risk for the group are: reinsurers whereby reinsurers may fail to pay valid claims against a reinsurance contract held by the group: brokers and coverholders whereby counterparties fail to pass on premiums or claims collected or paid on behalf of the group: investments whereby issuer default results in the group losing all or part of the value of a financial instrument and derivative financial instrument: and cash and cash equivalents.
The groups core business is to accept significant insurance risk and the appetite for other risks is low.
This protects the groups capital from erosion so that it can meet its insurance liabilities.
The group limits exposure to a single counterparty or a group of counterparties and analyses the geographical locations of exposures when assessing credit risk.
An approval system also exists for all new brokers, and broker performance is carefully monitored.
Regular exception reports highlight trading with non-approved brokers, and the groups credit control function frequently assesses the ageing and collectability of debtor balances.
Any large, aged items are prioritised and where collection is outsourced, incentives are in place to support these priorities.
The investments committee has established comprehensive guidelines for the groups investment managers regarding the type, duration and quality of investments acceptable to the group.
The performance of investment managers is regularly reviewed to confirm adherence to these guidelines.
The group has developed processes to formally examine all reinsurers before entering into new business arrangements.
New reinsurers are approved by the reinsurance security committee RSC, which also reviews arrangements with all existing reinsurers at least annually.
Vulnerable or slow-paying reinsurers are examined more frequently.
com Annual report 2013 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 2 Risk management continued To assist in the understanding of credit risks, A. M. Best, Moodys and Standard & Poors S&P ratings are used.
These ratings have been categorised below as used for Lloyds reporting: A. M.

Financial investments falling within the unrated category comprise hedge funds and regulated equity linked funds for which there is no readily available market data to allow classification within the respective tiers.
Additionally, insurance receivables are classified as unrated, in accordance with Lloyds guidelines.
Insurance receivables and other receivables balances held by the group have not been impaired, based on all evidence available, and no impairment provision has been recognised in respect of these assets.
Insurance receivables in respect of coverholder business are credit controlled by third-party managers.
We monitor third party coverholders performance and their financial processes through the groups coverholder management team.
These assets are individually impaired after considering information such as the occurrence of significant changes in the counterparties financial position, pattern of historical payment information and disputes with counterparties.
com Beazley 127 Annual report 2013 Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Risk management continued An analysis of the overall credit risk exposure indicates that the group has reinsurance assets that are impaired at the reporting date.
The total impairment in respect of the reinsurance assets at 31 December 2013 was as follows: Individual Collective impairment impairment Total $m $m $m Balance at 1 January 2012 6.8 8.9 15.7 Impairment loss recognised 1.3 1.0 2.3 Balance at 31 December 2012 8.1 9.9 18.0 Impairment loss written back recognised 3.6 0.1 3.5 Balance at 31 December 2013 4.5 10.0 14.5 The group has insurance receivables and reinsurance assets that are past due at the reporting date.
An aged analysis of these is presented below: Greater than Up to 30 days 30-60 days 60-90 days 90 days past due past due past due past due Total 31 December 2013 $m $m $m $m $m Insurance receivables 22.7 7.2 2.4 7.0 39.3 Reinsurance assets 4.4 2.1 2.0 4.2 12.7 Greater than Up to 30 days 30-60 days 60-90 days 90 days past due past due past due past due Total 31 December 2012 $m $m $m $m $m Insurance receivables 16.9 3.2 1.6 5.0 26.7 Reinsurance assets 6.0 1.9 1.2 7.3 16.4 The total impairment in respect of reinsurance assets past due by more than 30 days at 31 December 2013 was $5.1m 2012: $5.7m.
The group believes that the unimpaired amounts that are past due more than 30 days are still collectable in full, based on historic payment behaviour and analyses of credit risk.
2.4 Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises where cash may not be available to pay obligations when due at a reasonable cost.
The group is exposed to daily calls on its available cash resources, principally from claims arising from its insurance business.
In the majority of the cases, these claims are settled from the premiums received.
The groups approach is to manage its liquidity position so that it can reasonably survive a significant individual or market loss event details of the groups exposure to realistic disaster scenarios RDS are provided on page 121.
This means that the group maintains sufficient liquid assets, or assets that can be converted into liquid assets at short notice and without any significant capital loss, to meet expected cash flow requirements.
These liquid funds are regularly monitored using cash flow forecasting to ensure that surplus funds are invested to achieve a higher rate of return.
The group also makes use of loan facilities and borrowings, details of which can be found in note 25.
Further information on the groups capital resources is contained on pages 42 to 43.
The sources and uses of funds table on page 42 shows the level of surplus capital that the group currently holds.
This is the surplus over expected working capital and regulatory capital requirements and represents a buffer that could be used to meet unforeseen costs or take advantage of new opportunities.

If the debt is settled when due in October 2026 the maturity date of the debt falls within the 10 yrs category.
If the debt is called in October 2016, the maturity date of the debt falls within the 2-3 yrs 2012: 3-4 yrs category.
2.5 Operational risk Operational risk arises from the risk of losses due to inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, service providers or external events.
There are a number of business activities for which the group uses the services of a third-party company, such as investment management, data entry and credit control.
These service providers are selected against rigorous criteria and formal service level agreements are in place, and regularly monitored and reviewed.
The group also recognises that it is necessary for people, systems and infrastructure to be available to support our operations.
Therefore we have taken significant steps to mitigate the impact of business interruption which could follow a variety of events, including the loss of key individuals and facilities.
We operate a formal disaster recovery plan which, in the event of an incident, allows the group to move critical operations to an alternative location within 24 hours.
com Annual report 2013 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 2 Risk management continued The group actively manages operational risks and minimises them where appropriate.
This is achieved by implementing and communicating guidelines to staff and other third parties.
The group also regularly monitors the performance of its controls and adherence to these guidelines through the risk management reporting process.
Key components of the groups operational control environment include: ICA modelling of operational risk exposure and scenario testing: management review of activities: documentation of policies and procedures: preventative and detective controls within key processes: contingency planning: and other systems controls.
Capital management The group follows a risk-based approach to determine the amount of capital required to support its activities.
Recognised stochastic modelling techniques are used to measure risk exposures, and capital to support business activities is allocated according to risk profile.
Stress and scenario analysis is regularly performed and the results are documented and reconciled to the boards risk appetite where necessary.
The group has several requirements for capital, including: to support underwriting at Lloyds through the syndicates in which it participates, being 2623, 3623 and 3622.
This is based on the groups own individual capital assessment.
This may be provided in the form of either the groups cash and investments or debt facilities: to support underwriting in Beazley Insurance Company, Inc. in the US: and to make acquisitions of insurance companies or MGAs whose strategic goals are aligned with our own.
The capital structure section of the financial review on pages 42 to 43 provides further background to the groups management of capital.
2.6 Group risk Group risk occurs where business units fail to consider the impact of their activities on other parts of the group, as well as the risks arising from these activities.
There are two main components of group risk which are explained below.
a Contagion Contagion risk is the risk arising from actions of one part of the group which adversely affect any other part of the group.
As the two largest components of the group, this is of particular relevance for actions in any of the US operations adversely affecting the UK operations and vice versa.
The group has limited appetite for contagion risk and minimises the impact of this occurring by operating with clear lines of communication across the group to ensure all group entities are well informed and working to common goals.
b Reputation Reputation risk is the risk of negative publicity as a result of the groups contractual arrangements, customers, products, services and other activities.
Key sources of reputation risk include operation of a Lloyds franchise, interaction with capital markets since the groups IPO during 2002, and reliance upon the Beazley brand in the US, Europe, Asia, South America and Australasia.
The groups preference is to minimise reputation risks but where it is not possible or beneficial to avoid them, we seek to minimise their frequency and severity by management through public relations and communication channels.
2.7 Regulatory and legal risk Regulatory and legal risk is the risk arising from not complying with regulatory and legal requirements.
The operations of the group are subject to legal and regulatory requirements within the jurisdictions in which it operates and the groups compliance function is responsible for ensuring that these requirements are adhered to.
com Beazley 131 Annual report 2013 Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Risk management continued 2.8 Strategic risk This is the risk that the groups strategy is inappropriate or that the group is unable to implement its strategy.
Where events supersede the groups strategic plan this is escalated at the earliest opportunity through the groups monitoring tools and governance structure.
Senior management performance Management stretch is the risk that business growth might result in an insufficient or overly complicated management team structure, thereby undermining accountability and control within the group.
As the group expands its worldwide business in the UK, US, Europe, South America and Asia, management stretch may make the identification, analysis and control of group risks more complex.
On a day-to-day basis, the groups management structure encourages organisational flexibility and adaptability, while ensuring that activities are appropriately co-ordinated and controlled.
By focusing on the needs of their customers and demonstrating both progressive and responsive abilities, staff, management and outsourced service providers are expected to excel in service and quality.
Individuals and teams are also expected to transact their activities in an open and transparent way.
These behavioural expectations reaffirm low group risk tolerance by aligning interests to ensure that routine activities, projects and other initiatives are implemented to benefit and protect resources of both local business segments and the group as a whole.
3 Segmental analysis a Reporting segments Segment information is presented in respect of reportable segments.
These are based on the groups management and internal reporting structures and represent the level at which financial information is reported to the Board, being the chief operating decision-maker as defined in IFRS 8.
The operating segments are based upon the different types of insurance risk underwritten by the group, as described below: Life, accident & health This segment underwrites life, health, personal accident, sports and income protection risks.
Marine This segment underwrites a broad spectrum of marine classes including hull, energy, cargo and specie, piracy, aviation, kidnap & ransom and war risks.
Political risks & contingency This segment underwrites terrorism, political violence, expropriation and credit risks as well as contingency and risks associated with contract frustration.
Property The property segment underwrites commercial, high-value homeowners and construction and engineering property insurance on a worldwide basis.
Reinsurance This division specialises in writing property catastrophe, property per risk, casualty clash, aggregate excess of loss and pro-rata business.
Specialty lines This segment underwrites professional liability, management liability and environmental liability, including architects and engineers, healthcare, lawyers, technology, media and business services, directors and officers and employment practices risks.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
The reporting segments do not cross-sell business to each other.
There are no individual policyholders who comprise greater than 10% of the groups total gross premiums written.

com Beazley 139 Annual report 2013 Notes to the financial statements continued 12 Intangible assets continued Impairment tests Goodwill, syndicate capacity and US insurance authorisation licences are deemed to have indefinite life as they are expected to have value in use that does not erode or become obsolete over the course of time.
Consequently, they are not amortised but annually tested for impairment.

Value in use is calculated using projected cash flows based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period taking into account historic growth rates and expected future market conditions.
A pre tax discount rate of 9% 2012: 9% has been used to discount the projected cash flows of each CGU.
The same discount rate has been applied to all operating segments as these segments all undertake underwriting activities supported by the same capital base.
The discount rate of 9% 2012: 9% reflects the groups expected return on equity and cost of borrowing and has been calculated using independent measures of the risk-free rate of return and the groups risk profile relative to the risk-free and market rates of return and, as such, is considered representative of the rate appropriate to the risk specific to the CGU.
The impairment tests have been performed assuming the groups operating segments are the CGUs to which the intangible assets have been allocated.
The tests indicate that there is significant headroom in respect of the value in use of all the groups intangible assets and it is not expected that any realistic change in market conditions would give rise to any further impairment.
Impairment losses During the year under review, there have been indicators that the performance of certain insurance contracts relating to specific renewal rights within our life, accident & health and specialty lines divisions is not in line with expectation.
As a result, the value in use of these renewal rights is estimated to be less than the carrying value and an impairment loss, of $7.5m and $4.0m respectively, was recognised in the statement of profit or loss.

com Beazley 143 Annual report 2013 Notes to the financial statements continued 16 Financial assets and liabilities continued Fair value measurement The table below summarises financial assets carried at fair value using a valuation hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
The fair value hierarchy has the following levels: Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments.
An active market is a market in which transactions for the instrument occur with sufficient frequency and volume on an ongoing basis such that quoted prices reflect prices at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants at the measurement date.
Included within level 1 are bonds and treasury bills of government and government agencies which are measured based on quoted prices.
Level 2 Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, or based on pricing models for which significant inputs can be corroborated by observable market data eg.
Included within level 2 are government bonds and treasury bills which are not actively traded, corporate bonds, asset backed securities and mortgage-backed securities.
Level 3 Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable or for which there is limited market activity against which to measure fair value.
The availability of financial data can vary for different financial assets and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether it is new and not yet established in the marketplace, and other characteristics specific to each transaction.
To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgement.
Accordingly the degree of judgement exercised by management in determining fair value is greatest for instruments classified in level 3.
The group uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date for valuation of these instruments.
If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability could be categorised in different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.
The group has an established control framework and valuation policy with respect to the measurement of fair values.
For the Groups Level 2 debt securities our fund administrator obtains the prices used in the valuation from independent pricing vendors such as Bloomberg, S&P, Reuters, Markit and IDC.
The independent pricing vendors derive an evaluated price from observable market inputs.
The market inputs include trade data, two-sided markets, institutional bids, comparable trades, dealer quotes news media, and other relevant market data.
These inputs are verified in their pricing engines and calibrated with the pricing models to calculate spread to benchmarks, as well as other pricing assumptions such as Weighted Average life WM, Discount Margins DM, Default rates, and recovery and prepayments assumptions for mortgage securities.
While such valuations are sensitive to estimates, it is believed that changing one or more of the assumptions to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would not change the fair value significantly.
The group records the unadjusted price provided and validates the price through various tolerance checks such as comparison with the investment custodians and the investment managers to assess the reasonableness and accuracy of the price to be used to value the security.
In the rare case that the price fails the tolerance test, it is escalated and discussed internally.
We would not override the price on a retrospective basis, but we would work with the administrator and pricing vendor to investigate the difference.
This generally results in the vendor updating their inputs.
We also review the valuation policy on a regular basis to ensure it is fit for purpose.
No adjustments have been made to the prices obtained from the independent administrator.
For our hedge funds and regulated equity linked funds, the pricing and valuation of each fund is undertaken by independent administrators in accordance with each underlying funds valuation policy.
For the regulated equity linked funds, the individual fund prices are published on a daily or weekly basis via Bloomberg and other market data providers such as Reuters.
For the hedge funds, the individual fund prices are communicated by the independent administrators to all investors via the monthly investor statements.
The fair value of the hedge fund and regulated equity linked fund portfolios are calculated by reference to the underlying net asset values of each of the individual funds.
Additional information is obtained from fund managers relating to the underlying assets within individual hedge funds and regulated equity linked funds.
We identified that 70% 2012: 64% of these underlying assets were level 1 and the remainder level 2.
This enables us to categorise hedge funds as level 2.
com Annual report 2013 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 16 Financial assets and liabilities continued Fair value measurement continued Prior to any new hedge fund investment, extensive due diligence is undertaken on each fund to ensure that pricing and valuation is undertaken by the independent administrators and that each funds valuation policy is appropriate for the financial instruments the manager will be employing to execute the investment strategy.

com Beazley 151 Annual report 2013 Notes to the financial statements continued 24 Insurance liabilities and reinsurance assets continued 24.2 Assumptions, changes in assumptions and sensitivity analysis a Process used to decide on assumptions The peer review reserving process Beazley uses a quarterly dual track process to set its reserves: the actuarial team uses several actuarial and statistical methods to estimate the ultimate premium and claims costs, with the most appropriate methods selected depending on the nature of each class of business: and the underwriting teams concurrently review the development of the incurred loss ratio over time, work with our claims managers to set reserve estimates for identified claims and utilise their detailed understanding of both risks underwritten and the nature of the claims to establish an alternative estimate of ultimate claims cost, which is compared to the actuarially established figures.
A formal internal peer review process is then undertaken to determine the reserves held for accounting purposes which, in totality, are not lower than the actuarially established figure.
The group also commissions an annual independent review to ensure that the reserves established are reasonable or within a reasonable range.
The group has a consistent reserving philosophy with initial reserves being set to include risk margins which may be released over time as uncertainty reduces.
Actuarial assumptions Chain-ladder techniques are applied to premiums, paid claims and incurred claims ie paid claims plus case estimates.
The basic technique involves the analysis of historical claims development factors and the selection of estimated development factors based on historical patterns.
The selected development factors are then applied to cumulative claims data for each underwriting year that is not yet fully developed to produce an estimated ultimate claims cost for each underwriting year.
Chain-ladder techniques are most appropriate for classes of business that have a relatively stable development pattern.
Chain-ladder techniques are less suitable in cases in which the insurer does not have a developed claims history for a particular class of business or for underwriting years that are still at immature stages of development where there is a higher level of assumption volatility.
The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method uses a combination of a benchmark market-based estimate and an estimate based on claims experience.
The former is based on a measure of exposure such as premiums: the latter is based on the paid or incurred claims observed to date.
The two estimates are combined using a formula that gives more weight to the experience-based estimate as time passes.
This technique has been used in situations where developed claims experience was not available for the projection eg recent underwriting years or new classes of business.
The expected loss ratio method uses a benchmark market-based estimate applied to the expected premium and is used for classes with little or no relevant historical data.
The choice of selected results for each underwriting year of each class of business depends on an assessment of the technique that has been most appropriate to observed historical developments.
In certain instances, this has meant that different techniques or combinations of techniques have been selected for individual underwriting years or groups of underwriting years within the same class of business.
As such, there are many assumptions used to estimate general insurance liabilities.
We also review triangulations of the paid outstanding claim ratios as a way of monitoring any changes in the strength of the outstanding claim estimates between underwriting years so that adjustments can be made to mitigate any subsequent over under reserving.
To date, this analysis indicates no systematic change to the outstanding claim strength across underwriting years.
Where significant large losses impact an underwriting year eg the events of 11 September 2001, the hurricanes in 2004, 2005, 2008 and 2012, or the earthquakes in 2010 and 2011, the development is usually very different from the attritional losses.
In these situations, the large loss total is extracted from the remainder of the data and analysed separately by the respective claims managers using exposure analysis of the policies in force in the areas affected.
Further assumptions are required to convert gross of reinsurance estimates of ultimate claims cost to a net of reinsurance level and to establish reserves for unallocated claims handling expenses and reinsurance bad debt.
com Annual report 2013 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 24 Insurance liabilities and reinsurance assets continued b Major assumptions The main assumption underlying these techniques is that the groups past claims development experience with appropriate adjustments for known changes can be used to project future claims development and hence ultimate claims costs.
As such these methods extrapolate the development of premiums, paid and incurred losses, average costs per claim and claim numbers for each underwriting year based on the observed development of earlier years.
Throughout, judgement is used to assess the extent to which past trends may not apply in the future: for example, to reflect changes in external or market factors such as economic conditions, public attitudes to claiming, levels of claims inflation, premium rate changes, judicial decisions and legislation, as well as internal factors such as portfolio mix, policy conditions and claims handling procedures.
c Changes in assumptions As already discussed, general insurance business requires many different assumptions.
The diagram below illustrates the main categories of assumptions used for each underwriting year and class combinations.
Life, accident & health Premium rate change Classes Marine Claims inflation Political risks & contingency Mix of business Property Reporting patterns Underwriting years Reinsurance Settlement patterns Specialty lines Judicial decisions Professional judgement 1993 1994... 2012 2013 Given the range of assumptions used, the groups profit or loss is relatively insensitive to changes to a particular assumption used for an underwriting year class combination.
However, the groups profit or loss is potentially more sensitive to a systematic change in assumptions that affect many classes, such as judicial changes or when catastrophes produce more claims than expected.
The group uses a range of risk mitigation strategies to reduce the volatility including the purchase of reinsurance.
In addition, the group holds capital to absorb volatility.
d Sensitivity analysis The estimation of IBNR reserves for future claim notifications is subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than the estimation of the outstanding claims already notified.
This is particularly true for the specialty lines business, which will typically display greater variations between initial estimates and final outcomes as a result of the greater degree of difficulty in estimating these reserves.
The estimation of IBNR reserves for other business written is generally subject to less variability as claims are generally reported and settled relatively quickly.
As such, our reserving assumptions contain a reasonable margin for prudence given the uncertainties inherent in the insurance business underwritten, particularly on the longer tailed specialty lines classes.
Since year end 2004, we have identified a range of possible outcomes for each class and underwriting year combination directly from our individual capital assessment ICA process.
Comparing these with our pricing assumptions and reserving estimates gives our management team increased clarity into our perceived reserving strength and the relative uncertainties of the business written.
To illustrate the robustness of our reserves, the loss development tables below provide information about historical claims development by the six segments life, accident & health, marine, political risks & contingency, property, reinsurance and specialty lines.
The tables are by underwriting year which in our view provides the most transparent reserving basis.
We have supplied tables for both ultimate gross claims and ultimate net claims.
The top part of the table illustrates how the groups estimate of the claims ratio for each underwriting year has changed at successive year ends.
The bottom half of the table reconciles the gross and net claims to the amount appearing in the statement of financial position.
While the information in the table provides a historical perspective on the adequacy of the claims liabilities established in previous years, users of these financial statements are cautioned against extrapolating past redundancies or deficiencies on current claims liabilities.
The group believes that the estimate of total claims liabilities as at 31 December 2013 is adequate.
However, due to inherent uncertainties in the reserving process, it cannot be assured that such balances will ultimately prove to be adequate.
com Beazley 157 Annual report 2013 Notes to the financial statements continued 24 Insurance liabilities and reinsurance assets continued Analysis of movements in loss development tables We have updated our loss development tables to show the ultimate loss ratios as at 31 December 2013 for each underwriting year.
Generally, the claims experience has been in line with or better than expected.
There was notably benign natural catastrophe experience on the 2012 underwriting year, which resulted in the release of unutilised catastrophe reserve margin.
The initial reserves established in respect of the 2010 and 2011 natural catastrophe events have remained appropriate in light of development to date.
Life, accident & health The 2011 and 2012 reserves were strengthened on the income protection segment of the portfolio, emerging claims experience exceeded expectation.
The 2013 underwriting year opening loss ratio reflects this.
The remainder of the portfolio developed as expected.
Marine The sustained period of exceptional performance continued as all years exhibited stable to strongly favourable development.
Political risks & contingency The financial crisis-exposed 2006, 2007 and 2008 underwriting years for our political risks business have continued to develop favourably in 2013.
The subsequent underwriting years showed lower claim frequency, which is now being borne out in reserve releases.
Property 2013 saw stable to strongly positive development across all underwriting years.
Reserve releases on the 2010 and 2011 natural catastrophes, generally favourable attrition and benign natural catastrophe experience on the 2012 underwriting year each played their part.
Reinsurance The benign natural catastrophe experience in 2012 can readily be seen in the development of that underwriting year.
In addition, there was improvement on the 2010 and 2011 underwriting years as the reserves initially established on the natural catastrophes have being proving more than sufficient.
Specialty lines During 2013, the hard market 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 underwriting years continued their exceptional development.
The team maintained its vigilance on the 2007 and post underwriting years.
The nature of claims development and the residual uncertainty in these years coupled with our consistent reserving philosophy has resulted in stable to marginally decreasing loss ratios.
Our 2010 and 2011 underwriting year loss ratios opened slightly higher than in the previous years to reflect the rating and claims environment and to allow consistency to be maintained in our reserving philosophy.
Our 2012 and 2013 underwriting years opening loss ratios were lower than 2011 reflecting the growing benefit of our breach response product to the business mix.
com Annual report 2013 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 24 Insurance liabilities and reinsurance assets continued Claim releases The table below analyses our net claims between current year claims and adjustments to prior year net claims reserves.
These have been broken down by department and period.
Beazleys reserving policy is to maintain catastrophe reserve margins either until the end of the exposure period or until catastrophe events occur.
Therefore margins have been released on those classes affected by superstorm Sandy.
The net of reinsurance estimates of ultimate claims costs on the 2012 and prior underwriting years has improved by $218.0m during 2013 2012: $126.0m.
This movement has arisen from a combination of better than expected claims experience coupled with small changes to the many assumptions reacting to the observed experience and anticipating any changes as a result of the new business written.
The movements shown on 2010 and earlier are absolute claim movements and are not impacted by any current year movements in premium on those underwriting years.
