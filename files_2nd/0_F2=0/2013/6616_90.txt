See Note 1, Presentation of the financial statements for more details.
Comparative information has been restated accordingly.
R&D investment is essential for the sustainability of the pharmaceutical businesses.
However, for segment reporting, the US, Europe, Emerging Markets Asia Pacific and Japan Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines operating profits exclude allocations of globally funded R&D as well as central costs, principally corporate functions and unallocated manufacturing costs.
The Groups management reporting process allocates intra-Group profit on a product sale to the market in which that sale is recorded, and the profit analyses below have been presented on that basis.
Other trading and unallocated pharmaceuticals and vaccines includes Canada, Puerto Rico, Australasia, central vaccine tender sales and contract manufacturing sales, together with costs such as vaccines R&D, central dermatology costs and central manufacturing costs not attributed to other segments.
The Pharmaceuticals R&D segment is the responsibility of the Chairman, Research & Development and is reported as a separate segment.
Corporate and other unallocated costs represent the costs of corporate functions.
