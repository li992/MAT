Where there are no readily available market values to determine fair values, cash flows relating to the various instruments have been discounted at prevailing interest and exchange rates to give an estimate of fair value.
Book Fair Book Fair Value Value Value Value 2013 2013 2012 2012 m m m m Cash deposits 27.2 27.2 53.8 53.8 Other investments 0.8 0.8 0.9 0.9 2010 Club facility due 2015 140.8 140.8 177.8 177.8 $100m fixed rate 10 year bond 60.4 65.5 61.9 71.9 Other bank borrowings 29.5 29.5 21.2 21.2 Other loans 8.5 8.5 - - Obligations under finance leases 0.5 0.5 0.6 0.6 For financial instruments with a remaining life of greater than one year, fair values are based on cash flows discounted at prevailing interest rates.
Accordingly, the fair value of cash deposits and short term borrowings approximates to the book value due to the short maturity of these instruments.
The same applies to trade and other receivables and payables excluded from the above analysis.
Financial instruments Effective 1 January 2013, the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS 13 for financial instruments that are measured in the balance sheet at fair value.
This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following hierarchy: - Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices level 2 - Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.
All of the Groups financial instruments are classified as level 3.

In addition the Group had other undrawn facilities of 54.4m 2012: 67.4m available.
Of the Groups total committed facilities of 465.8m, 60.4m expires in 2020 with the balance expiring in 2015.
Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk.
The Groups overall risk management strategy is approved by the Board and implemented and reviewed by the Risk Management Committee.
Detailed financial risk management is then delegated to the Group Finance department which has a specific policy manual that sets out guidelines to manage financial risk.
Regular reports are received from all operating companies to enable prompt identification of financial risks so that appropriate action may be taken.
In the management and definition of capital the Group includes ordinary and preference share capital and net debt.
Currency risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to currency risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US Dollar and the Euro.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
Entities in the Group use foreign currency bank balances to manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities.
The Groups risk management policy is to manage transactional risk up to three months forward.
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk.
Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Groups foreign operations is not specifically hedged but is reduced primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies where it is efficient to do so.
For 2013, had the Groups basket of reporting currencies been 10% weaker stronger than the actual rates experienced, post-tax profit for the year would have been 11.6m 2012: 11.6m lower higher than reported, primarily as a result of the translation of the profits of the Groups overseas entities, and equity would have been 25.5m 2012: 17.4m lower higher.
Interest rate risk The Group has both interest bearing assets and liabilities.
The Group has a policy of maintaining at least 50% of its gross borrowings at floating interest rates and at 31 December 2013 over 75% of Group borrowings were at floating rates.
During 2010 the Group issued a ten year fixed rate $100m loan note.
The loan note is repayable in 2020 and carries a fixed rate of 5.94%.
As at 31 December 2013, aside from the $100m loan note, all Group debt and cash was exposed to repricing within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
At 31 December 2013, the Groups fixed rate debt was at a weighted average rate of 5.94% 2012: 5.94%.
The Groups floating rate liabilities are predominantly based on LIBOR and its overseas equivalents.
Based on the above, had interest rates moved by 10 basis points in the territories where the Group has substantial borrowings, post tax profits would have moved by 0.1m 2012: 0.2m due to increased interest expense on the Groups floating rate borrowings.
Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term committed facilities designed to ensure the Group has sufficient funds available for operations and planned investments.
The Group also has a share buyback programme which is managed to ensure the efficiency of the Groups funding structure.
On a regular basis, management monitors forecasts of the Groups cash flows against both internal targets and those targets imposed by external lenders.
The Group has substantial committed, unused facilities and the Directors are confident this situation will remain the case for the foreseeable future.
Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
It has policies in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high-credit quality financial institutions.
The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any financial institution.
