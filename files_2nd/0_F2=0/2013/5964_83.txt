Annual impairment tests are conducted on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the recoverable amount of the cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
Value in use calculations are used to determine the recoverable amount of cash generating units.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are the discount rate applied, future growth rate of the revenue and operating margin.
These take into account the existing customer base and expected revenue commitments from it, anticipated additional sales to existing and new customers, planned expansion of the product and service offerings to the marketplace and the specific market trends that are currently seen or expected in the future.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of LatentZero resulted from the value of the assembled workforce, the synergistic nature of the acquisition due to the long-term cross-selling opportunities between the buy-side and sell-side clients, potential cost savings, the expected future growth and the acceleration of operations into the buy-side.
Fidessa prepares a cash flow forecast for the following year which is extended for the following four years based on the estimated growth rate which management consider reflects a reasonable future rate for the cash generating unit after considering recent trading experience, the increasing amount of recurring revenue, assessing the market opportunities and threats and the potential to expand the addressable market.
The cash flow forecast is discounted by the discount rate which has been calculated after assessing the specific risk premium for the cash generating unit, current gilt rates and the businesss beta factor.
The value in use calculation uses the growth rate from the detailed forecast for the first year followed by 10% per annum for the remainder of the initial five years.
This is followed by a reducing growth rate of 5% and a terminal growth rate of 2%.
The expected useful life is materially greater than five years.
This is considered to reflect a cautious long-term average growth rate for the products and services in the addressable market.
A discount rate of 8.3% pre-tax 2012: 8.8% has been applied to the cash flow forecast.
The discount rate includes unchanged general and specific risk premiums, a reduction in the beta factor and a small increase in gilt rates.
The value in use calculation results in a recoverable amount that exceeds the carrying value by 47,000,000.
