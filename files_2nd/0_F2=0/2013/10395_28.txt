Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty Critical judgements in applying the groups accounting policies In the process of applying the groups accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 above, management has made the following judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised for certain project based contracts based on the stage of completion of the contract activity.
This is measured by comparing the proportion of costs incurred against the estimated whole-life contract costs.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Measurement and impairment of intangible assets The measurement of intangible assets other than goodwill on a business combination involves estimation of future cash flows and the selection of suitable discount rates.
Determining whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which the goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation involves an estimation of the future cash flows of CGUs and also the selection of appropriate discount rates to use in order to calculate present values.
The carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets is 535.2m 2012: 413.5m at the balance sheet date: see Notes 13 and 14.
Management do not consider that any reasonably foreseeable change in the key assumptions would result in an impairment.
Measurement of provisions and defined benefit pension obligations The groups provisions per Note 26 comprise deferred contingent consideration and insurance reserves.
The measurement of provisions and defined benefit obligations requires judgement.
In particular, the calculation of defined benefit obligations is dependent on material key assumptions including discount rates, life expectancy rates, future returns on assets and future contribution rates.
The present value of defined benefit obligations at the balance sheet date is 171.8m 2012: 148.5m : see Note 35.
The sensitivity of defined benefit pension obligations to changes in principal actuarial assumptions is shown below: Increase decrease Change in in liability assumption m Discount rate 0.5% 17.2 0.5% 18.8 Retail Price Inflation 0.5% 14.7 0.5% 9.8 Consumer Price Inflation 0.5% 3.3 0.5% 3.3 Salary increases 0.5% 4.1 0.5% 3.3 Life expectancy 1 year 4.9 3.
