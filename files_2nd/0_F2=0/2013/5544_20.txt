Presentation of Financial Statements Statement of compliance These financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU.
Basis of preparation The financial information for the year ended 30 September 2013 has been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out in note 3 and are presented in pounds sterling.
Amounts are shown in millions, unless stated otherwise.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Enterprise Inns plc and its subsidiaries.
Consolidated financial statements are drawn up to 30 September each year and adjustments are made to the financial statements of the subsidiaries where necessary to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used by the Group.
Result of the Parent Company The directors have taken advantage of the exemption provided under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to publish the Parent Company individual Income Statement and related notes.
Going concern The Groups business activities, including a description of its financial position, cash flows, debt and borrowing facilities, are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 02 to 29.
In addition, a summary of factors likely to affect the Groups future developments and performance is set out in the Strategic Report on pages 02 to 29.
Further details on the Groups financial instruments and risks can be found in note 23 of the accounts on pages 90 to 98.
The directors have made enquiries into the adequacy of the Parent Company and Groups financial resources, including a review of the budgets and medium-term financial plans, which includes a review of cash flow forecasts, financial covenant calculations and the ability to meet any refinancing requirements, and have a reasonable expectation that the Parent Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.
Exceptional items The Group has elected to classify certain items as exceptional and present them separately on the face of the Income Statement.
Exceptional items are classified as those which are separately identified by virtue of their size or nature to allow a full understanding of the underlying performance of the Group.
Exceptional items are explained further in notes 3, 6, 9, 10, 12 and 13.
New standards and interpretations During the year the Group and the Parent Company have adopted the following new standards, interpretations and amendments: Amendments to IAS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements Other Comprehensive Income Amendments to IAS 12: Income Taxes Recovery of Underlying Assets The adoption of these standards has not had a material impact on the results or financial position of the Parent Company or Group.

Presentation of Financial Statements continued New standards and interpretations not yet adopted As at 30 September 2013 there are a number of standards, amendments and interpretations in issue some of which have not yet been adopted by the EU with an effective date for financial years beginning on or after the dates disclosed below and which have not been early adopted by the Parent Company or Group.
Amendment to IFRS 7: Financial Instruments: Disclosures Offsetting Financial Assets and 1 January 2013 Financial Liabilities IFRS 9: Financial Instruments 1 January 2015 Amendment to IFRS 10: Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial 1 January 2014 Statements, Joint Arrangements and Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities: Transition Guidance Amendment to IFRS 10: Consolidated Financial Statements Investment Entities 1 January 2014 Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 Amendment to IFRS 12: Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities Investment Entities 1 January 2014 Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 IFRS 13: Fair Value Measurement 1 January 2013 Amendments to IAS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements Annual Improvements 2009- 1 January 2013 2011 Cycle Amendments to IAS 16 : Property, Plant and Equipment Clarification of Servicing Equipment 1 January 2013 IAS 19: Employee Benefits revised 1 January 2013 Amendments to IAS 32: Financial Instruments: Presentation Annual Improvements 1 January 2013 2009-2011 Cycle Amendments to IAS 32: Financial Instruments: Presentation Offsetting Financial Assets 1 January 2014 and Financial Liabilities Amendments to IAS 34: Interim Reporting Annual Improvements 2009-2011 Cycle 1 January 2013 Amendments to IAS 36: Impairment of Assets Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non- 1 January 2013 Financial Assets The adoption of IFRS 13, which will be implemented prospectively in the 30 September 2014 financial statements, addresses fair value measurement including specific rules for determining the fair value of non-financial assets and related disclosures.
In order to assess the effect of the new standard, the concepts concerning highest and best use of an asset were considered during the current year valuation process and had IFRS 13 been implemented during the year, the effect on the valuation would not have been material.
As the Group and Parent Company carry property, plant and equipment at valuation, implementation of the standard will require further consideration during the valuation process in 2014 and an increased level of disclosures will be required in the 30 September 2014 financial statements.
Accounting policies Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of consideration over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment.
On disposal of a pub, an attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of profit or loss on sale.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 October 1998 was written off against reserves and has not been subsequently reversed.
Any such goodwill is not included in determining the profit or loss on disposal.

Accounting policies continued Fixed asset investments Fixed asset investments in the Parent Company Balance Sheet are initially recognised at fair value and then held at this value subject to an annual impairment test.
Property, plant and equipment Licensed land and buildings are held at their fair value and landlords fixtures and fittings and other assets are held at cost.
The Groups licensed land and buildings, except for those non-current assets held for sale, are revalued each year by external valuers or employees who are professionally qualified to carry out such valuations.
Surpluses arising from the revaluation exercise are taken through Other Comprehensive Income to the revaluation reserve except where they reverse a revaluation decrease relating to the same asset previously recognised as an expense in the Income Statement.
Any deficit arising from the revaluation exercise is taken through Other Comprehensive Income to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is a surplus in place relating to the same asset.
Any further decrease in value is recognised in the Income Statement as an expense.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Freehold buildings are depreciated so as to write-off the difference between their carrying value and residual value over their useful economic life of 50 years.
Residual value is reviewed at least at each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value.
Landlords fixtures and fittings are split into two categories, long life landlords fixtures and fittings and short life landlords fixtures and fittings.
Both are held at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The useful economic life of additions to long life landlords fixtures and fittings has been calculated at 30 years and short life landlords fixtures and fittings has been calculated at 5 years.
Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis to write-off the total cost less residual value over their useful economic life.
Properties held under finance leases are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the remaining lease term and their useful economic life of 50 years.
Depreciation is provided on other categories of property, plant and equipment over 3 to 50 years on a straight-line basis to residual value.
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually for indications of impairment.
Where any indications are identified, assets are assessed fully for impairment.
Impairment occurs where the recoverable amount of the asset is less than its carrying amount.
Recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Any impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease to the extent that a surplus exists for the same asset, and thereafter as an expense in the Income Statement.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets held for sale are held at the lower of their carrying value and expected sale proceeds, net of selling costs.
Licensed land and buildings and operating lease intangibles are classified as held for sale when they have been identified for disposal by the Group.
They must be available for immediate sale in their present condition and the sale should be highly probable.
These conditions are met when management are committed to the sale, the pub or lease is actively marketed and the sale is expected to occur within one year.
Licensed land and buildings held for sale are not depreciated and operating lease intangible assets held for sale are not amortised.
Profits or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are calculated as the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset within non-current assets held for sale at the date of disposal.
Leases Leases where the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Pubs acquired under finance leases are capitalised at the lower of their fair value and the present value of future minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability is included in the Balance Sheet as a finance lease payable.
Pubs held under finance leases are revalued along with the freehold estate on an annual basis.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to obtain a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are taken as an expense to the Income Statement.

Accounting policies continued Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis to the Income Statement over the lease term.
The fair value attributed to pubs acquired as part of business combinations that are held as operating leases are classified in the Balance Sheet as intangible assets: operating lease premiums within noncurrent assets and are amortised over the lease term.
The Group enters into sale and leaseback transactions where licensed land and buildings have been sold and the Group has immediately entered into a lease agreement with the acquiree.
These land and buildings have been classified as operating leases.
They are no longer included within property, plant and equipment and the rentals paid are charged on a straight-line basis to the Income Statement over the lease term.
Current assets held for sale Current assets held for sale comprise tenants fixtures and fittings and are held at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred on disposal.
Repairs and maintenance Repairs and maintenance expenditure is charged to the Income Statement as incurred.
Financial instruments a Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash at bank and in hand.
Any short-term deposits with an original maturity date of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents.
b Borrowings Borrowings which include bank borrowings, debentures, secured bonds and securitised bonds are measured at amortised cost.
This method is used to ensure that the interest charge associated with the debt, combined with the amortisation of the issue costs, premiums and discounts, represents a constant percentage of the borrowings across the life of the instrument.
When borrowings are refinanced the Group reviews whether the arrangement constitutes an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability or a modification of the terms of the existing financial liability.
If the refinanced borrowings are accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability any costs or fees incurred are recognised as part of the gain or loss on the extinguishment.
If the refinanced borrowings are accounted for as a modification any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the liability and are amortised over the remaining life of the modified loan.
c Convertible financial instruments The gross proceeds received from the issue of convertible bonds are split between a liability element and an equity component at the date of issue.
The fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bonds and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in equity and is not remeasured.
The liability component is carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method until extinguished upon conversion or at the instruments maturity date.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds based on their relative carrying amounts at the date of issue.
The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity.
The difference between the interest expense calculated under the effective interest rate method and interest paid to bond holders is added to the carrying amount of the convertible bonds.
d Equity instruments Equity instruments, being ordinary shares issued by the Parent Company, are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds received, net of any direct issue costs.
The nominal value of shares issued is recorded in called up share capital and the balance of the net proceeds is recorded in share premium.
72 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report enterpriseinns.
Accounting policies continued e Trade debtors and creditors Trade debtors and creditors are held at amortised cost.
Net debt Net debt is the total book value of all financial assets and liabilities not including trade receivables, trade payables and the equity component of the convertible bond less cash.
Underlying net debt is the nominal value of all financial assets and liabilities not including trade receivables and trade payables net of cash retained in the business.
Taxation The tax expense comprises both the tax payable based on taxable profits for the year and deferred tax.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for accounting and tax purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
No deferred tax is recognised if the taxable temporary difference arises from goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and the intention is to either settle on a net basis or realise the asset and liability simultaneously.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority which are intended to be settled net or simultaneously.
Tax is charged or credited to Other Comprehensive Income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to Other Comprehensive Income.
Similarly tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity.
Otherwise tax is charged in the Income Statement.
Tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
If the effect is material, the amount of the provision is discounted using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The amount of the provision would therefore represent the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation.
Pension obligations The Group has both defined contribution and defined benefit pension arrangements.
The cost of defined contribution payments made to employees own pension plans is charged to the Income Statement as incurred.
The defined benefit scheme is now closed to new members and for the future accrual of benefits.
The net amount recognised in the Balance Sheet comprises the difference between the present value of the schemes liabilities and the fair value of the schemes assets.
This is determined annually by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Current service cost and past service cost are charged to operating profit.
The net of the expected return on scheme assets and interest on scheme liabilities is recognised within finance income or finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in Other Comprehensive Income.
Treasury shares The cost of own shares held in employee benefit trusts and in treasury is deducted from shareholders equity until the shares are cancelled, re-issued or disposed of.
Any proceeds received are also taken to shareholders equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of own shares held.

Accounting policies continued Revenue recognition Revenue is the fair value of consideration received or receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, volume rebates and VAT.
Sales of beverages are recognised when these goods are delivered to our Publicans.
Property rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Amusement machine royalties are recognised in the accounting period to which the income relates.
Segmental reporting An operating segment is a distinguishable segment of an entity that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses and whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the entitys chief operating decision maker CODM.
The Board reviews the Groups operations and financial position as a whole and therefore considers that it has only one operating segment, being the operation of a leased and tenanted pub estate operating solely within the UK.
The information presented to the CODM directly reflects that presented in the financial statements.
Share-based payments The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment schemes for employees.
Share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of the award.
This value is subsequently updated at each Balance Sheet date for managements best estimate of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions on the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any service and performance vesting conditions, other than performance conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Parent Company market conditions.
Any other conditions which are required to be met in order for an employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered to be non-vesting conditions.
Like market performance conditions, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining the grant date fair value.
The fair value is recognised as an expense over the vesting period by calculating the cumulative expense and recognising the movement in the cumulative expense in the Income Statement.
A corresponding entry is made to equity.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance or service conditions are satisfied.
Dividends Final dividends are recognised as a liability when they have been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
Operating profit Operating profit as referred to in the Income Statement is defined as being profit generated from normal trading activities before net profit loss on sale of property, plant and equipment, movements in valuation of the pub estate and related assets, finance costs and taxation.
Exceptional items are classified as those which are separately identified by virtue of their size or nature to allow a full understanding of the underlying performance of the Group and include the following: a Exceptional items recognised in operating profit Exceptional costs relating to regulatory matters and reorganisational costs have been recognised in the administrative costs line.
b Net profit loss on sale of property, plant and equipment Net profit loss arising from the sale of property, plant and equipment less goodwill allocated to disposals.
74 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report enterpriseinns.
Accounting policies continued c Movements in valuation of pub estate and related assets Any revaluation that causes the book value of a pub to fall below historic cost will lead to a charge in the Income Statement.
If that same pub later recovers in value so that its book value exceeds historic cost, the increase in value is credited to the Income Statement to the extent that a debit was previously recognised.
Where pubs identified for disposal are written down to fair value less costs to sell, any associated write-down below historic cost is also recognised in this line.
The remaining impact of the annual revaluation exercise or the identification of pubs for disposal is accounted for in Other Comprehensive Income.
d Finance costs The gain on purchase of own debt is calculated as the difference between the nominal price of the debt purchased less the aggregate of the consideration and related transaction costs paid.
The Group has elected to take the gain on the settlement date.
Exceptional finance costs are also recognised to reflect the write-off of brought forward fees in relation to bank facilities cancelled prior to the commencement of the facility.
e T ax A deferred tax liability has been recognised on the Balance Sheet relating to the pub estate.
On transition to IFRS, the Group elected to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to acquisitions from 1 January 1999.
This led to an increase in goodwill in respect of this deferred tax.
As this pre-acquisition liability changes due to capital gains indexation relief and changes in the rate of UK tax, a debit or a credit is recognised in the Income Statement.
This has been classified as an exceptional tax item due to its size and because it does not relate to any income or expense recognised in the Income Statement in the same period.
All other movements in respect of this deferred tax liability are accounted for in the same performance statement as the gross item to which it relates.
The effect of changes in the enacted rate of tax used to calculate deferred tax is reflected in Other Comprehensive Income to the extent it relates to revaluation surpluses therein and in exceptional profit loss for all other elements of deferred tax.
The tax effect of all other exceptional items is also included within the exceptional items column in the Income Statement.
Use of accounting estimates and judgements The Group makes estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the financial statements.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
The estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are discussed below: a Property, plant and equipment PPE Properties are valued annually at open market value in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS.
The valuation is based on market observations and estimates the amount that would be paid by a willing buyer to a willing seller in an arms length transaction after proper marketing.
Non-current assets held for sale are valued at the lower of their carrying value and their market value less any costs that may be incurred to sell the pub.
Further information about the valuation of the pub estate is provided in note 17 of these financial statements.
The Group estimates the useful economic life and residual value of PPE and these estimates influence the depreciation charged each year.
For details of these estimates, see the detailed accounting policy for PPE.
b Testing goodwill for impairment The Group annually tests whether goodwill has been impaired.
Management make judgements to allocate goodwill to the Group of Cash Generating Units CGUs that benefits from the synergy of acquisitions and reflects the level at which goodwill is monitored.
The recoverable amount of the CGUs that the goodwill has been allocated to is determined based on value in use calculations which require estimating future cash flows and applying a suitable discount rate.
Details of the tests and carrying value of the asset are shown in note 15.

Accounting policies continued c T axation Judgement is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot be finally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained.
Tax provisions are made if it is expected that a liability will arise.
The Group reviews each significant tax liability or benefit to assess the appropriate accounting treatment.

During the year 428 pubs 2012: 301 pubs and various other plots of land with a book value of 127 million 2012: 154 million were sold generating gross proceeds of 157 million 2012: 193 million which, after taking account of disposal costs of 9 million 2012: 7 million, resulted in an overall profit of 21 million 2012: 32 million.
During the prior year, 17 pubs were sold as part of the Groups sale and leaseback programme.
These pubs generated gross proceeds of 24 million and resulted in a profit over book value, after fees, of 1 million.
These pubs were immediately leased back by the Group and are now classified as pubs held under operating leases.
No further pubs have been sold on a sale and leaseback basis since this time.
In accordance with IAS 36 purchased goodwill is allocated to operations disposed of, based on the relative value of the disposal to operations retained.
Accordingly, goodwill of 14 million 2012: 18 million has been allocated to the 428 pubs 2012: 318 pubs disposed of during the year.

The deferred tax liability that would have been in place at the time of business combinations that have occurred since 1 January 1999 resulted in the recognition of additional goodwill of 330 million as the fair value of the net assets acquired had been reduced.
As this preacquisition liability has reduced due to capital gains indexation relief and disposals, a credit has been recognised in the Income Statement.
The exceptional indexation credit for the year ended 30 September 2013 is 5 million 2012: 14 million.
This has been classed as an exceptional tax item due to its size and because it does not relate to any income or expense recognised in the Income Statement in the same period.

Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the loss attributable to Ordinary Shareholders for the year of 4 million 2012: profit of 44 million and on 499.5 million 2012: 499.4 million shares, being the weighted average number of equity shares in issue during the year after excluding shares held by trusts relating to employee share options and shares held in treasury.
Adjusted earnings per share, which the directors believe reflects the underlying performance of the Group, is based on earnings attributable to Ordinary Shareholders adjusted for the effects of exceptional items, net of tax, of 95 million 2012: 102 million and on 499.5 million 2012: 499.4 million shares, being the weighted average number of equity shares in issue during the year after excluding shares held by trusts relating to employee share options and shares held in treasury.

As a result there is no difference between basic earnings per share and basic diluted earnings per share, or between adjusted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share.
For the year ended 30 September 2012, diluted earnings per share is based on the profit for the year of 44 million and adjusted profit of 102 million and on 500.2 million ordinary shares, being the basic weighted average number of shares of 499.4 million adjusted for 0.8 million dilutive ordinary shares relating to long-term and short-term incentive plans.

Goodwill 2013 2012 m m At 1 October 359 377 Allocated to disposals 14 18 At 30 September 345 359 Allocation to disposals In accordance with IAS 36 goodwill is allocated to operations disposed of, based on the relative value of the disposal to operations retained.
Impairment testing Goodwill acquired via business combinations is tested annually for impairment.
For this purpose, the goodwill is allocated to the pub estate being a group of Cash Generating Units CGUs, as this represents the lowest level within the Group that goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
The impairment test compares the recoverable amount of the CGU with its carrying amount.
The recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations.
Value in use is calculated using budgeted EBITDA and forecasts of cash flow over a three year period, as prepared for the Board.
The three year cash flows continue to be risk adjusted to reflect a conservative outlook.
They include the impact of the reduction in consumer spending as a result of the difficult economic conditions and have also been adjusted to reflect the forecast level of disposals.
The key assumptions in these estimates are trading margin, rent projections and levels of working capital required to support trading.
Key assumptions have been assigned values by management using estimates based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
These assumptions have been reviewed by the Board and are believed to be reasonable.
Cash flows beyond three years are extrapolated using a 2% growth rate in operating income 2012: 2% which was selected as prudently below the Groups estimate of the long-term average growth rate.
The key driver to maintaining the growth rate is managements focus on selecting and supporting the best Publicans, whilst meeting the challenges of changing consumer demand.
The discount rate is based on the Group weighted average cost of capital WACC, which has been risk adjusted to reflect current market factors which have not already been captured within the cash flows.
In making this adjustment to the Group WACC, management have risk adjusted the cost of debt and the cost of equity by using an average of the highest four market risk premiums and Company betas obtained from five advisers at the year end date.
The cost of equity has been further inflated by using a theoretical share price derived from peer group data.
The pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate used in the testing at 30 September 2013 was 8.0% 2012: 8.0%.
As of 30 September 2013, the headroom on the impairment test is 758 million, the pre-tax adjusted discount rate could increase to 9.11% before any impairment would be required.
Management have considered the volatility within the current economic climate within the risk adjusted cash flow and the growth rate of any cash flows beyond the budget period would need to fall by 1.3% before any impairment would be required.
There is no impairment to goodwill in the period.

Property, plant and equipment continued Revaluation of property, plant and equipment With the exception of properties identified for disposal the Groups licensed land and buildings were revalued as at 30 September 2013 by GVA Grimley Limited and Christie & Co. independent Chartered Surveyors, and by the internal Asset and Valuation Director, Simon Millar MRICS, Chartered Surveyor.
The land and buildings were valued at market value as defined within RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards Red Book, reflecting the current and future rent and other income streams which are expected to be generated by each property capitalised at an appropriate yield.
The valuation also takes account of the terms of the leases or tenancies under which the properties are let.
Market value is influenced by factors such as income, location, pub quality and tenure.
The valuations are made with consideration given to market transactions within the UK pub sector.
Land and buildings are valued on an individual basis, however in order to give an indication as to the sensitivity of the Group revaluation, movements in both the total income stream and the average yield have been tested, each in isolation.
All other variables are held constant in order to assess the effect on the valuation.
This information should not be taken as a projection of likely future valuation movements as the interaction of more than one input to the valuation model on a pub by pub basis is actually assessed in the year end revaluation exercise.
Decreasing the yield used in the revaluation at 30 September 2013 by 0.25% would increase the valuation of the estate by 97 million, increasing the yield by 0.25% would decrease the valuation by 92 million.
Increasing the income streams used in the revaluation at 30 September 2013 by 2.5% would increase the valuation by 98 million, decreasing the income streams by 2.5% would decrease the valuation by 98 million.
The pubs used as security for the secured bonds and debenture in Enterprise Inns plc have been valued by GVA Grimley Limited 2,158 pubs and a representative sample of pubs held by Unique Pub Properties Limited Unique has been valued by Christie & Co 200 pubs.
GVA Grimley valued a further sample of pubs in Enterprise Inns plc 50 pubs.
The balance of the estate held in Enterprise Inns plc 564 pubs and the rest of the Unique estate 2,392 pubs have been valued by the internal Asset and Valuation Director using RICS valuation guidelines.
The results of this internal valuation have been compared to that of the external valuers.
This review ensured that the results are consistent.

Trade and other receivables continued Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to trade receivables and cash balances.
The Groups objective is to minimise this risk by carrying out credit checks where appropriate.
The amount of trade and other receivables included in the Balance Sheet are net of a bad debt provision which has been determined by management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the Balance Sheet date after taking into account collateral held in the form of cash deposits.
Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
At 30 September 2013 the value of collateral in the Group is 32 million 2012: 33 million and in the Parent Company is 21 million 2012: 23 million.
This balance is held on the Balance Sheet in other payables.

The proceeds of the bond have been used to cancel the 70 million tranche A of our new forward start facility and will enable us to reduce the requirement for future asset disposals.
The bank borrowings, corporate bonds and securitised bonds are held at amortised cost.
Finance lease payables represent the present value of future minimum lease payments.
Other categories of financial instruments include trade receivables and trade payables.
However there is no difference between the book value and fair value of these items.

Financial assets and liabilities continued The bank borrowings at 30 September 2013 comprised the drawndown balance of tranche A of the existing 180 million forward start facility which expires in December 2013 when the new forward start facility commences.
The new forward start facility comprises of tranches B and C each of 75 million which expire in June 2016, tranche A having been cancelled in September 2013.
Tranche B is a term loan with tranche C being a revolving facility.
The margin over LIBOR payable under tranche B and C are 4.5% and 4.0% respectively.
The margin over LIBOR payable on the tranche C loan will be reduced to 3.5% following repayment of the B facility.
A utilisation fee of 0.5% is payable if tranche C is more than 66% drawn.
Having raised funds through the issue of a convertible bond in Enterprise Funding Limited, these were on-loaned to Enterprise Inns plc on the same terms with an amount recorded in equity and an amount recorded as a liability.
Interest rate swaps Previously all of the Groups swaps were in place to hedge cash payments made on the floating rate debt.
There are no swaps held in the Group or Parent Company as at 30 September 2013.
Prior to cancellation the movement in the fair value of interest rate swaps has been accounted for as follows: 2013 2012 m m At 1 October 4 Cancellation of interest rate swaps 3 Fair value movements: ineffective portion and swaps not designated as effective hedges recognised in Income Statement 1 At 30 September Financial instruments and risk The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank borrowings, corporate bonds, securitised bonds and cash.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
There is no currency exposure as all transactions are in Sterling.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised as follows: Liquidity risk The Group has exposure to liquidity risk, being the risk that payments cannot be made when they fall due.
The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank borrowings, corporate bonds and securitised bonds.
This objective is achieved through the following processes: regular cash flow forecasting and reporting through the treasury function: regular review of the Groups debt portfolio including maturities and repayment profile: maintenance of undrawn bank facilities.

Financial assets and liabilities continued Interest rate risk The Group borrows its corporate bonds and securitised bonds except for the A2N bonds which were repaid in full during the 2012 financial year at a fixed rate.
Bank borrowings and cash balances attract interest at a floating rate.
The Groups objective is to manage exposure to changes in interest rates.
This exposure is managed by borrowing at fixed rates on the majority of its debt.
At 30 September 2013, the Groups borrowings were 97% fixed with an average interest rate of 6.3% for 8 years 2012: 88% fixed at an average rate of 6.4% for 9 years.
The Parent Companys borrowings were 94% fixed with an average interest rate of 6.5% for 8 years 2012: 78% fixed at an average rate of 6.5% for 8 years.
Interest rate sensitivity In estimating the sensitivity of the financial instruments we have assumed a reasonable potential change in interest rates.
The method used assumes that all other variables are held constant to determine the impact on profit before tax.
The analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice market rates rarely change in isolation.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimates due to the movements in the underlying transactions, actions taken to mitigate any potential losses, the interaction of more than one sensitivity occurring, and further developments in global financial markets.
As such the below should not be considered as a projection of likely future gains and losses in these financial instruments.
If interest rates were to increase by 50 basis points 0.5% the interest receivable in the Group would increase by 1 million 2012: 1 million and the interest payable would increase by 1 million 2012: 3 million.
If interest rates were to decrease by 50 basis points 0.5% the interest receivable in the Group would decrease by 1 million 2012: 1 million and the interest payable would decrease by 1 million 2012: 3 million.
If interest rates were to increase by 50 basis points 0.5% the interest receivable in the Parent Company would increase by 1 million 2012: 1 million and the interest payable would increase by 2 million 2012: 2 million.
If interest rates were to decrease by 50 basis points 0.5% the interest receivable in the Parent Company would decrease by 1 million 2012: 1 million and the interest payable would decrease by 2 million 2012: 2 million.
Security The bank borrowings are secured by a security deed entered into by substantially all of the companies which comprise the Group, excluding Enterprise Inns Holding Company Limited and its subsidiaries, Unique Pubs Limited and its subsidiaries and Enterprise Funding Limited.
The lenders have a floating charge over all of the assets and undertakings of such Group companies.
The floating charge ranks subsequent to the fixed charges created by the corporate bonds.
The total value of assets within the Group secured by way of a fixed or floating charge as at 30 September 2013 is property, plant and equipment 3,923 million 2012: 4,232 million, operating lease premiums 11 million 2012: 11 million and pubs held for sale 39 million 2012: 46 million.
The value of assets within the Parent Company secured by way of a fixed or floating charge as at 30 September 2013 is property, plant and equipment 2,003 million 2012: 2,227 million, operating lease premiums 4 million 2012: 5 million and pubs held for sale 30 million 2012: 20 million.

Financial assets and liabilities continued The security pledged for the Groups debt is summarised below: Debt Instrument Security Bank borrowings 1st floating charge over the balance of pubs in the Parent Company not already secured by a 1st fixed charge created by the corporate bonds.
2nd floating charge over the pubs secured by a 1st fixed charge created by the corporate bonds.
Share pledge over Unique Pubs Limited.
Corporate bonds excluding the unsecured 1st fixed charge over the 2,206 pubs in the Parent Company valued by convertible bond GVA Grimley Limited see note 17.
2nd floating charge over the balance of pubs in the Parent Company.
Securitised bonds Collectively over the whole Securitisation the security incorporates a 1st fixed charge in favour of the Trustee over the Issuers right, title, interest and benefit, present and future to all properties, cash, eligible investments and income generated by Unique Pub Properties Limited.
Covenants The Group is subject to a number of covenants in relation to its borrowing facilities.
There are four covenants that relate to the bank borrowings, which are tested quarterly.
There are two leverage covenants and two asset valuation covenants.
There is sufficient headroom on all four of these covenants.
The covenants are the same under the new forward start facility.
There are two covenants that relate to the corporate bonds excluding the unsecured convertible bond : an asset value covenant and a net annual income covenant.
At the year end there is an annual valuation of the pub estate and a review of the annual income for the pubs secured under each of the corporate bonds.
The valuation is undertaken by a firm of independent chartered surveyors.
The directors certify the net annual income as part of an annual compliance exercise.
In the event that pub values or pub incomes have fallen, there may be a requirement to add more pubs to the security of the corporate bonds and any addition of new pubs must be completed within 90 days of the year end.
There is sufficient headroom on both of these covenants.
There are two covenants that relate to the securitised bonds which are tested at each quarter end.
These covenants are based solely on the assets held within the securitised bonds and comprise a net asset covenant and a debt service cover covenant.
There is sufficient headroom in both of these covenants.
The Group tests all of the above covenants on a regular basis and forecasts are prepared during the budgeting process.
These are reviewed at Board level.
Hierarchical classification of financial instruments measured at fair value IFRS 7 requires that for fair value measurements recognised in the Balance Sheet the inputs used in the valuation are graded using a prescribed hierarchy as described below: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 Other techniques whereby the inputs are either directly or indirectly derived from market data.
Level 3 Inputs used in the valuation are not based on observable market data.
The fair values disclosed in respect of corporate bonds and securitised bonds have been evaluated as level 1 within the hierarchy described above.

This amount was paid on the condition it will be returned if HMRC is successful in an appeal in respect of the Rank Group plc gaming machine litigation, which has been to the European Court of Justice and has now been referred back to the UK First Tier Tax Tribunal for a decision.
There is a separate, but connected, matter being considered by the Court of Appeal that may also have a bearing on whether this amount is ultimately repayable, and the decision in that case was recently announced and found to be in favour of HMRC.
However, Rank Group plc are in the process of appealing to the Supreme Court against that decision and litigation is likely to continue on both strands of this case.
The Group has therefore recognised this amount as a provision pending the final outcome of the UK Courts decisions and any further litigation.
The non-current provision in both the Group and Parent Company relates to future commitments under onerous lease agreements.
The provision is expected to be utilised over the life of leases involved or as the pubs are disposed of.
The remaining lease terms vary from 0 to 57 years.

The changes in corporation tax from 23% to 20% have been substantively enacted and therefore the effects of these reductions have been included in the calculation of deferred tax in these financial statements.

Pension scheme The Group and the Parent Company make defined contribution payments to employees own pension plans and these payments are charged to the Income Statement as incurred.
RetailLink Management Limited a subsidiary company that has now been liquidated as part of a Group reorganisation established a pension plan for its employees in January 1999.
The plan has defined contribution and defined benefit schemes.
The plan is now closed to new members and for the future accrual of benefits.
The preliminary results of the full valuation of the defined benefit section of the plan at 5 April 2011 have been updated to 30 September 2013.
The valuation was carried out by Mercer, independent professionally qualified actuaries, using the projected unit credit method.
In view of the relative insignificance of the pension scheme, both on a gross and net basis, the Group has elected to only present summarised disclosures to one decimal place in respect of the scheme.

The maximum number of Deferred Share Award shares granted during the year is therefore estimated using the closing share price on 30 September 2013.
The number of shares granted in 2012 has been amended to show the actual number granted in 2012.
Where the conditions are not met the shares are shown in the forfeited released line.
Directors pay 1 to exercise awards granted under the Deferred Share Award and the LTIP.

The weighted average fair value of shares granted during the year under the Deferred Share Award was 1.45 2012: 0.76 restated for actual number of shares granted in 2012 and under the LTIP was 0.69 2012: 0.19.

Fair value of share schemes The fair value of equity-settled share options and share awards granted is estimated at the date of grant using share option valuation models.
The ESOS, SAYE and Deferred Share Award schemes are valued using the Black-Scholes model.
The element of the LTIP scheme that relates to non-market conditions is valued using the Black-Scholes model.
The element of the LTIP that includes market conditions is valued using the Monte-Carlo Simulation Model.
The following tables list the inputs to the models for options and shares granted during the year: ESOS SAYE Weighted average: 2013 2012 2013 2012 Share price 0.96 0.37 0.93 0.39 Exercise price 0.96 0.37 0.54 0.24 Dividend yield 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% Expected volatility 53% 81% 76% 73% Risk-free interest rate 0.42% 0.50% 1.06% 1.05% Expected life of option years 3.3 3.3 5 5 or 7 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 107 for the year ended 30 September 2013 23069.04 10 December 2013 2:19 PM Proof 6 Enterprise Inns Annual Report 2013-Proof 6-fix.

The 2012 weighted averages have been amended to reflect the actual number of shares granted in 2013.
The Deferred Share Award for the executive directors vests in 4 years, the Deferred Share Award for the executive management vests in two equal tranches after 2 and 3 years.
The LTIP vests in three equal tranches after 3, 4 and 5 years.
Expected share price volatility is based on historic volatility over the same period of time as the vesting period of the option.
For the LTIP the expected life of an option is based on historical data.
The LTIP will only vest in full if a TSR target is met.
This is a market condition and the TSR performance criteria have therefore been taken into account when calculating the fair value of the options granted under the LTIP.
These conditions have been incorporated into the Monte-Carlo Simulation model which is used to fair value the TSR element of the scheme.
