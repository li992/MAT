4.2 Goodwill and intangible assets Accounting policies Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of an acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and any contingent liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
In respect of joint ventures, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the joint venture.
Where they arise on acquisition, brands have been valued based on discounted future cash flows using the relief from royalty method, including amounts into perpetuity.
Currently all brands held are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives.
This is based upon the strong historical performance of the brands over a number of economic cycles, the demonstrable chaining of brands, and the Directors intentions regarding the future use of brands.
The Directors feel this is a suitable policy for a brands business which invests in and maintains the brands, and foresee no technological developments or competitor actions which would put a definite life on the brands.
The brands are tested annually for impairment.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Other intangible assets comprise software licences, sponsorship rights and other contract based intangible assets.
They are amortised on a straight-line basis from the date they are available for use.
They are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
