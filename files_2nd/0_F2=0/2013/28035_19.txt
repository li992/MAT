The tax charge is allocated between the revenue and capital account on the marginal basis whereby revenue expenses are matched first against taxable income in the revenue account.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised where, in the opinion of the directors, it is more likely than not that these amounts will be realised in future periods.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of surplus management expenses, losses on loan relationships and eligible unrelieved foreign tax, as the Company is unlikely to have sufficient future taxable revenue to offset against these.
h Dividends Dividends are not recognised in the financial statements unless there is an obligation to pay at the balance sheet date.
Proposed dividends are recognised in the year in which they are paid to shareholders.
