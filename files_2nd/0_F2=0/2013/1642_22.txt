| AVEVA Group plc Financial statements Annual report 2013 59 notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Corporate information AVEVA Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The address of the registered office is given on the inside back cover.
AVEVA Group plcs shares are publicly traded on the Official List of the London Stock Exchange.
2 baSiS of preparation The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2013.
The Consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 000 except when otherwise indicated.
The Group presents a nonGAAP performance measure on the face of the Consolidated income statement.
The Directors believe that this alternative measure of profit provides a reliable and consistent measure of the Groups underlying performance.
The face of the Consolidated income statement presents adjusted profit before tax and reconciles this to profit before tax as required to be presented under the applicable accounting standards.
Adjusted earnings per share, as disclosed in note 14, is calculated having adjusted profit after tax for the same items and their tax effect.
The term adjusted profit is not defined under IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly titled profit measures reported by other companies.
It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measures of profit.
a Statement of compliance The Consolidated financial statements of AVEVA Group plc and all its subsidiaries the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, as adopted by the European Union, as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2013.
The Groups financial statements are also consistent with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
The parent Company financial statements of AVEVA Group plc have been prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and are included on pages 89 to 92. b basis of consolidation The Consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of AVEVA Group plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 March each year.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared using existing GAAP for each country of operation.
Adjustments are made to translate any differences that may exist between the respective local GAAP and IFRSs.
Intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intraGroup transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
On acquisition, assets and liabilities of subsidiaries are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition, with any excess of the cost of acquisition over this value being capitalised as goodwill.
c adoption of new and revised standards The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
new standards and interpretations which came into force during the year did not have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
new standards and interpretations not yet effective During the year, the IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards although in some cases not yet adopted by the EU which are expected to have implications for the reporting of the financial position or performance of the Group or which will require additional disclosures in future financial years: Effective for periods commencing after IAS 1 Amendment Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income 1 July 2012 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments classification and measurement 1 January 2015 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements 1 January 2013 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements 1 January 2013 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 1 January 2013 IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement 1 January 2013 IAS 27 Revised Separate Financial Statements 1 January 2013 IAS 28 Revised Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures 1 January 2013 IAS 19 Revised Employee Benefits 1 January 2013 The Group intends to adopt these standards in the first accounting period after the effective date.
The adoption of IAS19 revised in 2013 14, is expected to reduce the element of finance revenue associated with retirement benefit obligations by approximately 500,000.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of the other standards and interpretations listed will have a material effect on the Consolidated financial statements in the period of initial application.
OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS AVEVA Group plc | 60 Annual report 2013 Financial statements notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 3 SignifiCant aCCounting eStimateS The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of judgement and estimation uncertainty at the Balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below: a retirement benefit obligations The determination of the Groups obligations and expense for defined benefit pensions is dependent on the selection, by the Board of Directors, of assumptions used by the pension scheme actuary in calculating these amounts.
The assumptions applied together with sensitivity analysis are described in note 28 and include, amongst others, the discount rate, the inflation rate, rates of increase in salaries and mortality rates.
While the Directors consider that the assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in the actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the reported amount of the Groups future pension obligations, actuarial gains and losses included in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in future years and the future staff costs.
The carrying amount of retirement benefit obligations at 31 March 2013 was 16,959,000 2012 9,875,000. b provision for impairment of receivables The Group makes provision for the impairment of receivables on a customer specific basis.
The determination of the appropriate level of provision involves an estimate of the potential risk of default or nonpayment by the Groups customers and management consider a number of factors including the financial strength of the customers, the level of default that the Group has suffered in the past, the age of the receivable outstanding and the Groups trading experience with that customer.
The provision for impairment of receivables at 31 March 2013 was 4,771,000 2012 3,431,000. c revenue recognition Revenue from sales of software licences when these are combined with the delivery of significant implementation or customisation services is recognised in line with the delivery of the services to the customer.
This policy involves the assessment of which customer projects include significant customisation or implementation and also an assessment of the stage of completion of such projects.
We generally only enter into this type of contract in our Enterprise Solutions segment but the assessments and estimates used by the Group could have a significant impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognised on a project.
4 Summary of SignifiCant aCCounting poliCieS a revenue The Group generates its revenue principally from licensing the rights to use its software products directly to end users and to a lesser extent indirectly through resellers.
Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents the amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of business, net of discounts and sales taxes.
It comprises initial licence fees, annual fees and rental licence fees, together with income from consultancy and other related services.
For each revenue stream, revenue is not recognised unless and until: B a clear contractual arrangement can be evidenced: B delivery has been made in accordance with that contract: B if required, contractual acceptance criteria have been met: and B the fee has been agreed and collectability is probable.
Where extended payment terms beyond 180 days exist, revenue recognition is deferred until payment is due.
initial annual licence agreements Users are charged an initial licence fee upon installation for a set number of users together with an obligatory annual fee, which is charged every year.
Annual fees consist of the continuing right to use and customer support and maintenance, which includes core product upgrades and enhancements and remote support services.
Users must continue to pay annual fees in order to maintain the right to use the software.
Initial licence fees are recognised once the above conditions have been met.
Annual fees are recognised on a straightline basis over the period of the contract, which is typically twelve months.
If annual fees are charged at a discount, an amount is allocated out of the initial licence fee at fair market value based on the value established when annual fees are charged separately to customers.
rental licence agreements As an alternative to the initial licence fee plus annual fee model, the Group also supplies its software under three different types of rental licence agreement.
Rental licence fees which are invoiced monthly and which are cancellable by the customer are recognised on a monthly basis.
Other rental licence agreements are invoiced at the start of the contracted period, which is typically one year, are noncancellable and consist of two separate components, the initial software delivery: and the continuing right to use with customer support and maintenance.
Revenue in respect of the continuing right to use and customer support and maintenance element is valued at fair market value based on the value established when annual fees are charged separately to the customer.
This component is recognised on a straightline basis over the period of the contract.
The residual amount representing the implied initial fee element is recognised upfront, provided all of the above criteria have been met.
Where uncertainty exists and it is not possible to reliably determine the fair value of the customer support and maintenance element, all revenue is recognised on a straightline basis over the period of the contract.
COM | AVEVA Group plc Financial statements Annual report 2013 61 4 Summary of SignifiCant aCCounting poliCieS continued a revenue continued rental licence agreements continued The Group also licenses its software using a token licensing model.
Under this model, a basket of tokens representing licences to use different software products over a defined period is granted, which enables the customer to draw these down as and when required.
Where the customer commits in advance to a specified number of tokens over a defined period, a proportion of revenue is recognised with an appropriate element deferred for customer support and maintenance obligations, subject to the above recognition conditions being met.
Where the customer is charged in arrears, revenue is recognised based on actual number of tokens used.
Services Services consist primarily of consultancy, implementation services and training and are performed under separate service arrangements.
Revenue from these services is recognised as the services are performed and stage of completion is determined by reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the service project.
If a contract cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is recognised only to the extent that costs have been incurred.
Provision is made as soon as a loss is foreseen.
If an arrangement includes both licence and service elements, licence fee revenue is recognised upon delivery of the software provided that services do not include significant customisation or modification of the base product and the payment terms for licences are not subject to acceptance criteria.
In all other cases, revenues from both licence and service elements are recognised as services are performed.
b foreign currencies The functional and presentational currency of AVEVA Group plc is Pounds Sterling.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the Balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the Consolidated income statement.
nonmonetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of the initial transaction.
The subsidiaries have a number of different functional currencies.
As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of these overseas subsidiaries are translated into Pounds Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the Balance sheet date, and their Income statements are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation are taken directly to the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
c exceptional items The Group discloses items of both income and expense which are exceptional by virtue of their size or incidence so as to allow a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
The Group includes the costs of significant restructuring exercises, fees associated with business combinations and costs incurred in integrating acquired companies.
d goodwill Goodwill on acquisitions is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the acquirers interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Where goodwill forms part of a cashgenerating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cashgenerating unit retained.
If the potential benefit of tax losses or other deferred tax assets does not satisfy the criteria in IFRS 3 for separate recognition when a business combination is initially accounted for but is subsequently realised, the Group recognises the deferred tax income in the Consolidated income statement.
e intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and from a business acquisition are capitalised at fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, the cost model is applied to each class of intangible asset as set out below.
Expenditure on internally developed intangible assets, excluding development costs, is taken to the Consolidated income statement in the year in which it is incurred.
Internal software development expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only after its technical feasibility and commercial viability can be demonstrated.
Useful lives are also examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.
Amortisation is calculated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful economic lives of the asset, which are as follows: Years Developed technology 512 Customer relationships 1020 Other software 3 Purchased software rights 510 OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS AVEVA Group plc | 62 Annual report 2013 Financial statements notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 4 Summary of SignifiCant aCCounting poliCieS continued f research expenditure Research expenditure is written off in the year of expenditure.
g property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is calculated on a straightline basis to write down the assets to their estimated residual value over the useful economic life of the asset as follows: Years Computer equipment 3 Fixtures, fittings and office equipment 68 Motor vehicles 4 Leasehold buildings and improvements are amortised on a straightline basis over the period of the lease 3 to 49 years or useful economic life, if shorter.
h impairment of assets Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to cashgenerating units expected to benefit from the combinations synergies and represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and generates cash flows which are independent of other cashgenerating units.
The recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstance indicate that it might be impaired.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may be impaired.
If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets or cashgenerating units are written down to their recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the greater of net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Income statement in the administrative expenses line item.
i trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
j Cash and cash equivalents Cash and shortterm deposits in the Consolidated balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and shortterm deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these approximates their fair value.
For the purpose of the Consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
k Derivative financial instruments The only derivative financial instruments the Group holds are forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
All forward foreign exchange contracts have been markedtomarket and are held at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet.
The Group has not applied hedge accounting during the year and therefore movements in fair value are being recorded in the Consolidated income statement.
Fair value is estimated using the settlement rates prevailing at the period end.
l leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated income statement on a straightline basis over the lease term.
m taxation Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the Balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences: B except where the deferred income tax liability arises from goodwill amortisation or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and B in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
COM | AVEVA Group plc Financial statements Annual report 2013 63 4 Summary of SignifiCant aCCounting poliCieS continued m taxation continued Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carryforward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carryforward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised: B except where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and B in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each Balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance sheet date.
The income tax effects of items recorded in either other comprehensive income or equity are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income or the Consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity respectively.
Otherwise, income tax is recognised in the Consolidated income statement.
Revenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales taxes except: B where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable: and B receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales taxes included.
The net amount of sales taxes recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the Consolidated balance sheet.
n post retirement benefits The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the UK, Sweden and Germany.
The Group also provides certain post employment benefits to its South Korean employees.
The UK defined benefit pension scheme, previously available to all UK employees, was closed to new applicants in 2002.
UK employees are now offered membership of a defined contribution scheme.
The German unfunded defined benefit schemes are closed to new applicants and provide benefits to nine deferred members.
These schemes were acquired as part of previous business combinations.
no current employees participate in the scheme.
Full provision has been made for the liability on the Consolidated balance sheet.
The Group also operates a defined benefit pension scheme for one German employee.
The Group provides pension arrangements to its Swedish employees through an industrywide defined benefit scheme.
It is not possible to identify the share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme which is attributable to the Group on a fair and reasonable basis.
Therefore the Group has applied the provisions in IAS 19 to account for the scheme as if it was a defined contribution scheme.
For the defined benefit schemes, the defined benefit obligation is calculated annually for each plan by qualified external actuaries using the projected unit credit method which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of defined benefit obligation.
The retirement benefit liability in the Consolidated balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation using a discount rate derived from a published index of AA rated corporate bonds as reduced by the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
Fair value is based on market price information and in the case of quoted securities is the published bid price.
The value of a net pension benefit asset is restricted to the present value of any amount the Group expects to recover by way of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions.
The current service cost is recognised in the Consolidated income statement as an employee benefit expense.
The interest element of the defined benefit cost represents the change in present value of scheme obligations resulting from the passage of time and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening present value of the benefit obligation, taking into account material changes in the obligation during the year.
The expected return on plan assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of the year of longterm market returns on scheme assets, adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions received and benefits paid during the year.
The expected return on plan assets and the interest cost is recognised in the Consolidated income statement as finance revenue and finance expense respectively.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments or changes in actuarial assumptions are credited or charged in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
The Group also operates defined contribution pension schemes for a number of UK and nonUK employees.
Contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to profit before tax as they become payable.
OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS AVEVA Group plc | 64 Annual report 2013 Financial statements notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 4 Summary of SignifiCant aCCounting poliCieS continued o Sharebased payments The cost of equitysettled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted, further details of which are given in note 29.
In valuing equitysettled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of AVEVA Group plc market conditions.
The cost of equitysettled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equitysettled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Groups best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
no expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equitysettled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equitysettled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
however, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share, subject to an estimate of whether performance conditions will be met.
p employee benefit trust The Group has established an employee benefit trust AVEVA Group Employee Benefit Trust 2008, which is a separately administered trust and is funded by loans from Group companies.
The assets of the trust comprise shares in AVEVA Group plc and cash balances.
The Group recognises assets and liabilities of the trust in the Consolidated financial statements and shares held by the trust are recorded at cost as a deduction from shareholders equity.
Consideration received for the sale of shares held by the trust is recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from the sale and the original cost being taken to retained earnings.

Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the potentially dilutive share options into ordinary shares.
Details of the terms and conditions of share options are provided in note 29.

The assembled workforce brings product development skills and expertise, service delivery skills and domain knowledge of the end user markets to the Group.
acquisition of trade and assets from global majic Software inc. On 17 December 2012, the Group acquired the trade and certain assets and liabilities of Global Majic Software Inc. for cash consideration of 989,000.
The fair value of the assets acquired consisted mainly of developed technology of 1,092,000. lfm Software limited On 7 October 2011, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Z F UK Limited, a UK software company which develops and markets laser scanning software for the capture and management of laser scan data.
The companys name has since been changed to LFM Software Limited.
The acquisition was satisfied for net consideration of 6.3 million on a debt free cash free basis.
As part of this acquisition, Z F Gmbh, the former parent company of Z F UK Limited, has also been granted a licence to continue to distribute the Z F UK software together with Z F Gmbhs laser scanning hardware products.
This initial licence has been granted free of royalty up to the value of the first 1 million of royalties over the next five years.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
COM | AVEVA Group plc Financial statements Annual report 2013 71 16 gooDwill continued Considering the sensitivity levels for the two cashgenerating units: engineering & Design Systems During 2012 13 the Contribution of the Engineering & Design Systems CGU was 144.1 million.
This is far in excess of the attributable goodwill value.
Therefore, the Directors believe that no reasonably foreseeable changes to key assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill, such is the margin by which the estimated recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value.
enterprise Solutions The recoverable amount of the Enterprise Solutions CGU is determined from a value in use calculation.
The key assumptions for this calculation are those regarding discount rates and growth rates.
Management estimates discount rates using pretax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the year ending 31 March 2014 together with the most recent three year business plan and extrapolates cash flows for future years based on an average estimated new business growth rate of 4% 2012 4%.
In addition, revenue is also forecast to grow from the impact of sales of initial licenses driving increased annual fees in future periods.
In total, the revenue growth in periods beyond the period covered by the business plan is 7%.
The longterm average growth rate is based on typical growth rates for companies with strong software and technology services that are exposed to high growth sectors such as Oil & Gas and Power and high growth economies such as Asia Pacific, India and Latin America.
Future cash flows are discounted in line with the weighted average cost of capital of approximately 12% pretax 2012 12%.
headroom for goodwill based on current forecasts is 32 million.
Sensitivity levels on these calculations indicate that impairment would need to be considered if: B instead of 12%, a discount rate of 18.5% or higher had been used: or B instead of 4%, a longterm new business growth rate of 1% or lower had been used.

26 finanCial riSk management The Groups principal financial instruments comprise cash and shortterm deposits, treasury deposits and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into forward foreign currency contracts to manage currency risks arising from the Groups operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing such risks on a regular basis as summarised below: a market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holding of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters.
interest rate risk The Group holds net funds and hence its interest rate risk is associated with shortterm cash deposits and treasury deposits.
The Groups overall objective with respect to holding these deposits is to maintain a balance between security of funds, accessibility and competitive rates of return.
OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS AVEVA Group plc | 76 Annual report 2013 Financial statements notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 26 finanCial riSk management continued a market risk continued interest rate risk continued For the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analyses that show the effects of hypothetical changes of relevant risk variables on profit or loss and shareholders equity.
The Group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on its cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits.
The Group does not have any borrowings.
The impact is determined by applying sensitised interest rates to the cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposit balances.
A 1% point decrease in the Sterling and US Dollar interest rates would have reduced interest income by approximately 1,148,000 2012 1,302,000 and profit after tax by 872,000 2012 963,000. foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk arises from the Group undertaking a significant number of foreign currency transactions in the course of operations.
These exposures arise from sales by business units in currencies other than the Groups functional currency of Sterling.
The majority of costs are denominated in the functional currency of the business unit.
The main exposures relate to the US Dollar, Euro and yen reflecting the fact that a significant proportion of the Groups revenue and cash receipts are denominated in these currencies whilst a large proportion of its costs, such as Research and Development, are settled in Sterling and Swedish Krona.
The Group manages these exchange risks, where possible, by using currency exchange contracts for the sale of US Dollar, Euro and yen as appropriate.
The Group enters into specific forward foreign exchange contracts for individually significant revenue contracts when the timing of forecast cash flows is reasonably certain.
In addition, the Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to sell US Dollars and Euro to match forecast cash flows arising from its recurring revenue base.
These are renewed on a revolving basis as required.
At 31 March 2013, the Group had outstanding currency exchange contracts to sell $21.0 million 2012 $13.0 million, 14.25 million 2012 6.65 million and 304.0 million 2012 nil.
It has also had outstanding currency exchange contracts to buy Kr24.0 million 2012 Kr nil.
The Group has not applied hedge accounting during the current year and therefore all gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts have been included in the Consolidated income statement.
The Group has investments in foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to currency translation risk.
Gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
foreign currency sensitivity analysis For the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analyses that show the effects of hypothetical changes in the foreign exchange rates in profit or loss or shareholders equity.
The impact is determined by applying the sensitised foreign exchange rate to the monetary assets and liabilities at the Balance sheet date.
Currency risks as defined by IFRS 7 arise on account of financial instruments being denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency and being of a monetary nature: differences resulting from the translation of financial statements into the Groups presentation currency are not taken into consideration.
A 10% change in the US Dollar against Sterling, Euro against Sterling and Swedish Krona against Sterling would have impacted equity and profit after tax by the amounts shown below as at the reporting date shown.
In managements opinion, this is a reasonably possible change given current market conditions.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates and other foreign currencies, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2012 13.
COM | AVEVA Group plc Financial statements Annual report 2013 77 26 finanCial riSk management continued b Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash equivalents, treasury deposits, trade and other receivables.
Counterparties for cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits are governed by the treasury policy, which has been approved by the Board, and are limited to financial institutions which have a high credit rating assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The amount of exposure to each counterparty is subject to a specific limit, up to a maximum of 70 million as set out in the Groups treasury policy.
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties and provides credit to customers in the normal course of business.
The amounts presented in the Consolidated balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event, which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The Group has credit control functions to monitor receivable balances on an ongoing basis.
Credit checks are performed before credit is granted to new customers.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
The exposure to credit risk is mitigated where necessary by either letters of credit or payments in advance.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of its financial assets.
Disclosures relating to the credit associated with trade receivables are in note 20. c liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity of financial assets and liabilities.
The Group has no borrowings from third parties and therefore liquidity risk is not considered a significant risk at this time.

The carrying amounts of these financial assets and liabilities in the Groups financial statements approximates their fair values.
In addition the Groups financial assets also include forward foreign exchange contracts.
Financial instruments which are recognised at fair value subsequent to initial recognition are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
The three levels are defined as follows: B Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: B Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and B Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
At 31 March 2013 the Group had forward foreign exchange contracts, which were measured at Level 2 fair value subsequent to initial recognition.
The fair value of the liability in respect of foreign exchange contracts was 574,000 at 31 March 2013 2012 223,000 asset.
The resulting loss of 796,000 2012 gain of 308,000 on the movement of the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is recognised in the Consolidated income statement within administrative expenses.
f Capital management The Groups policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor market, creditor, customer and employee confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to the equity holders of AVEVA Group plc comprising issued share capital, other reserves and retained earnings.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
no changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 March 2012 or 2013.
The Board monitors the capital structure on a regular basis and determines the level of annual dividend.
The Group is not exposed to any externally imposed capital requirements.

Other deferred tax assets consist principally of deferred tax on bad debt provision, forward foreign exchange contracts, staff bonus accrual and timing differences in respect of revenue recognition.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2013 2012 000 000 Deferred tax liabilities 2,081 1,855 Deferred tax assets 6,291 4,009 4,210 2,154 At the Balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 4,109,000 2012 795,000 available for offset against future profits.
Of the total deferred tax asset of 1,237,000 2012 238,000, 1,051,000 2012 238,000 has been recognised and is included in other above.
These losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the Balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was approximately 42,612,000 2012 32,172,000. no liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
It is likely that the majority of the overseas earnings would qualify for the UK dividend exemptions but may be subject to foreign withholding taxes.

This scheme was closed to new employees on 30 September 2002 with the option of reopening if required and was converted to a Career Average Revalued Earnings basis on 30 September 2004.
Pensions are payable to dependants on death in retirement and a lump sum is payable if death occurs in service.
There is an insurance policy in place which covers this liability.
Administration on behalf of the members is governed by a trust deed, and the funds are held and managed by professional investment managers who are independent of the Group.
Contributions to the scheme are made in accordance with advice from an external, professionally qualified actuary, Broadstone Investment Management Limited, at rates which are calculated to be sufficient to meet the future liabilities of the scheme using the projected unit credit method.
The employees contributions are fixed as a percentage of salary, the balance being made up by the employer.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective Balance sheet dates.
To develop the expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption, the Company considered the current level of expected returns on riskfree investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The principal assumptions used in determining the pension valuation were as follows: 2013 2012 % % Main assumptions: Rate of salary increases 5.50 5.20 Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.30 2.90 Rate of increase of pensions in deferment 2.50 2.20 Discount rate 4.20 4.60 Inflation assumption 3.50 3.20 Expected rate of return on scheme assets: Equities 6.30 6.40 Bonds 2.30 2.90 Other 0.50 0.50 For the years ended 31 March 2013 and 2012, the following weighted average life expectancy at age 65 for mortality has been used: 2013 2012 Years Years Male pensioners 24.5 24.4 Female pensioners 25.5 25.4 nonretired males 26.7 26.6 nonretired females 27.8 27.7 Member contributions were 7.5% 2012 7.5% of pensionable salary.
From 1 September 2012 most members contributions were made by the Company through a salary sacrifice arrangement.
The total contributions in 2014 are expected to be approximately 2,100,000.
The assumed discount rate, inflation rate and mortality all have a significant effect on the IAS 19 accounting valuation.
The following table shows the sensitivity of the valuation to changes in these assumptions: Impact on deficit increase decrease 2013 2012 000 000 0.25 percentage point increase to: discount rate 3,543 2,829 inflation including pension increases linked to inflation 2,204 1,639 Additional one year increase to life expectancy 1,441 1,103 The assets and liabilities of the scheme at 31 March 2013 and 2012 were as follows: 2013 2012 000 000 Equities 22,232 31,939 Bonds 26,414 12,869 Cash and deposits 10,561 5,637 Total fair value of assets 59,207 50,445 Present value of scheme liabilities 72,421 58,253 net pension liability 13,214 7,808 WWW.

Tribon Solutions Gmbh operated an unfunded defined benefit scheme that provides benefits to three deferred members following an acquisition in 1992. no current employees participate in the scheme and it is closed to new applicants.
Benefit payments are made as they fall due.
The scheme was transferred to AVEVA Gmbh when Tribon Solutions Gmbh and AVEVA Gmbh merged in 2005.
Since the acquisition of Bocad in May 2012, AVEVA Software Gmbh has been responsible for the pension obligations of six former Bocad employees.
At the time of the acquisition, the pension obligations were only partly financed via external funding vehicles.
In March 2013, AVEVA concluded an agreement with an external insurance provider which results in the insurance company being obliged to provide all benefits as detailed in the individual pension commitments, with AVEVA only having an obligation if the external insurance provider defaults.
In addition, AVEVA Gmbh operates a defined benefit pension scheme for one employee.
This scheme is closed to new members.
Details of the actuarial assumptions used to value these schemes in accordance with IAS 19 are set out below: 2013 2012 Rate of increase of pension in payment 2.0%2.5% 2.0%2.5% Discount rate 3.25% 4.8%5.3% Mortality 14.8 years 15.5 years Rate of salary increases 0%2.5% 0%2.5% The retirement age for the Tribon Solutions Gmbh and AVEVA Gmbh schemes was 60 and 63 years of age respectively 2012 60 and 63 years of age.
The contributions in 2014 are expected to be approximately 80,000. c South korean severance pay South Korean employees are entitled to a lump sum on severance of their employment equal to one months salary for each year of service.
The IAS 19 valuation of the liability has been carried out using the following assumptions: 2013 2012 % % Rate of salary increases 5.00 6.00 Discount rate 3.68 4.67 The retirement age for AVEVA Korea Limited employees is 60 years of age 2012 60 years of age.
d other retirement schemes All Swedish employees employed by AVEVA AB aged 28 or over are members of the ITP, an industry scheme for salaried employees which provides benefits in addition to the state pension arrangements.
The ITP scheme is managed by Alecta, a Swedish insurance company.
It is a multiemployer defined benefit scheme with a supplementary defined contribution component.
AVEVA AB pays monthly premiums to the insurers which vary by age, service and salary of the employee.
AVEVA AB is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme on a fair and reasonable basis because this information is not provided by the scheme and therefore has accounted for the scheme as if it was a defined contribution pension scheme.
At 31 March 2013, Alectas surplus in the form of collective funding level was 135% 2012 124% which was calculated in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act for Insurance Companies.
The total cost charged to the income statement was 733,000 2012 666,000. e Defined contribution schemes The Group operates defined contribution retirement schemes for certain UK, US, German, French, norwegian and Asian employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
The total cost charged to income of 3,704,000 2012 3,055,000 represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at the rates specified in the rules of the plans.

The average fair value of options granted during the year was 16.67 2012 17.13.
In calculating the fair value, the expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The range of exercise prices for options outstanding at the end of the year was nil to 0.03 2012 nil to 0.03.
The Group recognised total expenses of 1,226,000 and 666,000 related to equitysettled sharebased payment transactions in the years ended 31 March 2013 and 2012 respectively.

If average diluted EPS growth is more than 15% then all shares shall vest.
If average diluted EPS growth over the same period is less than 8% then none of the shares will vest.
For growth rates between 8% and 15% the number of shares that vest will be determined by linear interpolation between 25% and 100%.
2011 12 awards In 2011 12 a total of 140,820 share options were awarded to the Executive Directors and senior management under the LTIP.
The performance conditions attached to this award are based on EPS growth over the three years from 2011 12 to 2013 14.

If average diluted earnings per share for the period was below 52.14 pence, then no shares would vest and the option would lapse.
During 2011 12, the vesting conditions were tested and had been met.
Therefore the award vested in full.
The fair value of each these option awards is measured at grant date using the Black Scholes option pricing model taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
