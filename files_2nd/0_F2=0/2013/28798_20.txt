The inputs to the model included the following: expected volatility of 20% 31 December 2012: 20%, dividends of 28.0p 31 December 2012: 28.0p per annum, and a risk-free interest rate based on the Sterling Benchmark Swap Curve.
Expected volatility has been estimated based on relevant historic data in respect of RITs share price.
The vesting requirements are set out in detail in the section headed Long-Term Incentive Plan in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 35.
To allow for the effects of early exercise and staff turnover, it was assumed that the majority of the SARs, in terms of value, would be exercised four and a half years after the relevant grant dates.
Weighted average exercise prices are calculated as the sum of all prices of SAR exercises divided by number of SARs exercised.

In relation to receivables, payables and short-term borrowings the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
The fair value of the bank loans was estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rates available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
As at 31 December 2013 this amounted to 197.4 million 31 December 2012: 147.8 million.
No financial assets or liabilities were reclassified during the year or prior period by the Group or the Company.
RIT Capital Partners plc Report and Accounts December 2013 81 Notes to the Financial Statements 28.
Financial Instruments continued 28.2 Financial risk management The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The identification, mitigation and monitoring of these risks is undertaken by JRCMs executive management under the authority of the Board and the Audit and Risk Committee, and is described in more detail below.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing risks have not changed since the previous accounting period.
The risk management processes of the Company are aligned with those of the Group as a whole and it is at the Group level that the majority of the risk management procedures are performed.
Where relevant and materially different to the Group position, Company specific risk exposures are explained alongside those of the Group.
Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument and investment properties held by the Group may fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices.
Market risk can be summarised as comprising three types of risk: Price risk The risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments and investment properties will fluctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk Interest rate risk The risk that fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates Currency risk The risk that fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates The Groups exposure, sensitivity to and management of each of these risks is described in further detail below.
Management of market risk Management of market risk is fundamental to the Groups investment objective.
The investment portfolio is continually monitored to ensure an appropriate balance of risk and reward.
From time to time, the Group may seek to reduce or increase its exposure to stock markets and currencies by taking positions in currency forward contracts, index futures and options relating to one or more stock markets.
These instruments are used for the purpose of hedging some or all of the existing exposure within the Groups investment portfolio to those currencies or particular markets or to enable increased exposure when deemed appropriate.
Price risk Price risk other than caused by interest rate or currency risk may affect the value of the quoted and the unquoted investments held by the Group.
Management of price risk The Group has a widely diversified investment portfolio which significantly reduces the exposure to individual asset price risk.
The performance of third party investment managers is regularly reviewed and assessed to ensure compliance with their mandates and that their performance is compatible with the Groups investment objective.
Exposure to price risk The Groups exposure to price risk can be assumed to be equivalent to the investment portfolio, excluding interests in debt securities and including relevant derivatives, as set out below: 31 December 31 December 2013 2012 million million Exposure to price risk 2,159.6 1,875.8 82 Report and Accounts December 2013 RIT Capital Partners plc | Company Highlights | Strategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements | Other Information | Notes to the Financial Statements As at the year-end, the Groups exposure to listed equities after adjusting for index futures and unquoted investments represented 100.6% of net assets 31 December 2012: 101.5%.
Price risk sensitivity analysis The sensitivity of the Groups net assets and income statement IS with regards to changes in market prices is illustrated below.
This is based on an assumed 10% increase in the fair value of the investments with all other variables held constant.
A 10% decrease is assumed to produce an equal and opposite effect.
The sensitivity analysis takes account of the relevant derivative transactions the Group has entered into including those to provide a hedge against such movements.
31 December 31 December 2013 2012 Impact on IS Impact on IS & net assets & net assets million million Total 216.0 187.6 The Group is exposed to market risk in respect to the fair value of the investment properties.
The investment properties are valued by an external party using a market valuation approach and as such the valuation will be influenced by trends experienced in the property market and also the wider economic environment.
In particular the valuation will be dependent on rental income yields, demand and supply for office space in London and comparable transactions completed in the marketplace.
Fluctuations in any of the inputs used by the valuers to value the investment properties may reduce or increase the fair value of the properties.
c. Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations mainly through its share capital and retained profits, including realised gains on investments.
In addition, financing has been obtained through bank borrowings.
Changes in interest rates have a direct impact on the fair value or future cash flows of the following financial assets and liabilities: Gilts and other government securities Money market funds Credit funds Cash and cash equivalents Group borrowings Certain derivative contracts Changes in interest rates indirectly affect the fair value of the Groups other investments including those in quoted and unquoted equity securities.
Management of interest rate risk The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making decisions on investments and borrowings.
The Company uses interest rate swaps as a hedge of future interest payments and this has the effect of increasing the proportion of its fixed interest debt.
Exposure to interest rate risk The Groups exposure of financial assets and liabilities to floating interest rates giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are reset and fixed interest rates giving fair value risk, is shown below.
RIT Capital Partners plc Report and Accounts December 2013 83 Notes to the Financial Statements 28.

These provide indirect exposure to interest rate risk.
Exposures vary throughout the year as a consequence of changes in the composition of the net assets of the Group arising out of investment, borrowing and risk management processes.
Portfolio investments include direct and indirect via external managed funds investments in government securities, money markets, and unquoted debt securities issued by portfolio companies.
Interest received on cash and cash equivalents is at prevailing market rates.
The Group has total borrowings of 197.4 million outstanding at the year-end 31 December 2012: 147.8 million.
The credit facility comprising this total incurs floating interest payments, however the overall interest cost is fixed through the operation of interest rate swaps.
Further details are provided in note 18.
Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis The approximate sensitivity of the Groups net assets and IS in regard to changes in interest rates is illustrated below.
This is based on an assumed 50 basis point annualised increase in prevailing interest rates at the balance sheet date applied to the floating rate assets and liabilities and the following assumptions: the fair values of assets and liabilities are not affected by a change in interest rates funds will be reinvested in similar interest bearing securities on maturity all other variables are held constant The Group has direct exposure to the effect of interest rate changes on the valuation and cash flows of its interest bearing assets and liabilities.
However, it may also be indirectly affected by the impact of interest rate changes on the earnings of certain companies in which the Group invests, and the impact on valuations that use interest rates as an input, such as valuation models for unquoted investments.
Therefore, the sensitivity analysis may not reflect the full effect on the Groups net assets.
A 50 basis point decrease is assumed to produce an equal and opposite impact.
31 December 31 December 2013 2012 Impact on IS Impact on IS & net assets & net assets million million Total 0.4 0.4 d. Currency risk Consistent with its investment objective, the Group invests in financial instruments and transactions denominated in currencies other than Sterling.
As such, the Groups profits and net assets could be significantly affected by currency movements.
Management of currency risk The Group enters into forward currency contracts as a means of limiting or increasing its exposure to particular currencies.
These contracts are used for the purpose of hedging the existing currency exposure of elements of the Groups portfolio as a means of reducing risk or to enable increased exposure when this is deemed appropriate.
Part of the Companys currency exposure in respect of its US Dollar investments is also hedged by way of the Companys borrowings denominated in this currency.

Credit risk Counterparty credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument held by the Group will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Group which could result in a loss to the Group.
Management of credit risk This risk is not considered significant and is managed as follows: The vast majority of the Groups transactions are settled on a delivery versus payment basis Use of a large number of brokers Liquid investments cash and cash equivalents are divided between a number of different financial institutions The majority of the portfolio investments exposed to credit risk relate to highly rated government securities A credit exposure could arise in respect of derivative contracts entered into by the Group if a counterparty was unable to fulfil its contractual obligations.
The Group has exposure to certain debt instruments acquired as part of its private equity transactions.
The credit risk associated with these instruments is managed as part of the overall investment risk in the relevant portfolio companies and is not considered separately.

Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will have difficulty in meeting its obligations in respect of financial liabilities as they fall due.
The Group has significant investments in and commitments to unquoted companies and unquoted funds which are inherently illiquid.
In addition the Group holds investments with other third party organisations which may require notice periods in order to be realised.
Management of liquidity risk The Group manages its liquid resources to ensure sufficient cash is available to meet all of its contractual commitments.
It monitors the level of short-term funding and balances the need for access to short-term funding with the long-term funding needs of the Group.
Exposure to liquidity risk Liquidity risk is not viewed as significant as a substantial proportion of the Groups net assets are in liquid or readily realisable assets, which could be utilised to meet funding requirements if necessary.
The Company has the power, under its Articles of Association, to take out both short and long-term borrowings.
The Group has two revolving credit facilities totalling 400 million details of which are disclosed in note 18.
The remaining contractual maturities of the Groups financial liabilities at the year-end, based on the earliest date on which payment could be required are as follows: 31 December 2013 31 December 2012 3 months 3-12 3 months 3-12 or less months 1 year Total or less months 1 year Total million million million million million million million million Current liabilities: Bank loan overdraft 197.4 197.4 147.8 147.8 Derivatives 5.8 5.8 16.8 3.4 20.2 Other liabilities 7.0 7.0 11.8 11.8 Total 210.2 210.2 176.4 3.4 179.8 Commitments 89.3 89.3 153.9 153.9 Total 299.5 299.5 330.3 3.4 333.7 28.3 Collateral Collateral is posted by the Group in relation to derivative transactions.

Financial Instruments continued 28.4 Derivative financial instruments The Group typically uses the following types of derivative instruments in the portfolio: Futures and forward contracts relating to foreign currencies, market indices and bonds Options relating to foreign currencies, market indices, equities and interest rates Swaps relating to interest rates, credit spreads and equity indices As explained above, the Group uses derivatives to hedge various exposures and also selectively to increase or decrease exposure where desired.
The notional amount of certain types of financial instruments provides a basis for comparison with instruments recognised on the balance sheet but does not necessarily indicate the amount of future cash flows involved or the current fair value of the derivatives.
The derivative instruments become favourable assets or unfavourable liabilities as a result of fluctuations in market interest rates, indices, security prices or foreign exchange rates relative to the terms of the derivative instrument.
The aggregate contractual or notional amount of derivative financial instruments held, the extent to which instruments are favourable or unfavourable and thus the aggregate fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly from time to time.

RIT Capital Partners plc Report and Accounts December 2013 91 Notes to the Financial Statements 28.
Financial Instruments continued During the year there were no transfers of investments between fair value hierarchies and no financial assets or liabilities were reclassified as a result of any change in their purpose or use.
The Groups policy is to recognise transfers into and transfers out of fair value hierarchy levels at the end of the reporting period when they are deemed to occur.
A description of the valuation techniques used by the Group with regards to investments categorised in each level of the fair value hierarchy is detailed below.
Level 1 The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price or the last traded price depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted.
Where a market price is available but the market is not considered active, the Group has classified these investments as level 2.
Level 2 The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data where it is available.
Specific valuation techniques used to value derivatives include quoted market prices for similar instruments, counterparty quotes and the use of forward exchange rates to estimate the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts at the balance sheet date.
Investments in externally managed funds are valued at the price or net asset value released by the investment manager fund administrator as at the balance sheet date.
Level 3 The Group considers all private investments, direct and funds, as described on page 17 of the Investment & Business Review as level 3 assets, as the valuations of these assets are not based on observable market data.
Where other funds invest into illiquid stocks, these are also considered by the Group to be level 3 assets.
For the private fund investments, fair value is deemed to be the capital statement account balance as reported by the General Partner of the investee fund which represents RITs pro-rata proportion of the funds net asset value.
A review is conducted annually over the valuation basis of the investee funds to confirm these are valued in accordance with fair value methodologies.
The directly held private investments are valued on a semi-annual basis using techniques including a market approach, cost approach or income approach.
The valuation process is collaborative involving the finance and investment functions with the final valuations being reviewed by the Valuation Committee.
The specific techniques used will typically include earnings multiples, discounted cash flow analysis, the value of recent share transactions and where appropriate industry rules of thumb.
The valuations will often reflect a synthesis of a number of distinct approaches in determining the final fair value estimate.
The individual approach for each investment will vary depending on relevant factors that a market participant would take into account in pricing the asset.
These might include the specific industry dynamics, the companys stage of development, profitability, growth prospects or risk as well as the rights associated with the particular security.
On a semi-annual basis, the Group engages external, independent and qualified valuers to determine the fair value of the Groups investment properties.
Further information in relation to the directly held private investment portfolio at 31 December 2013 is set out below: Fair Value Sector million Valuation Methods Inputs Financials 54 Revenue multiple 1.1x : Book value multiples 0.7x - 0.8x : DCF 5% - 20% cost of capital : P E 17x - 22x : EV EBITDA 5x TMT 25 DCF 16% -17% cost of capital : EV EBITDA 7x - 20x Consumer Staples Industrial 14 EV EBITDA 5x - 8x : P E 9x Total 93 The remainder of the direct portfolio was valued using the following primary methods: price of a recent financing round 72 million, cost of a recent investment 77 million and third party valuations 21 million.
Given the range of techniques and inputs used in the valuation process, and the fact that in most cases more than one approach is used, a sensitivity analysis is not considered to be a practical or meaningful disclosure.
Shareholders should note however that increases or decreases in any of the inputs listed above in isolation may result in higher or lower fair value measurements.

Financial Instruments continued 28.6 Capital management The Groups primary objectives in relation to the management of capital are: to ensure its ability to continue as a going concern to maximise the long-term capital growth for its shareholders through an appropriate balance of equity capital and gearing The Company is subject to externally imposed capital requirements: the Companys Articles of Association restrict borrowings to a maximum of five times share capital and reserves The Companys borrowings are subject to covenants limiting the total exposure based on a cap of borrowings as a percentage of adjusted net asset value All these conditions were met during this year and the previous financial period.
In addition, JRCM is subject to capital requirements imposed by the FCA and that subsidiary must ensure that it has sufficient capital to meet the requirements as set out by the FCA.
JRCM was in compliance with those capital requirements throughout the year.
The Groups capital at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 comprised: 31 December 31 December 2013 2012 million million Equity share capital 155.4 155.4 Retained earnings and other reserves 1,990.6 1,691.8 Net asset value 2,146.0 1,847.2 Bank loans 197.4 147.8 Total capital 2,343.4 1,995.0 Debt as a percentage of total capital 8.4% 7.4% There have been no significant changes to the Groups capital management objectives, policies and processes in the year, nor has there been any change in what the Group considers to be its capital.

Pension Commitments JRCM has pension commitments in respect of its participation in the RITCP Pension and Life Assurance Scheme the Scheme.
The Scheme consists of a defined benefit section which is closed to new members.
The assets of the Scheme are held in a separate Trustee-administered fund.
Under IAS 19, actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they occur.
The retirement benefit liability recognised in the balance sheet represents the fair value of the Schemes assets as reduced by the present value of the defined benefit obligation DBO.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method.
It is estimated that the contributions payable to the Scheme during the year ending 31 December 2014, will be 1.1 million as compared to 1.1 million paid during the year ended 31 December 2013.
The Scheme is administered under a Trust Deed and Rules.
The Trustees are responsible for agreeing a funding plan with JRCM such that any deficit in the scheme is expected to be eliminated and for agreeing a Statement of Investment Principles that the Scheme adopts in order to achieve its aim of providing retirement benefits.
The Trustees have delegated the day-to-day investment management responsibility to GAM and administration of the Scheme to JRCM.
Two of the five Trustees are independent of the Group.
Description of Scheme Characteristics and Associated Risks The Scheme operates as a defined benefit scheme in the UK.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out at 1 January 2011 by a qualified independent actuary, and this was updated to 31 December 2013 for the purposes of these disclosures.
This is a closed Scheme though open to future accrual and so the age profile of the active membership is rising significantly.
Therefore, under the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as a percentage of salary as the members of the Scheme are set out below: Asset volatility: The Schemes liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields.
If the Schemes assets underperform this yield, this may lead to a worsening of the funding position of the Scheme.
The Scheme holds a significant proportion of equities which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the longterm but give exposure to volatility and risk in the short-term.
Changes in bond yields: A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the Schemes liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Schemes bond holdings.
Life expectancy and concentration risk: The majority of the Schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the members, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the Schemes liabilities, and furthermore, inflationary increases result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.
There is the risk that the members live longer than implied by current assumptions used.
In particular, the majority of the Schemes liabilities are held by a small number of members, and if these members live longer than assumed this could put a strain on the funding of the Scheme.
Currently the Scheme has no asset-liability matching strategies in place.
As a result of the most recent actuarial valuation performed as at 1 January 2011, the sponsoring employer, JRCM, has agreed to pay contributions to the Scheme of 1,095,000 per annum for five years from 1 April 2012.
The next actuarial valuation will be as at 1 January 2014.
Benefits paid to members of the defined benefit scheme upon retirement will depend upon that members final salary upon retirement or date of leaving the scheme, if earlier, and the length of service.
Pensions in retirement increase at 4% per annum for the element earned before 6 April 1997 and at a minimum of 4% per annum and a maximum of 5% per annum for elements earned after 6 April 1997 depending upon the annual increase in the Retail Prices Index.
The costs associated with the Scheme, their recognition in the financial statements and the assumptions underlying the calculation of those costs are set out below.
