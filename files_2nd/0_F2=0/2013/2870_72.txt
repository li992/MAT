The non-significant CGUs included within the balance do not individually exceed 5% of the Groups total goodwill balance.
The number of CGUs identified for 2013 has increased due to acquisitions.
The recoverable amount of the CGUs is based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections based on the latest 1-year budget forecast approved by senior management, extrapolated for 4 future years at a growth rate applicable to each unit: an appropriate terminal value is then added.
Pre-tax discount rates, derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital are then applied to these projections.
