124 IMI plc SECTION 4 CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING COSTS Continued 4.5 Retirement benefits IMI offers a number of defined benefit arrangements to employees that will not be paid until more than a year after the period in which they are earned, for example pension benefits, jubilee plans, post-employment and other long-term employee benefit arrangements.
There is a significant degree of estimation involved in predicting the ultimate benefits payable under these defined benefit arrangements in respect of which the Group holds significant net liabilities on its balance sheet.
This section explains how the value of these benefits payable and any assets funding the arrangements are accounted for in the Group Financial Statements and gives details of the key assumptions upon which the estimations are based.
The accounting standard governing this area IAS19 was recently revised and 2013 is the first year for which the revised standard applies to the Group and comparative figures for 2012 have been restated.
The only significant accounting change for the Group is that the interest income relating to defined benefit plan assets, previously calculated based on the directors estimate of expected returns, is now calculated based on the discount rate used to calculate the present value of liabilities.
This discount rate is determined with reference to the high quality corporate bonds relevant to the schemes locations and durations.
This change results in a lower total return on assets in the Income Statement than was previously the case.
Assets and liabilities for defined contribution arrangements are minimal as they relate solely to short-term timing differences between the period during which benefits have accrued and when contributions are paid into schemes.
The final part of this section includes a number of definitions to aid understanding.
1 Summary information Net pension deficit: 157.9m 2012: 232.2m The net pension deficit or net liability for defined benefit obligations DBO at 31 December 2013 was 157.9m 2012: 232.2m.
A further 0.8m 2012: nil is recognised in liabilities held for sale.
The assets and liabilities of the schemes are aggregated, recognised in the consolidated balance sheet and shown within non-current liabilities or in current assets if a scheme is in surplus and is recoverable.
In our financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012, we referred to enquiries made by the conduct division of the Financial Reporting Council into the accounting treatment of the IMI Pension Funds investment in the IMI Scottish Limited Partnership.
These enquiries were closed in early 2014, with no prior year adjustments made to reported amounts.
Number of Defined Benefit arrangements: 74 2012: 79 Five defined benefit arrangements were closed during the year and a further ten schemes were divested on 1 January 2014, as part of the disposal of the Retail Dispense businesses.
The Group provides pension benefits through a mixture of funded and unfunded defined benefit and defined contribution DC arrangements, although its strategy is to move away from defined benefit arrangements towards defined contribution arrangements wherever possible to minimise the liability of the Group.
Assessments of the obligations of the defined benefit plans are carried out by independent actuaries, based on the projected unit credit method.

3.2 Other Comprehensive Income Movements in pension assets and liabilities that arise during the year from changes in actuarial assumptions, or because actual experience is different from the underlying actuarial assumptions, are recognised in equity via Other Comprehensive Income.

These assumptions include the discount rate applied to the assets and liabilities, the life expectancy of the members, their expected salary & pension increases and inflation.
The assumptions used for this purpose in these financial statements are summarised below: Weighted Averages 31 Dec 13 31 Dec 12 31 Dec 11 UK Overseas UK Overseas UK Overseas % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa Inflation - RPI 3.5 n a 3.0 n a 3.1 n a Inflation - CPI 2.5 1.8 2.0 1.9 2.1 1.9 Discount Rate 4.45 3.3 4.25 2.8 4.8 3.7 Expected salary increases n a 2.3 n a 2.8 n a 2.8 Rate of pension increases 3.5 0.5 3.0 0.5 3.1 0.5 2013 Years 2012 Years 2011 Years Life expectancy IMI Pension Fund only Current male pensioners 21.2 21.0 20.9 Current female pensioners 24.0 23.9 23.8 Future male pensioners 23.0 22.8 22.7 Future female pensioners 26.0 25.9 25.8 The mortality assumptions used for the IMI Pension Fund in the UK the Fund above reflect its experience, together with an allowance for improvements over time.
The experience was reviewed as part of the formal triennial actuarial valuation carried out as at 31 March 2011, and the assumptions used as at 31 December 2013 and 2012 reflect the results of this review.
The allowance for future improvements in mortality rates from 2011 is in line with the CMIs a research body funded by the actuarial profession to collect and analyse UK mortality rates 2010 Core Projection model, with a long-term improvement rate of 1.25% pa.
The tables below illustrate how the UK and overseas net pension deficit would increase, as at 31 December 2013, in the event of the following changes in key assumptions above.
The most important assumptions that impact the net deficits are the discount rates used to present the value of the future liabilities: longevity and inflation or salary increases.
The tables above demonstrate how these key assumptions have moved over the recent years and the table below demonstrates discrete movements in each of these assumptions that impact on the net deficit.

3.3 Income Statement In accordance with IAS19, pension costs recorded through the income statement primarily represent the increase in the defined benefit obligation based on employee service during the year and the interest on the net liability for defined benefit obligations in respect of employee service in previous years.

The net past service credit of 12.2m in the prior year comprised: A 9.0m past service credit arising on a pension increase exchange exercise relating to the UK pension scheme.
A 3.2m past service credit in two of our Swiss schemes, resulting from a change in these schemes rules during the year.
The Income Statement charges and credits in the above table are presented on a total Group basis i. e. including both continuing and discontinued operations.
The charges relating to discontinued operations contributed 0.4m 2012: 0.4m to the current service cost, 2.1m 2012: 1.6m to the DC employer contributions and 0.4m 2012: 0.4m to the net finance expense but had no impact on any other lines.

The discount rate used in calculating the present value is the yield on high quality corporate bonds relevant to the particular plans geography and duration.
