Significant restrictions In certain jurisdictions the ability of subsidiaries to transfer funds to the Group in the form of cash dividends or to repay loans and advances is subject to local corporate or insurance laws and regulations and solvency requirements.
We do not believe that these requirements constitute a material limitation on the ability of the subsidiaries to transfer funds to the Group.
There are no protective rights of non-controlling interests which significantly restrict the Groups ability to access or use the assets and settle the liabilities of the Group.

9 Long-term business economic volatility The long-term nature of much of the Groups operations means that, for managements decision-making and internal performance management, the effects of short-term economic volatility are treated as non-operating items.
The Group focuses instead on an operating profit measure that incorporates an expected return on investments supporting its long-term business, as described below.
a Definitions Operating profit for long-term business is based on expected investment returns on financial investments backing shareholder and policyholder funds over the reporting period, with consistent allowance for the corresponding expected movements in liabilities.
Operating profit includes the effect of variance in experience for non-economic items, such as mortality, persistency and expenses, and the effect of changes in non-economic assumptions, where not treated as exceptional.
Changes due to economic items, such as market value movements and interest rate changes, which give rise to variances between actual and expected investment returns, and the impact of changes in economic assumptions on liabilities, are disclosed separately outside operating profit.
b Economic volatility The investment variances and economic assumption changes excluded from the long-term business operating profit are as follows: 2013 2012 Long-term business m m Investment variances and economic assumptions continuing operations 49 620 Investment variances and economic assumptions discontinued operations 452 342 Investment variances and economic assumptions 403 278 For continuing operations, investment variances were 49 million negative 2012: 620 million negative.
Negative variances in the UK resulting from increasing the allowance for credit defaults on commercial mortgages were partially offset by the positive effect of narrowing spreads on government and corporate bonds in Italy and Spain together with reduction in cost of guarantees in France.
In 2012, for continuing operations, negative investment variances of 620 million mainly related to the UK.
The total for the UK included increasing the allowance for credit risk defaults on UK commercial mortgages together with some adverse experience on the portfolio and the cost of fide-risking activities.
Positive variances in Spain and France were offset by a negative variance in Italy.
The positive variance of 452 million 2012: 342 million for discontinued operations relates to the US business disposed of in 2013, driven by the impact of favourable equity market performance on embedded derivatives.
c Methodology The expected investment returns and corresponding expected movements in long-term business liabilities are calculated separately for each principal long-term business unit.
The expected return on investments for both policyholders and shareholders funds is based on opening economic assumptions applied to the expected funds under management over the reporting period.
Expected investment return assumptions are derived actively, based on market yields on risk-free fixed interest assets at the end of each financial year.
The same margins are applied on a consistent basis across the Group to gross risk-free yields, to obtain investment return assumptions for equities and properties.
Expected funds under management are equal to the opening value of funds under management, adjusted for sales and purchases during the period arising from expected operating experience.
The actual investment return is affected by differences between the actual and expected funds under management and changes in asset mix, as well as movements in interest rates.
To the extent that these differences arise from the operating experience of the long-term business, or management decisions to change asset mix, the effect is included in the operating profit.
The residual difference between actual and expected investment return is included in investment variances, outside operating profit but included in profit before tax.
Strategic report Governance IFRS Financial statements Other information 149 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 9 Long-term business economic volatility continued The movement in liabilities included in operating profit reflects both the change in liabilities due to the expected return on investments and the impact of experience variances and assumption changes for non-economic items.
The effect of differences between actual and expected economic experience on liabilities, and changes to economic assumptions used to value liabilities, are taken outside operating profit.
For many types of long-term business, including unit-linked and with-profits funds, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit.
For other long-term business the profit impact of economic volatility depends on the degree of matching of assets and liabilities, and exposure to financial options and guarantees.
d Assumptions The expected rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard to local economic and market forecasts of investment return and asset classification under IFRS.
The principal assumptions underlying the calculation of the expected investment return for equities and properties are: Equities Properties 2013 2012 2013 2012 % % % % United Kingdom 5.4 5.8 3.9 4.3 Eurozone 5.1 5.9 3.6 4.4 The expected return on equities and properties is calculated by reference to the opening 10-year swap rate in the relevant currency plus an appropriate risk margin.
These are the same assumptions as are used under MCEV principles to calculate the longer-term investment return for the Groups long-term business.
For fixed interest securities classified as fair value through profit or loss, the expected investment returns are based on average prospective yields for the actual assets held less an adjustment for credit risks: this includes an adjustment for credit risk on all Eurozone sovereign debt.
Where such securities are classified as available for sale AFS, the expected investment return comprises the expected interest or dividend payments and amortisation of the premium or discount at purchase.
10 Longer-term investment return and economic assumption changes for non-long-term business For non-long-term business, the total investment income, including realised and unrealised gains, is split between a calculated longer-term return, which is included in operating profit, and short-term fluctuations from this, which are disclosed outside operating profit but are included in profit before tax.
This note gives details of the longer-term return calculation and the relevant assumptions, as well as the economic assumption changes on our general insurance and health business.
a The short-term fluctuations in investment return and economic assumption changes attributable to the non-long-term business result and reported outside operating profit were as follows: 2013 2012 Non-long-term business m m Short-term fluctuations in investment return see b below continuing operations 336 7 Economic assumption changes continuing operations see g below 33 21 303 14 Short-term fluctuation in investment return discontinued operations 303 14 b The longer-term investment return and short-term fluctuation for continuing operations are as follows: 2013 2012 Non-long-term business Continuing operations m m Analysis of investment income: Net investment income 266 827 Foreign exchange on unrealised gains losses and other charges 35 97 231 730 Analysed between: Longer-term investment return, reported within operating profit 567 723 Short-term fluctuation in investment return, reported outside operating profit General insurance and health 243 18 1 Other operations 93 11 336 7 231 730 1 For 2013 represents short term fluctuations on assets backing non-life business in the France holding company and Group centre investments, including the centre hedging programme.
For 2012 represents short term fluctuations on assets backing non-life business in the France holding company.
c The longer-term investment return is calculated separately for each principal non-long-term business unit.
In respect of equities and properties, the return is calculated by multiplying the opening market value of the investments, adjusted for sales and purchases during the year, by the longer-term rate of investment return.
150 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 10 Longer-term investment return and economic assumption changes for non-long-term business continued The longer-term rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard to local economic and market forecasts of investment return.
The allocated longer-term return for other investments is the actual income receivable for the year.
Actual income and longer-term investment return both contain the amortisation of the discounts premium arising on the acquisition of fixed income securities.
For other operations, the longer-term return reflects assets backing non-longterm business held in the France holding company and Group centre investments, including the centre hedging programme.
Market value movements which give rise to variances between actual and longer-term investment returns are disclosed separately in short term fluctuations outside operating profit.
The adverse movement in short term fluctuations during 2013 compared with 2012 is mainly due to an increase in risk free rates reducing fixed income security market values and other market movements impacting Group centre investments and the centre hedging programme.
d The total assets supporting the general insurance and health business, which contribute towards the longer-term return, are: 2013 2012 m m Debt securities 10,105 9,297 Equity securities 339 774 Properties 140 139 Cash and cash equivalents 1,969 2,535 Other 5,410 5,997 Assets supporting general insurance and health business 17,963 18,742 1 Assets supporting other non-long-term business 695 206 Total assets supporting non-long-term business 18,658 18,948 1 For 2013 represents assets backing non-life business in the France holding company and Group centre investments, including the centre hedging programme.
For 2012 represents assets in France holding company backing non-longterm business.
The principal assumptions underlying the calculation of the longer-term investment return are: Longer-term rates Longer-term rates of return of return Equities Properties 2013 2012 2013 2012 % % % % United Kingdom 5.4 5.8 3.9 4.3 Eurozone 5.1 5.9 3.6 4.4 Canada 5.8 5.8 4.3 4.3 To calculate the longer-term investment return for its non-long-term business in 2012 and 2013, the Group has applied the same economic assumptions for equities and properties as are used under MCEV principles.
e The table below compares the actual return on investments attributable to the non-long-term business, after deducting investment management expenses and charges, with the aggregate longer-term return over a five-year period.
2009-2013 2008-2012 Continuing operations m m Actual return attributable to shareholders 2,902 3,095 Longer-term return credited to operating results 3,578 3,902 Excess of longer-term returns over actual returns 676 807 f The table below shows the sensitivity of the Groups non-long-term business operating profit for continuing operations before tax to changes in the longer-term rates of return: 2013 2012 Continuing operations Movement in investment return for By Change in m m Equities 1% higher lower Group operating profit before tax 8 6 Properties 1% higher lower Group operating profit before tax 1 2 g The economic assumption changes mainly arise from movements in the rate used to discount latent claims.
As explained in accounting policy L, provisions for latent claims are discounted, using rates based on the relevant swap curve, in the relevant currency at the reporting date, having regard to the duration of the expected settlement of the claims.
The discount rate is set at the start of the accounting period, with any change in rates between the start and end of the accounting period being reflected below operating profit as an economic assumption change.
The range of discount rates used is disclosed in note 41c.

The tax charge attributable to policyholders' returns is removed from the Groups total profit loss before tax in arriving at the Groups profit loss before tax attributable to shareholders' profits.
As the net of tax profits attributable to with-profit and unitlinked policyholders is zero, the Groups pre-tax profit attributable to policyholders is an amount equal and opposite to the tax charge attributable to policyholders included in the total tax charge.
The difference between the policyholder tax charge and the impact of this item in the tax reconciliation can be explained as follows: 2013 2012 m m Tax attributable to policyholder returns 191 221 UK corporation tax at a rate of 23.25% 2012: 24.5% in respect of the policyholder tax deduction 44 54 Different local basis of tax of overseas profits 3 Different basis of tax policyholders per tax reconciliation 147 170 The UK corporation tax rate reduced to 23% from 1 April 2013.
Legislation was substantively enacted in July 2013 to reduce the main rate of UK corporation tax to 21% from 1 April 2014, with a further reduction to 20% from 1 April 2015.
The 20% rate has been used in the calculation of the UKs deferred tax assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2013.

Goodwill relating to US Life was fully impaired in 2012.
Following the completion of the disposal, the gross amounts are removed from the above table in 2013 with no impact on the statement of financial position.
Goodwill on acquisitions and additions arose on the acquisition of a small general insurance business in Canada and a small wealth management business in Singapore.
Goodwill impairment charges of 48 million have been recognised in income statement see b below.
Together with impairment charges of 29 million recognised in respect of goodwill within interests in associates note 20, the total charge for impairment of goodwill, joint ventures and associates for the year was 77 million.
Goodwill disposed of during the year relates to the Groups US Life business, Aseval, a Spanish long-term business, and the Russian long-term business see note 4 b.

The recoverable amount is the value in use of the cash generating unit unless otherwise stated.
158 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 17 Goodwill continued Long-term business Value in use is calculated as an actuarially determined appraisal value, based on the embedded value of the business calculated in accordance with market consistent embedded value MCEV principles, together with the present value of expected profits from future new business.
If the embedded value of the business tested is sufficient to demonstrate goodwill recoverability on its own, then it is not necessary to estimate the present value of expected profits from future new business.
If required, the present value of expected profits arising from future new business written over a given period is calculated on an MCEV basis, using profit projections based on the most recent three year business plans approved by management.
These plans reflect managements best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth rates for the relevant cash generating unit.
The underlying assumptions of these projections include market share, customer numbers, mortality, morbidity and persistency.
Future new business profits for the remainder of the given period beyond the initial three years are extrapolated using a steady growth rate.
Growth rates and expected future profits are set with regards to management estimates, past experience and relevant available market statistics.
Expected profits from future new business are discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate.
The discount rate is a combination of a risk-free rate and a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years for new business may differ from that assumed.
The recoverable amounts of businesses classified as held for sale was assessed based on the fair value less costs of disposal of the business, based on the expected net disposal proceeds of the businesses.

The calculation uses cash flow projections based on business plans approved by management covering a three-year period.
The underlying assumptions of these projections include market share, customer numbers, premium rate and fee income changes, claims inflation and commission rates.
Cash flows beyond that three-year period are extrapolated using a steady growth rate.
Growth rates and expected future profits are set with regards to past experience and relevant available market statistics.

The fair value less costs to sell was determined based on the quoted market value of Avivas share of the subsidiary to which it relates.
Results of impairment testing The goodwill associated with the Spanish long-term cash generating unit was reviewed in the first half of the year due to the continued volatility in the Spanish economy, in accordance with accounting policy O.
As a result, management concluded that the goodwill was no longer fully recoverable.
An impairment of 18 million was recognised in the first half of the year reducing the carrying value of this cash generating unit to its recoverable amount reflecting a reduction to managements estimates due to prevailing economic circumstances.
Subsequently, management reviewed the goodwill at 31 December 2013 and concluded that no further impairment was required as the recoverable amount exceeded the carrying amount.
Similarly, as a result testing of the Italian long-term and general insurance cash generating unit, impairments of 21 million and 9 million respectively have been recognised.
Other than the CGUs noted above, the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value of the cash generating units including goodwill.

v The joint ventures have no significant contingent liabilities to which the Group is exposed.
The Group has commitments to provide funding to property management joint ventures of 140 million 2012: 41 million.
In certain jurisdictions the ability of joint ventures to transfer funds in the form of cash dividends or to repay loans and advances made by the Group is subject to local corporate or insurance laws and regulations and solvency requirements.
We do not believe that these requirements constitute a material limitation on the ability of the joint ventures to transfer funds to the Group.
b Impairment testing Joint ventures are tested for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill relates to the recoverable value of that cash generating unit.
The recoverable amount of long-term business undertakings is the value in use of the joint venture.
This is calculated according to the methodology for the calculation of the value in use of long-term business cash generating units for the impairment testing of goodwill, as set out in note 17 b.
The recoverable amount for joint ventures in Korea and Taiwan classified as operations held for sale Woori Aviva Life Insurance Co. Ltd and First-Aviva Life Insurance Co. Ltd. is the fair value less costs to sell for each entity, based on the expected net disposal proceeds.
The recoverable amount of property management undertakings is the fair value less costs to sell of the joint venture, measured in accordance with the Groups accounting policy for Investment Property accounting policy Q.
Following impairment testing for the remaining joint ventures, the goodwill amounts within the joint ventures are fully recoverable.

Fair value losses on owner-occupied properties of 2 million 2012: 3 million losses have been taken to other comprehensive income.
Owner-occupied properties are stated at their revalued amounts, as assessed by qualified external valuers.
These values are assessed in accordance with the relevant parts of the current RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards in the UK, and with current local valuation practices in other countries.
This assessment is in accordance with UK Valuations Standards Red book, and is the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms-length transaction, after proper marketing wherein the parties had acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion, on the basis of the highest and best use of asset that is physically possible, legally permissible and financially feasible.
The valuation assessment is in line with guidance from the International Valuation Standards Committee and the requirements of IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment.
Similar considerations apply to properties under construction, where an estimate is made of valuation when complete, adjusted for anticipated costs to completion, profit and risk, reflecting market conditions at the valuation date.
In 2012, the 106 million impairment loss charged to the income statement mainly related to Aviva USAs property and equipment, the carrying value of which was reduced to nil.
If owner-occupied properties were stated on a historical cost basis, the carrying amount would be 255 million 2012: 275 million.
The Group has no material finance leases for property and equipment.

2 Disposals include investment property sold as part of the disposal of the US Life business in 2013.
The majority of investment property in the UK is valued at least annually by external chartered surveyors in accordance with the guidance issued by The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors or using internal valuations and estimates during the intervening period.
For other investment property, valuations are produced by local qualified staff of the Group or external qualified professional valuers in the countries concerned.
In the event of a material change in market conditions between the valuation date and balance sheet date, adjustments are made to reflect any material changes in fair value.
Values are calculated using a discounted cash flow approach and are based on current rental income plus anticipated uplifts at the next rent review, lease expiry, or break option taking into consideration lease incentives and assuming no further growth in the estimated rental value of the property.
This uplift and the discount rate are derived from rates implied by recent market transactions on similar properties where available.
The fair value of investment properties leased to third parties under operating leases at 31 December 2013 was 9,447 million 2012: 10,822 million.
Future contractual aggregate minimum lease rentals receivable under the non-cancellable portion of these leases are given in note 54 b i.
23 Fair value methodology This note explains the methodology for valuing our assets and liabilities measured at fair value, and for fair value disclosures.
It also provides an analysis of these according to a fair value hierarchy, determined by the market observability of valuation inputs.
a Basis for determining fair value hierarchy All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 Inputs to Level 1 fair values are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 Inputs to Level 2 fair values are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
If the asset or liability has a specified contractual term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the instrument.
Level 2 inputs include the following: Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets.
Quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which little information is released publicly.
Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability for example, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, implied volatilities, and credit spreads.
Where we use broker quotes and no information as to the observability of inputs is provided by the broker, the investments are classified as follows: Where the broker price is validated by using internal models with market observable inputs and the values are similar, we classify the investment as Level 2.
In circumstances where internal models are not used to validate broker prices, or the observability of inputs used by brokers is unavailable, the investment is classified as Level 3.
Level 3 Inputs to Level 3 fair values are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
Unobservable inputs may have been used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.
However, the fair value measurement objective remains the same, i. e. an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability.
Therefore, unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions the business unit considers that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
Examples are investment properties, certain private equity investments and private placements.
Strategic report Governance IFRS Financial statements Other information 165 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 23 Fair value methodology continued The majority of the Groups assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on quoted market information or observable market data.
16.6% of assets and 0.9% of liabilities measured at fair value are based on estimates and recorded as Level 3.
Where estimates are used, these are based on a combination of independent third-party evidence and internally developed models, calibrated to market observable data where possible.
Third-party valuations using significant unobservable inputs validated against Level 2 internally modelled valuations are classified as Level 3, where there is a significant difference between the third-party price and the internally modelled value.
Where the difference is insignificant, the instrument would be classified as Level 2. b Changes to valuation techniques: There were no changes in the valuation techniques during the year compared to those described in the 2012 annual consolidated financial statements, other than those noted below.
c Comparison of the carrying amount and fair values of financial instruments Set out below is a comparison of the carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments, excluding assets classified as held for sale.
These amounts may differ where the asset or liability is carried on a measurement basis other than fair value, e. g. amortised cost.

Fixed income assets, in line with market practice, are generally valued using an independent pricing service.
These valuations are determined using independent external quotations from multiple sources and are subject to a number of monitoring controls, such as monthly price variances, stale price reviews and variance analysis.
Pricing services, where available, are used to obtain the third-party broker quotes.
Where pricing services providers are used, a single valuation is obtained and applied.
When prices are not available from pricing services, quotes are sourced from brokers.
Other level 2 investments, including Unit Trusts, are valued using net assets values which are deemed to be observable market inputs.
e Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy For recurring fair value measurements, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between the levels of the fair value hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of the year.
Level 1 to 2 For the year to 31 December 2013, transfers of financial assets from fair value hierarchy Level 1 to Level 2 amounted to 29.4 billion 2012: 1.3 billion.
The transfers from Level 1 to Level 2 arose primarily in the UK and Ireland 26.9 billion as a result of the enhanced understanding of pricing vendor methodologies for the fair value hierarchy level classification of certain debt securities.
Other transfers from level 1 to 2 arose mainly from changes in the level of market activity for specific assets in Asia 1.2 billion and Europe 1.3 billion.
Level 2 to 1 Transfers from Level 2 to Level 1 of 1.1 billion 2012: 0.3 billion arose in France 0.5 billion, Ireland 0.4 billion, and Spain 0.2 billion and were due to improvements in pricing sourcing or increasing liquidity of underlying investments.
Strategic report Governance IFRS Financial statements Other information 167 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 23 Fair value methodology continued Transfer to from Level 3 Transfers out of Level 3 mainly relate to improvements in the market liquidity of certain debt securities held by our business in France 1.9 billion, which were transferred to Level 2, as observable prices became available.
The transfers into Level 3 shown below primarily relate to UK mortgage loans 14.6 billion and investment property 9.5 billion as follows: 9.9 billion of UK commercial mortgage loans.
Following a reassessment of inputs management has deemed the illiquidity premium used to value these mortgage loans to be a significant, unobservable input.
2.6 billion of UK equity release mortgage loans.
During 2013, the discounted cash flow model used to value certain equity release mortgage loans has been revised, incorporating a greater number of inputs relevant to calculating a fair value of these mortgages.
Within this model, credit risk assumptions are derived from market data with adjustments applied to ensure they are relevant to the mortgage portfolio, but these are not fully market observable.
As a result, these assets have been classified as Level 3 and transferred from Level 2.
2.1 billion of UK securitised mortgage loans and certain non-securitised equity release mortgage loans.
Market transactions used in the valuation of these loans are infrequent and, as a result, prices are no longer classified as market observable.
In the absence of any additional market transactions the mortgage loans have been reclassified from Level 2 to Level 3.
Following the adoption of IFRS 13, investment property is now included within the fair value hierarchy.
Due to the irregularity of similar transactions, management has concluded that significant inputs into the valuation methodology are non-market observable, and classified investment property within Level 3.
We have also transferred 0.5 billion of property funds into Level 3 to reflect the valuation of underlying property assets.
Also included within transfers into Level 3 loans are 0.8 billion of non-recourse loans held by the UK business that were reclassified from Level 2 to Level 3.
This was due to the enhancement of the valuation model to include an illiquidity premium which is deemed to be an unobservable input.
For the year to 31 December 2013, transfers of financial liabilities between fair value hierarchies included the reclassification of 0.5 billion 2012: nil of securitised mortgage loan notes from Level 2 to Level 3 in line with the reclassification of the related securitised mortgage loans referred to above.

Included in this balance are 73 million 2012: 1,030 million of net gains attributable to those assets and 13 million 2012: 3 million of losses attributable to those liabilities still held at the end of the year.
The principal investments classified as Level 3, and the valuation techniques applied to them, are: Commercial mortgage loans held by our UK Life business amounting to 9.9 billion, valued using a Portfolio Credit Risk Model PCRM.
This model calculates a Credit Risk Adjusted Value CRAV for each mortgage.
The risk adjusted cash flows are discounted using a yield curve, taking into account the term dependent gilt yield curve, and global assumption for the liquidity premium.
The mortgage loans have been classified as Level 3 as the liquidity premium is not deemed to be market observable.
Equity release and UK securitised mortgage loans held by our UK Life business amounting to 4.7 billion, valued using Discounted Cash Flow models DCF.
Cash flows are adjusted for credit risk and discounted using a yield curve and global assumptions for the liquidity premium.
The mortgage loans have been classified as Level 3 as assumptions used to derive the credit risk and property risk are not deemed to be market observable.
Investment property amounting to 9.5 billion.
In the UK, the majority of investment property is valued at least annually by external chartered surveyors in accordance with guidance issued by The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, and using estimates during the intervening period.
Fair values are determined using an income method, by which own lease agreement cash-flows are adjusted for anticipated uplifts, and discounted by rates implied by recent market transactions for similar properties where available.
These inputs are deemed unobservable.
Structured bond-type and non-standard debt products held by our business in France amounting to 7.1 billion 2012: 8.6 billion, for which there is no active market.
These bonds are valued either using counterparty or broker quotes.
These bonds are validated against internal or third-party models.
These bonds have been classified as Level 3 because either i the thirdparty models included a significant unobservable liquidity adjustment or ii differences between the valuation provided by the counterparty and broker quotes and the validation model were sufficiently significant to result in a Level 3 classification.
At 31 December 2013, the values reported in respect of these products were the lower of counterparty and broker quotes and internally modelled valuations.
Private equity investment funds amounting to 1.1 billion 2012: 1.3 billion, together with external hedge funds held principally by businesses in the UK and France amounting to 1.1 billion 2012: 1.3 billion, and property funds amounting to 0.5 billion are valued based on external reports received from the fund manager.
Where these valuations are at a date other than balance sheet date, as in the case of some private equity funds, we make adjustments for items such as subsequent draw-downs and distributions and the fund managers carried interest.
Level 3 investments including a collateralised loan obligation of 0.4 billion 2012: nil and UK non-recourse loans of 0.8 billion 2012: nil have been valued using internally developed discounted cash flow models.
Investments including debt securities held by our French business of 0.7 billion 2012: nil and notes issued by loan partnerships held by our UK Life business amounting to 0.3 billion 2012: 1.0 billion, have been valued using third party or counterparty valuations.
Other Level 3 investments amount to 1.1 billion 2012: 0.9 billion and relate to a diverse range of different types of securities held by a number of businesses throughout the Group.
Level 3 liabilities include 0.5 billion 2012: nil of securitised mortgage loan notes which are valued using a similar technique to the related Level 3 securitised mortgage assets.
Where possible, the Group tests the sensitivity of the fair values of Level 3 investments to changes in unobservable inputs to reasonable alternatives.
Where possible of valuations for Level 3 investments are sourced from independent third parties and, where appropriate, validated against internally-modelled valuations, third-party models or broker quotes.
Where third-party pricing sources are unwilling to provide a sensitivity analysis for their valuations, the Group undertakes, where feasible, sensitivity analysis on the following basis: For third-party valuations validated against internally-modelled valuations using significant unobservable inputs, the sensitivity of the internally modelled valuation to changes in unobservable inputs to a reasonable alternative is determined.
For third-party valuations either not validated or validated against a third-party model or broker quote, the third-party valuation in its entirety is considered an unobservable input.
Sensitivities are determined by flexing inputs of internal models to a reasonable alternative, including the yield, NAV multiple, IRR or other suitable valuation multiples of the financial instrument implied by the third-party valuation.
For example, for a fixed income security the implied yield would be the rate of return which discounts the securitys contractual cash flows to equal the third-party valuation.
On the basis of the methodology outlined above, the Group is able to perform sensitivity analysis for 35.7 billion of the Groups Level 3 investments.
For these Level 3 investments, changing unobservable valuation inputs to a reasonable alternative would result in a change in fair value by 1.8 billion.
Of the 1.5 billion Level 3 investments for which sensitivity analysis is not provided, 0.6 billion relates to investments held in unit-linked and participating funds in France where investment risk is predominantly borne by policyholders and therefore shareholder profit before tax is insensitive to reasonable change in fair value of these investments.
The remaining 0.9 billion of Level 3 investments are held predominantly to back non-linked shareholder business and it is estimated that a 10% change in valuation of these investments would increase or reduce shareholder profit before tax by 90 million.

The obligation to repay this collateral is included in payables and other financial liabilities note 51.
Of the above loans, 21,850 million 2012: 19,179 million are due to be recovered in more than one year after the statement of financial position date.
Loans at fair value Fair values have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using appropriate current interest rates for each portfolio of mortgages.
Further details of the fair value methodology are given in note 23.
The change in fair value of these loans during the year, attributable to a change in credit risk, was 43 million loss 2012: 491 million loss.
The cumulative change attributable to changes in credit risk to 31 December 2013 was 2,709 million loss 2012: 2,665 million loss.
Non-securitised mortgage loans include 4.1 billion 2012: 4.1 billion relating to UK primary healthcare and PFI businesses which are secured against General Practitioner premises, other primary health-related premises or other emergency services related premises.
For all such loans, government support is provided through either direct funding or reimbursement of rental payments to the tenants to meet income service and provide for the debt to be reduced substantially over the term of the loan.
Although the loan principal is not , the nature of these businesses and premises provides considerable comfort of an ongoing business model and low risk of default.
Loans at amortised cost The fair value of these loans at 31 December 2013 was 5,334 million 2012: 8,735 million.

This collateral generally takes the form of liens or charges over properties and, in the case of policy loans, the underlying policy for the majority of the loan balances above.
In all other situations, the collateral must be in a readily realisable form, such as listed securities, and is held in segregated accounts.
Transfer of title for the collateral received always occurs in such cases, although no market risk or benefit is taken.
In the event of a default, the Group is able to sell or repledge the collateral.
The amount of collateral received with respect to loans which the Group is permitted to sell or repledge in the absence of default was 5,513 million 2012: 4,560 million.
No collateral was actually sold or repledged in the absence of default during the year 2012: nil.
25 Securitised mortgages and related assets The Group, in its UK Life business has loans receivable, secured by mortgages, which have then been securitised through nonrecourse borrowings.
This note gives details of the relevant transactions.
a Description of current arrangements In a UK long-term business subsidiary, Aviva Equity Release UK Limited AER, the beneficial interest in certain portfolios of lifetime mortgages has been transferred to five special purpose securitisation companies the ERF companies, in return for initial consideration and, at later dates, deferred consideration.
The deferred consideration represents receipts accrued within the ERF companies after meeting all their obligations to the note holders, loan providers and other third parties in the priority of payments.
The purchases of the mortgages were funded by the issue of fixed and floating rate notes by the ERF companies.
All the shares in the ERF companies are held by independent companies, whose shares are held on trust.
Although AER does not own, directly or indirectly, any of the share capital of the ERF companies or their parent companies, it has control of the securitisation companies, and they have therefore been treated as subsidiaries in the consolidated financial statements.
AER has no right to repurchase the benefit of any of the securitised mortgage loans, other than in certain circumstances where AER is in breach of warranty or loans are substituted in order to effect a further advance.
AER has purchased subordinated notes and granted subordinated loans to some of the ERF companies.
In addition, Group companies have invested in loan notes issued by the ERF companies.
These have been eliminated on consolidation through offset against the borrowings of the ERF companies in the consolidated statement of financial position.
In all of the above transactions, the Company and its subsidiaries are not obliged to support any losses that may be suffered by the note holders and do not intend to provide such support.
Additionally, the notes were issued on the basis that note holders are only entitled to obtain payment, of both principal and interest, to the extent that the available resources of the respective special purpose securitisation companies, including funds due from customers in respect of the securitised loans, are sufficient and that note holders have no recourse whatsoever to other companies in the Aviva Group.

The Group has interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities as described below.
The Group holds redeemable shares or units in investment vehicles, which consist of: Debt securities which comprise securitisation vehicles that Aviva does not originate.
These securities consist of: Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities RMBS, Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities CMBS, Asset Backed Securities ABS, Asset Backed Commercial Papers ABCP and Wrapped credits securities.

Specialised investment vehicles which comprise Open Ended Investment Companies OEICs, Property Limited Partnerships PLPs, Specialised Open Investment Funds SOIFs, Socits d'Investissement Capital Variable SICAVs, Fonds Communs fide Placement FCPs and Special Purpose Vehicles SPVs.
The Groups holdings in investment vehicles are subject to the terms and conditions of the respective investment vehicles offering documentation and are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of those investment vehicles.
The investment manager makes investment decisions after extensive due diligence of the underlying investment vehicle including consideration of its strategy and the overall quality of the underlying investment vehicles manager.
All of the investment vehicles in the investment portfolio are managed by portfolio managers who are compensated by the respective investment vehicles for their services.
Such compensation generally consists of an asset-based fee and a performancebased incentive fee, and is reflected in the valuation of the investment vehicles.
a Interests in consolidated structured entities The Group has determined that where it has control over investment vehicles, these investments are consolidated structured entities.
As at 31 December 2013 the Group has granted loans to consolidated PLPs for a total of 371 million 2012: 351 million.
The purpose of these loans is to assist the consolidated PLPs to purchase or construct properties within the funds business activity.
The Group has also provided support, without having a contractual obligation to do so, to certain PLPs via letters of support amounting to 39 million 2012: 34 million in relation to loans to consolidated PLPs.
The Group has also given support to the consolidated structured entity Aviva Equity Release UK Limited AER.
As reported in note 25, at the inception of the securitisation vehicle, the UK subsidiary, Aviva Equity Release UK Limited AER, has granted subordinated loan facilities to some of the ERF companies.
AER receives various fees in return for the services provided to the entities.
For the administration of the loan note liabilities Aviva receives cash management fees based on the outstanding loan balance at the start of each quarter.
As compensation for managing the mortgage assets, AER receives portfolio administration fees.
As at the reporting date, the Group has no intentions to provide financial or other support in relation to any other investment vehicles.
172 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 26 Interests in structured entities continued b Interests in unconsolidated structured entities As part of its investment activities, the Group invests in unconsolidated structured entities.
As at 31 December 2013, the Groups total interest in unconsolidated structured entities was 26,474 million on the Groups statement of financial position, which are classified as financial investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group does not sponsor any of the unconsolidated structured entities.

The Groups maximum exposure to loss to the interests presented above is the carrying amount of the Groups investments.
The majority of debt securities above are investment grade securities held by the UK business.
Based on the different structures of the securities, in some cases the Group may be required to absorb losses from an unconsolidated structured entity before other parties.
Those cases occur when and if Avivas interest is more subordinated with respect to other owners of the same security.
With regard to unconsolidated PLPs, the Group has provided a guarantee to a property management company to fund its future development.
The amount provided is 66 million and the intention is for the Group to provide an additional 10 million.
As at 31 December 2013, the Group has granted loans to PLPs classified as joint ventures and associates for a total of 29 million.
This amount has been provided for the purpose of short term liquidly funding.
For commitments to property management joint ventures, please refer to Note 19.
In relation to risk management, disclosures on debt securities and investment vehicles are given in note 58 b iii.
The Group has not provided any other financial or other support in addition to that described above as at the reporting date, and there are no intentions to provide support in relation to any other unconsolidated structured entities in the foreseeable future.
In relation to other guarantees and commitments that the Group usually provides in the course of its business, please refer to Note 53 f Contingent liabilities and other risk factors.
c Other interests in unconsolidated structured entities The Group receives management fees and other fees in respect of its asset management businesses.
The Group does not sponsor any of the funds or investment vehicles from which it receives fees.
Management fees received for investments that the Group manages but does not have a holding in also represent an interest in unconsolidated structured entities.
As these investments are not held by the Group, the investment risk is borne by the external investors and therefore the Groups maximum exposure to loss relates to future management fees.
The table below shows the assets under management of entities that the Group manages but does not have a holding in and the fees earned from those entities.

Strategic report Governance IFRS Financial statements Other information 175 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 27 Financial investments continued Non-cash collateral received The Group receives collateral in order to reduce the credit risk of these arrangements.
Collateral must be in a readily realisable form, such as listed securities, and is held in segregated accounts.
Transfer of title always occurs for collateral received, although no market risk or economic benefit is taken.
The level of collateral held is monitored regularly, with further collateral obtained where this is considered necessary to manage the Groups risk exposure.
In certain markets, the Group or the Groups appointed stock lending managers obtain legal ownership of the collateral received and can re-pledge it as collateral elsewhere or sell outright in the absence of default.
The carrying amount of financial assets received in this manner at 31 December 2013 was 16,914 million 2012: 16,943 million.
The value of collateral that was actually sold in the absence of default was nil 2012: nil.
Cash collateral received In addition to the above, the Group has received cash collateral under stock lending arrangements that has been recognised in the statement of financial position with a corresponding obligation for its return.
The latter balance is included in note 51. ii Other arrangements In carrying on its bulk purchase annuity business, the Groups UK Life operation is required to place certain investments in trust on behalf of the policyholders.

Deferred acquisition costs DAC on long-term business are generally recoverable in more than one year whereas such costs on general insurance and health business are generally recoverable within one year.
Of the above total, 1,285 million 2012: 1,351 million is expected to be recovered more than one year after the statement of financial position date.
For long-term business where amortisation of the DAC balance depends on projected profits, the amount expected to be recovered is estimated and actual experience will differ.
Surpluses in the staff pension schemes are recoverable more than one year after the statement of financial position date.

The balance of deferred acquisition costs for long-term business decreased by 1.6 billion in 2013, primarily reflecting the disposal of the US Life and Ark Life businesses.
Where amortisation of the DAC balance depends on projected profits, changes to economic conditions may lead to a movement in the DAC balance and a corresponding impact on profit.
It is estimated that the movement in the DAC balance would reduce profit by 2 million 2012: 30 million if market yields on fixed income investments were to increase by 1% and increase profit by 8 million 2012: 50 million if yields were to reduce by 1%.
The shadow adjustments relate to deferred acquisition costs on business in the US backed by investments classified as available for sale AFS.
As explained in accounting policies T and L, movements in unrealised gains and losses on the AFS investments and movements in the shadow adjustments are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.

182 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 32 Groups share plans continued i Share options The fair value of the options was estimated on the date of grant, based on the following weighted average assumptions: Weighted average assumption 2013 2012 Share price 408p 326p Exercise price 312p 266p Expected volatility 38% 41% Expected life 3.66 years 3.71 years Expected dividend yield 3.58% 7.98% Risk-free interest rate 0.92% 0.37% The expected volatility used was based on the historical volatility of the share price over a period equivalent to the expected life of the option prior to its date of grant.
The risk-free interest rate was based on the yields available on UK government bonds as at the date of grant.
The bonds chosen were those with a similar remaining term to the expected life of the options.
2,442,874 options granted after 7 November 2002 were exercised during the year 2012: 2,862,952. ii Share awards The fair value of the awards was estimated on the date of grant based on the following weighted average assumptions: Weighted average assumption 2013 2012 Share price 295.37p 331.54p 1 Expected volatility 35% 37% 1 Expected volatility of comparator companies share price 31% 38% 1 Correlation between Aviva and competitors share price 67% 63% Expected life 3.00 years 3.00 years 2 Expected dividend yield 1 Risk-free interest rate 0.29% 0.42% 1 For awards with market-based performance conditions.
2 The long term incentive plan awards granted in 2012 and 2013 include additional shares being provided to employees equal to dividend rights before vesting.
As a result, no dividend yield assumption is required for these awards.
The expected volatility used was based on the historical volatility of the share price over a period equivalent to the expected life of the share award prior to its date of grant.
The bonds chosen were those with a similar remaining term to the expected life of the share awards.
33 Shares held by employee trusts We satisfy awards and options granted under the Groups share plans primarily through shares purchased in the market and held by employee share trusts.

These shares were purchased in the market and are carried at cost.
The trustees have waived their rights to dividends on the shares held in the trusts.
34 Preference share capital This note gives details of Aviva plcs preference share capital.
The preference share capital of the Company at 31 December 2013 was: 2013 2012 m m Issued and paid up 100,000,000 8.375% cumulative irredeemable preference shares of 1 each 100 100 100,000,000 8.75% cumulative irredeemable preference shares of 1 each 100 100 200 200 Under its articles of association, the Company may issue and allot sterling new preference shares and euro new preference shares, which, if issued and allotted, would rank, as to payment of a dividend and capital, ahead of the Companys ordinary share capital but behind the cumulative irredeemable preference shares currently in issue.
The issued preference shares are non-voting except where their dividends are in arrears, on a winding up or where their rights are altered.
On a winding up, they carry a preferential right of return of capital ahead of the ordinary shares.
The Company does not have a contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets to the preference shareholders and therefore the directors may make dividend payments at their discretion.

36 Merger reserve This note describes the use of the merger reserve.
Prior to 1 January 2004, certain significant business combinations were accounted for using the pooling of interests method or merger accounting, which treats the merged groups as if they had been combined throughout the current and comparative accounting periods.
Merger accounting principles for these combinations gave rise to a merger reserve in the consolidated statement of financial position, being the difference between the nominal value of new shares issued by the Parent Company for the acquisition of the shares of the subsidiary and the subsidiarys own share capital and share premium account.
The merger reserve is also used where more than 90% of the shares in a subsidiary are acquired and the consideration includes the issue of new shares by the Company, thereby attracting merger relief under the Companies Act 1985 and, from 1 October 2009, the Companies Act 2006.
The balance on the reserve of 3,271 million 2012: 3,271 million has arisen through the mergers of Commercial Union, General Accident and Norwich Union companies, forming Aviva plc in 2000, together with the acquisition of RAC plc RAC in 2005.
Because RAC ownership was immediately transferred from Aviva plc to a subsidiary company, this reserve is unaffected by the disposal of RAC in 2011.

The shares issued in lieu of dividends in 2012 were in respect of the transfer to retained earnings from the ordinary dividend account, arising from the treatment of these shares explained in note 31 b.
The Groups regulated subsidiaries are required to hold sufficient capital to meet acceptable solvency levels based on applicable local regulations.
Their ability to transfer retained earnings to the UK parent companies is therefore restricted to the extent these earnings form part of local regulatory capital.

There were no dividends paid to the non-controlling interest of Eurovita during the year 2012: nil.
Although the Group holds only 39% of the voting rights of Eurovita, it controls the entity.
This is because Finoa S. r. l, a consolidated special purpose company of the Group which is controlled by Aviva Italia Holding S. p. A. owns 77.6% of Eurovita and has the ability to use its power over Eurovita to influence its returns.

To do this we need to separate out the change in provision for outstanding claims on long-term business which is not included in a separate movement table, and the unwind of discounting on GI reserves which is included within finance costs within the income statement.
For general insurance and health business, the change in the provision for unearned premiums is not included in the reconciliation below, as within the income statement, this is included within earned premiums.

Any surplus or deficit emerging in NWPSF that is not distributed as bonus will be transferred from this sub-fund to the Reattributed Inherited Estate External Support Account RIEESA see below.
Old With-Profits sub-fund OWPSF, With-Profits sub-fund WPSF and Provident Mutual sub-fund PMSF of UKLAP, where the with-profit policyholders are entitled to at least 90% of the distributed profits, the shareholders receiving the balance.
Non-profit funds of Aviva Annuity UK and UKLAP, where shareholders are entitled to 100% of the distributed profits.
Shareholder profits on unitised with-profit business written by WPSF and on stakeholder unitised with-profit business are derived from management fees and policy charges, and emerge in the non-profit funds.
The RIEESA of UKLAP, which is a non-profit fund where shareholders are entitled to 100% of the distributed profits, but these cannot be distributed until the lock-in criteria set by the Reattribution Scheme have been met.
RIEESA will be used to write non-profit business and also to provide capital support to NWPSF.
In France, where the majority of policyholders benefits are determined by investment performance, subject to certain guarantees, and shareholders profits are derived largely from management fees.
In addition, a substantial number of policies participate in investment returns, with the balance being attributable to shareholders.
In other operations in Europe and Asia, a range of long-term insurance and savings products are written.
ii Group practice The long-term business provision is calculated separately for each of the Groups life operations.
The provisions for overseas subsidiaries have generally been included on the basis of local regulatory requirements, modified where necessary to reflect the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Material judgment is required in calculating the provisions and is exercised particularly through the choice of assumptions where discretion is permitted.
In turn, the assumptions used depend on the circumstances prevailing in each of the life operations.
Provisions are most sensitive to assumptions regarding discount rates and mortality morbidity rates.
Where discount rate assumptions are based on current market yields on fixed interest securities, allowance is made for default risk implicit in the yields on the underlying assets.
Bonuses paid during the year are reflected in claims paid, whereas those allocated as part of the bonus declaration are included in the movements in the long-term business provision.
For UK with-profit life funds falling within the scope of the PRA realistic capital regime, and hence FRS 27, an amount may be recognised for the present value of future profits PVFP on non-participating business written in a with-profit fund where the determination of the realistic value of liabilities in that with-profit fund takes account, directly or indirectly, of this value.
For our UK with-profit funds, no adjustment for this value is made to the participating insurance and investment contract liabilities or the unallocated divisible surplus.
iii Methodology and assumptions There are two main methods of actuarial valuation of liabilities arising under long-term insurance contracts the net premium method and the gross premium method both of which involve the discounting of projected premiums and claims.
Under the net premium method, the premium taken into account in calculating the provision is determined actuarially, based on the valuation assumptions regarding discount rates, mortality and disability.
The difference between this premium and the actual premium payable provides a margin for expenses.
This method does not allow for voluntary early termination of the contract by the policyholder, and so no assumption is required for persistency.
The gross premium method uses the amount of contractual premiums payable and includes explicit assumptions for interest and discount rates, mortality and morbidity, persistency and future expenses.
These assumptions can vary by contract type and reflect current and expected future experience.
a UK With-profit business The valuation of with-profit business uses the methodology developed for the Realistic Balance Sheet, adjusted to remove the shareholders share of future bonuses.
The key elements of the Realistic Balance Sheet methodology are the with-profit benefit reserve WPBR and the present value of the expected cost of any payments in excess of the WPBR referred to as the cost of future policyrelated liabilities.
The realistic liability for any contract is equal to the sum of the WPBR and the cost of future policy-related liabilities.
The WPBR for an individual contract is generally calculated on a retrospective basis, and represents the accumulation of the premiums paid on the contract, allowing for investment return, taxation, expenses and any other charges levied on the contract.
For a small proportion of business, a prospective valuation approach is used, including allowance for anticipated future regular and final bonuses.
The items included in the cost of future policy-related liabilities include: Maturity Guarantees: Guarantees on surrender, including no-MVR Guarantees and Guarantees linked to inflation: Guaranteed Annuity Options: GMP underpin on Section 32 transfers: and Expected payments under Mortgage Endowment Promise.
188 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 41 Insurance liabilities continued The cost of future policy-related liabilities is determined using a market-consistent approach and, in the main, this is based on a stochastic model calibrated to market conditions at the end of the reporting period.
Non-market-related assumptions for example, persistency, mortality and expenses are based on experience, adjusted to take into account future trends.
The principal assumptions underlying the cost of future policy-related liabilities are as follows: Future investment return A risk-free rate equal to the spot yield on UK swaps is used for the valuation of With-Profits business.
The rates vary according to the outstanding term of the policy, with a typical rate as at 31 December 2013 of 3.11% 2012: 1.92 % for a policy with ten years outstanding.
Volatility of investment return Volatility assumptions are set with reference to implied volatility data on traded market instruments, where available, or on a best estimate basis where not.
Volatility 2013 2012 Equity returns 22.2% 26.3% Property returns 15.0% 15.0% Fixed interest yields 16.3% 17.1% The equity volatility used depends on term, money-ness and region.
The figure shown is for a sample UK equity, at the money, with a ten-year term.
Fixed interest yield volatility is also dependent on term and money-ness.
The figure shown is for a ten-year swap option with ten-year term, currently at the money.
Future regular bonuses Annual bonus assumptions for 2014 have been set consistently with the year-end 2013 declaration.
Future annual bonus rates reflect the principles and practices of each fund.
In particular, the level is set with regard to the projected margin for final bonus and the change from one year to the next is limited to a level consistent with past practice.
Mortality Mortality assumptions for with-profit business are set with regard to recent Company experience and general industry trends.
The mortality tables used in the valuation are summarised below: Mortality table used 2013 2012 Assurances, pure endowments and deferred annuities before vesting Nil or Axx00 adjusted Nil or Axx00 adjusted Pensions business after vesting and pensions annuities in payment PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted plus PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted plus allowance for future mortality allowance for future mortality improvement improvement Allowance for future mortality improvement is in line with the rates shown for non-profit business below.
Non-profit business The valuation of non-profit business is based on regulatory requirements, adjusted to remove certain regulatory reserves and margins in assumptions, notably for annuity business.
Conventional non-profit contracts, including those written in the with-profit funds, are valued using gross premium methods which discount projected future cash flows.
The cash flows are calculated using the amount of contractual premiums payable, together with explicit assumptions for investment returns, inflation, discount rates, mortality, morbidity, persistency and future expenses.
These assumptions vary by contract type and reflect current and expected future experience.
For unit-linked and some unitised with-profit business, the provisions are valued by adding a prospective non-unit reserve to the bid value of units.
The prospective non-unit reserve is calculated by projecting the future non-unit cash flows on the assumption that future premiums cease, unless it is more onerous to assume that they continue.
Where appropriate, allowance for persistency is based on actual experience.
Valuation discount rate assumptions are set with regard to yields on the supporting assets and the general level of long-term interest rates as measured by gilt yields.
An explicit allowance for risk is included by restricting the yields for equities and properties with reference to a margin over long-term interest rates or by making an explicit deduction from the yields on corporate bonds, mortgages and deposits, based on historical default experience of each asset class.
A further margin for risk is then deducted for all asset classes.
The provisions held in respect of guaranteed annuity options are a prudent assessment of the additional liability incurred under the option on a basis and method consistent with that used to value basic policy liabilities, and includes a prudent assessment of the proportion of policyholders who will choose to exercise the option.
Strategic report Governance IFRS Financial statements Other information 189 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 41 Insurance liabilities continued Valuation discount rates for business in the non-profit funds are as follows: Valuation discount rates 2013 2012 Assurances Life conventional non-profit 2.5% 1.8% Pensions conventional non-profit 3.2% 2.2% Annuities Conventional immediate and deferred annuities 3.2% to 4.7% 2.6% to 4.1% Non-unit reserves on Unit Linked business Life 2.8% 2.1% Pensions 3.5% 2.5% Income Protection Active lives 2.9% 2.2% Claims in payment level 3.1% 3.1% Claims in payment index linked 0.6 % 0.7 % The above valuation discount rates are after reduction for investment expenses and credit risk.
For conventional immediate annuity business the allowance for credit risk comprises long-term assumptions for defaults and downgrades, which vary by asset category and rating.
The credit risk allowance made for corporate bonds and mortgages, including healthcare mortgages, held by Aviva Annuity UK Limited equated to 48bps and 124bps respectively at 31 December 2013 2012: 56 bps and 89 bps respectively.
For corporate bonds, the allowance represented 44% of the average credit spread for the portfolio 2012: 30%.
The total valuation allowance held by Aviva Annuity UK Limited in respect of corporate bonds and mortgages, including healthcare mortgages, was 2.0 billion 2012: 2.0 billion including an implicit reinvestment margin of 0.2 billion over the remaining term of the UK Life corporate bond and mortgage portfolio.
Total liabilities for the annuity business were 30 billion at 31 December 2013 2012: 30 billion.
Whilst the total valuation allowance held by Aviva Annuity UK Limited remained unchanged, the allowance for defaults for commercial mortgages was increased by 0.3 billion at half year whilst the implicit reinvestment margin was reduced by 0.2 billion to reflect management actions to better duration match, during the second half of 2013 this has reduced slightly in line with interest rate increases and default experience, the allowance for corporate bonds remains largely unchanged.
Mortality assumptions for non-profit business are set with regard to recent Company experience and general industry trends.
The mortality tables used in the valuation are summarised below: Mortality tables used 2013 2012 Assurances Non-profit AM00 AF00 or TM00 TF00 AM00 AF00 or TM00 TF00 adjusted for smoker status and adjusted for smoker status and age sex specific factors age sex specific factors Pure endowments and deferred annuities before vesting AM00 AF00 adjusted AM00 AF00 adjusted Annuities in payment Pensions business and general annuity business PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted plus PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted plus allowance for future mortality allowance for future mortality improvement improvement For the main pensions annuity business in Aviva Annuity UK Limited, the underlying mortality assumptions for Males are 103.0% of PCMA00 with base year 2000: for Females the underlying mortality assumptions are 98.5% of PCFA00 with base year 2000.
Improvements have been strengthened and are based on data used in CMI 2013 with a long-term improvement rate of 1.75% for males and 1.5% for females both with an addition of 0.5% to all future annual improvement 2012: CMI 2011 with long-term improvement rate of 1.5% for males and 1.0% for females both with an addition of 0.5% to all future annual improvement.
Year-specific adjustments are made to allow for selection effects due to the development of the Enhanced Annuity market.
b France The majority of reserves arise from single premium savings products and are based on the accumulated fund values, adjusted to maintain consistency with the value of the assets backing the policyholder liabilities.
For traditional business, the net premium method is used for prospective valuations, in accordance with local regulation, where the valuation assumptions depend on the date of issue of the contract.
The valuation discount rate also depends on the original duration of the contract and mortality rates are based on industry tables.

iv Movements The following movements have occurred in the gross long-term business provisions during the year: 1 Restated 2013 2012 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 131,190 131,171 Provisions in respect of new business 5,671 8,631 Expected change in existing business provisions 8,015 8,362 Variance between actual and expected experience 2,871 943 Impact of operating assumption changes 428 718 Impact of economic assumption changes 2,812 1,726 1 Other movements 235 2 Change in liability recognised as an expense 2,092 2,222 2 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 34,441 214 Foreign exchange rate movements 509 1,878 1,3 Other movements 194 111 Carrying amount at 31 December 94,972 131,190 1 Other movements outside change in liability recognised as an expense of 111 million in 2012 represents the reclassification of liabilities from insurance to non-participating investment in Eurovita.
In 2012 these were included within Other movements within change in liability recognised as an expense.
2 Disposals in 2013 include 31,167 million related to the disposal of the US business, 1,900 million related to the disposal of Aseval, and 1,233 million related to the disposal of Ark Life.
3 Other movements outside change in liability recognised as an expense in 2013 of 194 million represents the reclassification of liabilities from insurance to participating investment in Eurovita.
The variance between actual and expected experience of 2.9 billion in 2013 was primarily due to the impact of favourable equity and property returns on liabilities for unit-linked and with profit contracts in the UK and Ireland, and unit-linked contracts in France and Italy.
For many types of long-term business, including unit-linked and participating funds, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit.
Minor variances arise from differences between actual and expected experience for persistency, mortality and other demographic factors.
The impact of assumption changes in the above analysis shows the resulting movement in the carrying value of insurance liabilities.
The 0.4 billion impact of operating assumption changes relates to a strengthening of mortality and lapse assumptions on protection business in the UK with the impact on profit mainly offset by a corresponding increase in reinsurance assets, and the impact on with profit liabilities in the With profits sub-fund WPSF, of a decision to discontinue the charge on assets shares for guarantee costs, and to refund previously deducted charges to asset shares.
The 2.8 billion impact of economic assumption changes reflects increases in valuation interest rates, primarily in respect of immediate annuity and participating insurance contracts in the UK.
The 0.2 billion release of reserves due to other movements included within change in liability recognised as an expense largely relates to UK with profit liabilities, the most significant individual item being the impact on asset shares of moving to a fair-value asset valuation, for loans previously valued at amortised cost.
For participating business, a movement in liabilities is generally offset by a corresponding adjustment to the unallocated divisible surplus and does not impact on profit.
Where assumption changes do impact on profit, these are included in the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year shown in note 45, together with the impact of movements in related non-financial assets.
In 2013 we found evidence of improper allocation of trades in fixed income securities in Aviva Investors.
These breaches of our dealing policy involved late allocation of trades which favoured external hedge funds to the detriment of certain Aviva UK Life funds.
The relevant regulatory authorities were notified at an early stage and have been kept fully apprised of the issue.
A thorough review of internal control processes relating to the dealing policy has been carried out by management and reviewed by PwC.
Measures to improve controls have been implemented.
Of the total expected cost of 132 million, an amount of 126 million in relation to this matter has been recognised within insurance liabilities this reflects the compensation expected to be claimed in respect of these breaches, with the balance relating to other associated costs.
Strategic report Governance IFRS Financial statements Other information 191 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 41 Insurance liabilities continued c General insurance and health liabilities i Provisions for outstanding claims Delays occur in the notification and settlement of claims and a substantial measure of experience and judgement is involved in assessing outstanding liabilities, the ultimate cost of which cannot be known with certainty at the statement of financial position date.
The reserves for general insurance and health business are based on information currently available.
However, it is inherent in the nature of the business written that the ultimate liabilities may vary as a result of subsequent developments.
Provisions for outstanding claims are established to cover the outstanding expected ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses LAE in respect of all claims that have already occurred.
The provisions established cover reported claims and associated LAE, as well as claims incurred but not yet reported and associated LAE.
The Group only establishes loss reserves for losses that have already occurred.
The Group therefore does not establish catastrophe equalisation reserves that defer a share of income in respect of certain lines of business from years in which a catastrophe does not occur to future periods in which catastrophes may occur.
When calculating reserves, the Group takes into account estimated future recoveries from salvage and subrogation, and a separate asset is recorded for expected future recoveries from reinsurers after considering their collectability.
The table below shows the split of total general insurance and health outstanding claim provisions and IBNR provisions, gross of reinsurance, by major line of business.
As at 31 December 2013 As at 31 December 2012 Outstanding Outstanding claim IBNR Total claim claim IBNR Total claim provisions provisions provisions provisions provisions provisions m m m m m m Motor 3,724 1,001 4,725 3,737 1,051 4,788 Property 1,493 180 1,673 1,408 212 1,620 Liability 2,035 1,208 3,243 2,003 1,394 3,397 Creditor 26 18 44 54 13 67 Other 452 161 613 509 173 682 7,730 2,568 10,298 7,711 2,843 10,554 ii Discounting Outstanding claims provisions are based on undiscounted estimates of future claim payments, except for the following classes of business for which discounted provisions are held: Rate Mean term of liabilities Class 2013 2012 2013 2012 Reinsured London Market business 2.5% 2.0% 12 years 11 years Latent claims 0.36% to 3.76% 0.33% to 3.35% 6 to 15 years 6 to 15 years Structured settlements 2.8% 2.6% 35 years 33 years The gross outstanding claims provision before discounting was 10,914 million 2012: 11,004 million.
The period of time which will elapse before the liabilities are settled has been estimated by modelling the settlement patterns of the underlying claims.
The discount rate that has been applied to latent claims reserves is based on the relevant swap curve in the relevant currency having regard to the expected settlement dates of the claims.
The range of discount rates used depends on the duration of the claims and is given in the table above.
The duration of the claims span over 35 years, with the average duration being between 6 and 15 years depending on the geographical region.
Any change in discount rates between the start and the end of the accounting period is reflected outside operating profit as an economic assumption change.
During 2013, the Group has seen a levelling off in the number of new bodily injury claims settled by periodic payment orders PPOs or structured settlements, which are reserved for on a discounted basis.
iii Assumptions Outstanding claims provisions are estimated based on known facts at the date of estimation.
Case estimates are set by skilled claims technicians and established case setting procedures.
Claims technicians apply their experience and knowledge to the circumstances of individual claims.
They take into account all available information and correspondence regarding the circumstances of the claim, such as medical reports, investigations and inspections.
Claims technicians set case estimates according to documented claims department policies and specialise in setting estimates for certain lines of business or types of claim.
Claims above certain limits are referred to senior claims handlers for estimate authorisation.
No adjustments are made to the claims technicians case estimates included in booked claim provisions, except for rare occasions when the estimated ultimate cost of individual large or unusual claims may be adjusted, subject to internal reserve committee approval, to allow for uncertainty regarding, for example, the outcome of a court case.
The ultimate cost of outstanding claims is then estimated by using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques, such as the Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods.
The main assumption underlying these techniques is that a companys past claims development experience can be used to project future claims development and hence ultimate claims costs.
As such, these methods extrapolate the development of paid and incurred losses, average costs per claim and claim numbers based on the observed development of earlier years and expected loss ratios.
Historical claims development is mainly analysed by accident period, although underwriting or notification period is also used where this is considered appropriate.
Claim development is separately analysed for each geographic area, as well as by each line of business.
Certain lines of business are also further analysed by claim type or type of coverage.
In addition, large claims are usually separately addressed, either by being reserved at the face value of loss adjuster estimates or separately projected in order to reflect their future development.
192 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 41 Insurance liabilities continued The assumptions used in most non-life actuarial projection techniques, including future rates of claims inflation or loss ratio assumptions, are implicit in the historical claims development data on which the projections are based.
Additional qualitative judgement is used to assess the extent to which past trends may not apply in the future, for example, to reflect one-off occurrences, changes in external or market factors such as public attitudes to claiming, economic conditions, levels of claims inflation, judicial decisions and legislation, as well as internal factors such as portfolio mix, policy conditions and claims handling procedures in order to arrive at a point estimate for the ultimate cost of claims that represents the likely outcome, from a range of possible outcomes, taking account of all the uncertainties involved.
The range of possible outcomes does not, however, result in the quantification of a reserve range.
The following explicit assumptions are made which could materially impact the level of booked net reserves: UK mesothelioma claims The level of uncertainty associated with latent claims is considerable due to the relatively small number of claims and the long-tail nature of the liabilities.
UK mesothelioma claims account for a large proportion of the Groups latent claims.
The key assumptions underlying the estimation of these claims include claim numbers, the base average cost per claim, future inflation in the average cost of claims and legal fees.
The best estimate of the liabilities reflects the latest available market information and studies.
Many different scenarios can be derived by flexing these key assumptions and applying different combinations of the different assumptions.
An upper and lower scenario can be derived by making reasonably likely changes to these assumptions, resulting in an estimate 235 million greater than the best estimate, or 70 million lower than the best estimate.
These scenarios do not, however, constitute an upper or lower bound on these liabilities.
Interest rates used to discount latent claim liabilities The discount rates used in determining our latent claim liabilities are based on the relevant swap curve in the relevant currency at the reporting date, having regard to the duration of the expected settlement of latent claims.
The range of discount rates used is shown in section ii above and depends on the duration of the claim and the reporting date.
At 31 December 2013, it is estimated that a 1% fall in the discount rates used would increase net claim reserves by approximately 90 million, excluding the offsetting effect on asset values as assets are not hypothecated across classes of business.
The impact of a 1% fall in interest rates across all assets and liabilities of our general insurance and health businesses is shown in note 58.
Allowance for risk and uncertainty The uncertainties involved in estimating loss reserves are allowed for in the reserving process and by the estimation of explicit reserve uncertainty distributions.
The reserve estimation basis for non-life claims requires all non-life businesses to calculate booked claim provisions as the best estimate of the cost of future claim payments, plus an explicit allowance for risk and uncertainty.
The allowance for risk and uncertainty is calculated by each business unit in accordance with the requirements of the Group non-life reserving policy, taking into account the risks and uncertainties specific to each line of business and type of claim in that territory.
The requirements of the Group non-life reserving policy also seek to ensure that the allowance for risk and uncertainty is set consistently across both business units and reporting periods.
Changes to claims development patterns can materially impact the results of actuarial projection techniques.
However, allowance for the inherent uncertainty in the assumptions underlying reserving projections is automatically allowed for in the explicit allowance for risk and uncertainty included when setting booked reserves.
Lump sum payments in settlement of bodily injury claims decided by the UK courts are calculated in accordance with the Ogden Tables.
The Ogden Tables contain a discount rate that is set by the Lord Chancellor and that is applied when calculating the present value of loss of earnings for claims settlement purposes.
The process for setting this discount rate is under review.
The timing of the conclusion of this review is unclear and it is still uncertain whether or by how much the rate will change.
However an allowance has been included in provisions for a reduction in the Ogden discount rates.
A reduction in the Ogden discount rates will increase lump sum payments to UK bodily injury claimants.
Strategic report Governance IFRS Financial statements Other information 193 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 41 Insurance liabilities continued iv Movements The following changes have occurred in the general insurance and health claims provisions during the year: 2013 2012 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 10,554 10,745 Impact of changes in assumptions 80 61 Claim losses and expenses incurred in the current year 6,337 6,291 Decrease in estimated claim losses and expenses incurred in prior years 237 199 Exceptional strengthening of general insurance latent claims provisions Incurred claims losses and expenses 6,020 6,153 Less: Payments made on claims incurred in the current year 3,352 3,243 Payments made on claims incurred in prior years 3,001 3,104 Recoveries on claim payments 285 297 Claims payments made in the year, net of recoveries 6,068 6,050 Unwind of discounting 15 35 Other movements in the claims provisions 2 Changes in claims reserve recognised as an expense 33 140 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 44 171 Foreign exchange rate movements 178 158 Other movements 1 2 Carrying amount at 31 December 10,298 10,554 The effect of changes in the main assumptions is given in note 45 and the economic assumption changes are explained in note 10. d Loss development tables i Description of tables The tables that follow present the development of claim payments and the estimated ultimate cost of claims for the accident years 2004 to 2013.
The upper half of the tables shows the cumulative amounts paid during successive years related to each accident year.
For example, with respect to the accident year 2004, by the end of 2013 5,843 million had actually been paid in settlement of claims.
In addition, as reflected in the lower section of the table, the original estimated ultimate cost of claims of 6,891 million was re-estimated to be 5,919 million at 31 December 2013.
The original estimates will be increased or decreased, as more information becomes known about the individual claims and overall claim frequency and severity.
The Group aims to maintain strong reserves in respect of its general insurance and health business in order to protect against adverse future claims experience and development.
As claims develop and the ultimate cost of claims become more certain, the absence of adverse claims experience will result in a release of reserves from earlier accident years, as shown in the loss development tables and movements table c iv above.
However, in order to maintain overall reserve adequacy, the Group establishes strong reserves in respect of the current accident year 2013 where the development of claims is less mature and there is much greater uncertainty attaching to the ultimate cost of claims.
Releases from prior accident year reserves are also due to an improvement in the estimated cost of claims.
Key elements of the movement in prior accident year general insurance and health net provisions during 2013 were: 32 million release from UK & Ireland, including Group reinsurance business, mainly due to favourable development in health, commercial motor and commercial liability in Ireland, slightly offset by a small strengthening in the UK.
9 million release from Europe mainly due to favourable development across a number of lines of business in France.
160 million release from Canada mainly due to continued favourable experience on motor, following the legislative changes in Ontario.
Key elements of the release from prior accident year general insurance and health net provisions during 2012 were: 47 million release from UK & Ireland, including Group reinsurance business, due to favourable development in Group reinsurance, health and across a number of lines of business in Ireland.
51 million release from Europe mainly due to favourable development of personal motor and commercial property claims in France.
122 million release from Canada mainly due to continued favourable experience on motor, following the legislative changes in Ontario.
The impact of using varying exchange rates is shown at the bottom of each table.
Disposals are dealt with by treating all outstanding and IBNR claims of the disposed entity as paid at the date of disposal.
The loss development tables above include information on asbestos and environmental pollution claims provisions from business written before 2004.
The undiscounted claim provisions for continuing operations, net of reinsurance, in respect of this business at 31 December 2013 were 976 million 2012: 1,003 million.
The movement in the year reflects strengthening of provisions by 5 million in the UK 2012: 8 million, other decreases in undiscounted provisions of 2 million 2012: 51 million increase, claim payments, reinsurance recoveries and foreign exchange rate movements.
e Provision for unearned premiums Movements The following changes have occurred in the provision for unearned premiums UPR during the year: 2013 2012 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 4,441 4,483 Premiums written during the year 9,361 9,535 Less: Premiums earned during the year 9,497 9,514 Change in UPR recognised as income 136 21 Gross portfolio transfers and acquisitions 6 Foreign exchange rate movements 79 57 Carrying amount at 31 December 4,226 4,441 196 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 42 Liability for investment contracts This note analyses our investment contract liabilities by type of product and describes how the Group calculates these liabilities and the assumptions used.
a Carrying amount The liability for investment contracts gross of reinsurance at 31 December comprised: 2013 2012 Long-term business m m Participating contracts 70,628 66,849 Non-participating contracts at fair value 48,140 46,299 Non-participating contracts at amortised cost 1,400 48,140 47,699 Total 118,768 114,548 Less: Amounts classified as held for sale 2,710 4,054 116,058 110,494 b Long-term business investment liabilities Investment contracts are those that do not transfer significant insurance risk from the contract holder to the issuer, and are therefore treated as financial instruments under IFRS.
Many investment contracts contain a discretionary participation feature in which the contract holder has a contractual right to receive additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits.
These are referred to as participating contracts and are measured according to the methodology and Group practice for long-term business liabilities as described in note 41.
They are not measured at fair value as there is currently no agreed definition of fair valuation for discretionary participation features under IFRS.
In the absence of such a definition, it is not possible to provide a range of estimates within which a fair value is likely to fall.
The IASB has deferred consideration of participating contracts to Phase II of its insurance contracts project.
For participating business, the discretionary participation feature is recognised separately from the guaranteed element and is classified as a liability, referred to as unallocated divisible surplus.
Guarantees on long-term investment products are discussed in note 43.
Investment contracts that do not contain a discretionary participation feature are referred to as non-participating contracts and the liability is measured at either fair value or amortised cost.
Following the disposal of the US, there are no non-participating investment contracts, that are measured at amortised cost, at 31 December 2013.
Of the non-participating investment contracts measured at fair value, 47,684 million in 2013 are unit-linked in structure and the fair value liability is equal to the unit reserve plus additional non-unit reserves, if required, on a fair value basis.
These contracts are generally classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy, as the unit reserve is calculated as the publicly quoted unit price multiplied by the number units in issue, and any non-unit reserve is insignificant.
For unit-linked business, a deferred acquisition cost asset and deferred income reserve liability are recognised in respect of transaction costs and front-end fees respectively, that relate to the provision of investment management services, and which are amortised on a systematic basis over the contract term.
The amount of the related deferred acquisition cost asset is shown in note 29 and the deferred income liability is shown in note 52. c Movements in the year The following movements have occurred in the gross provisions for investment contracts in the year: i Participating investment contracts 2013 2012 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 66,849 67,707 Provisions in respect of new business 3,421 2,695 Expected change in existing business provisions 2,243 2,039 Variance between actual and expected experience 1,085 102 Impact of operating assumption changes 329 9 Impact of economic assumption changes 301 74 Other movements 47 82 Change in liability recognised as an expense 2,244 759 1 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 39 Foreign exchange rate movements 1,380 1,610 2 Other movements 194 7 Carrying amount at 31 December 70,628 66,849 1 Disposals in 2013 relate to Aseval.
2 Other movements outside change in liability recognised as an expense in 2013 of 194 million represents the reclassification of liabilities from insurance to participating investment in Eurovita.
Strategic report Governance IFRS Financial statements Other information 197 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 42 Liability for investment contracts continued For many types of long-term business, including unit-linked and participating funds, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit.
The 0.3 billion impact of operating assumption changes relates to the impact on with profit liabilities in the With-profits sub-fund WPSF, of a decision to discontinue the charge on assets shares for guarantee costs, and to refund previously deducted charges to asset shares.
The impact of assumption changes in the above analysis shows the resulting movement in the carrying value of participating investment contract liabilities.
ii Non-participating investment contracts 1 Restated 2013 2012 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 47,699 45,659 Provisions in respect of new business 3,386 3,851 Expected change in existing business provisions 2,698 2,531 Variance between actual and expected experience 3,122 982 Impact of operating assumption changes 4 14 Impact of economic assumption changes 1 4 Other movements 46 18 Change in liability 3,861 2,302 2 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 3,785 25 Foreign exchange rate movements 365 404 Other movements 117 Carrying amount at 31 December 48,140 47,699 1 Other movements outside Change in liability of 117 million in 2012 include 111 million in respect of the reclassification of liabilities from insurance to non-participating investment.
In the 2012 statements this 111 million was included within Other movements within change in liability.
2 Disposals include 1,826 million related to the disposal of the US business, and 1,955 million related to the disposal of Ark Life.
The variance between actual and expected experience of 3.1 billion was primarily driven by favourable movements in investment markets in 2013.
The rise in investment markets increased the value of unit linked contracts, which comprise the vast majority of the non-participating investment contract liabilities.
For unit-linked investment contracts, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit.
The impact of assumption changes in the above analysis shows the resulting movement in the carrying value of nonparticipating investment contract liabilities.
The impact of assumption changes on profit are included in the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year shown in note 45, which combines participating and non-participating investment contracts together with the impact of movements in related non-financial assets.
43 Financial guarantees and options This note details the financial guarantees and options that the Group has given for some of our insurance and investment products.
As a normal part of their operating activities, various Group companies have given guarantees and options, including investment return guarantees, in respect of certain long-term insurance and fund management products.
Further information on assumptions is given in notes 41 and 42. a UK Life with-profit business In the UK, life insurers are required to comply with the PRAs realistic reporting regime for their with-profit funds for the calculation of PRA liabilities.
Under the PRAs rules, provision for guarantees and options within realistic liabilities must be measured at fair value, using market-consistent stochastic models.
A stochastic approach includes measuring the time value of guarantees and options, which represents the additional cost arising from uncertainty surrounding future economic conditions.
The material guarantees and options to which this provision relates are: i Maturity value guarantees Substantially all of the conventional with-profit business and a significant proportion of unitised with-profit business have minimum maturity values reflecting the sums assured plus declared annual bonus.
In addition, the guarantee fund has offered maturity value guarantees on certain unit-linked products.
For some unitised with-profit life contracts the amount paid after the fifth policy anniversary is guaranteed to be at least as high as the premium paid increased in line with the rise in RPI CPI.
ii No market valuation reduction MVR guarantees For unitised business, there are a number of circumstances where a no MVR guarantee is applied, for example on certain policy anniversaries, guaranteeing that no market value reduction will be applied to reflect the difference between the accumulated value of units and the market value of the underlying assets.
198 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 43 Financial guarantees and options continued iii Guaranteed annuity options The Groups UK with-profit funds have written individual and group pension contracts which contain guaranteed annuity rate options GAOs, where the policyholder has the option to take the benefits from a policy in the form of an annuity based on guaranteed conversion rates.
The Group also has exposure to GAOs and similar options on deferred annuities.
Realistic liabilities for GAOs in the UK with-profit funds were 921 million at 31 December 2013 2012: 1,156 million.
With the exception of the New With-Profits Sub Fund NWPSF, movements in the realistic liabilities in the with-profit funds are offset by a corresponding movement in the unallocated divisible surplus, with no net impact on IFRS profit.
Realistic liabilities for GAOs in the NWPSF were 149 million at 31 December 2013 2012: 180 million.
iv Guaranteed minimum pension The Groups UK with-profit funds also have certain policies that contain a guaranteed minimum level of pensions as part of the condition of the original transfer from state benefits to the policy.
v Guaranteed minimum maturity payments on mortgage endowments In addition, the with-profit fund companies have made promises to certain policyholders in relation to their with-profit mortgage endowments.
Top-up payments will be made on these policies at maturity to meet the mortgage value up to a maximum of the 31 December 1999 illustrated shortfall.
For UKLAP WP policyholders, these payments are subject to certain conditions.
b UK Life non-profit business The Groups UK non-profit funds are evaluated by reference to statutory reserving rules, including changes introduced in 2006 under FSA Policy Statement 06 14, Prudential Changes for Insurers which was designated by the PRA on 1 April 2013. i Guaranteed annuity options Similar options to those written in the with-profit fund have been written in relation to non-profit products.
Provision for these guarantees does not materially differ from a provision based on a market-consistent stochastic model, and amounts to 31 million at 31 December 2013 2012: 35 million.
ii Guaranteed unit price on certain products Certain unit-linked pension products linked to long-term life insurance funds provide policyholders with guaranteed benefits at retirement or death.
No additional provision is made for this guarantee as the investment management strategy for these funds is designed to ensure that the guarantee can be met from the fund, mitigating the impact of large falls in investment values and interest rates.
c Overseas life businesses In addition to guarantees written in the Groups UK life businesses, our overseas businesses have also written contracts containing guarantees and options.
Details of the significant guarantees and options provided by overseas life businesses are set out below.
i France Guaranteed surrender value and guaranteed minimum bonuses Aviva France has written a number of contracts with such guarantees.
The guaranteed surrender value is the accumulated value of the contract including accrued bonuses.
Bonuses are based on accounting income from amortised bond portfolios, where the duration of bond portfolios is set in relation to the expected duration of the policies, plus income and releases from realised gains on equity-type investments.
Policy reserves are equal to guaranteed surrender values.
Local statutory accounting envisages the establishment of a reserve, Provision pour Alas Financiers PAF, when accounting income is less than 125% of guaranteed minimum credited returns.
No PAF was established at the end of 2013.
The most significant of these contracts is the AFER Eurofund which has total liabilities of 34 billion at 31 December 2013 2012: 33 billion.
The guaranteed minimum bonus is agreed between Aviva France and the AFER association at the end of each year, in respect of the following year.
The bonus was 3.36% for 2013 2012: 3.45% compared with an accounting income from the fund of 3.85% 2012: 3.94%.
Non-AFER contracts with guaranteed surrender values had liabilities of 15 billion at 31 December 2013 2012: 14 billion and all guaranteed annual bonus rates are between 0% and 4.5%.
Guaranteed death and maturity benefits In France, the Group has also sold unit-linked policies where the death and or maturity benefit is guaranteed to be at least equal to the premiums paid.
The reserve held in the Groups consolidated statement of financial position at the end of 2013 for this guarantee is 20 million 2012: 101 million.
The reserve is calculated on a prudent basis and is in excess of the economic liability.
At the end of 2013, total sums at risk for these contracts were 101 million 2012: 223 million out of total unit-linked funds of 15 billion 2012: 12 billion.
The average age of policyholders was approximately 54.
It is estimated that this liability would increase by 22 million 2012: 88 million if yields were to decrease by 1% per annum and by 8 million 2012: 21 million if equity markets were to decline by 10% from year end 2013 levels.
These figures do not reflect our ability to review the tariff for this option.
ii Ireland Guaranteed annuity options Products with similar GAOs to those offered in the UK have been issued in Ireland.
The current net of reinsurance provision for such options is 202 million 2012: 256 million.
This has been calculated on a deterministic basis, making conservative assumptions for the factors which influence the cost of the guarantee, principally annuitant mortality option take-up and long-term interest rates.
These GAOs are in the money at current interest rates but the exposure to interest rates under these contracts has been hedged through the use of derivatives receiver swaps and payer swaptions.
Strategic report Governance IFRS Financial statements Other information 199 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 43 Financial guarantees and options continued No MVR guarantees Certain unitised with-profit policies containing no MVR guarantees, similar to those in the UK, have been sold in Ireland.
These guarantees are currently in-the-money by 0.2 million 2012: 0.4 million.
This has been calculated on a deterministic basis as the excess of the current policy surrender value over the discounted value excluding terminal bonus of the guarantees.
The value of these guarantees is usually sensitive to the performance of investments held in the with-profit fund.
Amounts payable under these guarantees are determined by the bonuses declared on these policies.
There is no sensitivity to either interest rates or equity markets since there is no longer any exposure to equity in these funds and a matching strategy has been implemented for bonds.
iii Spain and Italy Guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values The Group has also written contracts containing guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values in both Spain and Italy.
Traditional profit-sharing products receive an appropriate share of the investment return, assessed on a book value basis, subject to a guaranteed minimum annual return of up to 6% in Spain and up to 4% in Italy on existing business, while on new business the maximum guaranteed rate is lower.
Liabilities are generally taken as the face value of the contract plus, if required, an explicit provision for guarantees calculated in accordance with local regulations.
At 31 December 2013, total liabilities for the Spanish business were 1 billion 2012: 3 billion with a further reserve of 0.1 million 2012: 0.1 million for guarantees.
Total liabilities for the Italian business were 11 billion 2012: 10 billion, with a further provision of 43 million 2012: 45 million for guarantees.
Liabilities are most sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates.
It is estimated that provisions for guarantees would need to increase by 7 million 2012: 5 million in Spain and 0 million 2012: 1 million in Italy if interest rates fell by 1% from end 2013 values.
Under this sensitivity test, the guarantee provision in Spain is calculated conservatively, assuming a longterm market interest rate of 2.34% and no lapses or premium discontinuances.
d Sensitivity In providing these guarantees and options, the Groups capital position is sensitive to fluctuations in financial variables including foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, real estate prices and equity prices.
Interest rate guaranteed returns, such as those available on GAOs, are sensitive to interest rates falling below the guaranteed level.
Other guarantees, such as maturity value guarantees and guarantees in relation to minimum rates of return, are sensitive to fluctuations in the investment return below the level assumed when the guarantee was made.
44 Reinsurance assets This note details the reinsurance recoverables on our insurance and investment contract liabilities.
a Carrying amounts The reinsurance assets at 31 December comprised: 2013 2012 m m Long-term business Insurance contracts 3,734 4,291 Participating investment contracts 2 3 1 Non-participating investment contracts 2,048 1,678 5,784 5,972 Outstanding claims provisions 53 93 5,837 6,065 General insurance and health Outstanding claims provisions 849 900 Provisions for claims incurred but not reported 315 354 1,164 1,254 Provisions for unearned premiums 256 248 1,420 1,502 7,257 7,567 Less: Amounts classified as held for sale 37 883 Total 7,220 6,684 1 Balances in respect of all reinsurance treaties are included under reinsurance assets, regardless of whether they transfer significant insurance risk.
The reinsurance assets classified as non-participating investment contracts are financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Of the above total, 5,553 million 2012: 5,251 million is expected to be recovered more than one year after the statement of financial position date.
b Assumptions The assumptions, including discount rates, used for reinsurance contracts follow those used for insurance contracts.
Reinsurance assets are valued net of an allowance for their recoverability.
200 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 44 Reinsurance assets continued c Movements The following movements have occurred in the reinsurance asset during the year: i In respect of long-term business provisions 2013 2012 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 5,972 5,373 Asset in respect of new business 268 387 Expected change in existing business asset 19 166 Variance between actual and expected experience 454 197 Impact of operating assumption changes 247 306 Impact of economic assumption changes 426 143 Other movements 81 137 Change in asset 643 450 1 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 873 197 Foreign exchange rate movements 42 48 Carrying amount at 31 December 5,784 5,972 1 Includes 631 million related to the disposal of the US business in 2013, 3 million related to the disposal of Aseval, and 230 million related to the disposal of Ark Life.
The impact of assumption changes in the above analysis shows the resulting movement in the carrying value of reinsurance assets.
The changes to the reinsurance asset from assumption changes mainly relates to business in the UK and Ireland, with corresponding movements in gross insurance contract liabilities.
For participating businesses, a movement in reinsurance assets is generally offset by a corresponding adjustment to the unallocated divisible surplus and does not impact on profit.
Where assumption changes do impact profit, these are included in the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year shown in note 45, together with the impact of movements in related liabilities and other non-financial assets.

This note analyses the effect of the changes.
This note only allows for the impact on liabilities and related assets, such as unallocated divisible surplus, reinsurance, deferred acquisition costs and AVIF, and does not allow for offsetting movements in the value of backing financial assets.
Effect on Effect on profit 2013 profit 2012 m m Assumptions Long-term insurance business Interest rates 1,389 515 Expenses 3 11 Persistency rates 1 Mortality for assurance contracts 8 Mortality for annuity contracts 85 241 Tax and other assumptions 20 207 Investment contracts Interest rates 2 Expenses 1 Persistency rates Tax and other assumptions General insurance and health business Change in loss ratio assumptions 3 Change in discount rate assumptions 33 21 Change in expense ratio and other assumptions 21 Total 1,540 515 The impact of interest rates for long-term business relates primarily to the UK and Ireland driven by the increase in valuation interest rates.
This had the effect of decreasing liabilities and hence a positive impact on profit.
The overall impact on profit also depends on movements in the value of assets backing the liabilities, which is not included in this disclosure.
The impact of annuitant mortality assumptions relates to a slight weakening of annuitant mortality assumptions in the UK and Ireland.
Mortality assumptions in the UK and Ireland are reviewed each year, and updated to reflect recent experience.
46 Unallocated divisible surplus An unallocated divisible surplus UDS is established where the nature of policy benefits is such that the division between shareholder reserves and policyholder liabilities is uncertain at the reporting date.
Therefore the expected duration for settlement of the UDS is not defined.
The following movements have occurred in the year: 2013 2012 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 6,986 650 Change in participating contract assets 262 6,140 Change in participating contract liabilities 22 253 Other movements 4 77 Change in liability recognised as an expense 280 6,316 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 115 1 Foreign exchange rate movements 118 24 Other movements 5 Carrying amount at 31 December 6,709 6,986 Less: Amounts classified as held for sale 4 55 6,713 6,931 Following the reversal of previous losses in Italy and Spain, all Italian participating funds at 31 December 2013 have a positive UDS balance with the exception of Eurovita which is held for sale and a number of smaller funds in Italy.
In Spain, all participating funds had positive UDS balances at 31 December 2013.
Negative UDS balances result from an accounting mismatch between participating assets carried at market value and participating liabilities measured using local practice.
The negative balances are tested for recoverability using embedded value methodology and in line with local accounting practice.
Testing is conducted at a participating fund-level within each life entity.
The negative balances are considered to be recoverable from margins in the existing participating business liabilities.
In Italy the estimation of the recoverable negative UDS balance uses a real-world embedded value method, with a risk-discount rate of 6.6% 2012: 6.25%.
The embedded value method includes implicit allowance for the time value of options and guarantees.
In Spain, the estimation of the recoverable negative UDS balance uses a market-consistent embedded value method.
At 31 December 2013 there was no negative UDS in Spain and consequently testing was not required.
The carrying value of UDS was 132 million positive 2012: 95 million positive in aggregate, though certain funds had a negative UDS balance totalling 39 million.
At 31 December 2013, the negative UDS balances in Italy were tested for recoverability and 42 million 39 million Eurovita of negative UDS was considered irrecoverable 2012: 130 million, 108 million Eurovita.
The remaining carrying value of negative UDS in Italy is 5 million, of which 4 million is in Eurovita.
The aggregate UDS balance was 205 million positive at 31 December 2013 2012: 2 million negative.

In countries where there is a history of tax losses, deferred tax assets are only recognised in excess of deferred tax liabilities if there is convincing evidence that future profits will be available.
Where this is the case, the directors have relied on business plans supporting future profits.
The Group has unrecognised tax losses and other temporary differences of 777 million 2012: 1,005 million to carry forward against future taxable income of the necessary category in the companies concerned.
Of these, trading losses of 79 million will expire within the next 20 years.
The remaining losses have no expiry date.
In addition, the Group has unrecognised capital losses of 438 million 2012: 652 million.
These have no expiry date.
There are no temporary differences in respect of unremitted overseas retained earnings for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised at 31 December 2013 2012: nil.

49 Pension obligations a Introduction The Group operates a large number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The material defined benefit schemes are in the UK, Ireland, and Canada with the main UK scheme being the largest.
The assets and liabilities of these defined benefit schemes as at 31 December 2013 are shown below.
The smaller ones, while still measured under IAS 19, are included as one total within Provisions see note 48.
Similarly, while the charges to the income statement for the main schemes are shown in section b i below, the total charges for all pension schemes are disclosed in section d below.
The assets of the UK, Irish and Canadian schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
In all schemes, the appointment of trustees of the funds is determined by their trust documentation, and they are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneficiaries.
The long-term investment objectives of the trustees and the employers are to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long term, and to maximise returns consistent with an acceptable level of risk so as to control the long-term costs of these schemes.
A full actuarial valuation of each of the defined benefit schemes is carried out at least every three years for the benefit of scheme trustees and members.
Actuarial reports have been submitted for each scheme within this period, using appropriate methods for the respective countries on local funding bases.
204 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 49 Pension obligations continued The number of scheme members was as follows: United Kingdom Ireland Canada 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 Number Number Number Number Number Number Active members 791 Deferred members 56,009 56,825 2,017 1,246 919 1,022 Pensioners 30,945 30,647 747 723 1,364 1,344 Total members 86,954 87,472 2,764 2,760 2,283 2,366 As noted in section ii below, the final salary section of the Irish scheme was closed to future accrual with effect from 30 April 2013.
The final salary sections of the UK and Canadian schemes were closed to future accrual in 2011.
Closure of the schemes has removed the volatility associated with additional future accrual for active members.
i UK schemes In the UK, the Group operates two main pension schemes, the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme ASPS and the smaller RAC 2003 Pension Scheme which was retained after the sale of RAC Limited in September 2011.
As the defined benefit section of both UK schemes is now closed to both new members and future accrual, existing deferred members and new entrants participate in the defined contribution section of the ASPS.
Both schemes operate within the UK pensions regulatory framework.
ii Other schemes Following formal consultation, the Group confirmed its decision to close the final salary section of the Irish scheme with effect from 30 April 2013, in addition to making amendments to future pension increases and breaking the link to final salary.
The consequential reduction in the liabilities, arising from the plan amendments to future pension increases and the break to final salary has resulted in a negative past service cost a gain of 145 million.
The Irish scheme is regulated by the Irish Pensions Board.
In Canada, although future accruals ceased with effect from 31 December 2011, the defined benefit components continue to reflect future increases in salary as benefits are based on a members best average earnings at a future date.
The main Canadian plan is a Registered Pension Plan in Canada and as such is registered with the Canada Revenue Agency and Financial Services Commission of Ontario and is required to comply with the Income Tax of Canada and the various provincial Pension Acts within Canada.
b IAS 19 disclosures Disclosures under IAS 19 for the material defined benefit schemes in the UK, Ireland and Canada, are given below.
Where schemes provide both defined benefit and defined contribution pensions, the assets and liabilities shown exclude those relating to defined contribution pensions.

2 Administrative expenses are expensed as incurred.
3 Net interest income of 57 million has been credited to investment income and net interest expense of 20 million has been charged to finance costs see Note 8.
4 Total recognised in income from discontinued operations is nil and total remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income from discontinued operations is nil.
Strategic report Governance IFRS Financial statements Other information 205 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 49 Pension obligations continued The present value of unfunded post-retirement benefit obligations included in the table above is 118 million at 31 December 2013 2012: 127 million.
The net surplus in the pension schemes in 2013 was adversely affected by a narrowing of the spread between UK corporate bond yields and gilt yields.
This was partly offset by a variety of factors which increased the surplus, including deficit funding contributions, positive equity and property market performance, and reductions to future member benefits.
Present Value Fair Value of of defined IAS 19 Scheme benefit Pensions net Assets obligation surplus 1 2012 Restated m m m Net surplus in the schemes at 1 January 11,791 10,527 1,264 Current service costs 6 6 Past service costs curtailment gain 15 15 2 Administrative expenses 13 13 Total pension cost charged to net operating expenses 4 4 3 Net interest credited charged to investment income finance costs 577 509 68 Total recognised in income from continuing operations 577 513 64 Remeasurements: Actual return on these assets 611 611 Less: Interest income on scheme assets 577 577 Return on scheme assets excluding amounts in interest income 34 34 Losses from change in financial assumptions 914 914 Experience losses 100 100 Total remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income from continuing operations 34 1,014 980 Employer contributions 250 250 Employee contributions 2 2 Benefits paid 344 344 2 Administrative expenses paid from scheme assets 13 13 Foreign exchange rate movements 16 24 8 Net surplus in the scheme at 31 December 12,281 11,675 606 1 Following the adoption of the revised IAS 19 Employee Benefits, the Group has retrospectively applied the changes to the comparative periods.
The key impact of the standard is the replacement of interest cost on the defined benefit obligation and the expected return on plan assets with a net interest cost based on the net defined benefit asset or liability and the discount rate at the beginning of the year.
This has resulted in an increase of 150 million recognised in income and a corresponding decrease in remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income.
3 Net interest income of 87 million has been credited to investment income and net interest expense of 19 million has been charged to finance costs see Note 8.
ii Scheme assets Scheme assets are stated at their fair values at 31 December 2013.

206 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 49 Pension obligations continued Plan assets include investments in Group-managed funds in the consolidated statement of financial position of 868 million 2012: 616 million and transferrable insurance policies with other Group companies of 177 million 2012: 179 million in ASPS.
Where the investment and insurance policies are in segregated funds with specific asset allocations, they are included in the appropriate line in the table above, otherwise they appear in Other.
iii Assumptions on scheme liabilities The valuations used for accounting under IAS 19 have been based on the most recent full actuarial valuations, updated to take account of the standards requirements in order to assess the liabilities of the material schemes at 31 December 2013.
The projected unit credit method The inherent uncertainties affecting the measurement of scheme liabilities require these to be measured on an actuarial basis.
This involves discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out by the scheme using the projected unit credit method.
This is an accrued benefits valuation method which calculates the past service liability to members and makes allowance for their projected future earnings.
It is based on a number of actuarial assumptions, which vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which the relevant businesses are situated, and changes in these assumptions can materially affect the measurement of the pension obligations.
Financial assumptions The main financial assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities under IAS 19 are: UK Ireland Canada 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 1 Inflation rate 3.4% 2.3% 3.0% 2.2% 2.0% 2.0% 2.5% 2.5% 2 General salary increases 5.2% 4.8% 3.5% 3.5% 3.0% 3.0% 1 Pension increases 3.4% 2.3% 3.0% 2.2% 0.5% 2.0% 1.25% 1.25% 1 Deferred pension increases 3.4% 2.3% 3.0% 2.2% 2.0% 2.0% Discount rate 4.4% 4.5% 3.6% 3.5% 4.75% 3.75% Basis of discount rate AA-rated corporate bonds AA-rated corporate bonds AA-rated corporate bonds 1 For UK schemes, assumption provided for RPI CPI.
2 In the UK, the only remaining linkage between pension benefits and general salary increases is in respect of a small amount of Guaranteed Minimum Pensions benefits that increases, in line with National Average Earnings.
The discount rate and pension increase rate are the two assumptions that have the largest impact on the value of the liabilities, with the difference between them being known as the net discount rate.
For each country, the discount rate is based on current average yields of high-quality debt instruments taking account of the maturities of the defined benefit obligations.
Mortality assumptions Mortality assumptions are significant in measuring the Groups obligations under its defined benefit schemes, particularly given the maturity of these obligations in the material schemes.
The assumptions used are summarised in the table below and have been selected to reflect the characteristics and experience of the membership of these schemes.
The mortality tables, average life expectancy and pension duration used at 31 December 2013 for scheme members are as follows: Life expectancy pension Life expectancy pension duration at NRA of a male duration at NRA of a female Normal 20 years 20 years retirement Currently younger Currently younger Mortality table age NRA aged NRA than NRA aged NRA than NRA UK ASPS Club Vita pooled experience, including an allowance for future improvements 60 89.6 91.5 90.8 92.6 29.6 31.5 30.8 32.6 RAC SAPS series 1, including allowances for future improvement 65 88.0 90.6 89.8 92.2 23.0 25.6 24.8 27.2 Ireland 89% PNA00 with allowance for future improvements 61 87.6 90.8 90.5 93.6 26.6 29.8 29.5 32.6 Canada Canadian Pensioner Mortality RPP2014 65 87.5 89.0 89.5 90.5 22.5 24.0 24.5 25.5 The assumptions above are based on commonly used mortality tables.
The tables make allowance for observed variations in such factors as age, gender, pension amount, salary and postcode-based lifestyle group, and have been adjusted to reflect recent research into mortality experience.
However, the extent of future improvements in longevity is subject to considerable uncertainty and judgment is required in setting this assumption.
In the UK schemes, which are the most material to the Group, the allowance for future mortality improvement is per the actuarial professions CMI 2012 model, with assumed long term rates of improvement of 1.75% p. a. for males, and 1.50% p. a. for females.
Strategic report Governance IFRS Financial statements Other information 207 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 49 Pension obligations continued Sensitivity analysis Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate, inflation rate and mortality.
The sensitivities analyses below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant.
The following table summarises how the defined benefit obligation of 12,159 million 2012: 11,675 million would have increased decreased as a result of the change in the respective assumptions: Impact on present value of defined benefit obligation Discount Discount Inflation Inflation rate rate rate rate 1 year 1 1% -1% 1% -1% younger m m m m m Impact on present value of defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2013 1,968 2,616 2,388 1,824 324 Impact on present value of defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2012 1,954 2,591 2,334 1,790 293 1 The effect of assuming all members in the schemes were one year younger.
The sensitivity analyses presented above may not be representative as in practice it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
Furthermore, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised within the consolidated statement of financial position.
Maturity profile of the defined benefit obligation The discounted scheme liabilities have an average duration of 20 years in ASPS, 19 years in the RAC scheme, 20 years in the Irish scheme and 12 years in the Canadian scheme.
The expected undiscounted benefits payable from the main UK defined benefit scheme, ASPS, is shown in the chart below: Undiscounted benefit payments m Deferred member cash flows Pensioner cash flows 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 2014 2044 2074 2104 iv Risk management and asset allocation strategy As noted above, the long-term investment objectives of the trustees and the employers are to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long term, and to maximise returns consistent with an acceptable level of risk so as to control the long-term costs of these schemes.
To meet those objectives, each schemes assets are invested in a portfolio consisting primarily nearly 75% of debt securities, as detailed in section b ii.
The investment strategy will continue to evolve over time and is expected to match to the liability profile increasingly closely.
Main UK scheme The Company works closely with the trustee, who is required to consult it on the investment strategy.
Interest rate and inflation risks are managed using a combination of liability-matching assets and swaps.
Exposure to equity risk has been reducing over time and credit risk is managed within risk appetite.
Currency risk is relatively small and is largely hedged.
The other principal risk is longevity risk.
On 5 March 2014, ASPS entered into a longevity swap covering approximately 5 billion of pensioner in payment scheme liabilities.
The swap transfers longevity risk to three external reinsurers.
Other schemes The other schemes are considerably less material but their risks are managed in a similar way to those in the main UK scheme.
v Funding Formal actuarial valuations normally take place every three years and where there is a deficit, the Company and the trustee would agree a deficit recovery plan.
The assumptions adopted for triennial actuarial valuations are determined by the trustee and agreed with the Company and are normally more prudent than the assumptions adopted for IAS19 purposes, which are best estimate.
For ASPS, following the latest formal actuarial valuation with an effective date of 31 March 2012 a new deficit recovery plan was agreed, to make good the deficit over a period of time, consistent with the requirements of the UK pension regulations.
Under this agreement, the deficit funding payment for the next annual period is estimated to be 252 million of which 98 million relates to contributions deferred from 2013.
As at 31 December 2013, the funding deficit was estimated at 0.6 billion.
Total employer contributions for all schemes in 2014 are currently expected to be 380 million, which includes the 98 million of deficit funding contributions deferred for ASPS from 2013.
208 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 49 Pension obligations continued c Defined contribution money purchase section of the ASPS The trustees have responsibility for selecting a range of suitable funds in which the members can choose to invest and for monitoring the performance of the available investment funds.
Members are responsible for reviewing the level of contributions they pay and the choice of investment fund to ensure these are appropriate to their attitude to risk and their retirement plans.
Members of this section contribute at least 2% of their pensionable salaries and, depending on the percentage chosen, the Company contributes up to a maximum 14%, together with the cost of the death-in-service benefits.
These contribution rates are unchanged for 2014.
The amount recognised as an expense for defined contribution schemes is shown section d below.
d Charge to staff costs in the income statement The total pension credit charge to staff costs for all of the Groups defined benefit and defined contribution schemes were: 2013 2012 m m Continuing operations UK defined benefit schemes 19 12 1 Overseas defined benefit schemes 147 7 Total defined benefit schemes note 11 b 128 19 UK defined contribution schemes 90 91 Overseas defined contribution schemes 17 11 Total defined contribution schemes note 11 b 107 102 Total credit charge from continuing operations 21 121 Total charge from discontinuing operations 9 5 Total credit charge for pension schemes 12 126 1 Includes 145 million gain relating to plan amendments to the Irish Scheme.

All the above borrowings are stated at amortised cost, except for the loan notes issued in connection with the UK lifetime mortgage business of 1,313 million 2012: 1,332 million.
These loan notes are carried at fair value, their values are modelled on risk-adjusted cash flows for defaults discounted at a risk-free rate plus a market-determined liquidity premium, and are therefore classified as either Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, depending on whether observable market prices are available for the loan note.
These have been designated at fair value through profit and loss in order to present the relevant mortgages, borrowings and derivative financial instruments at fair value, since they are managed as a portfolio on a fair value basis.
This presentation provides more relevant information and eliminates any accounting mismatch.
The securitised mortgage loan notes are at various fixed, floating and index-linked rates.
Further details about these notes are given in note 25. ii The contractual maturity dates of undiscounted cash flows for these borrowings are: 1 Restated 2013 2012 Principal Interest Total Principal Interest Total m m m m m m Within one year 558 81 639 725 64 789 1 to 5 years 659 330 989 951 259 1,210 5 to 10 years 437 396 833 399 364 763 10 to 15 years 707 306 1,013 611 284 895 Over 15 years 766 125 891 940 291 1,231 Total contractual undiscounted cash flows 3,127 1,238 4,365 3,626 1,262 4,888 1 Restated for the adoption of IFRS 10.

The dated subordinated notes rank ahead of the undated subordinated notes.
The fair value of these notes at 31 December 2013 was 4,707 million 2012: 4,435 million, calculated with reference to quoted prices.
On 28 February 2014, the Company notified the respective holders of the 200 million subordinated notes due 2019 and the 50 million subordinated notes due 2019 that it would redeem each of the notes on their respective first call dates in April 2014. ii Debenture loans The 9.5% guaranteed bonds were issued by the Company at a discount of 1.1 million.
This discount and the issue expenses are being amortised over the full term of the bonds.
Although these bonds were issued in sterling, the loans have effectively been converted into euro liabilities through the use of financial instruments in a subsidiary.
All these borrowings are at fixed rates and their fair value at 31 December 2013 was 236 million 2012: 246 million, calculated with reference to quoted prices.
iii Commercial paper The commercial paper consists of 556 million issued by the Company 2012: 603 million and is considered core structural funding.
All commercial paper is repayable within one year and is issued in a number of different currencies, primarily sterling, euros and US dollars.
Its fair value is considered to be the same as its carrying value.

53 Contingent liabilities and other risk factors This note sets out the main areas of uncertainty over the calculation of our liabilities.
a Uncertainty over claims provisions Note 41 gives details of the estimation techniques used by the Group to determine the general insurance business outstanding claims provisions and of the methodology and assumptions used in determining the long-term business provisions.
These approaches are designed to allow for the appropriate cost of policy-related liabilities, with a degree of prudence, to give a result within the normal range of outcomes.
However, the actual cost of settling these liabilities may differ, for example because experience may be worse than that assumed, or future general insurance business claims inflation may differ from that expected, and hence there is uncertainty in respect of these liabilities.
b Asbestos, pollution and social environmental hazards In the course of conducting insurance business, various companies within the Group receive general insurance liability claims, and become involved in actual or threatened related litigation arising there from, including claims in respect of pollution and other environmental hazards.
Amongst these are claims in respect of asbestos production and handling in various jurisdictions, including Europe, Canada and Australia.
Given the significant delays that are experienced in the notification of these claims, the potential number of incidents which they cover and the uncertainties associated with establishing liability and the availability of reinsurance, the ultimate cost cannot be determined with certainty.
However, on the basis of current information having regard to the level of provisions made for general insurance claims, the directors consider that any additional costs arising are not likely to have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.
c Guarantees on long-term savings products As a normal part of their operating activities, various Group companies have given guarantees and options, including interest rate guarantees, in respect of certain long-term insurance and investment products.
Note 43 gives details of these guarantees and options.
In providing these guarantees and options, the Groups capital position is sensitive to fluctuations in financial variables including foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, property values and equity prices.
Interest rate guaranteed returns, such as those available on guaranteed annuity options, are sensitive to interest rates falling below the guaranteed level.
The directors continue to believe that the existing provisions for such guarantees and options are sufficient.
d Regulatory compliance The Groups insurance and investment business is subject to local regulation in each of the countries in which it operates.
A number of the Groups UK subsidiaries are dual regulated directly authorised by both the PRA for prudential regulation and the FCA for conduct regulation whilst others are solo regulated regulated solely by the FCA for both prudential and conduct regulation.
Between them, the PRA and FCA have broad powers including the authority to grant, vary the terms of, or cancel a regulated firms authorisation: to investigate marketing and sales practices: and to require the maintenance of adequate financial resources.
The Groups regulators outside the UK typically have similar powers, but in some cases they also operate a system of prior product approval.
The Groups regulated businesses have compliance resources to respond to regulatory enquiries in a constructive way, and take corrective action when warranted.
However, all regulated financial services companies face the risk that their regulator could find that they have failed to comply with applicable regulations or have not undertaken corrective action as required.
The impact of any such finding whether in the UK or overseas could have a negative impact on the Groups reported results or on its relations with current and potential customers.
Regulatory action against a member of the Group could result in adverse publicity for, or negative perceptions regarding, the Group, or could have a material adverse effect on the business of the Group, its results of operations and or financial condition and divert managements attention from the day-to-day management of the business.
Strategic report Governance IFRS Financial statements Other information 213 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 53 Contingent liabilities and other risk factors continued e Structured settlements The Company has purchased annuities from licensed Canadian life insurers to provide for fixed and recurring payments to claimants.
As a result of these arrangements, the Company is exposed to credit risk to the extent that any of the life insurers fail to fulfil their obligations.
The Companys maximum exposure to credit risk for these types of arrangements is approximately $1,119 million as at 31 December 2013 2012: $1,145 million, 2011: $1,085 million.
Credit risk is managed by acquiring annuities from a diverse portfolio of life insurers with proven financial stability.
This risk is reduced to the extent of coverage provided by Assuris, the life insurance industry compensation plan.
As at 31 December 2013, no information has come to the Companys attention that would suggest any weakness or failure in life insurers from which it has purchased annuities and consequently no provision for credit risk is required.
f Other In the course of conducting insurance and investment business, various Group companies receive liability claims, and become involved in actual or threatened related litigation or regulatory action.
In the opinion of the directors, adequate provisions have been established for such claims and no material loss will arise in this respect.
In addition, in line with standard business practice, various Group companies have given guarantees, indemnities and warranties in connection with disposals in recent years of subsidiaries and associates to parties outside the Aviva Group.
In the opinion of the directors, no material loss will arise in respect of these guarantees, indemnities and warranties.
There are a number of charges registered over the assets of Group companies in favour of other Group companies or third parties.
In addition, certain of the Companys assets are charged in favour of certain of its subsidiaries as security for intra-Group loans.
The Groups insurance subsidiaries pay contributions to levy schemes in several countries in which we operate.
Given the economic environment, there is a heightened risk that the levy contributions will need to be increased to protect policyholders if an insurance company falls into financial difficulties.
The directors continue to monitor the situation but are not aware of any need to increase provisions at the statement of financial position date.
54 Commitments This note gives details of our commitments to capital expenditure and under operating leases.
a Capital commitments Contractual commitments for acquisitions or capital expenditures of investment property and property and equipment, which have not been recognised in the financial statements, are as follows: 2013 2012 m m Investment property 3 6 Property and equipment 24 36 27 42 Contractual obligations for future repairs and maintenance on investment properties are nil 2012: nil.

These internal lending arrangements, which net out on consolidation, include the formal loan arrangement between Aviva Group Holdings Limited and Aviva Insurance Limited AIL.
Internal capital management mechanisms in place allocated a majority of the total capital of AIL to the UK general insurance operations with the remaining capital deemed to be supporting residual non-operational Pillar II ICA risks.
Certain subsidiaries, subject to satisfying standalone capital and liquidity requirements, loan funds to corporate and holding entities.
These loans satisfy arms-length criteria and all interest payments are made when due.

3 Total debt comprises direct capital instruments and fixed rate tier 1 notes, Aviva Plc preference share capital and core structural borrowings.
In addition General Accident plc preference share capital of 250 million within noncontrolling interests has been included.
Total capital employed is financed by a combination of equity shareholders funds, preference capital, subordinated debt and borrowings.
At the end of 2013 we had 16.1 billion 2012: 16.5 billion of total capital employed in our trading operations measured on an IFRS basis.
In July 2013 we issued 650 million of Lower Tier 2 subordinated debt callable in 2023.
This was used to repay a 650 million Lower Tier 2 subordinated debt instrument at its first call date, in October 2013.
On a net basis, these transactions did not impact on Group IGD solvency and Economic Capital measures.
Financial leverage, the ratio of external senior and subordinated debt to tangible capital employed was 50% 2012: 50%.
At the end of 2013 the market value of our external debt, subordinated debt, preference shares including both Aviva plc preference shares of 200 million and General Accident plc preference shares, within non-controlling interests, of 250 million, and direct capital instruments and fixed rate tier 1 notes was 7,573 million 2012: 7,260 million, with a weighted average cost, post tax, of 3.8% 2012: 4.4%.

Operating cash flows reflect the movement in both policyholder and shareholder controlled cash and cash equivalent balances.
Around two thirds of the Groups balances relate to unit-linked or participating policyholder funds.
As such, the asset mix and the level of cash held by these funds are determined from a policyholder perspective and can move significantly from one year to another.
Shareholder cash at 31 December 2013 is at 8.3 billion 2012: 9.0 billion.
Purchases and sales of operating assets, including financial investments, are included within operating cash flows as the purchases are funded from cash flows associated with the origination of insurance and investment contracts, net of payments of related benefits and claims.
During the year, the net operating cash inflow reflects a number of factors, including the level of premium income and the timing of receipts of premiums and the payment of creditors, claims and surrenders.
It also includes changes in the size and value of consolidated cash investment funds and changes in the Group participation in these funds.

The analysis of movements in capital provides an explanation of the movement in available capital of the Groups life business for the year.
This analysis is intended to give an understanding of the underlying causes of changes in the available capital of the Groups life business, and provides a distinction between some of the key factors affecting the available capital.
The negative shareholders funds balance within NWPSF arises as a result of regulatory valuation and admissibility differences in the reattributed estate which is valued on a realistic regulatory basis compared to the disclosure on an IFRS basis.
NWPSF is fully supported by the reattributed estate of 1,105 million this is known as RIEESA at 31 December 2013 31 December 2012: 748 million held within NPSF1 a non-profit fund within UKLAP included within other UK life operations in the form of a capital support arrangement.
This support arrangement will provide capital to NWPSF to ensure that the value of assets of NWPSF are at least equal to the value of liabilities calculated on a realistic regulatory basis, therefore it forms part of the NWPSF available capital resources.
218 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 57 Capital statement continued The with-profit funds and the RIEESA use internal hedging to limit the impacts of equity market volatility.
In aggregate, the Group has at its disposal total available capital of 18.6 billion 2012: 19.0 billion, representing the aggregation of the solvency capital of all of our businesses.
This capital is available to meet risks and regulatory requirements set by reference to local guidance and EU directives.
After effecting the year-end transfers to shareholders, the UK with-profit funds have available capital of 3.2 billion 2012: 3.0 billion including amounts held in RIEESA.
Subject to certain conditions, the RIEESA capital can be used to write new non-profit business, but the primary purpose of this capital is to provide support for the UK with-profit business.
The capital is comfortably in excess of the required capital margin, and therefore the shareholders are not required to provide further support.
For the remaining life and general insurance operations, the total available capital amounting to 15.4 billion 2012: 16 billion is higher than the minimum requirements established by regulators and, in principle, the excess is available to shareholders.
In practice, management will hold higher levels of capital within each business operation to provide appropriate cover for risk.
The total available capital of 18.6 billion is arrived at on the basis of local regulatory guidance, which evaluates assets and liabilities prudently and includes the Groups unallocated divisible surplus of overseas life operations.
This is a limitation of the Group Capital Statement which, to be more meaningful, needs to evaluate available capital on an economic basis and compare it with the risk capital required for each individual operation, after allowing for the considerable diversification benefits that exist in our Group.
Within the Aviva Group there exist intra-group arrangements to provide capital to particular business units.
Included in these arrangements is a subordinated loan of 200 million from Aviva Life Holdings UK Limited to Aviva Annuity Limited to provide capital to support the writing of new business.
The available capital of the Groups with-profit funds is determined in accordance with the Realistic balance sheet regime prescribed by the PRAs regulations, under which liabilities to policyholders include both declared bonuses and the constructive obligation for future bonuses not yet declared.
The available capital resources include an estimate of the value of their respective estates, included as part of the unallocated divisible surplus.
The estate represents the surplus in the fund that is in excess of any constructive obligation to policyholders.
It represents capital resources of the individual with-profit fund to which it relates and is available to meet regulatory and other solvency requirements of the fund and, in certain circumstances, additional liabilities may arise.
The liabilities included in the balance sheet for the with-profit funds do not include the amount representing the shareholders portion of future bonuses.
However, the shareholders portion is treated as a deduction from capital that is available to meet regulatory requirements and is therefore shown as a separate adjustment in the capital statement.
In accordance with the PRAs regulatory rules under its realistic capital regime, the Group is required to hold sufficient capital in its UK life with-profit funds to meet the PRA capital requirements, based on the risk capital margin RCM.
The determination of the RCM depends on various actuarial and other assumptions about potential changes in market prices, and the actions management would take in the event of particular adverse changes in market conditions.

4 The WPSF fund includes the Provident Mutual PM fund, which has realistic assets and liabilities of 1.5 billion and therefore does not impact the realistic inherited estate.
Under the PRA regulatory regime, UK life with-profits business is required to hold capital equivalent to the greater of their regulatory requirement based on EU directives regulatory peak and the PRA realistic bases realistic peak described above.
For UK non-participating business, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined in accordance with PRA regulations.
The available capital reflects the excess of regulatory basis assets over liabilities before deduction of capital resources requirement.
For UK general insurance businesses, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined in accordance with the PRA requirements.
For overseas businesses in the European Economic Area EEA, Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore, the available capital and the minimum requirement are calculated under the locally applicable regulatory regimes.
The businesses outside these territories are subject to the PRA rules for the purposes of calculation of available capital and capital resource requirement.
For fund management and other businesses, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined in accordance with the local regulators requirements for the specific class of business.
Strategic report Governance IFRS Financial statements Other information 219 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 57 Capital statement continued The available capital resources in each regulated entity are generally subject to restrictions as to their availability to meet requirements that may arise elsewhere in the Group.
The principal restrictions are: i UK with-profits fund NWPSF, OWPSF and WPSF any available surplus held in each fund can be used to meet the requirements of the fund itself, be distributed to policyholders and shareholders or in the case of NWPSF and OWPSF, transferred via the capital support arrangement explained above for OWPSF only to the extent support has been provided in the past.
In most cases, with-profit policyholders are entitled to at least 90% of the distributed profits while the shareholders receive the balance.
The latter distribution would be subject to a tax charge, which is met by the fund.
ii UK non-participating funds any available surplus held in these is attributable to shareholders.
Capital in the non-profit funds may be made available to meet requirements elsewhere in the Group subject to meeting the regulatory requirements of the fund.
Any transfer of the surplus may give rise to a tax charge subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group.
iii Overseas life operations the capital requirements and corresponding regulatory capital held by overseas businesses are calculated using the locally applicable regulatory regime.
The available capital resources in all these businesses are subject to local regulatory restrictions which may constrain managements ability to utilise these in other parts of the Group.
In several business units, Group companies and other parties jointly control certain entities: these joint venture operations may constrain managements ability to utilise the capital in other parts of the Group.
Any transfer of available capital may give rise to a tax charge subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group.
iv General insurance operations the capital requirements and corresponding regulatory capital held by overseas businesses are calculated using the locally applicable regulatory regime.
Any transfer of available capital may give rise to a tax charge, subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group.
58 Risk management This note sets out the major risks our businesses and its shareholders face and describes the Groups approach to managing these.
It also gives sensitivity analyses around the major economic and non-economic assumptions that can cause volatility in the Groups earnings and capital position.
a Risk management framework The risk management framework RMF in Aviva forms an integral part of the management and Board processes and decisionmaking framework across the Group.
The key elements of our risk management framework comprise risk appetite: risk governance, including risk policies and business standards, risk oversight committees and roles and responsibilities: and the processes we use to identify, measure, manage, monitor and report IMMMR risks, including the use of our risk models and stress and scenario testing.
For the purposes of risk identification and measurement, and aligned to Avivas risk policies, risks are usually grouped by risk type: credit, market, liquidity, life insurance, general insurance, asset management and operational risk.
Risks falling within these types may affect a number of metrics including those relating to balance sheet strength, liquidity and profit.
They may also affect the performance of the products we deliver to our customers and the service to our customers and distributors, which can be categorised as risks to our brand and reputation.
To promote a consistent and rigorous approach to risk management across all businesses we have a set of risk policies and business standards which set out the risk strategy, appetite, framework and minimum requirements for the Groups worldwide operations.
On a semi-annual basis the business chief executive officers and chief risk officers sign-off compliance with these policies and standards, providing assurance to the relevant oversight committees that there is a consistent framework for managing our business and the associated risks.
A regular top-down key risk identification and assessment process is carried out by the risk function.
This includes the consideration of emerging risks and is supported by deeper thematic reviews.
This process is replicated at the business unit level.
The risk assessment processes are used to generate risk reports which are shared with the relevant risk committees.
Risk models are an important tool in our measurement of risks and are used to support the monitoring and reporting of the risk profile and in the consideration of the risk management actions available.
We carry out a range of stress where one risk factor, such as equity returns, is assumed to vary and scenario where combinations of risk factors are assumed to vary tests to evaluate their impact on the business and the management actions available to respond to the conditions envisaged.
Roles and responsibilities for risk management in Aviva are based around the three lines of defence model where ownership for risk is taken at all levels in the Group.
Line management in the business is accountable for risk management, including the implementation of the risk management framework and embedding of the risk culture.
The risk function is accountable for quantitative and qualitative oversight and challenge of the IMMMR process and for developing the risk management framework.
Internal Audit provides an independent assessment of the risk framework and internal control processes.
Board oversight of risk and risk management across the Group is maintained on a regular basis through its Risk Committee.
The Board has overall responsibility for determining risk appetite, which is an expression of the risk the business is willing to take.
Risk appetites are set relative to capital, liquidity and franchise value at Group and in the business units.
Economic capital risk appetites are also set for each risk type.
The Groups position against risk appetite is monitored and reported to the Board on a regular basis.
The oversight of risk and risk management at the Group level is supported by the Asset Liability Committee ALCO, which focuses on business and financial risks, and the Operational Risk and Reputation Committee ORRC which focuses on operational and reputational risks.
Similar committee structures with equivalent terms of reference exist in the business units.
220 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 58 Risk management continued Further information on the types and management of specific risk types is given in sections b j below.
The risk management framework of a small number of our joint ventures and strategic equity holdings differs from the Aviva framework outlined in this note.
We work with these entities to understand how their risks are managed and to align them, where possible, with Avivas framework.
b Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss as a result of the default or failure of third parties to meet their payment obligations to Aviva, or variations in market values as a result of changes in expectations related to these risks.
Credit risk is an area where we can provide the returns required to satisfy policyholder liabilities and to generate returns for our shareholders.
In general we prefer to take credit risk over equity and property risks, due to the better expected risk adjusted return, our credit risk analysis capability and the structural investment advantages conferred to insurers with long-dated, relatively illiquid liabilities.
Our approach to managing credit risk recognises that there is a risk of adverse financial impact resulting from fluctuations in credit quality of third parties including default, rating transition and credit spread movements.
Our credit risks arise principally through exposures to debt security investments, structured asset investments, bank deposits, derivative counterparties, mortgage lending and reinsurance counterparties.
The Group manages its credit risk at business unit and Group level.
All business units are required to implement credit risk management processes including limits frameworks, operate specific risk management committees, and ensure detailed reporting and monitoring of their exposures against pre-established risk criteria.
At Group level, we manage and monitor all exposures across our business units on a consolidated basis, and operate a Group limit framework that must be adhered to by all.
A detailed breakdown of the Groups current credit exposure by credit quality is shown below.
i Financial exposures by credit ratings Financial assets are graded according to current external credit ratings issued.
AAA is the highest possible rating.
Investment grade financial assets are classified within the range of AAA to BBB ratings.
Financial assets which fall outside this range are classified as sub-investment grade.
The following table provides information regarding the aggregated credit risk exposure of the Group for financial assets with external credit ratings, excluding assets held for sale.
Not rated assets capture assets not rated by external ratings agencies.
The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk of financial assets, without taking collateral into account, is represented by the carrying value of the financial instruments in the statement of financial position.
These comprise debt securities, reinsurance assets, derivative assets, loans and receivables.
The carrying values of these assets are disclosed in the relevant notes: financial investments note 27, reinsurance assets note 44, loans note 24 and receivables note 28.
The collateral in place for these credit exposures is disclosed in note 60: Financial assets and liabilities subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements Additional information in respect to collateral is provided in notes 24 c and notes 27 d i.
To the extent that collateral held is greater than the amount receivable that it is securing, the table above shows only an amount equal to the latter.
In the event of default, any over-collateralised security would be returned to the relevant counterparty.
ii Financial exposures to peripheral European countries and worldwide banks Included in our debt securities and other financial assets are exposures to peripheral European countries and worldwide banks.
We continued in 2013 to limit our direct shareholder and participating assets exposure to the governments including local authorities and agencies and banks of Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Italy and Spain, which has been offset by an increase in market values.
Information on our exposures to peripheral European sovereigns and banks is provided in notes 27 e and 27 f. We continue to monitor closely the situation in the eurozone and have had additional restrictions on further investment in place since late 2009 as well as taking actions to reduce exposure to higher risk assets.
However, in the light of the improving economic situation in Ireland, we plan to allow a modest increase in our exposure to Irish sovereign debt during 2014.
Strategic report Governance IFRS Financial statements Other information 221 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 58 Risk management continued iii Other investments Other investments including assets of operations classified as held for sale include unit trusts and other investment vehicles: derivative financial instruments, representing positions to mitigate the impact of adverse market movements: and other assets includes deposits with credit institutions and minority holdings in property management undertakings.
The credit quality of the underlying debt securities within investment vehicles is managed by the safeguards built into the investment mandates for these funds which determine the funds risk profiles.
At the Group level, we also monitor the asset quality of unit trusts and other investment vehicles against Group set limits.
A proportion of the assets underlying these investments are represented by equities and so credit ratings are not generally applicable.
Equity exposures are managed against agreed benchmarks that are set with reference to overall appetite for market risk.
iv Loans The Group loan portfolio principally comprises: Policy loans which are generally collateralised by a lien or charge over the underlying policy: Loans and advances to banks which primarily relate to loans of cash collateral received in stock lending transactions.
These loans are fully collateralised by other securities: and Mortgage loans collateralised by property assets.
We use loan to value: interest and debt service cover: and diversity and quality of the tenant base metrics to internally monitor our exposures to mortgage loans.
We use credit quality, based on dynamic market measures, and collateralisation rules to manage our stock lending activities.
Policy loans are loans and advances made to policyholders, and are collateralised by the underlying policies.
v Credit concentration risk The long-term and general insurance businesses are generally not individually exposed to concentrations of credit risk due to the regulations applicable in most markets and the Group credit policy and limits framework, which limit investments in individual assets and asset classes.
Credit concentrations are monitored as part of the regular credit monitoring process and are reported to Group ALCO.
With the exception of government bonds the largest aggregated counterparty exposure within shareholder assets is approximately 1.9% of the total shareholder assets gross of held for sale.
vi Reinsurance credit exposures The Group is exposed to concentrations of risk with individual reinsurers due to the nature of the reinsurance market and the restricted range of reinsurers that have acceptable credit ratings.
The Group operates a policy to manage its reinsurance counterparty exposures, by limiting the reinsurers that may be used and applying strict limits to each reinsurer.
Reinsurance exposures are aggregated with other exposures to ensure that the overall risk is within appetite.
The Group risk function has an active monitoring role with escalation to the Chief Financial Officer CFO, Group ALCO and the Board Risk Committee as appropriate.
The Groups largest reinsurance counterparty is Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd including subsidiaries.
At 31 December 2013, the reinsurance asset recoverable, including debtor balances, from Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd was 1,620 million.
vii Securities finance The Group has significant securities financing operations within the UK and smaller operations in some other businesses.
The risks within this activity are mitigated by  and minimum counterparty credit quality requirements which are designed to minimise residual risk.
The Group operates strict standards around counterparty quality, collateral management, margin calls and controls.
viii Derivative credit exposures The Group is exposed to counterparty credit risk through derivative trades.
This risk is mitigated through collateralising almost all trades the exception being certain foreign exchange trades where it has historically been the market norm not to collateralise.
Residual exposures are captured within the Groups credit management framework.
ix Unit-linked business In unit-linked business the policyholder bears the direct market risk and credit risk on investment assets in the unit funds and the shareholders exposure to credit risk is limited to the extent of the income arising from asset management charges based on the value of assets in the fund.
222 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 58 Risk management continued x Impairment of financial assets In assessing whether financial assets carried at amortised costs or classified as available for sale are impaired, due consideration is given to the factors outlined in accounting policies T and V. The following table provides information regarding the carrying value of financial assets subject to impairment testing that have been impaired and the ageing of those assets that are past due but not impaired.
The table excludes assets carried at fair value through profit or loss or held for sale.
Financial assets that are past due but not impaired Financial Neither past assets that due nor 6 months1 Greater have been Carrying impaired 03 months 36 months year than 1 year impaired value At 31 December 2013 m m m m m m m Debt securities 1,133 1,133 Reinsurance assets 7,220 7,220 Other investments 7 6 13 Loans 5,263 139 5,402 Receivables and other financial assets 6,934 56 26 18 22 4 7,060 Financial assets that are past due but not impaired Financial Neither past assets that due nor 6 months1 Greater than have been Carrying impaired 03 months 36 months year 1 year impaired value 1 At 31 December 2012 Restated m m m m m m m Debt securities 517 517 Reinsurance assets 6,684 6,684 Other investments 9 8 17 Loans 5,469 151 5,620 Receivables and other financial assets 7,384 43 12 13 24 7,476 1 Restated for the impact of IFRS 10 see note 1 for further details and to exclude financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss.
Excluded from the tables above are financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss that are not subject to impairment testing, as follows: 125.7 billion of debt securities 2012: 131.9 billion, 31.4 billion of other investments 2012: 28.6 billion and 18.5 billion of loans 2012: 18.9 billion.
Of these financial assets none are past due other than 513 million 2012: 531 million of loans that are deemed not to have met their contractual commitments, and are therefore considered to be nonperforming.
The fair value of these loans reflects the underlying property exposure.
Where assets have been classed as past due and impaired, an analysis is made of the risk of default and a decision is made whether to seek to mitigate the risk.
There were no material financial assets that would have been past due or impaired had the terms not been renegotiated.
c Market risk Market risk is the risk of adverse financial impact resulting, directly or indirectly from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity and property prices.
Market risk arises in business units due to fluctuations in both the value of liabilities and the value of investments held.
At Group level, it also arises in relation to the overall portfolio of international businesses and in the value of investment assets owned directly by the shareholders.
We actively seek some market risks as part of our investment and product strategy.
However, we have limited appetite for interest rate risk as we do not believe it is adequately rewarded.
The management of market risk is undertaken at business unit and at Group level.
Businesses manage market risks locally using the Group market risk framework and within local regulatory constraints.
Group Risk is responsible for monitoring and managing market risk at Group level and has established criteria for matching assets and liabilities to limit the impact of mismatches due to market movements.
In addition, where the Groups long-term savings businesses have written insurance and investment products where the majority of investment risks are borne by its policyholders, these risks are managed in line with local regulations and marketing literature, in order to satisfy the policyholders risk and reward objectives.
The Group writes unit-linked business in a number of its operations.
The shareholders exposure to market risk on this business is limited to the extent that income arising from asset management charges is based on the value of assets in the fund.
The most material types of market risk that the Group is exposed to are described below.
i Equity price risk The Group is subject to equity price risk arising from changes in the market values of its equity securities portfolio.
We continue to limit our direct equity exposure in line with our risk preferences.
The disposal of the Groups remaining shareholding in Delta Lloyd has decreased the Groups shareholder equity price risk and, in particular, has led to a fall in equity exposures.
At a business unit level, investment limits and local asset admissibility regulations require that business units hold diversified portfolios of assets thereby reducing exposure to individual equities.
The Group does not have signigicant holdings of unquoted equity securities.
Equity risk is also managed using a variety of derivative instruments, including futures and options.
Businesses actively model the performance of equities through the use of risk models, in particular to understand the impact of equity performance on guarantees, options and bonus rates.
At 31 December 2013 the Groups shareholder funds held 1.5 billion notional of equity hedge put spreads, with up to 15 months to maturity with an average strike of 82-68% of the prevailing market levels on 31 December 2013.
Sensitivity to changes in equity prices is given in section j risk and capital management below.
Strategic report Governance IFRS Financial statements Other information 223 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 58 Risk management continued ii Property price risk The Group is subject to property price risk directly due to holdings of investment properties in a variety of locations worldwide and indirectly through investments in mortgages and mortgage backed securities.
Investment in property is managed at business unit level, and is subject to local regulations on asset admissibility, liquidity requirements and the expectations of policyholders.
As at 31 December 2013, no material derivative contracts had been entered into to mitigate the effects of changes in property prices.
Sensitivity to changes in property prices is given in section j risk and capital management below.
iii Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises primarily from the Groups investments in long-term debt and fixed income securities and their movement relative to the value placed on the insurance liabilities.
A number of policyholder product features have an influence on the Groups interest rate risk.
The major features include guaranteed surrender values, guaranteed annuity options, and minimum surrender and maturity values.
Details of material guarantees and options are given in note 43.
Exposure to interest rate risk is monitored through several measures that include duration, economic capital modelling, sensitivity testing and stress and scenario testing.
The impact of exposure to sustained low interest rates is considered within our scenario testing.
The Group typically manages interest rate risk by investing in fixed interest securities which closely match the interest rate sensitivity of the liabilities where this is available.
In particular, a key objective is to match the duration of our annuity liabilities with assets of the same duration.
These assets include corporate bonds, residential mortgages and commercial mortgages.
Should they default before maturity, it is assumed that the Group can reinvest in assets of a similar risk and return profile, which is subject to market conditions.
Interest rate risk is also managed in some business units using a variety of derivative instruments, including futures, options, swaps, caps and floors.
Some of the Groups products, principally participating contracts, expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will impact on profits through a change in the interest spread the difference between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts and the investment income we are able to earn on the investments supporting our obligations under those contracts.
The primary markets where Aviva is exposed to this risk are the UK, France and Italy.
The low interest rate environment in a number of markets around the world has resulted in our current reinvestment yields being lower than the overall current portfolio yield, primarily for our investments in fixed income securities and commercial mortgage loans.
Although we think it is reasonably likely that interest rates will rise, we still anticipate that interest rates may remain below historical averages for some time.
Investing activity will continue to decrease the portfolio yield as long as market yields remain below the current portfolio level.
We expect the decline in portfolio yield will result in lower net investment income in future periods.
Certain of the Groups product lines, such as protection, are not significantly sensitive to interest rate or market movements.
For unit-linked business, the shareholder margins emerging are typically a mixture of annual management fees and risk expense charges.
Risk and expense margins will be largely unaffected by low interest rates.
Annual management fees may increase in the short term as the move towards low interest rates increases the value of unit funds.
However, in the medium term, unit funds will grow at a lower rate which will reduce fund charges.
For the UK annuities business interest rate exposure is mitigated by closely matching the duration of liabilities with assets of the same duration.
The UK participating business includes contracts with features such as guaranteed surrender values, guaranteed annuity options, and minimum surrender and maturity values.
These liabilities are managed through duration matching of assets and liabilities and the use of derivatives, including swaptions.
As a result, the Groups exposure to sustained low interest rates on this portfolio is not material.
The Groups key exposure to low interest rates arises through its other participating contracts, principally in Italy and France.
Some of these contracts also include features such as guaranteed minimum bonuses, guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values.
In a low interest rate environment there is a risk that the yield on assets might not be sufficient to cover these obligations.
For certain of its participating contracts the Group is able to amend guaranteed crediting rates.
Our ability to lower crediting rates may be limited by competition, bonus mechanisms and contractual arrangements.
In addition, the following table summarises, which includes amounts held for sale, the weighted average minimum guaranteed crediting rates and weighted average book value yields on assets as at 31 December 2013 for our Italian and French participating contracts, where the Groups key exposure to sustained low interest rates arises.
Weighted average Weighted minimum average Participating guaranteed book value contract crediting yield on liabilities rate assets m France 0.78% 3.99% 63,407 Italy 2.21% 3.80% 11,246 1 Other N A N A 41,073 Total N A N A 115,726 1 Other includes UK participating business 224 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 58 Risk management continued Profit before tax on General Insurance and Health Insurance business is generally a mixture of insurance, expense and investment returns.
The asset portfolio is invested primarily in fixed income securities and the reduction in interest rates in recent years has reduced the investment component of profit.
The portfolio investment yield and average total invested assets in our general insurance and health business are set out in the table below.
Portfolio Average investment assets 1 yield m 2011 3.9% 18,978 2012 3.7% 18,802 2013 3.1% 18,352 1 Before realised and unrealised gains and losses and investment expenses The nature of the business means that prices in certain circumstances can be increased to maintain overall profitability.
This is subject to the competitive environment in each market.
To the extent that there are further falls in interest rates the investment yield would be expected to decrease further in future periods.
Sensitivity to changes in interest rates is given in section j risk and capital management below.
This analysis shows an initial benefit to profit before tax and shareholders equity from a 1% decrease in interest rates due to the increase in market value of the backing fixed income securities.
However, in subsequent years the reduction in portfolio yield will result in lower net investment income.
Further information on borrowings is included in note 50. iv Inflation risk Inflation risk arises primarily from the Groups exposure to general insurance claims inflation, to inflation linked benefits within the defined benefit staff pension schemes and within the UK annuity portfolio and to expense inflation.
Increases in long-term inflation expectations are closely linked to long-term interest rates and so are frequently considered with interest rate risk.
Exposure to inflation risk is monitored through economic capital modelling, sensitivity testing and stress and scenario testing.
The Group typically manages inflation risk through its investment strategy and, in particular, by investing in inflation linked securities and through a variety of derivative instruments, including inflation linked swaps.
v Currency risk The Group has minimal exposure to currency risk from financial instruments held by business units in currencies other than their functional currencies, as nearly all such holdings are backing either by unit-linked or with-profit contract liabilities or hedging.
The Group operates internationally and as a result is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates of various currencies.
Approximately half of the Groups premium income arises in currencies other than sterling and the Groups net assets are denominated in a variety of currencies, of which the largest are euro, sterling and Canadian dollars.
The Group does not hedge foreign currency revenues as these are substantially retained locally to support the growth of the Groups business and meet local regulatory and market requirements.
Businesses aim to maintain sufficient assets in local currency to meet local currency liabilities, however movements may impact the value of the Groups consolidated shareholders equity which is expressed in sterling.
This aspect of foreign exchange risk is monitored and managed centrally, against pre-determined limits.
These exposures are managed by aligning the deployment of regulatory capital by currency with the Groups regulatory capital requirements by currency.
Currency borrowings and derivatives are used to manage exposures within the limits that have been set.
At 31 December 2013 and 2012, the Groups total equity deployment by currency including assets held for sale was: Sterling Euro CAD$ Other Total m m m m m Capital 31 December 2013 4,942 4,178 987 910 11,017 Capital 31 December 2012 4,445 4,648 1,119 1,148 11,360 A 10% change in sterling to euro Canada$ CAD foreign exchange rates would have had the following impact on total equity.

These balance sheet movements in exchange rates therefore have no impact on profit.
Net asset and profit before tax figures are stated after taking account of the effect of currency hedging activities.
Strategic report Governance IFRS Financial statements Other information 225 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 58 Risk management continued vi Derivatives risk Derivatives are used by a number of the businesses.
Activity is overseen by the Group risk function, which monitors exposure levels and approves large or complex transactions.
Derivatives are primarily used for efficient investment management, risk hedging purposes, or to structure specific retail savings products.
The Group applies strict requirements to the administration and valuation processes it uses, and has a control framework that is consistent with market and industry practice for the activity that is undertaken.
vii Correlation risk The Group recognises that lapse behaviour and potential increases in consumer expectations are sensitive to and interdependent with market movements and interest rates.
These interdependencies are taken into consideration in the internal economic capital model and in scenario analysis.
d Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to make payments as they become due because there are insufficient assets in cash form.
The relatively illiquid nature of insurance liabilities is a potential source of additional investment return by allowing us to invest in higher yielding, but less liquid assets such as commercial mortgages.
The Group seeks to ensure that it maintains sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations as they fall due through the application of a Group liquidity risk policy and business standard.
At Group and business unit level, there is a liquidity risk appetite which requires that sufficient liquid resources be maintained to cover net outflows in a stress scenario.
In addition to the existing liquid resources and expected inflows, the Group maintains significant undrawn committed borrowing facilities 1.5 billion from a range of leading international banks to further mitigate this risk.
Maturity analyses The following tables show the maturities of our insurance and investment contract liabilities, and of the financial and reinsurance assets to meet them.
A maturity analysis of the contractual amounts payable for borrowings and derivatives is given in notes 50 and 59, respectively.
Contractual obligations under operating leases and capital commitments are given in note 54. i Analysis of maturity of insurance and investment contract liabilities For non-linked insurance business, the following table shows the gross liability at 31 December 2013 and 2012 analysed by remaining duration.
The total liability is split by remaining duration in proportion to the cash-flows expected to arise during that period, as permitted under IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts.
Almost all linked business and non-linked investment contracts may be surrendered or transferred on demand.
For such contracts, the earliest contractual maturity date is therefore the current statement of financial position date, for a surrender amount approximately equal to the current statement of financial position liability.
We expect surrenders, transfers and maturities to occur over many years, and the tables reflect the expected cash flows for these contracts.
However, contractually, the total liability for linked business and non-linked investment contracts would be shown in the within 1 year column below.
Changes in durations between 2012 and 2013 reflect evolution of the portfolio, and changes to the models for projecting cash-flows.
This table includes amounts held for sale.

This table excludes assets held for sale.
See note 1 for further details 2 To reflect the contractual redemption terms of the instruments, collective investment schemes included in other investments previously reported as having no fixed term and maturing over 5 years, amounting to 17 million and 12,278 million respectively, have been reclassified as repayable on demand or within 1 year The assets above are analysed in accordance with the earliest possible redemption date of the instrument at the initiation of the Group.
Where an instrument is transferable back to the issuer on demand, such as most unit trusts or similar types of investment vehicle, it is included in the On demand or within 1 year column.
Debt securities with no fixed contractual maturity date are generally callable at the option of the issuer at the date the coupon rate is reset under the contractual terms of the instrument.
The terms for resetting the coupon are such that we expect the securities to be redeemed at this date, as it would be uneconomic for the issuer not to do so, and for liquidity management purposes we manage these securities on this basis.
The first repricing and call date is normally ten years or more after the date of issuance.
Most of the Groups investments in equity securities and fixed maturity securities are market traded and therefore, if required, can be liquidated for cash at short notice.
e Life insurance risk Life insurance risk in the Group arises through its exposure to mortality and morbidity risks and exposure to worse than anticipated operating experience on factors such as persistency levels and management and administration expenses.
The Group chooses to take measured amounts of life insurance risk provided that the relevant business has the appropriate core skills to assess and price the risk and adequate returns are available.
The underlying risk profile of our life insurance risks, primarily persistency, longevity, mortality and expense risk, has remained stable during 2013, although the current continued relatively low levels of interest rates have increased our sensitivity to longevity shocks compared to historical norms.
Persistency risk remains significant and continues to have a volatile outlook with underlying performance linked to some degree to economic conditions.
However, businesses across the Group have continued to make progress with a range of customer retention activities.
The Group has continued to write considerable volumes of life protection business, and to utilise reinsurance to reduce exposure to potential losses.
More generally, life insurance risks are believed to provide a significant diversification against other risks in the portfolio.
Life insurance risks are modelled within the internal economic capital model and subject to sensitivity and stress and scenario testing.
The assumption and management of life insurance risks is governed by the group-wide business standards covering underwriting, pricing, product design and management, in-force management, claims handling, and reinsurance.
The individual life insurance risks are managed as follows: Mortality and morbidity risks are mitigated by use of reinsurance.
The Group allows businesses to select reinsurers, from those approved by the Group, based on local factors, but retains oversight of the overall exposures and monitor that the aggregation of risk ceded is within credit risk appetite.
Longevity risk and internal experience analysis are monitored against the latest external industry data and emerging trends.
Whilst individual businesses are responsible for reserving and pricing for annuity business, the Group monitors the exposure to this risk and any associated capital implications.
The Group has used reinsurance solutions to reduce the risks from longevity and continually monitors and evaluates emerging market solutions to mitigate this risk further.
Persistency risk is managed at a business unit level through frequent monitoring of company experience, and benchmarked against local market information.
Generally, persistency risk arises from customers lapsing their policies earlier than has been assumed.
Where possible the financial impact of lapses is reduced through appropriate product design.
Businesses also implement specific initiatives to improve retention of policies which may otherwise lapse.
The Group has developed guidelines on persistency management.
Expense risk is primarily managed by the business units through the assessment of business unit profitability and frequent monitoring of expense levels.
Strategic report Governance IFRS Financial statements Other information 227 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 58 Risk management continued Embedded derivatives The Group has exposure to a variety of embedded derivatives in its long-term savings business due to product features offering varying degrees of guaranteed benefits at maturity or on early surrender, along with options to convert their benefits into different products on pre-agreed terms.
The extent of the impact of these embedded derivatives differs considerably between business units and exposes Aviva to changes in policyholder behaviour in the exercise of options as well as market risk.
Examples of each type of embedded derivative affecting the Group are: Options: call, put, surrender and maturity options, guaranteed annuity options, options to cease premium payment, options for withdrawals free of market value adjustment, annuity options, and guaranteed insurability options.
Guarantees: embedded floor guaranteed return, maturity guarantee, guaranteed death benefit, and guaranteed minimum rate of annuity payment.
Other: indexed interest or principal payments, maturity value, loyalty bonus.
The impact of these is reflected in the economic capital model and MCEV reporting and managed as part of the asset liability framework.
f General insurance risk Types of risk General insurance risk in the Group arises from: Fluctuations in the timing, frequency and severity of claims and claim settlements relative to expectations: Unexpected claims arising from a single source or cause: Inaccurate pricing of risks or inappropriate underwriting of risks when underwritten: and Inadequate reinsurance protection or other risk transfer techniques.
Aviva has a preference for general insurance risk in measured amounts for explicit reward, in line with our core skills in underwriting and pricing.
The majority of the general insurance business underwritten by the Group continues to be short tail in nature such as motor, household and commercial property insurances.
The Groups underwriting strategy and appetite is communicated via specific policy statements, related business standards and guidelines.
General insurance risk is managed primarily at business unit level with oversight at the Group level.
Claims reserving is undertaken by local actuaries in the various general insurance businesses and is also subject to periodic external reviews.
Reserving processes are further detailed in note 41 insurance liabilities.
The vast majority of the Groups general insurance business is managed and priced in the same country as the domicile of the customer.
Management of general insurance risks Significant insurance risks will be reported under the risk management framework.
Additionally, the economic capital model is used to assess the risks that each general insurance business unit, and the Group as a whole, is exposed to, quantifying their impact and calculating appropriate capital requirements.
Business units have developed mechanisms that identify, quantify and manage accumulated exposures to contain them within the limits of the appetite of the Group.
The business units are assisted by a Business Capability team who provide technical input for major decisions which fall outside individual delegated limits or escalations outside group risk preferences, group risk accumulation, concentration and profitability limits.
Reinsurance strategy Significant reinsurance purchases are reviewed annually at both business unit and Group level to verify that the levels of protection being bought reflect any developments in exposure and the risk appetite of the Group.
The basis of these purchases is underpinned by analysis of economic capital, earnings and capital volatility, cash flow and liquidity and the Groups franchise value.
Detailed actuarial analysis is used to calculate the Groups extreme risk profile and then design cost and capital efficient reinsurance programmes to mitigate these risks to within agreed appetites.
For businesses writing general insurance we analyse the natural catastrophe exposure using external probabilistic catastrophe models widely used by the rest of the re insurance industry.
The Group cedes much of its worldwide catastrophe risk to third-party reinsurers but retains a pooled element for its own account gaining diversification benefit.
The total Group potential loss from its most concentrated catastrophe exposure zone Northern Europe is approximately 180 million, for a one in ten year annual loss scenario, compared to approximately 280 million when measured on a one in a hundred year annual loss scenario.
g Asset management risk Aviva is directly exposed to the risks associated with operating an asset management business through its ownership of Aviva Investors.
The underlying risk profile of our asset management risk is derived from investment performance, specialist investment professionals and leadership, product development capabilities, fund liquidity, margin, client retention, regulatory developments, fiduciary and contractual responsibilities.
The risk profile is regularly monitored.
Investment performance has remained strong over 2013 despite some positions being impacted by the volatility of global markets.
A client relationship team is in place to manage client retention risk, while all new asset management products undergo a review and approval process at each stage of the product development process, including approvals from legal, compliance and risk functions.
Investment performance against client objectives relative to agreed benchmarks is monitored as part of our investment performance and risk management process, and subject to further independent oversight and challenge by a specialist risk team, reporting directly to the Aviva Investors CRO.
228 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 58 Risk management continued h Operational risk Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss, arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or external events including changes in the regulatory environment.
We have limited appetite for operational risk and aim to reduce these risks as far as is commercially sensible.
Our business units are primarily responsible for identifying and managing operational risks within their businesses, within the group-wide operational risk framework including the risk and control self-assessment process.
Businesses must be satisfied that all material risks falling outside our risk tolerances are being mitigated, monitored and reported to an appropriate level.
Any risks with a high potential impact are monitored centrally on a regular basis.
Businesses use key indicator data to help monitor the status of the risk and control environment.
They also identify and capture loss events, taking appropriate action to address actual control breakdowns and promote internal learning.
i Brand and reputation risk We are exposed to the risk that litigation, employee misconduct, operational failures, the outcome of regulatory investigations, media speculation and negative publicity, disclosure of confidential client information, inadequate services, whether or not founded, could impact our brands or reputation.
Any of our brands or our reputation could also be affected if products or services recommended by us or any of our intermediaries do not perform as expected whether or not the expectations are founded or customers expectations for the product change.
We seek to reduce this risk to as low a level as commercially sensible.
Our regulators regularly consider whether we are meeting the requirement to treat our customers fairly and we make use of various metrics to assess our own performance, including customer advocacy, retention and complaints.
Failure to meet these requirements could also impact our brands or reputation.
If we do not manage the perception of our brands and reputation successfully, it could cause existing customers or agents to withdraw from our business and potential customers or agents to choose not to do business with us.
j Risk and capital management i Sensitivity test analysis The Group uses a number of sensitivity tests to understand the volatility of earnings, the volatility of its capital requirements, and to manage its capital more efficiently.
Sensitivities to economic and operating experience are regularly produced on the Groups key financial performance metrics to inform the Groups decision making and planning processes, and as part of the framework for identifying and quantifying the risks to which each of its business units, and the Group as a whole, are exposed.
For long-term business in particular, sensitivities of market consistent performance indicators to changes in both economic and non-economic experience are continually used to manage the business and to inform the decision making process.
ii Life insurance and investment contracts The nature of long-term business is such that a number of assumptions are made in compiling these financial statements.
Assumptions are made about investment returns, expenses, mortality rates and persistency in connection with the in-force policies for each business unit.
Assumptions are best estimates based on historic and expected experience of the business.
A number of the key assumptions for the Groups central scenario are disclosed elsewhere in these statements for both IFRS reporting and reporting under MCEV methodology.
iii General insurance and health business General insurance and health claim liabilities are estimated by using standard actuarial claims projection techniques.
These methods extrapolate the claims development for each accident year based on the observed development of earlier years.
In most cases, no explicit assumptions are made as projections are based on assumptions implicit in the historic claims.
iv Sensitivity test results Illustrative results of sensitivity testing for long-term business, general insurance and health business and the fund management and non-insurance business are set out below.
For each sensitivity test the impact of a reasonably possible change in a single factor is shown, with other assumptions left unchanged.
Sensitivity factor Description of sensitivity factor applied Interest rate and investment return The impact of a change in market interest rates by a 1% increase or decrease.
The test allows consistently for similar changes to investment returns and movements in the market value of backing fixed interest securities.
Credit spreads The impact of a 0.5% increase in credit spreads over risk-free interest rates on corporate bonds and other non-sovereign credit assets.
The test allows for any consequential impact on liability valuations Equity property market values The impact of a change in equity property market values by 10%.
Expenses The impact of an increase in maintenance expenses by 10%.
Assurance mortality morbidity life insurance only The impact of an increase in mortality morbidity rates for assurance contracts by 5%.
Annuitant mortality life insurance only The impact of a reduction in mortality rates for annuity contracts by 5%.
Gross loss ratios non-life insurance only The impact of an increase in gross loss ratios for general insurance and health business by 5%.

The sensitivities to economic movements relate mainly to business in the UK.
In general, a fall in market interest rates has a beneficial impact on non-participating business, due to the increase in market value of fixed interest securities and the relative durations of assets and liabilities: similarly a rise in interest rates has a negative impact.
The mortality sensitivities also relate primarily to the UK.

In reality, there is a correlation between the assumptions and other factors.
It should also be noted that these sensitivities are non-linear, and larger or smaller impacts should not be interpolated or extrapolated from these results.
The sensitivity analyses do not take into consideration that the Groups assets and liabilities are actively managed.
Additionally, the financial position of the Group may vary at the time that any actual market movement occurs.
For example, the Groups financial risk management strategy aims to manage the exposure to market fluctuations.
As investment markets move past various trigger levels, management actions could include selling investments, changing investment portfolio allocation, adjusting bonuses credited to policyholders, and taking other protective action.
A number of the business units use passive assumptions to calculate their long-term business liabilities.
Consequently, a change in the underlying assumptions may not have any impact on the liabilities, whereas assets held at market value in the statement of financial position will be affected.
In these circumstances, the different measurement bases for liabilities and assets may lead to volatility in shareholder equity.
Similarly, for general insurance liabilities, the interest rate sensitivities only affect profit and equity where explicit assumptions are made regarding interest discount rates or future inflation.
Other limitations in the above sensitivity analyses include the use of hypothetical market movements to demonstrate potential risk that only represent the Groups view of possible near-term market changes that cannot be predicted with any certainty, and the assumption that all interest rates move in an identical fashion.
Strategic report Governance IFRS Financial statements Other information 231 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 59 Derivative financial instruments and hedging This note gives details of the various instruments we use to mitigate risk.
The Group uses a variety of derivative financial instruments, including both exchange traded and over-the-counter instruments, in line with our overall risk management strategy.
The objectives include managing exposure to price, foreign currency and or interest rate risk on existing assets or liabilities, as well as planned or anticipated investment purchases.
In the narrative and tables below, figures are given for both the notional amounts and fair values of these instruments.
The notional amounts reflect the aggregate of individual derivative positions on a gross basis and so give an indication of the overall scale of the derivative transaction.
They do not reflect current market values of the open positions.
The fair values represent the gross carrying values at the year end for each class of derivative contract held or issued by the Group.
The fair values do not provide an indication of credit risk, as many over-the-counter transactions are contracted and documented under ISDA International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. master agreements or their equivalent.
Such agreements are designed to provide a legally enforceable set-off in the event of default, which reduces credit exposure.
In addition, the Group has collateral agreements in place between the individual Group entities and relevant counterparties.
a Instruments qualifying for hedge accounting The Group has formally assessed and documented the effectiveness of its instruments qualifying for hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
These instruments are analysed into cash flow, fair value and net investment hedges, as detailed below.
i Cash flow hedges At the end of 2012 the Group entered into two cash flow hedges, using foreign exchange forward and option contracts, to hedge the currency exposure on expected proceeds in 2013 of businesses which were held for sale as of 31 December 2012 and sold in 2013.
The fair value of the cash flow hedges as of 31 December 2012 was a 5 million derivative asset and no amounts in respect of the cash flow hedges were recognised in the income statement.
All cash flows being hedged have ceased as of the disposal dates of the Aseval Spanish long-term business and the US Life businesses in 2013 and therefore no derivative asset or liability exists as of 31 December 2013.
Following the disposal of these entities in 2013, 4 million 2012: nil has been recycled to the income statement.
ii Fair value hedges The Group entered into a number of interest rate swaps in order to hedge fluctuations in the fair value part of its portfolio of mortgage loans and debt securities in the US.
Subsequent to the sale of the US Life business, Aviva exited these swaps.
Therefore at 31 December 2013 there was a nil notional value of these swaps 2012: 765 million and nil fair value 2012: 54 million liability.
iii Net investment hedges To reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk, the Group has entered into the following net investment hedges: The Group has designated a portion of its euro denominated debt as a hedge of the net investment in its European subsidiaries.
Prior to the sale of the US business the Group also held a portion of its US dollar denominated debt as a hedge of the net investment in the US Subsidiaries.
The carrying value of the debt at 31 December 2013 was 1,428 million 2012: 1,741 million and its fair value at that date was 1,516 million 2012: 1,785 million.
The foreign exchange loss of 40 million 2012: gain of 74 million on translation of the debt to sterling at the statement of financial position date has been recognised in the hedging instruments reserve in shareholders equity.
This hedge was fully effective throughout the current and prior years.
b Derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting Certain derivatives either do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39 or the option to hedge account has not been taken.

Interest rate swap option swaption contracts are grouped with options above as managements intention in entering into and subsequent managing of the swaption contracts most closely resembles option-type contracts.
Fair value assets are recognised as Derivative financial instruments in note 27 a, while fair value liabilities are recognised as Derivative liabilities in note 51.
2012 fair value assets in note 27 a of 1,590 million represent non-hedge derivatives of 1,585 million per the table above plus 5 million of cash flow hedges.
Fair value liabilities in note 51 of 1,751 million represent nonhedge derivatives of 1,697 million per the table above plus 54 million of fair value hedges.
The Groups derivative risk management policies are outlined in note 58. ii The contractual undiscounted cash flows in relation to non-hedge derivative liabilities have the following maturities: 2013 2012 m m Within 1 year 245 534 Between 1 and 2 years 156 434 Between 2 and 3 years 115 158 Between 3 and 4 years 86 387 Between 4 and 5 years 41 113 After 5 years 785 1,787 1,428 3,413 c Collateral Certain derivative contracts, primarily interest rate and currency swaps, involve the receipt or pledging of cash and non-cash collateral.
The amounts of cash collateral receivable or repayable are included in notes 28 and 51 respectively.
Strategic report Governance IFRS Financial statements Other information 233 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2013 60 Financial assets and liabilities subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements Financial assets and liabilities are offset in the statement of financial position when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset and has the intention to settle the asset and liability on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Aviva mitigates credit risk in derivative contracts by entering into collateral agreements, where practical, and in ISDA master netting agreements for each of the legal entities to facilitate Avivas right to offset credit risk exposure.
The credit support agreement will normally dictate the threshold over which collateral needs to be pledged by Aviva or its counterparty.
Transactions requiring Aviva or its counterparty to post collateral are typically the result of over-the-counter derivative trades, comprised mostly of interest rate swaps, currency swaps and credit default swaps.
These transactions are conducted under terms that are usual and customary to standard long-term borrowing, derivative, securities lending and securities borrowing activities.
The derivative assets and liabilities in the table below are made up of the contracts described in detail in note 59.
Reverse repurchase arrangements are instances in which cash has been received as collateral for securities.
Those amounts included as securities lending in the tables below are securities which have been obtained as collateral in arrangements which transfer economic risk and reward, and therefore are recognised as assets by Aviva.
In both of these cases, the collateral received is over 100%, however, in accordance with IFRS 7, the amount reported in the tables below as collateral is limited to the amount reported on the balance sheet.
The amounts in the other investments lines represent offsetting collateral arrangements related to miscellaneous asset lending and unit trust arrangements.
