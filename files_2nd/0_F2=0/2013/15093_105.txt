SuperGroup Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 93 Notes to the Group and Company Financial Statements 19 Intangible assets continued Pre-tax adjusted discount rates Pre-tax adjusted discount rates are derived from the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
A relative risk adjustment has been applied to the rate to reflect the risk inherent in the territories to which the cash flows arise.
The pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate used for SuperGroup Europe BVBA of 12.3%, reflects the mix of geographical territories within which the CGU operates.
Operating cash flows The main assumptions, which are derived from past experience and external information, within the forecast operating cash flows include the achievement of future sales prices, volumes, raw material input costs and the level of ongoing capital expenditure.
Long-term growth rates To forecast beyond the three years, a long-term average growth rate has been used: this is not greater than the average longterm growth rate in each of the territories where the CGU is based.
This results in an average growth rate for SuperGroup Europe BVBA of 2.6%.
Goodwill sensitivity analysis The results of the Groups impairment tests are dependent on estimates and judgements made by management, particularly in relation to the key assumptions described above.
A sensitivity analysis as to potential changes in key assumptions has therefore been performed.
The table below shows the assumptions used and the assumptions required in isolation in order for the estimated recoverable amount to equal the carrying value.
The directors do not consider this to be reasonably possible.
Group Assumptions used Assumption required % % Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate 12.3 23.1 Long-term growth rate 2.6 -9.6 The discounted forecast operating cash flows were 116.4m and a percentage change of 54% in isolation would be required in order for the estimated recoverable amount to equal the carrying value.
