Tangible assets and depreciation tangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
depreciation is provided to write off the cost of assets less their estimated residual value on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Plant and equipment 3 to 10 years motor vehicles 3 to 4 years no depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Dividends dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately declared and authorised and no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Research and development Research and development expenditure is charged to profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
Taxation the charge for taxation is based on the Companys profit for the year.
deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes, which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRs 19. deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Employee benefits the Company operated a contributory pension scheme, of the defined benefit type up to 5th april 2007, after which this scheme was closed for future accruals to existing members and was closed to new members.
since 5th april 2007, the Company has operated a defined contribution scheme, which is part of the same scheme.
the scheme is administered by trustees who are independent of the company finances.
Pension scheme assets in the defined benefit scheme are measured using market value.
Pension scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a high-quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.
the expected return on the schemes assets and the interest on the schemes liabilities arising from the passage of time are included in other finance income.
the pension schemes surplus, to the extent that it is considered recoverable, or deficit is recognised in full and presented on the face of the balance sheet net of the related deferred tax.

Financial Shareholder Overview Performance Governance statements information Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2013 93 C. 28. aCCountinG PoliCies continued Warranty on the sale of products the Company provides a warranty from the date of purchase on all its products.
this is typically for a 12-month period, although up to three years is given for a small number of products.
a warranty provision is included in the accounts, which is calculated on the basis of historical returns and internal quality reports.
Derivative financial instruments in accordance with its treasury policy, the Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
the Company uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk arising from operational and financing activities.
Forward exchange contracts are recognised initially at cost and then subsequently remeasured at fair value.
where a forward contract is designated as a hedge of the variability in future cash inflows, the effective part of any gain or loss on the forward contract is recognised directly in equity.
anyeffective cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the profit and loss account at the same time as the hedged transaction.
theineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account immediately.
however, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Stocks stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and labour plus overheads applicable to the stage ofmanufacture reached.
Foreign currencies transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
