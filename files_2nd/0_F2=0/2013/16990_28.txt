Overview Strategic Review Operational Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements of The Weir Group PLC the Company and its subsidiaries together, the Group for the 53 weeks ended 3 January 2014 2013 were approved and authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 26 February 2014.
The comparative information is presented for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2012 2012.
For practical reasons, the Group prepares its financial statements to the week ending closest to the Company reference date of 31 December.
The results on this basis are unlikely to be materially different from those that would be presented for a period of one year.
The Weir Group PLC is a limited company incorporated in Scotland and is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The consolidated financial statements of The Weir Group PLC have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The principal activities of the Group are described in note 3.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation These financial statements are presented in Sterling.
All values are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million pounds m except when otherwise indicated.
In order to provide the users of the financial statements with a more relevant presentation of the Groups underlying performance, profit for each financial period has been analysed between: i profit before exceptional items and intangibles amortisation: and ii the effect of exceptional items and intangibles amortisation.
Exceptional items are items of income and expense which, because of the nature, size and or infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow a better understanding of the elements of the Groups financial performance for the period and are presented on the face of the income statement to facilitate comparisons with prior periods and assessment of trends in financial performance.
Exceptional items may include but are not restricted to: profits or losses arising on disposal or closure of businesses: the cost of significant business restructuring: significant impairments of intangible or tangible assets: adjustments to the fair value of acquisition related items such as contingent consideration and inventory: other items deemed exceptional due to their significance, size or nature: and the related exceptional taxation.
Intangibles amortisation, including impairment, has been shown separately to provide visibility over the impact of increased acquisition activity on intangible assets.
Further analysis of the items included in the column Exceptional items & intangibles amortisation is provided in note 5 to the financial statements.
The accounting policies which follow are consistent with those of the previous periods except for the adoption of the following standards and interpretations which have not had a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
IAS 19 Revised, Employee benefits The Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and affected notes have been restated for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2012, to reflect changes in the calculation of pension costs in accordance with IAS 19 Revised Employee Benefits.
The net charge to the Income Statement for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2012 increased by 3.3m, on a pre tax basis, with a tax impact of 0.9m.
Operating profit reduced by 0.5m due to the recognition of administrative costs, while other finance costs increased by 2.8m following the introduction of the concept of recognising net interest on the net defined benefit obligation in place of the interest on the defined benefit obligation and the expected return on plan assets recognised under the original standard.
The restatements have been reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and there was no impact on the disclosed defined benefit obligation at 28 December 2012.
The additional net charge to the income statement reduces basic earnings per share for total operations by 1.1p to 147.5p and diluted earnings per share for total operations by 1.1p to 146.6p.
The impact on the current year is disclosed in note 24.
Amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of financial statements presentation of items of other comprehensive income The amendments to IAS 1 introduce a grouping of items presented in other comprehensive income OCI.
Items that could be reclassified or recycled to profit or loss at a future point in time now have to be presented separately from items that will never be reclassified.
The amendment affected presentation only and had no impact on the Groups financial position or performance.
IFRS 13, Fair value measurement IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements.
IFRS 13 does not change when an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under IFRS when fair value is required or permitted.
The application of IFRS 13 has not materially impacted the fair value measurements carried out by the Group.
IFRS 13 also requires specific disclosures on fair values, some of which replace existing disclosure requirements in other standards, including IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
The relevant disclosures are reflected in notes 13 and 30.
Several other amendments apply for the first time in 2013.
However, they do not impact the Group financial statements.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 125 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 2.
Accounting policies continued Use of estimates & judgements The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
Details of the significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are described in the Financial Review on page 48 and in notes 14 and 24.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the results, cash flows and assets and liabilities of The Weir Group PLC and its subsidiaries, and the Groups share of its joint ventures results.
The financial statements of subsidiaries and joint ventures are prepared for the same reporting period as the Company using consistent accounting policies.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled, either directly or indirectly, by the Company, where control is the power to direct activities that significantly influence returns.
The results of a subsidiary acquired during the period are included in the Groups results from the effective date on which control is transferred to the Group.
The results of a subsidiary sold during the period are included in the Groups results up to the effective date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
All intragroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that are not held by the Group and are presented within equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, separately from the Company shareholders equity.
Joint ventures The Group has a number of long-term contractual arrangements with other parties which represent joint ventures.
These all take the form of agreements to share control over other entities jointly controlled entities.
The Groups interests in the results and assets and liabilities of its jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method.
These investments are carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets less any impairment in value.
The income statement reflects the share of results of operations of these investments after tax.
Where there has been a change recognised directly in the investees equity, the Group recognises its share of any changes and discloses this when applicable in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a joint venture, representing the excess of the cost of the investment over the Groups share of the net fair value of the joint ventures identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, is included in the carrying amount of the joint venture and is not amortised.
To the extent that the net fair value of the joint ventures identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the cost of the investment, a gain is recognised and added to the Groups share of the joint ventures profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.
Foreign currency translation The financial statements for each of the Groups subsidiaries and joint ventures are prepared using their functional currency.
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates.
At entity level, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the entitys functional currency at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Currency translation differences are recognised in the income statement except when hedge accounting is applied and for differences on monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the Groups net investment in a foreign operation.
These are recognised in other comprehensive income until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in profit or loss.
On consolidation, the results of foreign operations are translated into Sterling at the average exchange rate for the period and their assets and liabilities are translated into Sterling at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Currency translation differences, including those on monetary items that form part of a net investment in a foreign operation, are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve.
In the event that a foreign operation is sold, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement is determined after taking into account the cumulative currency translation differences that are attributable to the operation.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group elected to deem cumulative currency translation differences to be nil as at 27 December 2003.
Accordingly, the gain or loss on disposal of a foreign operation does not include currency translation differences arising before 27 December 2003.
In the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the cash flows of foreign operations are translated into Sterling at the average exchange rate for the period.
126 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Overview Strategic Review Operational Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is shown net of sales taxes, discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on dispatch of the goods, and can be reliably measured.
Revenue from the sales of services and revenue from construction contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion where the outcome can be estimated reliably, otherwise it is recognised to the extent costs are incurred.
The stage of completion of a contract is determined either by reference to the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, or by reference to the completion of a physical proportion of the contract work.
The basis used is dependent upon the nature of the underlying contract and takes into account the degree to which the physical proportion of the work is subject to formal customer acceptance procedures.
Losses on contracts are recognised in the period when such losses become probable.
Property, plant & equipment The Group elected to use previous UK GAAP revaluations of land and buildings, amounting to 10.5m, prior to 27 December 2003 as deemed cost at the date of the revaluation.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses.
Cost includes borrowing costs for qualifying assets for which the commencement date for capitalisation is on or after 1 January 2009.
Prior to this date, the Group recognised all borrowing costs as an expense immediately.
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land and assets under construction, is provided on a straight-line basis so as to charge the cost less residual value, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date, to the income statement over the expected useful life of the asset concerned, and is in the following ranges: Freehold buildings, long leasehold land & buildings 10 40 years Short leasehold land & buildings duration of lease Plant & equipment 3 20 years Goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents any excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the Groups interest in the fair value of the entitys identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities determined at the date of acquisition.
Acquisition costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
Goodwill in respect of an acquired subsidiary is recognised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses.
Where the fair value of the interest acquired in an entitys assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the consideration paid, the excess is recognised immediately as a gain in the income statement.
Goodwill recognised as an asset as at 27 December 2003 is recorded at its carrying amount at that date and is not amortised.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash generating unit is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the unit.
Goodwill that was written off directly to reserves under UK GAAP is not taken into account in determining the gain or loss on disposal of acquired businesses on or after 27 December 2003.
Any contingent consideration is recognised at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments see below.
All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any recognised impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured at cost on initial recognition.
An intangible resource acquired in a business combination is recognised as an intangible asset if it is separable from the acquired business or arises from contractual or legal rights, is expected to generate future economic benefits and its fair value can be measured reliably.
An intangible asset with a finite life is amortised on a straight-line basis so as to charge its cost, which in respect of an acquired intangible asset represents its fair value at the acquisition date, to the income statement over its expected useful life.
An intangible asset with an indefinite life is not amortised but is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses.
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset.
Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis so as to charge the cost of the software to the income statement over its expected useful life, not exceeding eight years.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 127 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 2.
Accounting policies continued The expected useful lives of acquired intangible assets are as follows: Brand names indefinite life Customer relationships 5 25 years Purchased software 4 8 years Intellectual property & trade marks 6 15 years Other up to 6 years Research & development costs All research expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Development expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred unless it relates to the development of a new product and it is incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the product has been proven, the development costs can be measured reliably, future economic benefits are probable and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset.
Any such capitalised development expenditure is amortised on a straight-line basis so that it is charged to the income statement over the expected life of the resulting product.
Impairment of non-current assets All non-current assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values might be impaired.
Additionally, goodwill, intangible assets with an indefinite life and any capitalised development expenditure are subject to an annual impairment test.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that an assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount, which represents the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
An assets value in use represents the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is conducted for the cash generating unit to which it belongs.
Similarly, the recoverable amount of goodwill is determined by reference to the discounted future cash flows of the cash generating units to which it is allocated.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in previous periods for an asset other than goodwill are reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount.
The carrying amount of an asset shall not be increased above the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior periods.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill are not reversed.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, with due allowance for any obsolete or slow moving items.
Cost represents the expenditure incurred in bringing inventories to their existing location and condition and comprises the cost of raw materials, direct labour costs, other direct costs and related production overheads.
Raw material cost is generally determined on a first in, first out basis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell.
Financial assets & liabilities The Groups principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, short-term borrowings, loans and fixed rate notes, cash and short-term deposits.
The Group also has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations and contingent consideration in relation to acquisitions.
A financial asset is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
Trade receivables Trade receivables, which generally are of a short dated nature, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Cash & cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits available on demand and other short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity on acquisition of three months or less and bank overdrafts and short-term borrowings with a maturity on acquisition of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are presented as current liabilities to the extent that there is no right of offset with cash balances.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount.
128 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Overview Strategic Review Operational Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Interest-bearing loans & borrowings Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, the obligation can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Derivative financial instruments & hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts and cross currency swaps, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate movements.
The Group also uses foreign currency borrowings as a hedge of its exposure to foreign exchange risk on its investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Additionally, the Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risk.
The Group does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on spot and forward foreign exchange rates and counterparty and own credit risk.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on interest rate curves, spot foreign exchange rates and counterparty and own credit risk.
Changes in their fair values have been recognised in the income statement, except where hedge accounting is used, provided the conditions specified by IAS 39 are met.
Hedge accounting is applied in respect of hedge relationships where it is both permissible under IAS 39 and practical to do so.
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships will be classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability will be adjusted by the increase or decrease in its fair value attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss will be recognised in the income statement where, to the extent that the hedge is effective, it will be offset by the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument.
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a cash flow hedge or as a net investment hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument will be recognised directly in other comprehensive income rather than in the income statement.
When the hedged item is recognised in the financial statements, the accumulated gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income will be either recycled to the income statement or, if the hedged item results in a non-financial asset, will be recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is kept in other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are recognised separately as derivative financial instruments when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not stated at its fair value with changes in its fair value recognised in the income statement.
Share-based payments Equity settled share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the Executive Bonus Scheme EBS and as a consequence of occasional one-off conditional awards made to senior executives.
The fair value of the LTIP at the date of the grant is calculated using appropriate option pricing models and the cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service or performance conditions.
The EBS is determined as a percentage of the annual bonus.
This percentage is matched by the Group with a share award that will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date provided the individual continues to hold the original bonus shares awarded and continues to be employed by the company at the date of vesting.
The EBS includes a strategic bonus shares element for a limited number of senior employees.
The fair value of the matching and strategic elements of the EBS is determined at the date of grant of the bonus and the cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The Group recognises a compensation cost in respect of this plan that is based on the fair value of the awards.
The fair value is determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently re-measured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modified.
The changes to the LTIP which will take effect in 2014 are described in the Directors Remuneration Policy on page 88.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has applied IFRS 2 Share-based Payment retrospectively only to equity settled awards that were granted on or after 7 November 2002 and had not vested as at 1 January 2005.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 129 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 2.
Accounting policies continued Treasury shares The Weir Group PLC shares held by the Company are classified in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken directly to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in total comprehensive income on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Post-employment benefits Post-employment benefits comprise pension benefits provided to certain current and former employees in the UK, US and Canada and post-retirement healthcare benefits provided to certain employees in the US.
For defined benefit pension and post-retirement healthcare plans, the annual service cost is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is recognised over the future service lives of participating employees, in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
Current service cost and administration expenses are recognised in operating costs and net interest on net pension liability is recognised in finance costs.
The finance cost recognised in the income statement in the period reflects the net interest on the net pension liability.
This represents the change in the net pension liability resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening net liability, taking into account employer contributions paid into the plan, and hence reducing the net liability, during the period.
Past service costs resulting from enhanced benefits are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses, which represent differences between interest on the plan assets, experience on the benefit obligation and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
The defined benefit liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet comprises the net total for each plan of the present value of the benefit obligation, using a discount rate based on yields at the balance sheet date on appropriate high quality corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations and are denominated in the currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid, minus the fair value of the plan assets, if any, at the balance sheet date.
The balance sheet amount recognised is limited to the present value of economic benefits which the Group expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in future contributions.
In order to calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is also given to any minimum funding requirements.
For defined contribution plans, the costs represent the Groups contributions to the plans and these are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.
Leases Leases which transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance leases.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are included within property, plant and equipment, initially measured at their fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments and a corresponding liability is recognised within obligations under finance leases.
Subsequently, the assets are depreciated on a basis consistent with similar owned assets or the lease term if shorter.
At the inception of the lease, the lease rentals are apportioned between an interest element and a capital element so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the outstanding liability.
Subsequently, the interest element is recognised as a charge to the income statement while the capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding liability.
Operating lease rentals and any incentives receivable are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Taxation Current tax is the amount of tax payable or recoverable in respect of the taxable profit or loss for the period.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base with the following exceptions: a. deferred tax arising from the initial recognition of goodwill, or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, is not recognised: b. deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and c. a deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
130 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Overview Strategic Review Operational Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets represent tax recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unutilised tax losses and the carry forward of unused tax credits.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except if it relates to an item recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised directly in equity.
New standards & interpretations The International Accounting Standards Board and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee have issued the following standards and interpretations, which are considered relevant to the Group, with an effective date after the date of these financial statements.
Effective date for International Accounting Standards IAS IFRS periods commencing IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements 1 January 2014 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements 1 January 2014 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 1 January 2014 Amendments to IFRS 10, 11 and 12 on transition guidance 1 January 2014 IAS 27 revised 2011 Separate financial statements 1 January 2014 IAS 28 revised 2011 Associates and joint ventures 1 January 2014 Amendment to IAS 32, Financial instruments: Presentation, on offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities 1 January 2014 IAS 36 amendment Impairment of Assets, recoverable amount disclosures for non-financial assets 1 January 2014 IAS 39 amendment Financial Instruments, novation of derivatives and continuation of hedge accounting 1 January 2014 IFRIC 21 Levies 1 January 2014 IAS 19 Defined benefit plans, employee contributions 1 July 2014 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 Cycle 1 July 2014 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011-2013 Cycle 1 July 2014 Not yet adopted for use in the European Union.
The above standards and interpretations will be adopted in accordance with their effective dates and have not been adopted in these financial statements.
The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into three operating divisions: Minerals, Oil & Gas and Power & Industrial.
These three divisions are organised and managed separately based on the key markets served and each is treated as an operating segment and a reportable segment under IFRS 8.
The operating and reportable segments were determined based on the reports reviewed by the Chief Executive which are used to make operational decisions.
The Minerals segment is the global leader in the provision of slurry handling equipment and associated aftermarket support for abrasive high wear applications used in the mining and oil sands markets.
The Oil & Gas segment provides products and service solutions to upstream, production, transportation, refining and related industries.
The Power & Industrial segment designs and manufactures valves, pumps and turbines as well as providing specialist support services to the global power generation, industrial and oil and gas sectors.
In prior periods, all other segments, disclosed as Group companies, included the results of LGE Process which supplied equipment to the liquefied petroleum gas marine and onshore markets.
The business was sold on 28 December 2012 note 5.
The Chief Executive assesses the performance of the operating segments based on operating profit from continuing operations before exceptional items and intangibles amortisation, including impairment segment result.
Finance income and expenditure and associated interest-bearing liabilities and derivative financial instruments are not allocated to segments as all treasury activity is managed centrally by the Group treasury function.
The amounts provided to the Chief Executive with respect to assets and liabilities are measured in a manner consistent with that of the financial statements.
The assets are allocated based on the operations of the segment and the physical location of the asset.
The liabilities are allocated based on the operations of the segment.
Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.

144 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Overview Strategic Review Operational Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Contingent consideration As part of the purchase agreement with the previous owner of Mathena Inc, a maximum amount of $120m was agreed to be payable to the former owners contingent on the achievement of specific profit growth targets over 2013 and 2014.
At the date of acquisition, the full liability of 60.1m was recognised on a discounted basis, and the unwind of the discount of 8.6m was recognised as an exceptional item during the period.
The balance recorded was based on vendor forecasts of discounted cash flows at the date of acquisition and reflected management expectations of short term growth in the market.
During the second half of the period, the continuation of the depressed natural gas price resulted in certain customers reducing their gas drilling activity and this impacted the short term forecasts for the business to the extent that the contingent consideration liability has reduced to nil.
The adjustment to release the contingent consideration liability of 67.8m, after allowing for exchange movements in the period, is recorded as an exceptional item in the Income Statement.
The acquisition of Weir International in 2011 included an earn out based on EBITDA achieved in 2013 and 2014, with further EBITDA targets also stretching out to 2019.
The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration at the date of acquisition was 13.9m based on an assessment of the probability of possible outcomes discounted to net present value.
The range of possible outcomes on an undiscounted basis is between zero and 45m.
As at 29 December 2012, the key performance indicators of Weir International highlighted that it is highly probable that the expected EBITDA levels will be achieved and the contingent liability was uplifted accordingly as per note 5.
There has been no change to this view during the 53 week period ended 3 January 2014, therefore, the contingent consideration continues to reflect this position, with only the unwind of the discount being recognised through the Income Statement in the period.
A significant increase decrease in the EBITDA of Mathena Inc or Weir International would result in higher lower fair value of the contingent consideration liability, while a significant increase decrease in the discount rate would result in lower higher fair value of the liability.
The discount rates applied in the fair value calculations were 9.0% for Weir International and 8.7% for Weir Mathena.
A reconciliation of fair value measurement of the contingent consideration liability is provided below.
m Opening balance as at 28 December 2012 24.5 Liability arising on business combinations 61.7 Fair value changes in profit or loss 67.8 Exchange movements in the period 1.1 Contingent consideration paid 0.3 Unwind of discount 10.7 Closing balance as at 3 January 2014 27.7 The contingent consideration in relation to other acquisitions is considered to be immaterial for further disclosure.
The contingent consideration liability for Mathena Inc is due for final measurement at the end of 2014, while the contingent consideration liability for Weir International is due for final measurement and payment to the former shareholders in 2019.
Impairment testing of goodwill & intangible assets with indefinite lives Goodwill acquired through business combinations and intangible assets with indefinite lives have been allocated at acquisition to cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
During the period, the Group completed a review of its cash generating units CGUs to reflect: i recent changes to the management of certain cash inflows as a result of increased collaboration across businesses, in part due to the realisation of revenue and cost synergies arising from the successful integration of acquisitions of recent periods: ii changes to the internal and external reporting structure of the Groups operations: and iii the allocation of recent acquisitions to CGUs on joining the Group.
The review resulted in four primary CGUs: Minerals, Pressure Pumping, Pressure Control and Gabbioneta, plus a further seven which are not significant for separate disclosure and are therefore grouped within Other.
This replaces the previous structure which comprised Warman, SPM, Seaboard and Gabbioneta, plus twelve individually immaterial CGUs within Other.
The acquisitions during 2013, as described in note 13, have been allocated to these CGUs.
Mathena has been included within the Pressure Control CGU, while R Wales, Cheong and Aspir have been added to the Minerals CGU.

A description of each of the CGUs is provided below along with a summary of the key drivers of revenue growth and EBIT margin.
Weir Pressure Pumping Weir Pressure Pumping includes the Weir SPM, Weir Novatech and Weir Mesa brands.
Weir Pressure Pumping is a supplier of oil and gas well service pumps, associated flow control equipment and services to the oil and gas production industry.
Demand for Weir Pressure Pumping products and services is closely related to the number of conventional and unconventional oil drilling rigs and gas well drilling rigs which is in turn dependent upon oil and natural gas prices and storage levels.
Independent forecasts of North American oil and gas well drilling activity, which take into account forecast oil and natural gas prices and storage levels, have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions.
These independent forecasts were prepared during the final quarter of 2013.
Weir Pressure Control Weir Pressure Control includes the Weir Seaboard and Weir Mathena brands.
Weir Pressure Control is a supplier of oil and gas wellhead solutions, flowback services and associated rental equipment to the oil and gas production industry.
A large proportion of the business revenues are generated in North America with demand being closely related to the number of conventional oil drilling rigs and gas well drilling rigs in operation which is in turn dependent upon oil and natural gas prices and storage levels.
Weir Minerals Weir Minerals includes the Weir Warman, Weir Linatex, Weir Multiflo and Weir Wales brands.
Weir Minerals companies supply pumps and associated equipment and services to all global markets.
The key drivers for revenues are i levels of mining capital expenditure which drives demand for original equipment and ii levels of actual mining activity which drives demand for spare parts and service.
Independent forecasts of mining capital expenditure and activity have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions.
Weir Gabbioneta Weir Gabbioneta is a supplier of heavy duty process applications to oil and gas refinery, petro-chemical and power generation industries.
The key drivers for revenues are capital expenditure within oil refinery and petro-chemical industries.
Independent forecasts of expenditure in these sectors have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions.
146 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Overview Strategic Review Operational Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Other The amounts included in Other are not considered individually significant.
The main movements in Other are the reallocation of Novatech, acquired in 2012, and Mesa, acquired in 2008, to the Weir Pressure Pumping CGU.
The Group tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that these might be impaired.
The basis of the impairment tests for the four primary CGUs including key assumptions are set out in the table below.
Basis of Period of Discount Real Key 1 2 CGU valuation forecast rate growth assumptions Source Revenue growth External forecast Weir Pressure Pumping Value in use 5 years 12.2% 2012:12.2% 1.5% 2012:1.2% EBIT margins Historic experience Revenue growth External forecast Weir Pressure Control Value in use 5 years 12.2% 2012:12.2% 1.5% 2012:1.2% EBIT margins Historic experience Revenue growth External forecast Weir Gabbioneta Value in use 5 years 13.6% 2012:14.2% 1.5% 2012:1.2% EBIT margins Historic experience Revenue growth External forecast Weir Minerals Value in use 5 years 14.7% 2012:13.9% 1.5% 2012:1.7% EBIT margins Historic experience 1 Discount rate The discount rates presented above reflect the pre-tax nominal weighted average cost of capital WACC in the most appropriate geographic region.
The WACC is the weighted average of the pre-tax cost of debt financing and the pre-tax cost of equity finance.
In the main the WACCs in mature economies have remained relatively stable compared to 2012 due to an increase in government bond yields being largely offset by the reduction in the cost of equity.
The discount rates for emerging markets have broadly decreased, directly linked to movement in the yields on Government bonds.
Government bond yields in Italy have decreased as local credit risks have reduced, the reduction visible in the Weir Gabbioneta WACC.
A change in the cash flow profile in Weir Minerals towards a higher proportion from emerging markets with higher WACCs drives the small increase in the Weir Minerals WACC, with the real growth rate declining in line with lower growth rates in emerging markets.
2 Real growth Real growth beyond the five year forecast period of 1.5%, a 30 bps increase on 2012, driven by the majority of mature economies exiting the recession of the previous two years.
EBIT margins EBIT margins have been forecast based on historic levels taking cognisance of the likely impact of changing economic environments and competitive landscapes on volumes and revenues and the impact of associated management actions on costs.
Sensitivity analysis Base case forecasts show significant headroom above carrying value for each of the CGUs.
There were no indicators of impairment under the previous CGU structure either.
Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken for each CGU to assess the impact of any reasonable possible change in key assumptions.
There is no reasonably possible change that would cause the carrying values to exceed recoverable amounts.

It is expected that all costs related to such claims will have been incurred within five years of the balance sheet date.
Provision has been made in respect of sales contracts entered into for the sale of goods in the normal course of business where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contracts exceed the economic benefits expected to be received from the contracts.
Provision is made immediately when it becomes apparent that expected costs will exceed the expected benefits of the contract.
It is expected that the majority of these costs will be incurred within one year of the balance sheet date.
Employee related Employee related provisions arise from legal obligations and asbestosis claims and are based on managements best estimate of the likely costs.

Deferred tax asset balances for unused tax losses of 4.9m 2012: 4.5m have not been recognised on the grounds that there is insufficient evidence that these assets will be recoverable.
These assets will be recovered when future tax charges are sufficient to absorb these tax benefits.
Deferred tax asset balances for capital losses in the UK amounting to 5.8m 2012: 9.8m have not been recognised but would be available in the event of future capital gains being incurred by the Group.
Temporary differences associated with Group investments A deferred tax liability of 24.3m 2012: 24.1m has been recognised in respect of taxes on the unremitted earnings of the South American and Canadian subsidiaries.
As at 3 January 2014, this is the only recognised deferred tax liability in respect of taxes on unremitted earnings as the Group does not foresee a distribution of unremitted earnings from other subsidiaries or joint ventures which would result in a reversal of deferred tax.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised, aggregate to 1,513.2m 2012: 1,367.0m.
There are no income tax consequences attaching to the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders.
A number of changes which reduce future UK corporation tax rates were announced in the UK Budget Statement of 20 March 2013.
Following on from this, legislation was enacted on 2 July 2013 such that the main rate of UK corporation tax will be 21% from April 2014 and 20% from April 2015.
Consequently, deferred tax has been provided on UK temporary differences at 20% 2012: 23%.

Pensions & other post-employment benefit plans The Group has five main defined benefit pension plans in the UK and North America four from 2014 onwards following a merger of arrangements in the United States.
All defined benefit plans are closed to new members.
The most significant of the defined benefit plans are the two funded UK plans.
UK Plans In the UK, the Group has two funded defined benefit plans Main plan and Executive plan and an unfunded retirement benefit plan for retired executive directors.
The Group operates a defined contribution plan for new hires.
Contributions to the defined contribution arrangements are in addition to those set out below and are charged directly to profit and loss.
For the defined benefit plans, benefits are related to service and final salary.
Contributory salary in respect of the Groups Main UK plan is subject to capped increases, with the cap being in line with RPI inflation up to a maximum of 5% per annum.
Following a consultation process which ended in August 2013, the Main UK plan will close to future accrual of benefits effective from 30 June 2015, resulting in a curtailment gain of 2.7m being recognised in the period.
The weighted average duration of the expected benefit payments from the Main plan is around 16 years and from the Executive plan is around 11 years.
The current funding target for the UK plans is to maintain assets equal to the value of the accrued benefits based on projected salaries where relevant subject to the cap above for the Main plan.
The Main UK plan holds insurance policies in respect of a significant proportion of deferred and retired pensioners.
The regulatory framework in the UK requires the Trustees and Group to agree upon the assumptions underlying the funding target, and then to agree upon the necessary contributions required to recover any deficit at the valuation date.
There is a risk to the Group that adverse experience could lead to a requirement for the Group to make considerable contributions to recover any deficit.
This risk is significantly reduced for the Main UK plan through the significant insurance policies held by the plan.
North American Plans The Group also sponsors a number of funded defined benefit pension plans in the United States and Canada and certain unfunded postemployment healthcare benefits to senior employees in the United States.
These plans combined make up 4% of the Groups pension and other post-employment benefit plan commitments and 2% of the Groups total associated assets.
The weighted average duration of these plans is around 11 years.
Assumptions The principal actuarial assumptions used for accounting purposes reflect prevailing market conditions in each of the countries in which the Group operates and are as follows: UK North American Post-retirement pensions pensions healthcare 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 Significant actuarial assumptions Discount rate % pa 4.4 4.3 4.7 3.9 4.7 3.9 Retail Prices inflation assumption % pa 3.4 2.9 n a n a n a n a Post-retirement mortality Life expectancies in years Current pensioners at 65 male 22.0 21.8 20.0 19.9 19.6 19.5 Current pensioners at 65 female 24.5 24.3 21.9 21.8 21.5 21.4 Future pensioners at 65 male 23.8 23.6 21.5 21.4 21.1 21.0 Future pensioners at 65 female 26.5 26.3 22.7 22.6 22.4 22.3 Other related actuarial assumptions Rate of increases for pensions in payment % pa Pre 6 April 2006 service 3.3 2.9 n a n a n a n a Post 5 April 2006 service 2.2 2.1 n a n a n a n a Consumer Prices inflation assumption % pa 2.4 2.2 2.0 2.0 2.3 2.4 Rate of increase in healthcare costs n a n a n a n a 7.7% per annum decreasing to 4.5% per annum and remaining static at that level from 2028 onwards.

For North America, weighted assumptions are shown where applicable.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions allow for expected increases in longevity.
The current disclosures above relate to assumptions based on longevity in years following retirement at the balance sheet date, with future being that relating to an employee retiring in 2034 in 20 years time.

In the UK, where the majority of the Groups pension assets are held, the investment strategy is to hold equities and other return-seeking assets such as diversified growth funds and a mixture of bonds to meet the assessed value of the benefits promised for the current active member employees and some deferred pensioners.
For the remaining deferred pensioners and the bulk of pensioners currently receiving their benefit, the liabilities are backed by insurance policies and suitable bonds.

The curtailment gain as a result of the Main UK plan closing to future accrual is recognised as an exceptional item.
Pension contributions are determined with the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the basis of regular valuations using the projected unit method.
The Group made special contributions of 12.1m over the period to 2013 2012: 7.5m in addition to the Groups regular contributions.
The special contributions for 2014 are expected to be 9.6m.
The total contributions to the defined benefit plans in 2014 are expected to be 12.6m 2013: 15.4m.
The figures above for this accounting period have been calculated under IAS 19 Revised.
There has been no impact from the adoption of IAS 19 Revised on the disclosed defined benefit obligation, fair value of assets or net liabilities.
However, the net charge to the Income Statement for this accounting period has increased by 3.3m on a pre tax basis relative to that which would have applied under the previous version of IAS 19, with a tax impact of 0.8m.
Operating profit reduced by 0.4m due to the recognition of administrative costs, while other finance costs increased by 2.9m.
The actuarial loss recognised has decreased correspondingly by 3.3m.
The additional net charge to the income statement reduces basic earnings per share for total operations by 1.2p and diluted earnings per share for total operations by 1.2p.
The 2012 prior year figures have been restated under IAS 19 Revised.
There was no impact on the disclosed defined benefit obligation, fair value of assets or net liabilities.
However, the prior year net charge to the Income Statement was increased by 3.3m relative to that disclosed previously, and the prior year actuarial loss recognised for 2012 was decreased correspondingly by 3.3m.
Sensitivity Analysis Changes in key assumptions can have a significant effect on the reported retirement benefit obligation and the income statement expense for 2014.
The effects of changes in those assumptions are set out in the table below.

Pensions & other post-employment benefit plans continued The impact on the net liability is significantly reduced as a result of the insurance policies held.
In the absence of such policies, the impact of the net liability would equal the significantly higher impact on the defined benefit obligation.
These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in the defined benefit obligation and net liability in isolation, and assuming no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date.
In practice, for example, a change in discount rate is unlikely to occur without any movement in the value of the invested non-insurance policy assets held by the plans.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligations are analysed as follows.

This decision was announced to members in August 2013, at which point the curtailment gain was recognised under IAS 19 Revised.

Legal claims The Company and certain subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business.
On 6 February 2013, an Opinion & Order was filed with the United States District Court, Southern District of New York dismissing the claim against the Company being one of many companies targeted relating to a civil action for damages arising from the UN Oil for Food programme which was raised in the US.
Subsequently the Iraqi Government filed notice of appeal.
A hearing of this appeal took place in the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals on 18 February 2014.
The decision of the Court of Appeals is still awaited at the time of publication.
It is the Companys intention to continue to defend this action vigorously.
To the extent not already provided for, the directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.
Equity settled share-based payments LTIP There are three types of award which may be made under the LTIP to senior executives: performance shares, matching shares and investment shares.
Details of each award are outlined in the Remuneration report on pages 85 to 112.
The changes to the 2014 LTIP as described in the Directors Remuneration Policy on page 88 will take effect for the 2014 year end.

Financial assets & liabilities Financial risk management objectives & policies The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those relating to foreign currency, liquidity and credit risk.
Foreign currency transactional risk arises when operating subsidiaries enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies.
Translational risk arises on the translation of overseas earnings and investments into Sterling for consolidated reporting purposes.
Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract and liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its liabilities as they fall due.
In addition, the Group is subject to a degree of interest rate risk on its borrowings.
The Group uses financial assets and liabilities, including derivatives, to hedge certain foreign exchange and interest rate risks as set out below.
Foreign exchange risk policy Foreign currency transactional and translational risk could result in volatility in reported consolidated earnings and net assets.
In respect of transactional foreign currency risk, the Group maintains a policy that all operating units eliminate exposures on material committed transactions, usually by undertaking forward foreign currency contracts through the Groups treasury function.
In addition, it is Group policy that those companies where a significant concentration of foreign exchange risk has been identified may also apply hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39.
Therefore, some of the Groups forward foreign currency contracts form part of an effective cash flow hedge.
Exchange rate fluctuations in respect of the forward foreign currency contracts which form part of a cash flow hedge will have an impact on shareholders equity.
Exchange rate fluctuations in respect of the other forward foreign currency contracts will have an impact on profit or loss.
It is Group policy not to engage in any speculative transaction of any kind.
In respect of translational risk, the Group has a policy to partially hedge United States dollar US$ net assets exposure.
This is achieved through designating an element of US dollar borrowings, forward foreign currency contracts and cross currency swaps as net investment hedges against the Groups US dollar investments.
The Group does not hedge the translational exposure arising from profit and loss items.
Liquidity risk policy Liquidity risk could impact negatively on the Groups reputation, borrowing costs or ultimately its ability to continue as a going concern.
Liquidity risk is managed by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and ensuring that sufficient committed facilities are in place to meet possible downside scenarios.
The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts, bank loans and fixed rate notes.
Further details of the Groups borrowing facilities are disclosed in note 20. Credit risk policy Credit risk could have a negative impact on reported earnings and cash and consequently the liquidity of the Group.
The Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its financial instruments.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables with risk spread over a large number of countries and customers, with no significant concentration of risk.
Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risk by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance.
Credit worthiness checks are also undertaken with external credit rating agencies before entering into contracts with new customers and credit limits are set as appropriate and adhered to.
As shown in note 17, the trade receivables presented in the balance sheet are net of allowance for doubtful debts.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identifiable loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
The Groups exposure to the credit risk of financial institutions is limited by the adherence to counterparty limits, and by only trading with counterparties that have an investment grade credit rating or better at contract inception, based upon ratings provided by the major agencies.
Exposures to those counterparties are regularly reviewed and, when the market view of a counterpartys credit quality changes, adjusted as considered appropriate.
Accordingly in normal market conditions, the probability of material loss due to non-performance by counterparties is considered to be low.
Interest rate risk policy The Groups borrowings are in a combination of fixed and variable rates of interest.
Interest rate risk is regularly monitored to ensure that the mix of variable and fixed rate borrowing is appropriate for the Group in the short to medium-term.
Details of changes to the Groups loans and facilities has been included in note 20.
Net investment in foreign operations As at 3 January 2014, US dollar fixed rate notes of US$1,160.0m 2012: US$1,088.2m and US dollar variable rate loans of US$70.0m 2012: US$252.0m, both included in interest-bearing loans and borrowings, cross currency swaps of US$89.4m 2012: US$89.4m and net forward foreign currency liability contracts of US$170.4m 2012: US$48.0m have been designated as a hedge of the Groups exposure to translational foreign exchange risk on its net investments in Weir SPM, Weir Warman, Weir Seaboard, Weir Novatech and Weir Mathena.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings and contingent consideration and the fair value of the cross currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in these subsidiaries.

166 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Overview Strategic Review Operational Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings.
The derivative financial instruments are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs including spot and forward foreign exchange rates, interest rate curves, counterparty and own credit risk.
The fair value of cross currency swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on spot foreign exchange rates and counterparty and own credit risk.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on spot and forward foreign exchange rates.
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: Level 3: t echniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
At 3 January 2014 and 28 December 2012, the Group has classified contingent consideration as level 3.
A reconciliation of the movements in the contingent consideration fair value has been included in note 13.
During the 53 weeks ended 3 January 2014 and the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2012, there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements and no transfers into or out of level 3 fair value measurements.
The fair value of borrowings and obligations under finance leases is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.

Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year.
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax and equity through the impact on floating rate borrowings and cross currency swaps in respect of each currency to which the Group has a significant exposure to interest rate risk.

Financial assets & liabilities continued Effect of hedge & derivative financial instruments included in the income statement & equity The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge currency risk associated with expected future sales or purchases for which the Group has firm commitments.
The terms of the forward foreign currency contracts are negotiated to match the terms of the commitments.
During the period three subsidiaries within the Group have applied cash flow hedge accounting to these forward foreign currency transactions.
On 28 December 2012, the hedge relationships within LGE Process Ltd were discontinued on disposal of the company with the outstanding hedge reserve balance of 0.2m charged to the income statement at that time.
All other forward foreign currency contracts, while representing commercial hedges, are not subject to cash flow hedge accounting with all fair value movements being recognised in the income statement.
The net carrying amount, maturity dates and the amounts recognised for the period in profit or loss and equity for each derivative financial instrument are set out below.

172 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Overview Strategic Review Operational Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Foreign exchange risk The Group considers the most significant foreign exchange risk relates to the Australian dollar, Euro and United States dollar.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in these foreign currency exchange rates with all other variables held constant.
The sensitivity analysis shows the effect on profit or loss in respect of financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency, including payables, receivables, borrowings and forward foreign currency contracts but excluding all financial assets and liabilities qualified as either cash flow or net investment hedges.
The sensitivity analysis also shows the effect on equity in respect of financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency qualifying as either cash flow or net investment hedges including forward foreign currency contracts, borrowings and cross currency swaps.
The sensitivity analysis below has been presented to demonstrate the impact of a 25% strengthening of the relevant functional currency against the currencies shown below and therefore give an indication of the transactional foreign exposure that exists at a subsidiary level across the Group.

Capital management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains robust capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Group monitors capital using the following indicators.
Gearing ratio Gearing comprises net debt divided by total equity.
Net debt comprises cash and short-term deposits and interest-bearing loans and borrowings note 26.

For the purposes of the covenants required by the Groups lenders, the net debt is to be converted at the exchange rate used in the preparation of the Groups income statement and cash flows, ie.
In addition, profits of businesses acquired in the financial year have to be included as if the acquisitions occurred at the start of the financial year.
