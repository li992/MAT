Loans and other borrowings Capital management policy The objective of the groups capital management policy is to reduce net debt over time whilst investing in the business, supporting the pension scheme and paying progressive dividends.
In order to meet this objective, the group may issue or repay debt, issue new shares, repurchase shares, or adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders.
The group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the group.
The Board regularly reviews the capital structure.
No changes were made to these objectives and processes during 2012 13 and 2011 12.
For details of share issues and repurchases in the year see note 20.
The groups capital structure consists of net debt and shareholders equity.
The analysis below summarises the components which the group manages as capital.

Net debt Net debt consists of loans and other borrowings both current and non-current, less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents.
Loans and other borrowings are measured at the net proceeds raised, adjusted to amortise any discount over the term of the debt.
For the purpose of this measure, current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Currency denominated balances within net debt are translated to Sterling at swapped rates where hedged.
Net debt is considered to be an alternative performance measure as it is not dened in IFRS.
The most directly comparable IFRS measure is the aggregate of loans and other borrowings current and non-current, current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents.
A reconciliation from this measure, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to net debt is given below.

b The interest rate payable on this bond attracts an additional 1.25% for a downgrade by one credit rating category by either or both Moodys and S&P below Baa3 BBB, respectively.
c Designated in a fair value hedge relationship.
d The interest rate payable on this bond attracts an additional 0.25% for a downgrade by one credit rating by either Moodys or S&P to the groups senior unsecured debt below A3 Arespectively.
In addition, if Moodys or S&P subsequently increase the ratings then the interest rate will be decreased by 0.25% for each rating category upgrade by each rating agency.
In no event will the interest rate be reduced below the minimum rate reected in the above table.
