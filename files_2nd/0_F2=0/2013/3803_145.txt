104 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2013 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2013 16 Trade and other receivables continued Trade receivables The book value of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value due to the short term nature of the majority of the receivables.
Credit sales are only made after credit approval procedures have been completed satisfactorily.
The policy for making provisions for bad and doubtful debts varies from country to country as different countries and markets have different payment practices, but various factors are considered, including how overdue the debt is, the type of receivable and its past history, and current market and trading conditions.
Full provision is made for debts that are not considered to be recoverable.
There is limited concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables due to the diverse and unrelated nature of the Groups client base.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the provision for the impairment of receivables.
The book value of trade and other receivables represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
Trade receivable days for the continuing business at 30 September 2013 were 44 days 2012: 46 days.
