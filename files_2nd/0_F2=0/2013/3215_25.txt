Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Performance Measures Shareholder Information Financial Statements Ofgem Consolidated Segmental Statement INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE DIRECTORS OF CENTRICA PLC AND ITS LICENSEES We have audited the accompanying statement the Consolidated Segmental Statement or CSS of Centrica plc and its Licensees as listed in ii footnote as at 31 December 2013 in accordance with the terms of our agreement dated 12 December 2013 which was updated on 15 February 2014.
The CSS has been prepared by the Directors of Centrica plc and its Licensees based on the requirements of Ofgems Standard Condition 19A of the Gas and Electricity Supply Licences and Standard Condition 16B of the Electricity Generation Licences together, the Licences and the basis of preparation on pages 174 to 176.
Directors Responsibility The Directors are responsible for the preparation of the CSS in accordance with the Licences and the basis of preparation on pages 174 to 176 and for maintaining the underlying accounting records and such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the CSS that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the CSS based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing.
Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the CSS is free from material misstatement.
The materiality level that we used in planning and performing our audit is set at 30 million for each of the segments.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the CSS.
The procedures selected depend on the auditors judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the CSS, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation of the CSS in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control.
An audit also includes evaluating the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the CSS.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion In our opinion, the attached CSS of Centrica plc and its Licensees as at 31 December 2013 is prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with: i the requirements of Ofgems Standard Condition 19A of the Gas and Electricity Supply Licences and Standard Condition 16B of the Electricity Generation Licences established by the Regulator Ofgem: and ii the basis of preparation on pages 174 to 176.
Basis of Accounting and Restriction on Distribution Without modifying our opinion, we draw attention to pages 174 to 176 of the CSS, which describes the basis of preparation.
The CSS is prepared in order for Centrica plc and its Licensees to meet the Licence requirements of the Regulator Ofgem rather than in accordance with a generally accepted accounting framework.
The CSS should therefore be read in conjunction with both the Licences and the basis of preparation on pages 174 to 176.
This basis of preparation is not the same as segmental reporting under IFRS and or statutory reporting.
As a result, the schedule may not be suitable for another purpose.
This report, including our conclusions, has been prepared solely for the Directors of Centrica plc and its Licensees as a body in accordance with the agreement between us, to assist the Directors in reporting on the CSS to the Regulator Ofgem.
We permit this report to be disclosed in the Annual i Report and Accounts of Centrica plc for the year ended 31 December 2013 and the website www.
com prelims2013, to enable the Directors to show they have addressed their governance responsibilities by obtaining an independent assurance report in connection with the CSS.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Directors as a body and Centrica plc and its Licensees for our work or this report except where terms are expressly agreed between us in writing.
Other Matter The CSS for the year ended 31 December 2012, forming the corresponding figures of the CSS for the year ended 31 December 2013, are unaudited.
 LLP London 20 February 2014 i The maintenance and integrity of the Centrica plc website is the responsibility of the Directors of Centrica plc: the work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the CSS since it was initially presented on the website.

Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 | 173 Financial Statements Ofgem Consolidated Segmental Statement BASIS OF PREPARATION The following notes provide a summary of the basis of preparation of the 2013 submission.
The Ofgem CSS segments our Supply and Generation activities and provides a measure of profitability, weighted average cost of fuel, and volumes, in order to increase energy market transparency for consumers and other stakeholders.
These statements have been prepared by the Directors of Centrica plc and its Licensees in accordance with Standard Condition 16B of Electricity Generation Licences and Standard Condition 19A of the Electricity and Gas Supply Licences and the basis of preparation.
Throughout the basis of preparation the first paragraph number relates to the generation licence and the second to the supply licence conditions respectively.
The financial data provided has been taken from the relevant licensees and affiliates financial information for the year ended 31 December 2013, included in the Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 which has been prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards in accordance with paragraph 3 19A.
For the Generation segment, we have included the financial results from all activities that relate to our generation licences.
For clarity the following judgements have been made: Where a sub-segment eg Nuclear, Thermal or Renewables has undertaken trades to optimise the result of their underlying generation, the net revenue and result from these trades has been included in the CSS sub-segment as they are considered to be related to our generation licences.
The Group has a long-term tolling contract in respect of the Spalding power station, but does not specifically hold the generation licence.
This arrangement provides the Group with the right to nominate 100% of the plant capacity in return for a mix of capacity payments and operating payments.
We do not own the power station and the Group does not control the physical dispatch of the asset.
This contractual arrangement has been accounted for as a finance lease under IFRS and therefore the financial result and volume has been included in the Thermal sub-segment, within the Generation segment.
The Group has a 20% equity interest in eight nuclear power stations through its indirect investment in EDF Energy Nuclear Generation Limited.
Although we do not specifically hold a generation licence for any of the nuclear stations, our share of the financial result from this business including any contractual arrangements has been included in the Nuclear sub-segment and hence within the Generation segment.
The Group has equity interests in a number of wind farm joint ventures.
Although we do not specifically hold a generation licence for any of the wind farms owned by these entities, our gross share of the financial result from these businesses including any contractual arrangements has been included in the Renewables sub-segment and hence within the Generation segment.
As a voluntary disclosure, to aid transparency, the Midstream trading result including immaterial overseas activities has been reported in a separate column of the CSS Midstream.
Midstream includes the result of trading in physical and financial energy contracts power only for the purpose of making profits in their own right and other non-licenced activities see below.
This does not form part of either the Generation or Supply segment.
This means our CSS discloses all of the activities that have been included in the Centrica Energy Power segment of the Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 note 4.
Where power is purchased from third parties eg from wind farms, power stations or other bilateral arrangements and we do not have an equity interest in, or a finance leasing arrangement from an IFRS perspective over the assets that generate this power, the result related to these activities is excluded from the Generation segment but is included in our Midstream disclosure.
In all cases, the direct fuel costs and generation volumes are reported on a consistent basis ie if the purchase cost is a direct fuel cost, then the electricity generated is reported in volume.
As a voluntary disclosure, to aid comparability, a summarised 2012 CSS with margins has been included with the report.
Revenues Revenues, costs and profits of the Licensee have been defined below and prepared in compliance with the Groups accounting policies as detailed in notes 2, 3 and S2 of the Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013, except for joint ventures and associates which are presented gross in accordance with paragraph 4 a 19A.
Revenue from Sales of electricity and gas for the Supply segment is recognised on the basis of gas and electricity supplied during the period to both domestic and non-domestic customers.
Revenue from Sales of electricity and gas includes an assessment of energy supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end unread.
For the respective Supply segments this means electricity and gas sales.
Revenue for domestic supply is after deducting dual 1 fuel discounts where applicable, with the discount split evenly between electricity and gas.
All social costs eg Warm Home Discount, Winter Top- 1 1 Up and British Gas Energy Trust BGET are included in Environmental and social obligation costs and therefore are not deducted from revenue.
Revenue from Sales of electricity for the Generation segment is recognised on the basis of power supplied during the period.
Power purchases and sales entered into to optimise the performance of each of the power Generation segments are presented net within revenue.
LEC revenues associated with Renewables are included within Sales of electricity and gas because the certificates must be sold with the electricity.
Revenue from Sales of electricity and gas in Midstream relate to the sale of power procured under non-licenced activities power purchasing agreements PPAs and from overseas generation.
No tolling agreements exist between business segments.
The financial risks and rewards of owning and using the Groups power stations reside in the Generation segment.
1 In compliance with Ofgems additional guidance, social discounts have not been netted against revenue but included in Environmental and social obligation costs.
174 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Performance Measures Shareholder Information Financial Statements Ofgem Consolidated Segmental Statement BASIS OF PREPARATION Other respective segmental revenues not related to the sale of gas or power have been separately disclosed.
Other revenues include: 106 million in Renewables principally relating to the sale of ROCs, services provided to joint ventures and from sub-leasing a turbine installation ship: 10 million in Non-Domestic Electricity Supply relating to connections and metering installations: 39 million in both Domestic Gas and Electricity Supply respectively relating to New Housing Connections and a variety of new technology investments including smart meter installations: and 40 million in Midstream predominantly relating to the net result of trading in physical and financial energy contracts both realised settled and unrealised fair value changes for the purpose of making profits in their own right, net of broker costs.
Direct fuel costs Direct fuel costs for both Generation and Supply include electricity, gas, carbon, nuclear fuel and imbalance costs.
Energy supply to Domestic and Non-Domestic energy customers is procured at a market referenced price, through a combination of Bilateral, OTC and Exchange based trades contracts see table below.
Where energy is procured from within the Group it is also at a market referenced 2 price on an OTC basis except for a small number of bilateral off-take contracts between wind farm joint ventures and the Supply segments.
The market referenced prices used are those prevailing at the time of procurement, which may differ from the price prevailing at the time of supply.
Domestic and Non-Domestic fixed price products are hedged based upon anticipated demand at the start of the contract period.
The majority of the gas and power for Non-Domestic energy and Domestic energy tariff products is purchased in advance see table below.
The exact purchasing patterns vary in response to the outlook for commodity markets and commercial factors.
The Generation segment purchases gas and sells all of its energy at market referenced prices.
Gas for CCGTs is procured at market referenced prices through a combination of OTC and Exchange based trades contracts.
The cost to the power stations will reflect market referenced prices at the time of procurement, and so may differ from the price prevailing at the time of physical supply.
For the Midstream segment, any procurement of gas for overseas generation is reported as part of direct costs and not within direct fuel costs.
How we procure electricity, gas and carbon: Long form bilateral Individually negotiated contracts with non-standardised terms and conditions which may relate to size, duration or flexibility.
contracts Bilateral Pricing is predominantly indexed to published market referenced prices, adjusted for transfer of risks, cost of carry and administration.
Over-the-counter Broker supported market of standardised products, predominantly performed via screen based trading.
These transactions OTC are between two parties, leaving both parties exposed to the others default with no necessary intermediation of any exchange.
An internal over-the-counter price may be provided where market liquidity prevents external trading, with prices that are reflective of market conditions at the time of execution.
Exchange Regulated electronic platform notably ICE, APX, and N2EX where standardised products are traded on exchange through Exchange the intermediary of the clearing house which becomes the counterparty to the trade.
Membership of a clearing house is required which entails posting of cash or collateral as margin.
WACOF WACOE WACOG: For Generation this represents the weighted average input cost of gas, carbon and nuclear fuel, shown as MWh, used by the generation business.
For Supply this covers the wholesale energy cost including the costs associated with the EU ETS and the Carbon Price Floor, the energy element of  RBD costs and balancing and shaping costs incurred by the Supply licensees.
Again, gas and electricity is procured at market referenced prices through a combination of Bilateral, OTC and Exchange based trades contracts.
The cost for the Supply business will reflect market referenced prices at the time of procurement, and so may differ from the price prevailing at the time of physical supply.
Where gas is procured using predominantly indexed Bilateral contracts, the fuel cost is then allocated between Domestic and Non-Domestic Supply using a consistent, fixed percentage based on the historic split of tariff book volumes.
Gas and Electricity balancing costs are allocated between Domestic and Non-Domestic Supply based on their respective volumes multiplied by an appropriate industry referenced price eg APX or SAP.
Direct costs Direct costs for Supply and Generation are broken down into network costs, environmental and social obligation costs and other direct costs.
Network costs for Supply and Generation include transportation costs, BSUOS and the transport element of RBD costs.
2 Internal power off-take contracts long-term power and associated renewable certificate sales from Generation owned assets to Domestic and Non-Domestic Electricity Supply.
Pricing is indexed to published market prices, adjusted for the transfer of risks specific to the asset.
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 | 175 Financial Statements Ofgem Consolidated Segmental Statement BASIS OF PREPARATION 1 1 Environmental and social obligation costs for Domestic Supply include ROCs, CERT, CESP, FIT, ECO, Warm Home Discount, Winter Top-Up 1 and BGET.
Non-Domestic Supply includes the cost of LECs, ROCs and FIT.
Within the Domestic and Non-Domestic segments, the costs of LECs, FIT and ROCs are included within Electricity, and ECO, CERT and CESP are allocated between Electricity and Gas based on the relevant legislation.
Warm Home Discount, Winter Top-Up and BGET are charged specifically to each fuel.
Other direct costs for Generation include employees, maintenance and ship charter costs.
Other direct costs for Supply relate to broker costs and sales commissions in Non-Domestic Gas and Electricity Supply.
Other direct costs for Midstream principally relate to the costs of purchasing power under other non-licenced activities PPAs and from procuring gas for overseas generation.
Indirect costs Indirect costs for Supply and Generation include operating costs such as sales and marketing, bad debt, credit balances, costs to serve, IT, staffing and billing and metering costs including smart meter costs.
Indirect costs for the Generation, Domestic and Non-Domestic Supply segments including corporate and business unit recharges are allocated based on relevant drivers which include turnover, headcount, operating profit, net book value of fixed assets and proportionate use benefit.
For Supply, indirect costs including corporate recharges are primarily allocated between Electricity and Gas on the basis of customer numbers Domestic and sites Non-Domestic.
Indirect costs for Midstream relate to employee, IT and property costs.
Other For Supply, depreciation and amortisation is allocated between Electricity and Gas on the basis of customer numbers Domestic and sites Non-Domestic.
Generation segment EBIT excludes 61 million of depreciation of fair value uplifts to property, plant and equipment relating to the strategic investment in British Energy referred to as Lake Acquisitions Limited in this document.
For further details of this adjustment see notes 2, 4, 6 and 10 of the Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013.
For the purposes of Supply PAT, tax is allocated between Gas and Electricity within both Domestic and Non-Domestic Supply based on their relative proportions of EBIT.
Note 4 c of the Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 provides details of the adjusted operating profit after tax of the British Gas Residential energy supply and British Gas Business energy supply and services operating segments.
Transfer pricing for electricity, gas and generation licensees in accordance with paragraph 4 d 19A.
4 d : 2 There are no specific energy supply agreements between the Generation and Supply segments apart from a small number of bilateral off-take contracts between wind farm joint ventures and Domestic and Non-Domestic Electricity Supply segments.
Treatment of joint ventures and associates The share of results of joint ventures and associates for the year ended 31 December 2013 principally arises from its interests in the entities listed on page 170.
Under paragraph 5 of the Conditions, the information provided in the CSS includes our share of revenues, costs, profits and volumes of joint ventures and associates.
In preparing the CSS, joint ventures and associates which hold a UK generation licence or exemption are accounted for as follows: our proportionate share of revenues of joint ventures and associates has been included within revenue: our proportionate share of the profit before tax of joint ventures and associates has been included within EBIT and EBITDA: and our proportionate share of the generation volumes of joint ventures and associates has been included within the generation volumes.
For each of the above items, our share of the income and expenses of the joint ventures or associates has been combined line by line within the relevant item of the CSS.
The Supply segment has an investment in an associate but because the investees business does not relate to the sale of gas and electricity, the share of result 8 million revenue, EBIT loss of 7 million has been included net within indirect costs rather than gross, on a line by line basis.
Exceptional items and certain re-measurements Mark to market adjustments, profits or losses on disposal, restructuring costs, and impairment charges that have been identified in the Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 are excluded from the CSS.
For further details of excluded exceptional items and certain re-measurements see note 7 in the Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013.
The Renewables sub-segment result includes a net 11 million loss: being a net 23 million profit on disposal of Braes of Doune Wind Farm Scotland Limited and Centrica RBW Limited, offset by a 25 million impairment of the Groups investment in Celtic Array Limited and a 9 million impairment in our Renewable joint venture businesses.
These results have been included in the Generation segment as they are not exceptional in size, nature or incidence, and do not materially change the Generation result.
This is in line with the Groups established wind farm strategy to realise value, share risk and reduce our capital requirements as individual projects develop, which may involve bringing in partners at an appropriate stage or full disposal.
The Supply segment includes a number of impairment losses totalling 18 million.
These losses have been included in the Supply results as they are not exceptional in size, nature or incidence, and do not materially change the result.
A reconciliation of the Segmental Statement revenue, EBIT and depreciation to the 2013 audited Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts has been included in accordance with paragraph 4 b & c 19A.
