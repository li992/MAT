fr If you have been nominated to receive general shareholder communications directly from HSBC Holdings, it is important to remember that your main contact for all matters relating to your investment remains the registered shareholder, or perhaps custodian or broker, who administers the investment on your behalf.
Therefore any changes or queries relating to your personal details and holding including any administration thereof must continue to be directed to your existing contact at your investment manager or custodian.
HSBC Holdings cannot guarantee dealing with matters directed to it in error.
