19 Segmental Reporting The Group has identified three operating segments as strategic business units that offer different products and services.
They are managed separately because of the differences in the products and services provided.
They are, however, all complementary to the core business of investing in various asset classes to generate increasing value over the long term.
The Groups primary operating segments are the Company, Alliance Trust Savings ATS and Alliance Trust Investments ATI.
The disclosures below for ATI do not include the unit creations and cancellations in the ATIF since these do not have any impact on the operational performance of the Company.
The Company is a self-managed investment trust.
ATS provides share dealing and pension administration services.
ATI is an investment management company.
ATI earns net revenue on the capital invested by Alliance Trust in the funds it manages with such fees market referenced to that appropriate for a seed capital investor.
Alliance Trust includes such fees in its Administrative expenses.
The costs of the Fixed Income and the SRI team from August 2012 are charged 100% to ATI.
The costs of the Global team who also manage the equity portfolio of Alliance Trust are split between ATI and Alliance Trust according to the average assets under administration during the year.
ATS bears its own direct costs.
Both ATS and ATI are also allocated a share of indirect expenses according either to the subsidiaries service usage or according to average headcount.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.
The Group evaluates performance based on the profit before tax.
Intersegment sales and transfers are accounted for on an arms length basis.
All operating segments operate within the United Kingdom.
