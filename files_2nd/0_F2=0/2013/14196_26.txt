COM ANNUAL REPORT 2013 SHIRE PLC 159 Other financial information continued Non GAAP Measures Non GAAP financial measures are used by the Companys management to make operating decisions because they facilitate internal comparisons of the Companys performance to historical results and to competitors results.
The Companys Remuneration Committee uses certain key Non GAAP measures when assessing the performance and compensation of employees, including Shires Executive Directors.
The Non GAAP measures are presented in this Annual Report as the Companys management believe that they will provide investors with a means of evaluating, and an understanding of how Shires management evaluates, Shires performance and results on a comparable basis that is not otherwise apparent on a US GAAP basis, since many non-recurring, infrequent or non-cash items that Shires management believe are not indicative of the core performance of the business may not be excluded when preparing financial measures under US GAAP.
These Non GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, as substitutes for, or superior to financial measures prepared in accordance with US GAAP.
Where applicable the following items, including their tax effect, have been excluded from both 2013 and 2012 Non GAAP earnings: Amortization and asset impairments: Intangible asset amortization and impairment charges: and Other than temporary impairment of investments.
Acquisitions and integration activities: Up-front payments and milestones in respect of in-licensed and acquired products: Costs associated with acquisitions, including transaction costs, fair value adjustments on contingent consideration and acquired inventory: Costs associated with the integration of companies: and Noncontrolling interests in consolidated variable interest entities.
Divestments, reorganizations and discontinued operations: Gains and losses on the sale of non-core assets: Costs associated with restructuring and reorganization activities: Termination costs: and Income losses from discontinued operations.
Legal and litigation costs: Net legal costs related to the settlement of litigation, government investigations and other disputes excluding internal legal team costs.
Depreciation, which is included in Cost of product sales, R&D and SG&A costs in our US GAAP results, has been separately disclosed for the presentation of 2013 and 2012 Non GAAP earnings.
Cash generation represents net cash provided by operating activities, excluding up-front and milestone payments for in-licensed and acquired products, tax and interest payments.
Free cashflow represents net cash provided by operating activities, excluding up-front and milestone payments for in-licensed and acquired products, but including capital expenditure in the ordinary course of business.
Non GAAP adjusted ROIC aims to measure true underlying economic performance of the Group, by making a number of adjustments to ROIC as derived from Shires Non GAAP financial results including: Adding back to Non GAAP operating income all R&D expenses and operating lease costs incurred in the period: Capitalizing on the Groups balance sheet historic, cumulative R&D, IPR&D, intangible asset impairment charges and operating lease costs which previously have been expensed: Deducting from Non GAAP operating income an amortization charge for the above capitalized costs, based on the estimated commercial lives of the relevant products: Excluding the income statement and balance sheet impact of non-operating assets such as surplus cash and non-strategic investments : and Taxing the resulting adjusted operating income at the underlying Non GAAP tax rate.
Non GAAP EBITDA represents Non GAAP operating income before depreciation.
