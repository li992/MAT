FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION 122 NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the combined financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 12 Acquisitions During the year a number of acquisitions were made for a total consideration of 239m 2012: 341m, after taking account of net cash acquired of 14m 2012: 12m.
The net assets of the businesses acquired are incorporated at their fair value to the combined businesses.
Provisional fair values of the consideration given and of the assets and liabilities acquired are summarised below: Fair Fair value value 2013 2012 m m Goodwill 157 165 Intangible assets 133 229 Property, plant & equipment 1 Current assets 9 21 Current liabilities 21 61 Borrowings Current tax 2 Deferred tax 39 16 Net assets acquired 239 341 Consideration after taking account of 14m 2012: 12m net cash acquired 239 341 Less: consideration deferred to future years 36 23 Less: acquisition date fair value of equity interest 9 42 Net cash flow 194 276 Goodwill, being the excess of the consideration over the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, represents benefits which do not qualify for recognition as intangible assets, including the ability of a business to generate higher returns than individual assets, skilled workforces, acquisition synergies that are specific to Reed Elsevier, and high barriers to market entry.
In addition, goodwill arises on the recognition of deferred tax liabilities in respect of intangible assets for which amortisation does not qualify for tax deductions.
The fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired are provisional pending the completion of the valuation exercises.
Final fair values will be incorporated in the 2014 combined financial statements.
There were no significant adjustments to the provisional fair values of prior year acquisitions established in 2012.
The businesses acquired in 2013 contributed 27m to revenue, increased adjusted operating profit by 8m, increased adjusted net profit by 8m, decreased net profit by 1m, and contributed a net cash outflow of 3m from operating activities for the part year under Reed Elsevier ownership and before taking account of acquisition financing costs.
Had the businesses been acquired at the beginning of the year, on a pro forma basis the Reed Elsevier revenues, adjusted operating profit, adjusted net profit attributable to parent companies shareholders and net profit attributable to parent companies shareholders for the year would have been 6,067m, 1,751m, 1,199m and 1,112m respectively before taking account of acquisition financing costs.
