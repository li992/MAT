Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the group will notbe able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the incomestatement.
Book value approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of the receivables and the low interest environment in which they are held.
There is limited concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables due to the groups customer base being large and diverse.
The maximum amount of credit risk with respect to customers is represented by the carrying amount on the balance sheet.
Customer credit facilities for new customers are approved by designated managers at business level.
Credit limits are set with reference to trading history and reports from credit rating agencies.
Overdue accounts are regularly reviewed and impairment provisions are created where necessary with due regard to the historical risk profile of the customer.
There were no new customers in 2013 where the group considered there was a risk of significant credit default.
There are no trade receivables that would otherwise be past due or impaired whose terms have been renegotiated.

Provisions for other liabilities and charges Vacant property, environmental, self-insurance and other provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and if this amount is capable of being reliably estimated.
If such an obligation isnot capable of being reliably estimated it is classified as a contingent liability.
When the effect of the time value of money is material, provision amounts are calculated on the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.
The present value is calculated using forward market interest rates, as measured at the balance sheet reporting date, which have been adjusted for risks already reflected in future cash flow estimates.

The total future minimum sub-lease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable sub-leases at 31 December 2013 is 4.9m 2012: 4.5m.
Environmental The group owns a number of properties in the UK, Europe and the US where there is land contamination and provisions are held for the remediation of such contamination.
These provisions are expected to be substantially utilised within the next ten years.
Self-insurance The group purchases external insurance from a portfolio of international insurers for its key insurable risks.
Historically the group self-insured its risks.
During the latter part of 2008, other than for third party motor liability UK & US, workers compensation US and the global property damage business interruption, this practice was stopped and these became fully covered in the insurance market.
Provision is still held for self-insured past cover, primarily in relation to workers compensation US.
For the continuing self-insured programmes, individual claims are met in full by the group up to agreed self-insured limits in order to limit volatility in claims.
The calculated cost of self-insurance claims is based on an actuarial assessment of claims incurred at the balance sheet date and is accumulated as claims provisions.

Employee benefit expense a Profit-sharing and bonus plans The group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing, based on a formula that takes into consideration the probability of certain performance criteria being achieved.
A provision is recognised where a contractual obligation exists or where past practice indicates that there is a constructive obligation to make such payments in the future.
b Holiday pay Paid holidays are regarded as an employee benefit and as such are charged to the income statement as the benefits are earned.
An accrual is made at the balance sheet date to reflect the fair value of holidays earned but not yet taken.
c Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when an employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits.
The group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either: terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal: or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the balance sheet date are discounted to present value where the effect of discounting is material.

Retirement benefit obligations Apart from the legally required social security state schemes, the group operates a number of pension schemes around the world covering manyof its employees.
The principal pension scheme in the group is the Rentokil Initial Pension Scheme RIPS in the UK which has a number of defined benefit sections, which are now closed to new entrants other than the Initial No 2 Section, accounting for 0.5% of the total schemes liabilities, which remains open, and a defined contribution section.
The defined benefit scheme is funded through payments to a trustee-administered fund, determined by periodic actuarial calculations.
A number of much smaller defined benefit and defined contribution schemes operate elsewhere which are also funded through payments to trustee-administered funds or insurance companies.
Defined benefit pension plans A defined benefit pension plan is a plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The asset or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
The group will recognise a pension surplus as an asset where there is an unconditional right to a refund or where the group has a right to reduce future pension contributions.
Current and past service costs, to the extent they have vested, and curtailments are recognised as charges or credits against operating profit inthe income statement.
Interest costs on the net defined benefit obligation are recognised in finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses arisingfrom experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Defined contribution pension plans A defined contribution plan is apension plan under which the group pays fixed contributions into aseparate entity.
The group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
Thegroup has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
Other post-employment obligations Some group companies provide post-employment healthcare benefits to their retirees.
The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional onthe employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period.
The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using an accounting methodology similar to that used for defined benefit pension plans.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, and changes in actuarial assumptions, are charged or credited to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Rentokil Initial Pension Scheme RIPS The assets of the RIPS are legally separated from the group.
The Trustee of the pension fund is Rentokil Initial Pension Trustee Limited.
TheBoard comprises six Company nominated directors and three member nominated directors.
The Trustee is required by law to act in the bestinterests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies e. g. investment, contribution and indexation policies of the scheme.
Actuarial valuations of the UK scheme are usually carried out every three years.
At 31 December 2013 the groups UK defined benefit pension scheme, which is closed to new members, was valued at an accounting surplus of 70.6m on the groups balance sheet.
The trustees value the scheme on a different basis and are currently in the process of finalising the 31 March 2013 valuation with the Company.
On this valuation basis the plan is 99% funded with an estimated deficit of 18m.
It has been agreed that this deficit is anticipated to be met by the investment return on pension assets over the period of the recovery plan but, in order to mitigate the risk that it does not, annual contributions of c. 3m perannum over the next six years, with the first payment made by March 2014, will be paid into a joint escrow account by the group.
In the event that the deficit is not cleared by the time of the 31 March 2019 valuation it will be funded from the escrow account.
The group has recognised the pension surplus as an asset because the group has a right to reduce future pension contributions.
The group has put in place a guarantee in favour of the Trustee of the RIPS which provides that the group willmake payments to the scheme up to a maximum amount equal to the lowest non-negative amount which, when added to the assets of the scheme, would result in the scheme being at least105% funded on the date on which any liability arises, calculated on the basis set out in s. 179 of the Pensions Act 2004.
This amount will vary and is in any event capped at 219m, the amount assessed at 31 March 2009.
The provision of the guarantee is reviewed on anannual basis.
indd 95 31 03 2014 23:37 96 Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts Notes to the Accounts continued The defined benefit schemes are reappraised bi-annually by independent actuaries based upon actuarial assumptions in accordance with IAS 19R requirements.
The assumptions used for the UK RIPS scheme are shown below.
2013 2012 Weighted average % Discount rate 4.4% 4.4% Future salary increases 4.3% 3.9% Future pension increases 3.4% 3.1% RPI inflation 3.6% 3.2% CPI inflation 2.6% 2.5% Risks The scheme exposes the Company to a number of risks, the most significant of which are: Asset volatility The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
The scheme holds a significant proportion of growth assets equities, diversified growth fund and global absolute return fund which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term.
Theallocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the schemes long-term objectives.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the schemes liabilities for accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings.
Inflation risk A significant proportion of the schemes benefit obligations are linked to inflation and higher inflation will give rise to higher liabilities although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.
The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
Profile of the scheme The defined benefit obligation includes benefits for current employees, former employees and current pensioners.
Broadly, about 40% of the liabilities are attributable to former employees and 60% to current pensioners.
The scheme duration is an indicator of the weighted-average time until benefit payments are made.
For the scheme as a whole, the duration is around 18 years.
There have been no significant changes to the membership of the scheme over the year.
Mortality assumptions The mortality assumptions are based on the recent actual mortality experience of scheme members, and allow for expected future improvements in mortality rates.
The mortality tables used are: 94% of the SAPS All base tables for male pensioners and male and female dependents: 106% of the SAPS All base tables for female pensioners: 104% of the SAPS All base tables for male non-pensioners: and 107% of the SAPS All base tables for female non-pensioners.
This equates to an assumption that a man currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 22.8 years.
Further improvements are made in line with CMI 2013 Core Projections with a long-term rate of future improvement of 1.25% p. a.

During the year the Trustee of the RIPS exited the funding trade it had with Barclays releasing 610.0m and as a result the investment strategy of the scheme was revisited.
Thetransition to the new strategy is still on going.
The target portfolio remains unchanged at: 25% in return seeking assets 75% in matching assets The schemes liability hedge is made up of interest rate and inflation swaps, corporate bonds, fixed gilts and LPI swaps.
The overall objective of the hedge is to match 85% of the interest rate and inflation sensitivity of the schemes liabilities c. 100% of assets.
The current portfolios return seeking assets consist of diversified growth funds 18% and global equities 11%.
Diversified growth funds invest in a range of asset classes including developed equities, emerging market equities, hedge funds, infrastructure, commodities, private equity, property, high yield credit, emerging market debt, investment grade credit, reinsurance and leveraged loans.
Matching assets consist of 39% gilts, 9% UK credit, 8% global credit and 15% cash and swaps.
The actual holdings in return seeking assets are currently higher than the target portfolio.
This is monitored on a regular basis, and there are no plans to rebalance at present.

Share-based payments Share-based compensation The group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
The economic cost of awarding shares and share options to employees is recognised as an expense in the income statement equivalent to the fair value of the benefit awarded.
The fair value is determined by reference to option pricing models, principally Monte Carlo and adjusted Black-Scholes models.
The charge is recognised in the income statement over the vesting period of the award.
At each balance sheet date, the group revises its estimate of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
Any revision to the original estimates is reflected in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity immediately to the extent it relates to past service and the remainder over the rest of the vesting period.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
The Company has share option schemes for approximately 500 senior executives worldwide.
The exercise price for share options is the mid-market closing price immediately preceding the date of grant.
The total net charge for the year relating to equity-settled share-based payment plans was 2.0m 2012: 3.9m.
Executive Share Option Schemes No awards have been made under these schemes since 2005.
Grants of share options under the Discretionary Approved and Discretionary Schemes the Discretionary Schemes are calculated by reference to base salaries and management grade in the Company.
There were two levels of qualification under the Discretionary Schemes.
Level 1 applied to senior executives including executive directors and all awards have now lapsed.
Level 2 schemes applied to executive directors and sector managing directors and are summarised as follows: The exercise condition under Level 2 is by reference to total shareholder return, i. e. the appreciation of the share price including reinvested dividends in comparison with the performance of the FTSE 100 index and a defined group of support services companies being used as comparators, during three consecutive calendar years commencing in the year in which the option is granted, on the following basis: If the Company achieves a median performance in relation to the FTSE 100 index, then 25% of the Level 2 share options will vest, rising pro rata to 50% if the Company achieves a performance in the upper quartile of the FTSE 100 and, in addition, if the Company achieves a median performance in the group of support services companies, then 25% of the Level 2 share options will vest, rising pro rata to 50% if the Company achieves a performance in the upper quartile in the group of support services companies.

The share price condition was based on the highest average share price of Rentokil Initial plc over any 60 consecutive dealing days during the initial three-year period.
The performance period for the share price element of the award began on 1 April 2008 and ended 61 dealing days following the announcement of the Companys results for the financial year ended 31December 2010.
The annual bonus multiplier measured the extent to which the annual bonus targets had been achieved in respect of each financial year during the performance period.
The 2008 awards in the above table reflect that during the first half of 2010 the Companys share price achieved a 60 day highest average price of 130.82p.
Participants were entitled to the value of dividends that were paid during the vesting period on the number of shares that ultimately vested, in the form of additional shares transferred at the end of the vesting period.
The performance conditions for the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 awards are total shareholder return TSR and the financial performance bonus multiplier of the group, division or business whichever is applicable to the award holder.
The performance condition for the 2013 award for participants below the Board and Executive Leadership Team level is solely relative TSR performance.
The TSR condition is measured relative to the TSR achieved by constituents of a comparator group, made up of the FTSE 350 companies at the date of grant but excluding financial services, primary resource and property sector companies.
The performance period for the share price element of the 2013 award began on 1 April 2013, running to 31 March 2016.
The TSR performance is measured using a three-month average with the start period average being 1 January 2013 to 31 March 2013 and the end period average being 1January 2016 to 31 March 2016.
For the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 awards the annual bonus multiplier measures the extent to which the annual bonus targets have been achieved in respect of each financial year during the performance period.
The 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 awards in the above table assume a TSR performance in the upper quartile or above is reached at the end of the vesting period and that participants achieve their target bonus in each of the three years over the vesting period.
For the 2009 and 2010 awards no shares will vest if the share price does not reach median TSR performance at the end of the vesting period and 200% will vest if the TSR performance is above the upper quartile and all participants attain maximum bonus targets.
For the 2011, 2012 and 2013 awards no shares will vest if the share price does not reach median TSR performance at the end of the vesting period and 150% will vest if the TSR performance is above the upper quartile and all participants attain maximum bonus targets.
Participants are entitled to the value of dividends that are paid during the vesting period on the number of shares that ultimately vest, in the form of additional shares transferred at the end of the vesting period.
The fair value of the 2013 awards made under the 2006 Performance Share Plan is charged to the income statement over the vesting period based on values derived from a model developed by Deloitte LLP.
This is a closed-form solution similar to a Monte Carlo simulation which takes account of the correlation between share price performance and the likelihood of a TSR performance condition being met.
For the shares awarded on 30 April 2013, the significant inputs into the model were a share price of 0.96p 2012: 83.15p, an expected share price volatility of 30%, a share price correlation of the companies in the comparator group of 26% and an expected life commensurate with the performance vesting period.
The share price volatility assumption is based on analysis of historical daily share prices.
As the awards are nil-cost i. e. there is no exercise price, the assumed risk-free rate of return has minimal impact on the fair value of the awards.
Similarly, as dividend equivalents are paid on the vesting portion of awards, the fair value of these awards is not reduced to reflect dividends paid during the vesting period.
The fair value of shares granted during 2013 was 8.1m.
2008 Share Incentive Plan In 2008 the Company also introduced a long-term incentive plan for the Chairman, Chief Executive and one other executive director and granted 22,500,000 shares during the year.

This was measured on the basis of an average share price over 60 consecutive trading days during the performance measurement period.
Until a minimum share price of 120p per share was met over a sustained period, noshares are earned.
At 120p per share, 20% of the award would be earned, rising on a straight-line basis to full vesting at a share price of 180pper share.
For achieving growth in market value between a share price of 180p per share and 280p per share further shares would be earned up to a maximum of a further 50% of the original award.
The 2008 awards in the same table assumed an on target share price of 180pper share is reached at the end of the vesting period.
Up to one third of the award would vest following the end of the third year, another onethird following the end of the fourth year and a further one third following the end of the fifth year, based on the extent to which performance targets were achieved.
Any unvested portion of the award following the end of the fifth year lapsed.
Participants were entitled to the value of dividends that are paid during the vesting period on the number of shares that ultimately vest, in the form of additional shares transferred at the end of the vesting period.
See the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 55 to 72 for further details.
The fair value of the 2008 awards made under the Rentokil Initial 2008 Share Incentive Plan is charged to the income statement over the vesting period based on values derived from a bespoke Monte Carlo simulation model.
The significant inputs into the model were a share price of 102p, an expected share price volatility of 21%, an expected dividend yield of 5% per annum and an expected life commensurate with the performance vesting period.
The share price volatility assumption is based on analysis of historical daily share prices measured until October 2007 therefore excluding the significant volatility during the last months of 2007, which the Company would not expect going forward.
During the first half of 2010 the Companys share price achieved a 60-day highest average price of 130.82p and therefore under the terms of the plan, 34.43% of the award vested with participants receiving one third of the award in May 2012, and being entitled to a second third a year later and the balance in June 2013.
Additional amounts could have been earned based on share price appreciation beyond the 130.82p level during the remaining life of the scheme.
The final one third of 907,470 including dividend equivalents per participant were released on 14June 2013 third vesting date.
The total of vested shares including dividend equivalents for each participant was 2,667,318.
Participants have 12 months from 14 June 2013 from which to call for their vested shares.

Income tax expense The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity.
In this case the tax is also recognised in equity.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Companys subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.
It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

indd 102 31 03 2014 23:37 Financial Statements Additional Information Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts 103 A deferred tax asset of 16.0m has been recognised in respect of UK tax losses carried forward as at 31 December 2013.
This amount has beencalculated by estimating the future UK taxable profits for 2014 to 2016, against which the UK tax losses will be utilised, and applying thetaxrates substantively enacted as at the balance sheet date applicable for each year.
Following the sale of City Link in April 2013 the groupisexpected to make taxable profits in the UK in the future.
Remaining UK tax losses of 312.9m have not been recognised as at 31December2013.
As a substantial proportion of profits are generated outside the UK, the standard rate of tax has been determined as the weighted average of the standard rates of tax in each of the different countries where profits are generated.
The relevant rates were approximately 27% 2012:28%.
The 2013 Budget on 20 March 2013 announced that the UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 21% effective from 1 April 2014 and 20% effective from 1 April 2015 and both rate changes were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013.
This will reduce the Companys future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax liability at 31 December 2013 has been calculated based on the rate of 20% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilitiesand their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, if the deferred income tax arises from initial recognition ofan asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither the accounting nor thetaxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted orsubstantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of thereversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.

Business combinations Under the requirements of IFRS 3, all business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method acquisition accounting.
The cost of a business combination is the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the acquirer.
The cost of a business combination is allocated at the acquisition date by recognising the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that satisfy the recognition criteria, at their fair values at that date.
The acquisition date is the date on which the acquirer effectively obtains control of the acquiree.
An intangible asset is recognised if it meets the definition of an intangible asset in IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
The intangible assets identified in all acquisitions made since 1 January 1998 are goodwill, customer lists and relationships, brands, reacquired franchise rights and contract portfolios.
Consideration in excess of net identifiable assets acquired in respect of non-controlling interests in existing subsidiary undertakings is taken directly to reserves.
Deferred and contingent consideration are accounted for at fair value at the acquisition date with subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration being recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Costs directly attributable to business combinations made after 1 January 2010 are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Costs directlyattributable to business combinations prior to this date were included as part of the purchase price of the business combination.
The group purchased 100% of the share capital or the trade and assets of 12 smaller companies and businesses.

Discontinued operations and disposals A discontinued operation is a component of an entity which has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale, which represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, and is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate line of business or geographical area of operations.
On 26 April 2013 the group sold the City Link division.
The division was not previously classified as held for sale or as a discontinued operation.
The comparative consolidated income statement has been re-presented to show the discontinued operation separately from continuing operations.
Management committed to a plan to sell this division early in 2013, following a decision to concentrate on the groups core international businesses in pest control, hygiene and workwear.

Disposal group held for sale Non-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, are classified as held for sale if it is highly probable that the carrying value will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use.
Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets, or components of a disposal group, are remeasured in accordance with the groups other accounting policies.
Thereafter generally, the assets, or disposal group, are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Any impairment loss on a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill and then to the remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis.
Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised in the income statement.
Gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss.
Once classified as held for sale, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are no longer amortised or depreciated.

Intangible assets Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, where applicable.
The main categories of intangible assets are as follows: Intangible assets indefinite useful lives Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary associate at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill in respect of business combinations made since 1January 1998 is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill on the acquisition of associates is included in investments in associates.
Goodwill in respect of the acquisition of subsidiaries made prior to 1 January 1998 remains eliminated against reserves.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment losses previously recognised are not reversed.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Intangible assets finite useful lives Intangible assets with finite useful lives are initially measured at either cost or fair value and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives, which are reviewed on an annual basis.
The fair value attributable to intangible assets acquired through a business combination is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows to be generated from that asset at the risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital for the group.
The residual values of intangible assets are assumed to be nil.
The estimated useful economic lives of intangible assets are as follows: Customer lists and relationships 5 to 16 years Brands and patents 2 to 15 years Computer software 3 to 5 years Product development up to 5 years The following are the main categories of intangible assets: Customer lists and relationships Customer lists and portfolios acquired are initially measured at fair value and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives.
Separate values are not attributed to internally generated customer lists or relationships.
Brands Brands acquired as part of a business combination are initially measured at fair value and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives.
Expenditure incurred to develop, maintain and renew brands internally is recognised as an expense in the period incurred.
Separate values are not attributed to internally generated brands.

Costs incurred on development projects relating to the design and testing of new or improved products are recognised as intangible assets when it is probable that the project will be a success considering its commercial and technological feasibility and only if the cost can be measured reliably.
Capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Other development expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Development costs that have been capitalised are amortised from the date the product is available for use on a straight-line basis over the period of its expected benefit.
Computer software Acquired computer software is capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software, and is amortised over its estimated useful life.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the group, and that are expected to generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets.
Direct costs include the software development and employee costs.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programs are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives.

The cash flow projections are based on financial budgets and long-range plans approved by management and the Board covering a three-year period which are prepared as part of the groups normal planning process.
Cash flows for years four and five use managements expectation of sales growth, operating costs and margin, based on past experience and expectations regarding future performance and profitability for each CGU.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using estimated long-term growth rates.
The key assumptions used by individual CGUs for value-in-use calculations were long-term growth rates of between 2% and 4% 2012:2%and 4% and pre-tax discount rates of between 10% and 14% 2012: 10% and 14%.
The key assumptions used by the US Pest Control CGU were a long-term growth rate of 3% 2012: 2% and a pre-tax discount rate of 14% 2012: 14%.
The growth rates used by individual CGUs are based on the long-term growth rates predicted for the relevant sector and country in which a business operates.
They do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for that industry or country.
The pre-tax discount rates are based on the groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks relating to the relevant sector and country.
Impairment charges 2013 2012 m m Asia 3.4 1.3 3.4 1.3 All impairment charges have been recorded in the income statement within operating expenses.
Apart from the impaired business in Asia, which is not considered material to the group, all other CGUs are not considered to be sensitive to changes in inputs.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation, with the exception of freehold land and assets under construction which are not depreciated.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
During the year the group reclassified 3 freehold properties as investment properties as they are leased to a third party.
Investment properties are recognised using the cost model.
Depreciation of assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the difference between their cost and their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Freehold buildings 50 to 100 years Leasehold buildings shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life Vehicles 4 to 5 years Plant and equipment including service contract equipment 3 to 10 years Office equipment, furniture and fittings 3 to 10 years Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2013 Rentokil 2013 Financials ID6 p75-136.
indd 110 31 03 2014 23:37 Financial Statements Additional Information Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts 111 Assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually and amended as necessary.
Fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the fixed asset may exceed its recoverable amount.
An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if its carrying amount exceeds the higher of its fair value less cost to sell or value-in-use.
For the purposes of assessing value-in-use, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units and cash flow forecasts are made using assumptions consistent with the most up-to-date budgets and plans that have been formally approved by management.
These cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate based on the weighted average cost of capital for the group, adjusted for the particular risks of the cash-generating unit being reviewed for impairment.
When assets are sold, the difference between sale proceeds and net book value is recognised in the income statement.
The category of service contract equipment represents the pool of assets used by the group in delivering contracted services to customers.
Land and buildings comprise mainly factories and offices.
indd 111 31 03 2014 23:37 112 Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts Notes to the Accounts continued Leases Leases of property, plant and equipment where the group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Finance leases are capitalised at the leases inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance outstanding.
The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in other payables.
The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.
The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term.
The net carrying amounts of assets held under finance leases are as follows: 2013 2012 m m Other plant and equipment 0.5 0.6 Vehicles and office equipment 20.4 16.8 Total 20.9 17.4 B6.

indd 112 31 03 2014 23:37 Financial Statements Additional Information Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts 113 C. Financing Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument and derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions.
Financial assets The group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through the income statement, loans and receivables, available-for-sale financial assets and other investments.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Management determines the classification of its investments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date.
The group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that financial assets are impaired.
All financial assets are held at amortised cost except for derivatives, which are classified as held for trading unless in a hedging relationship and certain assets classified as available-for-sale, which are held at fairvalue.
a Financial assets at fair value through the income statement Assets are classified as current if they are expected to be realised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
b Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise when the group provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the receivable.
They are included incurrent assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date.
These are classified as non-current assets.
Loans and receivables include trade and other receivables and cash and other equivalents.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, subject to impairment.
c Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12months of the balance sheet date.
Available-for-sale investments are fair valued and changes to market values are recognised in equity.
On subsequent disposal or impairment, theaccumulated gains and losses, previously recognised in equity, are recognised in the income statement as gains and losses from investmentsecurities.
The group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
In the case of equity securities classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered as an indicator that the securities are impaired.
If any such evidence exists for available for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income statement is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the income statement.
d Other investments Other investments comprise financial investments with a maturity date of greater than three months on the date the investment was made.
Investments with a maturity date more than one year from the balance sheet date are recorded as non-current.
Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method except for derivatives, which are classified as held for trading except where they qualify for hedge accounting and are held at fair value.
Financial liabilities held at amortised cost include trade payables, vacant property provisions, deferred consideration and borrowings.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value at the balance sheet date.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The group designates certain derivatives as either: a hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities b hedges of net investments in foreign operations c cash flow hedges.
The group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes infair values of hedged items.
indd 113 31 03 2014 23:37 114 Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts Notes to the Accounts continued Certain derivative instruments are not designated or do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Typically the group will not designate financial instruments for hedge accounting where a perfect or near perfect offset is expected between the change in value of assets and liabilities.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments in this category are immediately recognised in the incomestatement.
a Fair value hedge Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
b Net investment hedge Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity: the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
c Cash flow hedge The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity.
Any ineffective portion is immediately recognised in the income statement.
The gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the consolidatedincome statement in the same period in which the hedged cash flows affect the consolidated income statement.
In the event the hedged item occurs or is no longer expected to occur, accumulated gains or losses held in the cash flow hedge reserve are immediately recognised in the income statement.
In the event the hedged item is expected to occur but no longer meets the requirements of hedge accounting, accumulated gains or losses remain in equity and are only recognised in the income statement when the forecast transaction occursor is no longer expected to occur.
Fair value estimation The fair value of any financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the group is the current bid price: the appropriate quoted market price for financial liabilities is the current ask price.
Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term debt.
Other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
The fair value of interest rate and currency swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques.
The group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
The nominal value less estimated credit adjustments of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate to their fair values.
The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the group for similar financial instruments.
Financial risk factors The group operates a central treasury function which manages cash and borrows on behalf of the group, and provides finance to group companies in their home currencies.
The main financial risks faced by the group relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs, fluctuations in interest and foreign exchangerates, and credit risks relating to the risk of default by counterparties to financial transactions.
The management of these risks is set out below.
Capital risk The group is committed to maintaining a debt equity structure which allows continued access to a broad range of financing sources and sufficient flexibility to pursue commercial opportunities in a timely manner as they present themselves, without onerous financing terms and conditions.
The groups policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
Capital consists of ordinary shares, retained earnings and non-controlling interests in the group.
Management monitor the return on capital as well as the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
Debt credit rating The groups debt is rated by Standard & Poors and the group targets a rating of BBB or above for debt issuance over the medium term.
Arating of BBBor above is an investment grade rating.
Financial markets which have been closed to new debt issues from certain borrowers at times since 2008 have been receptive to debt issuance for investment grade borrowers throughout this period.
Currently the group is rated BBB with a positive outlook.
Both the groups 500m 3.375% bond, maturing 24 September 2019, and the new 350m 3.25% bond, maturing 7 October 2021, contain a coupon step-up increasing the coupon payable by 1.25% in the event that the group is downgraded to BB or below sub-investment grade.
indd 114 31 03 2014 23:37 Financial Statements Additional Information Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts 115 Financial covenants The group has in issue bonds issued under its Medium Term Note Programme and Revolving Credit Facilities see Note C4 for details.
The groups Revolving Credit Facilities contain covenants requiring that EBITDA : Interest should be at least 4.0 : 1.0 and that Net Debt: Adjusted EBITDA should be no greater than 3.5 : 1.0 at each semi-annual reporting date.
Change of control The groups Medium Term Notes may be recalled by its investors in the event of a change of control of the group, or within 120 days if: a the groups debt is downgraded below investment grade or the rating is withdrawn: and b the rating agency confirms in writing, either publicly or in writing to the issuer or the Trustee, that the rating action occurred either wholly or in part due to the change of control.
Liquidity risk The group is committed to ensuring it has sufficient liquidity to meet its payables as they fall due.
To achieve this, and in accordance with the liquidity ratio requirements of the credit rating agency Standard & Poors, significant maturities are financed at least 12 months in advance, eitherthrough existing cash balances, forecast cash flows or new debt issuance.
Management models financing requirements at least 12months ahead and aims to maintain average headroom of at least 150m and minimum headroom of at least 100m.
At 31 December 2013 the group had approximately 400m of bonds maturing in March 2014, available funds to meet this of 419.5m, and 270m of undrawn available committed headroom under its Revolving Credit Facilities 2012: 713m combined available funds and headroom.
Market risk Interest rate risk At the year end sensitivity to interest rate changes was limited as only 50m of the groups bond debt was held at floating rates which has subsequently been fixed.
Within net debt the group holds cash balances of 419.5m of which approximately 400m would be expected to be used to repay the 500m bond maturing in March 2014.
As such, most of these balances are deposited at a fixed rate up to the maturity date of the bond.
At 31 December 2013, net floating rate deposits, after deducting the 50m of floating rate debt, amounted to approximately 120m.
Assuming this balance remains constant for the first 3 months of the year, a 1% increase in rates would result in an improvement in interest of 0.3m.
From March onwards after the maturity of the 500m bond, net floating rate borrowings are expected to be 75m or less, meaning that a 1% rise in interest rates would result in an increase in interest payable of up to 0.6m.
Assuming an interest rate rise fall of 1% on 1 January 2014, the impact on interest payable would be an increase decrease of 0.3m 2012: 1.6m.
The group entered into opposing interest rate swaps on 800m of its bonds the 500m bond due in 2019 and 300m of the 350m bond due in 2021, which result in the group receiving fixed interest payments of approximately 9m in 2014 and making fixed repayments annually to 2021.
In order to minimise the cost of this structure, a break clause has been included requiring the group to repay the present value of all outstanding payments in September and October 2015.
The instruments are held at fair value on the balance sheet and a 1% rise fall in interest rates would result in a decrease increase of 0.2m shown in mark to market movements within interest.
The overall impact on interest in the income statement of a rise fall in interest rates of 1% is therefore an increase decrease of 0.1m.
As disclosed in Note C4 the group had outstanding debt at 31 December 2013 with a fair value of 1,466.2m.
Market risk for fixed rate, long-term debt is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates and amounts to 54.4m at 31 December 2013.
The income statement impact is nil as changes in interest rates do not change the expected cash flows on the bonds.
However, in the event it is decided to redeem bonds early, it will be necessary to pay the fair value.
Foreign exchange risk The groups primary exposure is to the sterling-euro exchange rate which impacts earnings, euro-denominated debt and intra-group borrowings.
At 31 December 2013 the groups net debt was approximately 70% euro 2012: 50% reflecting that it is the groups principal cash flow exposure and the low cost of euro funding.
The retranslation of the interest element of this euro debt provides a partial income statement offset to the retranslation of earnings.
The groups earnings are also exposed to currency movements from its worldwide operations, including US dollars and emerging market currencies.
The group calculates the impact on the income statement and equity of a 10% shift in foreign exchange rates.
The groups principal foreign currency exposure is to euro, and a 10% shift in would result in a 19.3m increase decrease 2012: 17.2m in adjusted operating profit, offset by a 2.6m decrease increase 2012: 2.9m in interest payable.
Where possible, currency cash flows are used to settle liabilities in the same currency in preference to selling currency in the market.
Foreign currency balances, including cash, debt and intra-group balances are hedged on a net basis.
To the extent that balances naturally offset, retranslation gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.
At 31 December 2013 a 10% shift in the rate would result ina net impact of nil, made up of a gain of 338.6m offset by an equal loss 2012: net impact of nil made up of a 205.4m gain offset by an equal loss.
indd 115 31 03 2014 23:37 116 Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts Notes to the Accounts continued Foreign currency debt is designated for hedge accounting by the group as a hedge of its currency net assets, so reducing its net currency assets.
Retranslation gains and losses are recognised in reserves rather than in the income statement.
At 31 December 2013 a 10% shift in foreign exchange rates would decrease increase equity reserves by 20.8m 2012: 14.8m.
Credit risk The group has no significant concentration of credit risk.
Sales are typically low value, high volume, spreading the risk across a number of customers.
Policies are in place to ensure that sales are only made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high-credit-quality financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure to any single counterparty.
The group monitors the creditworthiness of its derivative counterparties using a combination of credit ratings and other market indicators.
The groups core bank group of 10 counterparties who lend to the group were all rated Aor above by Standard and Poors.
However, in some territories, particularly in emerging markets, the group has exposure to some lower rated banks who conduct limited local cash management.
At 31 December 2013 the group had a total of 2.2m deposited with banks rated below Aby Standard and Poors.
The highest concentration with any single bank was 0.3m.
The group operates in some territories where there is increased exposure to trade credit risks and in those cases the group puts in place appropriate additional measures where possible to manage its credit exposure.
During the year the groups pension funding trade of 591.2m at 31 December 2012 which was invested with Barclays Bank plc was redeemed.
The proceeds have been invested in UK gilts and in AAA-rated liquidity funds considered to have very low counterparty risk.
Treasury risk The Company utilises financial instruments to manage known financial exposures in line with policies agreed by the Board and outlined above.
The Company does not enter into any speculative derivative contracts.

At the end of this period, the group reverted to paying fixed interest rates and revaluation of the bond ceased as the hedge relationship ended.
The bond is recorded in the financial statements at amortised cost and revaluation differences are amortised to the consolidated income statement over the life of the bond thus producing the effective rate indicated above The bonds are level 1 and the debentures, finance lease and bank borrowings are level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The group considers the fair value of other current liabilities to be equal to the carrying value.
In 2012 31.4m of one-off costs were recognised in the income statement in respect of the following transactions: In October 2012 the group repaid the 75m Puttable Callable Resettable floating rate bond, due in September 2033.
The loan included an option, which gave the right to the investors to call the bond at fair value in September 2013.
The bond was redeemed early, at a net cost of 28.7m, which has been recognised under one-off items financing in the income statement.
As the 2013 bond was repaid, the group recycled 2.1m of accumulated losses, held in the cash flow hedge reserve, which were recognised under one-off items financing in the income statement, and hedge accounting was discontinued prospectively.
In October 2012 the group also repaid 14.5m of the 500m bonds due in March 2014 and recognised the associated premium cost of 0.6m 0.7m in one-off items financing in the income statement.

Where no hedge accounting has been applied, related derivatives have been marked as non-hedge.
Any ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges is taken directly to finance costs.
There was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from net investment in foreign entity hedges or those derivatives in a cash flow hedge relationship.
Cash flow hedge accounting was applied to floating to fixed interest rate swaps relating to the groups 50m bond which was repaid on 29September 2013.
There was no balance in reserves in regards to cash flow hedge accounting at the end of the year 2012: 1.2m.
The effective nominal value of foreign exchange swaps is 263.6m 2012: 97.3m and foreign exchange forwards is 0.1m 2012: 20.3m.
The group had no outstanding commodity contracts at year end.
Fair value hierarchy of derivative financial instruments For all financial instruments held by the group, those that are held at fair value are to be classified by reference to the source of inputs used to derive the fair value.
The following hierarchy is used: Level 1 unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly as prices or indirectly through modelling based on prices: Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The group holds all derivatives at fair value using discounted cash flow models based on market rates which are observable: therefore all derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale assets held by the group fall into Level 2.
Deferred and contingent consideration payable by the group falls into Level 3.
It is valued based on the groups best estimate of the amount payable based on the future forecasts of the acquired businesses: discounted where the impact is considered material.
No financial instruments have moved between levels in the year.

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any group company purchases the Companys equity share capital Treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes, is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.

Foreign exchange losses on debt therefore amount to 11.3m for 2013 primarily resulting from a strengthening of the euro by 3 cents 2012: gain of 21.7m.
The groups interest rate swaps and foreign currency derivatives, with a fair value of 4.0m, have been included within net debt for the first time in 2013 as this better reflects the underlying nature of these contracts.
Foreign exchange contracts are used to convert the groups bond debt to debt in different currencies, or where cash has been generated overseas, to convert it to sterling to either deposit or repay short-term debt.
During the life of these contracts, which are typically short-term, theywill be revalued and the gains or losses will be substantially the same as if the group held debt or cash in the foreign currency.
The group also includes fair value hedge accounted interest rate swaps and non-hedge accounted interest rate swaps in net debt.
Interest rate swaps are used to transform the groups bonds from fixed to floating rate, or floating rate to fixed rate.

In 2004 the group made a loan to a consortium of private investors which enabled them to purchase a 25.1% stake in the groups South African business.
During the year the group repurchased the 25.1% stake for a consideration of ZAR 4.0m 0.3m plus the outstanding capital value of the loan at the execution date and a new special purpose entity was set up to enable colleagues in South Africa to benefit from the ownership of this stake by way of dividend payments.
The group has accordingly removed the non-controlling interest in the balance sheet, derecognised the loan, and reversed the capital reserve recorded in equity at the time of the original transaction.
The fair value adjustments taken to other comprehensive income on the available for sale loan have been recycled through one-off items financing.
