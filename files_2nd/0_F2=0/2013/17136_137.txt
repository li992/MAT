William Hill PLC 113 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 23.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The directors believe that due to the nature of the Groups non-derivative financial instruments the carrying value equates to the fair value.
Fair value hierarchy The hierarchy as defined in IFRS 13 of the Groups financial instruments carried at fair value was as follows: 31 December 2013 1 January 2013 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m m m m m Assets liabilities held at fair value Forward currency contracts 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.4 Contingent consideration 0.5 0.5 Antepost bet liabilities 11.6 11.6 7.0 7.0 Total 0.2 12.1 12.3 0.4 7.0 6.6 Antepost bet liabilities are valued using methods and inputs that are not based upon observable market data and all movements on the balance are recognised in revenue in the Income Statement.
There are no reasonably possible changes to assumptions or inputs that would lead to material changes in the fair value determined, although the final value will be determined by future sporting results.
The principal assumptions relate to anticipated gross win margins on unsettled bets.
Forward currency contracts are classified as level 2 in the hierarchy, as their value is determined using inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Changes in their fair value are recorded in the Income Statement, except in cases where the hedging arrangement qualifies for hedge accounting.
Contingent consideration liabilities are classified as level 3 in the hierarchy.
These liabilities represent the present value of the cash outflows under earn-out agreements that would result from acquired businesses performing in line with managements current estimates.
They key inputs into the fair value estimation include the forecast performance of the underlying business and the discount rate applied in deriving a present value from those forecasts.
