EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 215 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TERMS AND ABBREVIATIONS Term Definition Beam A structural element.
Beams are characterised by their profile the shape of their cross-section.
One of the most common types of steel beam is the I-beam, also known as H-beam, or W-beam wide-flange beam, or a universal beam column.
Beams are widely used in the construction industry and are available in various standard sizes, e. g. 40-k beam, 60Sh beam, 70Sh beam as mentioned in this report Billet A usually square, semi-finished steel product obtained by continuous casting or rolling of blooms.
Sections, rails, wire rod and other rolled products are made from billets Blast furnace The blast furnace is the classic production unit to reduce iron ore to molten iron, known as hot metal.
It operates as a counter-current shaft system, where iron ore and coke is charged at the top.
While this charge descends towards the bottom, ascending carbon containing gases and coke reduces the iron ore to liquid iron.
To increase efficiency and productivity, hot air often enriched with oxygen is blown into the bottom of the blast furnace.
In order to save coke, coal or other carbon containing materials are sometimes injected with this hot air By-product A secondary product which results from a manufacturing process or chemical reaction Capex Capital expenditure CFR Cost and freight, the seller must pay the costs and freight to bring the goods to the port of destination.
However, risk is transferred to the buyer once the goods are loaded on the vessel.
Insurance for the goods is not included Channel U-shaped section for construction Coal washing The process of removing mineral matter from coal usually through density separation, for coarser coal and using surface chemistry for finer particles Coke A product made by baking coal without oxygen at high temperatures.
Unwanted gases are driven out of the coal.
The unwanted gases can be used as fuels or processed further to recover valuable chemicals.
The resulting material coke has a strong porous structure which makes it ideal for use in a blast furnace Coke battery A group of coke ovens operating as a unit and connected by common walls Coking coal Highly volatile coal used to manufacture coke Concentrate A product resulting from iron ore coal enrichment, with a high grade of extracted mineral Construction products Include beams, channels, angles, rebars, wire rods, wire and other goods Converter A type of furnace that uses pure oxygen in the process of producing steel from cast iron or dry mix Continuous casting machine Process whereby molten metal is solidified into a semi-finished billet, bloom, or slab for subsequent rolling in the finishing mills Crude steel Steel in its solidified state directly after casting.
This is then further processed by rolling or other treatments, which can change its properties Debottlenecking Increasing capacity of a supply or production chain through the modification of existing equipment or infrastructure to improve efficiency Deposit An area of coal resources or reserves identified by surface mapping, drilling or development Electric arc furnace A furnace used in the steelmaking process which heats charged material via an electric arc Feasibility study A comprehensive engineering estimate of all costs, revenues, equipment requirements and production levels likely to be achieved if a mine is developed.
The study is used to define the technical and economic viability of a project and to support the search for project financing Finished products Products that have completed the manufacturing process but have not yet been sold or distributed to the end user Flat products or Flat-rolled steel products Include commodity plate, specialty plate and other products in flat shape such as sheet, strip and tin plate Greeneld The development or exploration of a new project not previously examined Grinding balls Balls used to grind material by impact and pressure 216 EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Strategic Report Business Units Review Governance Financial Statements Term Definition Head-hardened rails High strength rails with head hardened by heat treatment Heat-treatment A group of industrial and metalworking processes used to alter the physical, and sometimes chemical, properties of a material Iron ore Chemical compounds of iron with other elements, mainly oxygen, silicon, sulphur or carbon.
