Deferred tax balances for which there is a right of offset within the same jurisdiction are presented net on the face of the group balance sheet as permitted by IAS 12, with the exception of deferred tax related to BTs pension schemes which are disclosed within deferred tax assets.
At 31 March 2013, all of the deferred tax asset of 1,438m 2011 12: 626m and all of the deferred tax liability of 1,209m 2011 12: 1,100m are expected to be recovered or settled after more than one year.
Taxation continued Factors affecting future tax charges The rate of UK corporation tax changed from 24% to 23% on 1 April 2013.
As deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the rates that are expected to apply in the periods of the reversal, deferred tax balances at 31 March 2013 have been calculated using a rate of 23%.
This reduction has been recognised as a deferred tax credit of 105m and as a specic item in the income statement note 9 and a deferred tax expense of 94m in other comprehensive income.
The Government has also indicated that it intends to enact a further reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 21% by 1 April 2014 and to 20% by 1 April 2015.
The future annual corporation tax rate reduction is expected to affect the groups financial statements.
The actual impact will depend on the groups deferred tax position at that time.
Unrecognised tax losses and other temporary differences At 31 March 2013 the group had operating losses, capital losses and other temporary differences carried forward in respect of which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to 22.0bn 2011 12: 21.8bn.
The groups capital losses and other temporary differences have no expiry date restrictions.
The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the tax law of the various territories in which the losses arose.
A summary of expiry dates for losses in respect of which restrictions apply is set out below: 2013 Expiry of At 31 March m losses Restricted losses Europe 464 2014-27 Americas 102 2014-32 Other 1 2014-22 Total restricted losses 567 Unrestricted losses Operating losses 3,640 No expiry Capital losses 17,214 No expiry Total unrestricted losses 20,854 Other temporary differences 543 Total 21,964 At 31 March 2013 the undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries were 11.1bn 2011 12: 10.8bn.
No deferred tax liabilities have been recognised in respect of these unremitted earnings because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
