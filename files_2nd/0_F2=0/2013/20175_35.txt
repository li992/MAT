Notes to the accounts 1 Segmental analysis The Directors of the Company review the financial performance of the Group on the investment basis, as dened in the Returns and risks section.
However, the Directors also review information on a regular basis that is analysed by geography and is prepared on a basis that is consistent with the consolidated accounting basis.
In accordance with IFRS 8, the segmental information provided below uses this geographic analysis of results as it is the most closely aligned with IFRS reporting requirements.
The Group only operates in one service line, being that of an investment holding company.
Therefore, no segmental analysis by service line has been produced.
The Group is an investment holding company and does not consider itself to have any customers.
The Group received 49% 2012: 70% of its portfolio income in the year from investments held in the UK and Ireland and 51% 2012: 30% of portfolio income from investments held in continental Europe.
During the year, the Group received income from its investments in Oiltanking of 26.6 million 2012: 29.8 million, Elenia of 23.6 million 2012: nil, AWG of 22.6 million 2012: 29.6 million and Eversholt of 17.8 million 2012: 33.0 million, which represents 27% 2012: 29%, 24% 2012: nil, 23% 2012: 29% and 18% 2012: 33% respectively of the total portfolio income.
There was no other income entitlement during the year or in the comparative year that represented more than 10% of portfolio income.
Given the nature of the Groups operations, the Group is not considered to be exposed to any operational seasonality or cyclicality that would impact the financial results of the Group during the year or the financial position of the Group at 31 March 2013.

The foreign exchange gain of 14.9 million 2012: loss of 14.4 million in the table above relates to assets that are held by intermediary holding companies of the Group, for which sterling is not the functional currency.
As a result, this exchange gain of 14.9 million 2012: loss of 14.4 million is recognised within other comprehensive income as part of the overall gain of 12.6 million 2012: loss of 4.4 million arising on re-translation of foreign currency subsidiaries.
All other movements are recognised within the total Investment return of 135.5 million 2012: 106.6 million.
The holding period of investments in the portfolio is expected to be greater than one year.
For this reason, the Directors have classied the portfolio as non-current.
It is not possible to identify with certainty where any investments may be sold within one year.
The fair value of loans and receivables approximates to the carrying value.
All debt investments were held at fair value through profit or loss.
3i Infrastructure plc Annual report and accounts 2013 73 Notes to the accounts 8 Investment portfolio continued The Group invested in Elgin Infrastructure Limited in December 2009.
The investment meets the denition of a joint venture and under IAS 31 it has been held at fair value through profit and loss and accounted for in accordance with IAS 39, with changes in fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Elgin Infrastructure Limited was incorporated as a Special Purpose Entity in October 2009, to hold an underlying portfolio of PFI projects.
As at 31 March 2013, there were no outstanding commitments from the Group, or from the Company to Elgin Infrastructure Limited, or to theunderlying assets of Elgin Infrastructure Limited 2012: nil.
Fair value hierarchy The Group classies financial instruments measured at fair value in the investment portfolio according to the following hierarchy: Level Fair value input description Financial instruments Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted and in active markets Quoted equity investments Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable in Debt investments held at fair value the market either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices Level 3 Inputs that are not based on observable market data Unquoted equity instruments Unquoted equity instruments are measured in accordance with the International Private Equity Valuation guidelines with reference to the most appropriate information available at the time of measurement.
Further information regarding the valuation of unquoted equity instruments can befound in the section called Portfolio valuation methodology.
The Groups investment portfolio for equity instruments and the debt investments held at fair value are classied in accordance with the fair value hierarchy as follows: As at 31 March 2013 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m Unquoted equity 1,004.0 1,004.0 Debt investments held at fair value 1,004.0 1,004.0 As at 31 March 2012 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m Unquoted equity 949.1 949.1 Debt investments held at fair value 949.1 949.1 As at 31 March 2013 Unquoted Debt investments investments Total Level 3 fair value reconciliation m m m Opening fair value 949.1 949.1 Additions 16.5 16.5 Disposals 10.9 10.9 Unrealised gains on investments 34.4 34.4 Foreign exchange gain 14.9 14.9 Closing fair value 1,004.0 1,004.0 As at 31 March 2012 Unquoted Debt investments investments Total Level 3 fair value reconciliation m m m Opening fair value 723.6 723.6 Additions 231.4 231.4 Disposals Unrealised gains on investments 8.5 8.5 Foreign exchange loss 14.4 14.4 Closing fair value 949.1 949.1 74 3i Infrastructure plc Annual report and accounts 2013 Financials and otherinformation 8 Investment portfolio continued There have been no reclassications for assets that have been transferred in or out of Level 3 during the year 2012: nil.
This disclosure only relates to the investment portfolio, however the fair value hierarchy also applies to derivative financial instruments please refer to Note 11 for details of the investment hierarchy in relation to derivatives.
The majority of the assets held within Level 3 are valued on a discounted cash ow basis, hence, the valuations above are sensitive to the discount rate assumed in the valuation of each asset.
Increasing the discount rate used in the valuation of each asset by 1% would reduce the value of the portfolio by 81.4 million 2012: 72.5 million.
Decreasing the discount rate used in the valuation of each asset by 1% would increase the value of the portfolio by 96.9 million 2012: 82.5 million.

10 Financial risk management A full review of the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing and monitoring risk is set out in the Returns and risks section.
This Note provides further detail on financial risk management, cross-referring to the Returns and risks section where applicable, and providing further quantitative data on specic financial risks.
Each investment made by the Group is subject to a full risk assessment through a standardised investment approval process.
The Boards Investment Committee and the Investment Advisers investment process are part of the overall risk management framework of the Group.
The funding objective of the Group is that each category of investment ought to be broadly matched with liabilities and shareholders funds according to the risk and maturity characteristics of the assets, and that funding needs ought to be met ahead of planned investment.
Capital structure The Group has a continuing commitment to capital efficiency.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash held on deposit, borrowings and shareholders equity.
The Companys Articles require its outstanding borrowings, including any financial guarantees to support subsequent obligations, to be limited to 50% of the gross assets of the Group.
The type and maturity of the Groups borrowings are analysed in Note 12 and the Groups equity is analysed into its various components in the statement of changes in equity.
Capital is managed so as to maximise the return to shareholders, while maintaining a strong capital base that ensures that the Group can operate effectively in the marketplace and sustain future development of the business.
The Board is responsible for regularly monitoring capital requirements to ensure that the Company is maintaining sufficient capital to meet its future investment needs.
The Company is regulated under the provisions of the Collective Investment Funds Jersey Law 1988 as a closed-ended collective investment fundand is not required as a result of such regulation to maintain a minimum level of capital.
Capital is allocated for investment in Utilities, Transportation and Social Infrastructure across the UK, continental Europe and Asia.
As set out in the Groups investment policy, the maximum exposure to any one investment is 20% of gross assets including cash holdings at the time ofinvestment.
Credit risk The Group is subject to credit risk on its loans and receivables, debt investments, cash, deposits, derivative contracts and receivables.
Themaximum exposure to credit risk as a result of counterparty default equates to the current carrying value of these financial assets.
Throughout the year and the prior year, the Groups cash and deposits were held with a variety of counterparties, principally in AAA-rated money market funds, aswellas in short-term bank deposits with a minimum of a single A credit rating.
The counterparties selected for the derivative financial instruments were all banks with a minimum of a single A credit rating.
The credit quality of loans and receivables and debt instruments within theinvestment portfolio is based on the financial performance of the individual portfolio companies.
The performance of underlying investments is monitored by the Board to assess future recoverability.
For those assets and income entitlements that are not past due, it is believed that the risk of default is small and capital repayments and interest payments will be made in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions of the investment.
If the portfolio company has failed, or is expected tofail in the next 12 months, the Groups policy is to record a fair value adjustment for the full amount of the loan.
Fair value adjustments, or loan impairments, are made when the net present value of the future cash ows predicted to arise from the asset, discounted using the effectiveinterest rate method, implies non-recovery of all or part of the Groups loan investment.
In these cases a loan impairment is recorded equal to the valuation shortfall.
3i Infrastructure plc Annual report and accounts 2013 75 Notes to the accounts 10 Financial risk management continued As at 31 March 2013, the Group had no shareholder loan investments subject to impairment 2012: 3.7 million impaired.
No other assets held by the Group were considered to be impaired.
The Company had no loans or receivables or debt investments considered past due 2012: nil.
3i Infrastructure plc actively manages counterparty risk.
Counterparty limits are set and closely monitored by the Board and a regular review ofcounterparties is undertaken by the Investment Adviser and the Board.
As at 31 March 2013, the Group did not consider itself to have exposure to one large counterparty and held deposits and derivative contracts with a number of different counterparties to reduce counterparty risk.
Due to the size and nature of the investment portfolio there is concentration risk due to the size of the investments.
This risk is managed by diversifying the portfolio by sector and geography.
Liquidity risk Further information on how liquidity risk is managed is provided in the Risk section.
The table below analyses the maturity of the Groups contractual liabilities.
Due Due Due in Due between between greater Payable within 1 and 2 2 and 5 than on demand 1 year years years 5 years Total 2013 m m m m m m Liabilities Loans and borrowings 16.7 12.5 191.5 220.7 Trade and other payables 6.4 6.4 Forward currency contracts 0.5 0.6 3.1 4.2 Financial commitments 28.1 28.1 Total undiscounted financial liabilities 34.5 17.2 13.1 194.6 259.4 Due Due Due in Due between between greater Payable within 1 and 2 2 and 5 than on demand 1 year years years 5 years Total 2012 m m m m m m Liabilities Loans and borrowings 11.8 11.0 167.8 190.6 Trade and other payables 2.4 2.4 Forward currency contracts 1.8 1.3 0.9 4.0 Financial commitments 46.5 46.5 Total undiscounted financial liabilities 48.9 13.6 12.3 168.7 243.5 All derivatives are settled net.
Cash ows upon settlement of interest rate swap contracts are intended to be settled net of the finance costs arising from loans and borrowings and therefore the net cash ows are shown in the table above within loans and borrowings.
The financial commitment relates to the Companys commitments to the 3i India Infrastructure Fund and the Dalmore Capital Fund Note 17.
The cash ows from financial assets are not used to manage contractual liquidity risk.
Market risk The valuation of the Groups investment portfolio is largely dependent on the underlying trading performance of the companies within the portfolio, but the valuation of the portfolio and the carrying value of other items in the financial statements can also be affected by interest rate, currency and quoted market uctuations.
The Groups sensitivities to these uctuations are set out below.
i Interest rate risk Further information on how interest rate risk is managed is provided in the Risk section.
An increase or decrease of 250 basis points in interest rates over 12 months 2012: 250 basis points would lead to an approximate increase or decrease in net assets and to the net profit of the Group of 4.6 million 2012: 5.8 million.
This exposure relates principally to changes in interest payable and receivable on oating rate debt instruments and cash on deposit and changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives and xed rate debt instruments held at the year end.
The average cash balance of the Group during the year was 170.7 million 2012: 252.3 million and the weighted average interest earned was 0.4% 2012: 0.6%.
The loan facility in the Oystercatcher Luxco 2 subsidiary, disclosed in Note 12, is subject to interest rate risk, but this risk has been fully hedged through the use of interest rate swaps so there is no estimated impact on net assets or net profit from this loan.
In addition, the Group has indirect exposure to interest rates through changes to the financial performance of portfolio companies caused by interest rate uctuations.
The Group does not hold any xed rate debt investments or borrowings and is therefore not exposed to fair value interestrate risk.
76 3i Infrastructure plc Annual report and accounts 2013 Financials and otherinformation 10 Financial risk management continued ii Currency risk Further information on how currency risk is managed is provided in the Risk section.
The currency denominations of the Groups net assets are shown in the table below.
The sensitivity analysis demonstrates the exposure of the Groups net assets to movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
As at 31 March 2013 Sterling Euro US dollar Total m m m m Net assets 762.8 385.4 99.5 1,247.7 Sensitivity analysis Assuming a 10% appreciation in sterling against the euro and US dollar exchange rates: Impact of exchange movements on net profit 30.0 30.0 Impact of exchange movements on net assets 30.0 30.0 Impact of the translation of foreign operations in the translation reserve 38.8 9.9 48.7 As at 31 March 2012 Sterling Euro US dollar Total m m m m Net assets 729.2 353.8 114.3 1,197.3 Sensitivity analysis Assuming a 10% appreciation in sterling against the euro and US dollar exchange rates: Impact of exchange movements on net profit 31.0 31.0 Impact of exchange movements on net assets 31.0 31.0 Impact of the translation of foreign operations in the translation reserve 32.2 10.4 42.6 The impact of an equivalent depreciation in sterling against the euro and US dollar exchange rates has the inverse impact on net profit, net assets and the translation reserve as shown above.
There is an indirect exposure to the rupee through the investment in the 3i India Infrastructure Fund which is denominated in US dollars but it is only the direct exposure that is considered here.
iii Market price risk Further information about the management of external market risk and its impact on market price or valuation, which arises principally from unquoted equity and quoted debt investments, is provided in the Returns and risks section.
A 10% increase in the fair value of those investments would have the following direct impact on net profit and net assets.
As at 31 March 2013 As at 31 March 2012 Unquoted Unquoted investments investments m m Increase in net profit 100.4 94.9 Increase in net assets 100.4 94.9 The impact of a 10% decrease in the fair value of those investments would have the inverse impact on net profit and net assets, as shown above.
By the nature of the Groups activities, it has large exposures to individual assets that are susceptible to movements in price.
However, theDirectors have a set investment policy that sets predened limits for the exposure of the Group to an individual asset.
These limits have notbeen exceeded at 31 March 2013 or at 31 March 2012, and hence the Directors do not consider that any of these investments represents alarge exposure.
iv Fair values The fair value of the investment portfolio is described in detail in the Portfolio valuation methodology section.
The fair values of the remaining financial assets and liabilities approximate to their carrying values.
The sensitivity analysis in respect of the interest rate, currency and market price risks is considered to be representative of the Groups exposure to financial risks throughout the period to which they relate.

The contracts entered into by the Group are principally denominated in the currencies of the geographic areas in which the Group operates.
The fair value of these contracts is recorded in the balance sheet.
No contracts are designated as hedging instruments and consequently all changes in fair value are taken to the statement of comprehensive income.
As at 31 March 2013, the notional amount of the forward foreign exchange contracts held by the Group was 317.0 million 2012: 318.9 million.
Interest rate swaps The Group uses variable to xed interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its oating-rate interest-bearing borrowings.
No contracts are designated as hedging instruments and consequently all changes in fair value are taken through the statement of comprehensive income.
At 31 March 2013 the notional amount of the interest rate swaps held by the Group was 160.6 million or 190.0 million 2012: 158.3 million, 190.0 million.

The Group uses widely recognised valuation models for determining the fair values of over-the-counter interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models, using present value calculations.
The valuations are market observable, internally calculated and veried to externally sourced data and are therefore included within Level 2.
There have been no reclassications for derivatives that have been transferred in or out of Level 2 or Level 3 during the year 2012: nil.
