14 Financial instruments Risk management policies and procedures As an investment company, Witan invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to secure its investment objective as stated on the inside front cover.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Group is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Groups net assets or a reduction in the profits available for distribution by way of dividends.
These risks, market risk comprising price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk, and the directors approach to the management of them, are set out below.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to manage the risks, as set out below, have not changed from the previous accounting period, although in some instances additional resources have been allocated to some areas.
74 Witan Investment Trust plc Annual Report 2013 Report of the Directors Strategic Report Statutory Information Corporate Governance Financial Statements Other Information 14.1 Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Group may fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises: price risk see note 14.2, currency risk see note 14.3 and interest rate risk see note 14.4.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks, which policies have remained substantially unchanged from those applying in the year ended 31 December 201 2.
The investment managers assess the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitor the overall level of market risk on the whole of their investment portfolios on an ongoing basis.
14.2 Price risk Price risks ie changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of the quoted and the unquoted investments.
Management of the risk The Board manages the risks inherent in the investment portfolios by regularly reviewing relevant information from the investment managers.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance.
The Board monitors the managers compliance with their mandates and also whether each mandate and asset allocation is compatible with Witans objective.
When appropriate, Witan has the ability to manage its exposure to risk through the controlled use of derivatives.
The Groups exposure to other changes in market prices at 31 December on its quoted and unquoted equity investments, and on options on indices and investments, was as follows: 2013 2012 000 000 Investments held at fair value through profit or loss 1,436,962 1,202,076 Nominal futures exposure long position 35,199 Concentration of exposure to price risks An analysis of the Groups investment portfolio is shown on page 25.
This shows that the greater geographical weighting is to UK companies, with significant exposure also to North America, Asia and Continental Europe.
Accordingly, there is a concentration of exposure to those regions, although an investments country of domicile or of listing does not necessarily equate to its exposure to the economic conditions in that country.
Price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and the value of the shareholders funds to an increase or decrease of 15% in the fair values of the Groups equity investments including exposure through futures contracts.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of market conditions and historical trends.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Groups equities and equity exposure through options at each balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.
The results of these example calculations are significant but not unreasonable, given that most of the Groups assets are equity investments.

As a consequence, movements in exchange rates affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of the risk The investment managers monitor their exposure to currencies as part of their normal investment processes.
The Board receives a monthly report on the currency exposures of the entire fund.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling upon receipt.
The Group does not normally use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Groups monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31 December are shown below.
Where the Groups equity investments which are not monetary items are denominated in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.

Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after tax for the year and the Groups equity in regard to the Groups monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and the exchange rates for the US dollar, Euro and Japanese yen.
The results of these example calculations are significant but not unreasonable in the context of the majority of the Groups assets being invested overseas.
It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: US dollar - 15% 2012: 15% Euro - 15% 2012: 15% Japanese yen - 15% 2012: 15% 76 Witan Investment Trust plc Annual Report 2013 Report of the Directors Strategic Report Statutory Information Corporate Governance Financial Statements Other Information The sensitivity analysis is based on the Groups monetary foreign currency financial instruments held at the balance sheet date and takes account of any forward foreign exchange contracts that offset the effects of changes in currency exchange rates.
If sterling had depreciated against the currencies shown, this would have had the following effect: 2013 2012 US$ Euro Yen US$ Euro Yen 000 000 000 000 000 000 Income statement profit after tax Revenue return 1,248 798 140 1,175 828 61 Capital return 62,422 25,051 11,458 44,245 23,480 2,380 Change to the profit after tax 63,670 25,849 11,598 45,420 24,308 2,441 Change to the shareholders funds 63,670 25,849 11,598 45,420 24,308 2,441 If sterling had appreciated against the currencies shown, this would have had the following effect: 2013 2012 US$ Euro Yen US$ Euro Yen 000 000 000 000 000 000 Income statement profit after tax Revenue return 923 590 103 868 612 45 Capital return 46,138 18,516 8,469 32,703 17,355 1,759 Change to the profit after tax 47,061 19,106 8,572 33,571 17,967 1,804 Change to the shareholders funds 47,061 19,106 8,572 33,571 17,967 1,804 In the opinion of the directors, neither of the above sensitivity analyses is representative of the year as a whole since the level of exposure changes frequently, as part of the currency risk management process used to meet the Groups objective.
14.4 Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable from fixed interest securities and cash at bank and on deposit.
Management of the risk The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions.
The Group holds cash balances, partly to meet payments as they fall due but also when appropriate to offset the long-term borrowings that it has in place.
The Group finances part of its activities through preference shares that do not have redemption dates and through debenture stock and secured bonds that were issued as part of the Companys planned gearing.
Interest rate exposure The exposure at 31 December 2013 of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates: when the interest rate is due to be re-set: and fixed interest rates: when the financial instrument is due be repaid.
The Groups exposure to floating interest rates on assets is 47,532,000 2012: 15,420,000.
This represents cash holdings minus variable rate borrowing.
The Groups exposure to fixed interest rates on assets is 15,543,000 2012: 28,704,000.
This represents investments in bonds.
Annual Report 2013 Witan Investment Trust plc 77 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2013 14 Financial instruments continued The Groups exposure to fixed interest rates on liabilities is 110, 372,000 2012: 110,316,000.
This represents fixed rate borrowing.
Interest receivable and finance costs are at the following rates: interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts and loans, is at margin under over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent 2012: same : the finance charge on the preference shares is at a weighted average interest rate of 3.3% 2012: 3.3% : the finance charge on the debenture stock is at a weighted average interest rate of 8.5% 2012: 8.5% : and the finance charge on the secured bonds is at a weighted average interest rate of 6.125% 2012: 6.125%.
The above year end amounts are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year, as the level of exposure changes as investments are made in fixed interest securities, long-term debt is partially redeemed and as the level of cash balances varies during the year.
In the context of the Groups balance sheet, the exposure to interest rate risk is not considered to be material.
Interest rate sensitivity Based on the Groups monetary financial instruments at each balance sheet date, an increase or decrease of 200 basis points in interest rates would decrease or increase revenue return after tax by 1,101,000 2012: 623,000, capital return after tax by 150,000 2012: 315,000, and total profit after tax and shareholders funds by 951,000 2012: 308,000.
At 31 December 2012, the Group had a short position in Long Gilt Futures with a nominal value of 29,730,000.
An increase of 100 basis points in gilt yields would have increased net capital return after tax and shareholders funds by 2,081,000.
A decrease of 100 basis points in gilt yields would have decreased net capital return after tax and shareholders funds by 2,081,000.
At 31 December 2013, the Group did not have any interest rate exposure by way of futures contracts.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions.
This is not representative of the year as a whole, since the exposure changes as investments are made.
In the context of the Groups balance sheet, the outcome is not considered to be material.
14.5 Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Groups assets are investments in quoted equities and other quoted securities that are readily realisable.
The Group has borrowed 44,587,000 by its issue in 1986 of 8 per cent Debenture Stock 2016 and 63,174,000 by its issue in 2000 of 6.125 per cent Secured Bonds due 2025.
The Group is able to draw shortterm borrowings of up to the sterling equivalent of 50 million from its secured and committed multi-currency borrowing facility of 50 million with BNP Paribas, London Branch expiring in December 2014.
The Board gives guidance to the investment managers as to the maximum amount of the Companys resources that should be invested in any one company.
The policy is that the Group should remain fully invested in normal market conditions.
Liquidity risk exposure The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at 31 December 2013, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, were as follows: 78 Witan Investment Trust plc Annual Report 2013 Report of the Directors Strategic Report Statutory Information Corporate Governance Financial Statements Other Information 2013 2012 Within Between More than Within Between More than 1 year 1 and 5 years 5 years 1 year 1 and 5 years 5 years 000 000 000 000 000 000 Debenture stock 3,790 51,222 3,790 55,012 Secured bonds 3,938 15,751 91,681 3,938 15,751 95,619 Preference shares 83 332 2,555 83 332 2,555 Other creditors and accruals7,87 3 5,882 Bank loan 10,000 21,000 25,68 467,30594,236 34,693 71,095 98,174 The above figures show interest payable over the remaining terms of each instrument.
The figures in the between 1 and 5 years and more than 5 years columns also include the capital to be repaid.
The figures in the more than 5 years columns do not include the ongoing annual finance cost of 83,000.
14.6 Credit risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Group suffering a loss.
Management of the risk The risk is managed as follows: interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts and loans, is at margin under over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent: transactions involving derivatives are entered into only with investment banks, the credit rating of which is taken into account so as to minimise the risk to the Group of default: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, whose credit standard is reviewed periodically by the investment managers, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker: cash at bank is held only with reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings.
None of the Groups financial liabilities are past their due dates or impaired.
Credit risk exposure The table below summarises the credit risk exposure of the Group as at the year end.

Level 2 valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1.
Level 3 valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The valuation techniques used by the Group are explained in the accounting policies in note 1 h. There were no transfers during the year between Level 1 and Level 2.

Gearing The Groups policy is to manage the effective gearing in the portfolio to be below 20%, other than temporarily in exceptional circumstances.
Effective gearing is defined as the difference between shareholders funds and the total market value of the investments including the nominal value effective underlying exposure of futures positions which were 35,119,000 long at 31 December 2013 2012: 29,730,000 short expressed as a percentage of shareholders funds.

1% The Board monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Groups capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Chief Executive Officers view on the market: the need to buy back equity shares for cancellation, which takes account of the difference between the net asset value per share and the share price ie the level of share price discount or premium : and the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
The Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding accounting period.
