Impairment charges In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of assets and IAS 38 Intangible Assets a review for impairment of goodwill is undertaken annually or at any time an indicator of impairment is considered to exist and in accordance with IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment a review for impairment of long-lived assets is undertaken at any time an indicator of impairment is considered to exist.
The prevailing gold price fell significantly during the second quarter of 2013 due to macro-economic factors mainly as a result of positive economic news from the United States of America.
This forced a review of the gold price outlook used for long-term planning and reserve estimation.
Management expect weak investment demand to drive continued volatility and hold gold prices to an average of US$1,300 per ounce, a price that we consider a market participant would use to calculate the carrying value of our assets.
Given the impact of the lower gold price outlook and the impact on the reserves, life of mine plans and margins of the operating mines, operating performance was reassessed in order to ensure optimised returns and cash flows for each cash generating unit.
Cash generating units are determined on the same basis as operating segments.
Refer to Note 5 for further details.
At Bulyanhulu, goodwill and property, plant and equipment was reviewed for impairment due to a reduction in total reserves.
The impairment review did not indicate a need for impairment because the recoverable amount was calculated as higher than the carrying values.
As reported in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012, Buzwagis cost structure combined with the grade profile made it most susceptible to changes in the gold price.
At Buzwagi, in June 2013 the mine plan was re-engineered to substantially reduce the amount of waste movement required and optimise the grade of the mine.
This resulted in a reduction of reserve life, but drove a significant improvement in all-in 1 sustaining cost per ounce sold and set the mine up to deliver positive cash flows for the next five years.
As a result of the changes a mid year post-tax impairment was recorded to long-lived assets at Buzwagi of US$677.5 million and supplies inventory of US$13.0 million 2012: no impairment charge.
At North Mara, several changes were made to the plan during the year which will substantially reduce the strip ratio, volume of material to be moved and ultimate footprint of the asset.
In June 2013, the mine plan was re-engineered to remove uneconomic ounces from Nyabirama Stage 5 and Gokona Stage 4 and to improve the overall return from the mine.
Further to this, in October it was decided to defer Gokona Cut 3, which contains 628koz of North Maras reserve base, whilst an underground feasibility study into the alternative of mining of this reserve is finalised.
ABG is confident that the outcome of the underground study will be positive and together with the other changes made will ensure strong free cash flow generation for North Mara together with an optimised footprint to alleviate some of the other pressures encountered at the mine.
The reserve base has also been adjusted in line with the lower gold price assumption at 31 December 2013.
The impact of the deferral of Gokona Stage 3 combined with the updated reserve estimates resulted in a year end post-tax impairment of US$96.3 million in addition to the mid year post-tax impairment to goodwill of US$21 million and long-lived assets of US$152.9 million 2012: no impairment charge.
At Tulawaka, a review of the supplies balance on hand at the end of June 2013 prompted a supplies inventory impairment of US$16.7 million.
At 30 June 2013, the recoverable amount for Nyanzaga was calculated on a fair value less cost to dispose basis, using a comparable enterprise value for companies holding similar assets to arrive at a value per ounce.
Given the volatility in the market and the lack of comparable transactions in the current gold price environment, the value of this exploration asset is highly judgemental.
Due to the valuation being below the carrying value, mid year impairments was recorded relating to goodwill and acquired exploration potential intangible asset that arose on the acquisition of Tusker Gold Ltd of US$22.0 million and subsequent investment in the asset of US$24.6 million.
The review compared the recoverable amount of assets for the cash generating units CGU to the carrying value of the CGUs including goodwill.
The recoverable amount of an asset is assessed by reference to the higher of value in use VIU, being the net present value NPV of future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, and fair value less costs to dispose FVLCD.
The FVLCD of a CGU is based on an estimate of the amount that the Group may obtain in a sale transaction on an arms length basis.
There is no active market for the Groups CGUs.
Consequently, FVLCD is derived using discounted cash flow techniques NPV of expected future cash flows of a CGU, which incorporate market participant assumptions.
Cost to dispose is based on managements best estimates of future selling costs at the time of calculating FVLCD.
Costs attributable to the disposal of a CGU are not considered significant.
The expected future cash flows utilised in the NPV model are derived from estimates of projected future revenues, future cash costs of production and capital expenditures contained in the life of mine LOM plan for each CGU.
The Groups LOM plans reflect proven and probable reserves and are based on detailed research, analysis and modelling to optimise the internal rate of return for each CGU.
FVLCD measurements are defined as level three fair value measurements as they are valued using unobservable inputs.
The discount rate applied to calculate the present value is based upon the real weighted average cost of capital applicable to the CGU.
The discount rate reflects equity risk premiums over the risk-free rate, the impact of the remaining economic life of the CGU and the risks associated with the relevant cash flows based on the country in which the CGU is located.
These risk adjustments are based on observed equity risk premiums, historical country risk premiums and average credit default swap spreads for the period.
The VIU of a CGU is generally lower than its FVLCD, due primarily to the fact that the optimisation of the mine plans has been taken into account when determining its FVLCD.
Consequently, the recoverable amount of a CGU for impairment testing purposes is determined based on its FVLCD.
On a gross basis, and before taking into account the impact of deferred tax, the total impairment charge amounted to US$690.5 million at Buzwagi, US$307.3 million at North Mara, US$46.6 million relating to Nyanzaga and US$16.7 million at Tulawaka.

For purposes of testing for impairment of non-current assets, a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions used to estimate the recoverable amount for GGUs could result in an additional impairment charge.
The carrying value of the net assets relating to North Mara are most sensitive As reported in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012, Buzwagis cost structure combined with the grade profile to changes in key assumptions in respect of gold price and a US$100 per ounce decrease in isolation, would lead to an additional impairment at made it most susceptible to changes in the gold price.

Provisions continued Rehabilitation obligations arise from the acquisition, development, construction and normal operation of mining property, plant and equipment, due to government controls and regulations that protect the environment on the closure and reclamation of mining properties.
The major parts of the carrying amount of the obligation relate to tailings and heap leach pad closure rehabilitation: demolition of buildings mine facilities: ongoing water treatment: and ongoing care and maintenance of closed mines.
The fair values of rehabilitation provisions are measured by discounting the expected cash flows using a discount factor that reflects the credit-adjusted risk-free rate of interest.
ABG prepares estimates of the timing and amount of expected cash flows when an obligation is incurred and updates expected cash flows to reflect changes in facts and circumstances.
The principal factors that can cause expected cash flows to change are: the construction of new processing facilities: changes in the quantities of material in reserves and a corresponding change in the life of mine plan: changing ore characteristics that impact required environmental protection measures and related costs: changes in water quality that impact the extent of water treatment required: and changes in laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment.
Each year ABG assesses cost estimates and other assumptions used in the valuation of the rehabilitation provision at each mineral property to reflect events, changes in circumstances and new information available.
Changes in these cost estimates and assumptions are recorded as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the corresponding asset.
Rehabilitation provisions are adjusted to reflect the passage of time accretion calculated by applying the discount factor implicit in the initial fair-value measurement to the beginning-of-period carrying amount of the provision.
Settlement gains losses will be recorded in other income expense.

Oil price Diesel fuel is refined from crude oil and is therefore subject to the same price volatility affecting crude oil prices.
During 2011 and 2012 the Group entered into Brent oil option contracts to manage the impact of oil price fluctuations.
In 2013, oil prices traded between US$98 and US$119 per barrel with an average market price of US$109 2012: US$112 per barrel.
The table below summarises the impact of changes in the market prices of crude oil.
The impact is expressed in terms of the resulting change in the Groups profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2013.
The sensitivities are based on the assumption that the market price changes by US$10 per barrel with all other variables held constant.
The effect on profit after tax before hedging is calculated based on actual consumption for the year and does not address the indirect impact of a change in the oil price on other costs.

The designated contracts act as a hedge against variability in market prices, in a pre-defined range, of the cost of future fuel purchases over the next year.
At 31 December 2013, the Group had a total 144,000 barrels of Brent crude oil net purchase options outstanding.
All of the contracts mature in 2014.
Each contract consists of sold put options and bought call options with average strike prices of US$88 per barrel and US$105 per barrel respectively.
These contracts are treated as accounting hedges in accordance with IAS39.
Hedged items are identified as the first stated quantity of forecasted consumption purchased in a future month.
Hedge effectiveness is assessed using linear regression utilising the concept of the hypothetical derivative method.
The effective portion of changes in intrinsic value of the commodity contracts is recorded in other comprehensive income until the forecasted expenditure impacts earnings.
Risks relating to the use of derivatives By using derivatives, in addition to credit risk, we are affected by market risk.
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of a derivative might be adversely affected by a change in commodity prices, interest rates, or currency exchange rates, and that this in turn affects our financial condition.
We manage market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken.
Foreign currency risk The Groups transactions are denominated in a number of different currencies primarily US dollars, Tanzanian shillings, and South African rands.
The Group has liabilities that are primarily denominated in US dollars.
The US dollar is the Companys and its subsidiaries functional currency, as well as the Groups presentation currency.
Therefore, transactions in currencies other than the US dollar give rise to foreign currency translation risk.
The Groups primary exposure to this risk arises from direct mine operating costs and corporate administration costs that are transacted in shillings and rands, respectively.
Consequently, fluctuations in the US dollar: shilling rand exchange rates increase the volatility of cost of sales, corporate administration costs and overall net earnings, which are reported in US dollars.
The vast majority of all direct mining costs and corporate administration costs are denominated and settled in US dollars.
Consequently, the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations on the Groups reported direct mining and corporate administration costs is not significant.
The exchange rates at the end of each financial year are detailed in Note 2g.
Historically, the relationship between the gold price and the value of the shilling and rand provide a natural hedge against fluctuations in the exchange rate of these currencies against the US dollar.
Generally, a strengthening of the shilling rand, which would cause an increase in reported US dollar operating costs, corresponds with an increase in the US dollar gold price, which results in an increase in reported US dollar revenues.
During 2013 the Group entered into rand US dollar collar contracts to manage the impact of currency fluctuations on rand denominated operating and capital expenditures.
In 2013, the rand traded between R8.46 and R10.53 per US dollar, and averaged R9.63 per US dollar 2012: R8.20 per US dollar.
During 2012 the Group added R475 million of rand collar contracts for 2013 and 2014 with purchased put and sold call options with average strike prices of R8.70 and R9.59 respectively in 2013 and R8.90 and R9.80 respectively in 2014 up to April 2014 to hedge forecasted rand denominated capital spend in 2013 and part of 2014.
In 2013 no new contracts were entered on forecasted lower rand denominated capital expenditure.
The transactions are economic hedges, and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
Changes in the fair value of these options have been capitalised to the cost of the Bulyanhulu CIL Process plant asset in 2013 and will continue to be capitalised until the plant is brought into operation where after they will be recorded as a component of other income expense in the income statement.

At present, available funds are held with financial institutions at variable rates and primarily denominated in US dollars, interest income is not materially The Groups primary exposure to this risk arises from direct mine operating costs and corporate administration costs that are transacted in shillings affected by changes in short-term interest rates.
During the year, the Group entered into an Export Credit Insurance Company ECIC backed seven and rands, respectively.
Consequently, fluctuations in the US dollar: shilling rand exchange rates increase the volatility of cost of sales, corporate year term loan facility of US$142 million to fund the construction of the CIL Process plant at Bulyanhulu.

In 2013, the Group entered into interest rate swap contracts to hedge the interest on the ECIC backed loan for the Buly CIL Process plant.

Financial risk management continued b Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a third party might fail to fulfil its performance obligations under the terms of a financial instrument.
For cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables, credit risk represents the carrying amount on the balance sheet, net of any overdraft positions.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, and deposits with banks, as well as trade and other receivables.
The Groups financial assets are held with counterparties who the Group considers have an appropriate credit rating.
Location of credit risk is determined by physical location of the bank branch, customer or counterparty.
The maximum allowable term to maturity for any individual security is three months.
Investment counterparties must have a credit rating of at least Baa1 or better by Moodys Investor Services or BBB by Standard and Poors.
No more than 25% of the aggregate market value of the investment portfolio is maintained in any one country, with the exception of the United States of America or the United Kingdom, or in any one industry group.
Investments are primarily held in United States dollars.
Cash and cash equivalents in other foreign currencies are maintained for operational requirements.
As at 31 December 2014 the Group has money market investments of US$145.6 million.
All of the funds have at least a BBB rating from Standard and Poors.
The Group also has US$136.7 million in cash at bank on hand with credit ratings ranging from A-1 to A-2.
With respect to other receivables, the most significant debtor is the Tanzanian Revenue Authority TRA.
Following the abolishment of Government Notices regarding VAT relief and fuel duty exemption for mining companies in 2009, ABG signed a Memorandum of Settlement during 2011 with the TRA to address the treatment of the certain outstanding indirect tax refunds in respect of fuel levies and VAT that allows ABG to offset income tax payable against outstanding VAT and fuel levy refunds as it becomes payable.
Also, the Minister of Finance reinstated VAT relief and the fuel exemption followed by an agreement to allow for an escrow facility in respect of fuel and road levies.
Again through the Finance Act, 2012 issued on 19 October 2012, VAT Relief was abolished.
Throughout the past year, ABG has been actively involved in discussions with the Tanzanian Government and the TRA to resolve the issue.
The amendments conflict with certain provisions contained in the Groups existing Mine Development Agreements MDAs which guarantee the fiscal stability of its operations.
As part of a short-term solution, the Government during the third quarter of 2013, agreed to an escrow arrangement on VAT in relation to imported goods and services, whereby funds are restricted to the repayment of VAT refunds.
As at 31 December 2013, the discounted amounts due to the Group were approximately US$159.8 million prior year US$98.7 million.
We managed to receive refunds to the value of US$34.6 million during the year under review.
Group policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of a counterpartys failure to honour its obligations.
Individual exposures are monitored with trade customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each of the counterparties.
The Groups financial assets are with counterparties who the Group considers have an appropriate credit rating.
During the year, receivables to the value of US$71 million were advanced by a financial institution under a factoring agreement.
This agreement reduces the risk of default of receivables.
Maximum exposure to credit risk at each reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets described in Note 31.
The Group does not hold collateral as security for any trade receivables.
The Group does not grade the credit quality of receivables.
a Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk of loss from not having access to sufficient funds to meet both expected and unexpected cash demands.
The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by ensuring that its operating and strategic liquidity levels are well above minimum internal requirements.
Prudent liquidity risk management includes maintaining sufficient cash balances, and the availability of funding from an adequate amount of committed credit facilities.
At the end of both 2013 and 2012 the Group was in a positive net cash position, as disclosed in Note 20.
Details of the undrawn revolving credit facility are given in Note 31.
In the ordinary course of business, the Group receives cash proceeds from its operations and is required to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements.
The cash is managed to ensure surplus funds are invested to maximise returns while ensuring that capital is safeguarded to the maximum extent possible by investing only with financial institutions with a strong credit rating.
Insignificant uncommitted overdraft facilities are maintained with several banking counterparties to meet the Groups normal funding requirements.
The Groups primary source of liquidity is operating cash flow, and over the past two years the Group has generated an average of about US$228 million per year.
The principal risk factor affecting operating cash flow is market gold prices.
The principal uses of liquidity are sustaining capital expenditures at existing operating mines, construction activities at development projects, and interest payments.
Sustaining capital expenditures, including capitalised development costs, have averaged about US$274 million per year over the past two years.

Commitments and contingencies The Group is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties.
As at 31 December 2013, the Group has the following commitments and or contingencies: a Legal contingencies As at 31 December 2013, the Group was a defendant in approximately 333 lawsuits.
The plaintiffs are claiming damages and interest thereon for the loss caused by the Group due to one or more of the following: unlawful eviction, termination of services, wrongful termination of contracts of service, non-payment for services, defamation, negligence by act or omission in failing to provide a safe working environment, unpaid overtime and public holiday compensation.
The total amounts claimed from lawsuits in which specific monetary damages are sought amounted to US$142.8 million.
The Groups Legal Counsel is defending the Groups current position, and the outcome of the lawsuits cannot presently be determined.
However, in the opinion of the Directors and Groups Legal Counsel, no material liabilities are expected to materialise from these lawsuits.
Consequently no provision has been set aside against the claims in the books of account.
Included in the total amounts claimed is an appeal by the TRA intended for a tax assessment of US$21.3 million in respect of the acquisition of Tusker Gold Limited.
The case was awarded in favour of ABG however, the TRA has served a notice of appeal.
The calculated tax assessment is based on the sales price of the Nyanzaga property of US$71 million multiplied by the tax rate of 30%.
Management is of the opinion that the assessment is invalid due to the fact that the acquisition was for Tusker Gold Limited, a company incorporated in Australia.
The shareholding of the Tanzanian-related entities did not change and the Tusker Gold Limited group structure remains the same as prior to the acquisition.
Also included in the total amounts claimed is TRA claims to the value of $41.25 million for withholding tax on historic offshore dividend payments paid by ABG plc to its shareholders.
In addition to the claim, there are six other withholding tax claims which have not been quantified.
These claims are made on the basis that ABG is resident on Tanzania for tax purposes.
Management are of the opinion that the claims do not have substance and that it would be successfully defended.
On 26 October 2009, the TRA issued a demand notice against the Group for an amount relating to withholding tax on technical services provided to Bulyanhulu Gold Mine Ltd.
The claim amounts to US$5.4 million.
Management is of the opinion that the Group complied with all of the withholding tax requirements, and that there will be no amount payable, therefore no provision has been raised.
The TRA has issued a number of tax assessments to the Group relating to past taxation years from 2002 onwards.
The Group believes that these assessments are incorrect and has filed objections to each of them.
The Group is attempting to resolve these matters by means of discussions with the TRA or through the Tanzanian appeals process.
During the year under review the Board ruled in favour of BGML in relation to seven of ten issues raised by the TRA in final assessments for the 2000-2006 years under review.
The TRA filed a notice of intention to appeal against the ruling of the Board, while ABG has filed a counter appeal in respect of BGML to the Appeals Tribunal for all three items that were lost.
The positions that were ruled against BGML were sufficiently provided for in prior year results and management is of the opinion that open issues will not result in any material liabilities to the Group.
