Looking back over the year there have been many events that have impacted global markets, however the actions of central banks drove many of the major moves in 2013: Japan launched a huge stimulus program, fears that the US Fed would taper their bond purchases triggered a sharp fall across asset classes, the Eurozone economy continued to languish leading to interest rate cuts, whilst the new Bank of England Governor initiated forward guidance to moderate investors expectations of interest rate hikes.
Overall, the year proved to be strong for equities and credit, weak for government bonds, mixed for commodities and very challenging for emerging markets.
Against this backdrop, AllBlue Limited AllBlue generated a return of 1.51% Class A USD with modest correlation to traditional asset classes, low volatility and tight control of downside risk.
Reviewing 2013, four of the six strategies provided positive contributions whilst two, BlueTrend and BlueCrest Capital International, detracted from performance.
The largest positive contributors were BlueCrest Multi Strategy Credit and BlueMatrix.
In combination, AllBlue managed to retain its record of consistently positive annual returns, and has in fact been positive over every rolling 12 month period since inception.
Encouragingly, gains in both the first and fourth quarters were generated by positive returns across all six strategies.
In the second and third quarters, performance was impacted by the sharp reversal in government bond markets that caused losses for BlueTrend and BlueCrest Capital International.
Despite solid returns from the BlueCrest Emerging Markets, BlueCrest Multi Strategy Credit and BlueCrest Mercantile strategies relative to the severe losses incurred in their trading universe, AllBlue posted negative results over the summer.
In 2013, the AllBlue allocation to BlueMatrix was increased significantly to reflect higher conviction in the strategy due to model improvements, including a wider range of alpha signals and a broader 14 BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited 2013 Investment Manager Report set of markets covered.
The allocation to BlueCrest Capital International was reduced from a high starting point to fund the increase in the BlueMatrix allocation, along with increases in allocations to the BlueCrest Emerging Markets and BlueCrest Multi Strategy Credit strategies, where relative trading opportunities were more appealing.
Other allocation changes were less significant and were made to capture shifts in opportunities as markets evolved through the year.
Throughout the course of the year AllBlues VaR Historic Simulation, 95% confidence, 1 day VaR has averaged 0.38%, slightly up on the average for 2012, with a low of 0.17% being seen in June and a high of 0.42% being observed in January.
The underlying funds continued to hold significant levels of unencumbered cash, with levels at year end ranging from 23% in BlueCrest Mercantile to 84% in BlueCrest Capital International.
The imputed cash level for AllBlue was around 59% at year-end.
A high level of diversification was seen between the underlying funds, with the average correlation being 2%.
The highest correlation in 2013, measured on weekly data, was between BlueCrest Capital International and BlueTrend 50%, whilst the lowest correlation was observed between BlueCrest Emerging Markets and BlueCrest Mercantile -53%.
We believe that 2014 will be a year of considerable uncertainty.
A key driver of volatility will likely be the US Feds actions as economic developments unfold and the resulting changes in the markets anticipation of rate hikes.
Whilst the US economic outlook seems constructive, the recovery is unlikely to be smooth and the Fed will inevitably face future challenges if the labour market or inflation performs below above the base case, leading to instability in markets until control can be assured.
The ECB on its part is facing a more difficult task, since inflation is well below the target and the economic revival is marginal.
The imbalances between southern and northern Europe have not been addressed and economic improvements will likely be insufficient to sustain a recovery, eventually forcing the ECB to provide more stimulus through further rate cuts or even more dramatic actions.
Elsewhere sources of uncertainty include China, attempting to liberalise and rebalance its economy with a growing credit bubble and the Japanese experiment in massive quantitative easing.
Meanwhile emerging markets are vulnerable to a further slowdown as many countries are suffering from weak fiscal positions and increasing social tensions.
