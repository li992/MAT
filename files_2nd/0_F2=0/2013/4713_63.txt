Intangible assets continued statements Brands are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives and are therefore not amortised.
These brands are protected by 125 trademarks, which are renewable indefinitely, in all of the major markets where they are sold.
There are not believed to be any legal, Auditors report in respect of the Group regulatory or contractual provisions that limit the useful lives of these brands.
The nature of the premium drinks industry is that 126 obsolescence is not a common issue, with indefinite brand lives being commonplace, and Diageo has a number of brands that were Consolidated originally created more than 100 years ago.
Accordingly, the directors believe that it is appropriate that the brands are treated as having income statement indefinite lives for accounting purposes.
127 Consolidated b For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill has been attributed to cash-generating units as follows: statement of comprehensive 2013 2012 income million million 128 North America United States 209 223 Consolidated Western Europe 174 163 balance sheet Africa, Eastern Europe and Turkey East Africa 33 34 129 Africa Regional Markets 98 97 Consolidated statement of Russia and Eastern Europe 42 41 changes in equity Turkey 588 607 130 Latin America and Caribbean Paraguay, Uruguay and Brazil 74 Consolidated statement of Asia Pacific Greater China 122 105 cash flows Other cash-generating units 37 42 131 1,377 1,312 Accounting policies of the group Goodwill has arisen on acquisitions of businesses and distribution rights and includes synergies arising from cost savings and the 135 Notes to the opportunity to utilise the groups distribution network to leverage marketing of the acquired products and the extension of the groups consolidated portfolio of brands in other markets around the world.
financial statements 183 c Other intangibles comprise principally distribution rights.
Diageo owns the global distribution rights in perpetuity for Ketel One Auditors report vodka products, and the directors believe that it is appropriate to treat these rights as having an indefinite life for accounting purposes.
inrespect of The carrying value at 30 June 2013 was 1,184 million 2012 1,146 million.
All other distribution rights are amortised on a straight-line thecompany basis over the length of the distribution arrangements, generally between 10 and 20 years, unless there is an indication that the asset 184 Company may be impaired, in which case, if necessary, the asset is written down or the amortisation period is reassessed and changed.

company financial statements Impairment testing 190 To ensure that brands, goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives are not carried at above their recoverable amount, Principal group companies impairment reviews are performed comparing the net carrying value with the recoverable amount using value in use calculations.
For goodwill the recoverable amount is calculated in respect of the cash-generating unit including the attributed goodwill.
These calculations are performed annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The value in use calculations are based on discounted forecast cash flows and terminal values calculated on the assumption that cash flows continue in perpetuity at the long term growth rate of each country or region.
Cash flows are forecast for each brand, other intangible and cash-generating unit for the financial year, which is approved by management and reflects expectations of sales growth, operating costs and margin, based on past experience and external sources of information.
The discount rates used are the weighted average cost of capital which reflects the returns on government bonds specific to the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is attributed or returns on government bonds issued by triple A rated countries with a maturity of 10 years, and an equity risk premium adjusted for specific industry.
Further risk premiums are applied according to managements assessment of the risks in respect of the individual cash flows.
The group applies post-tax discount rates to post-tax cash flows as the valuation calculated using this method closely approximates to applying pre-tax discount rates to pre-tax cash flows.
The long term growth rates applied at the end of the forecast period are the long term annual inflation rate of the country obtained from external sources.
For goodwill, these assumptions are based on the cash-generating unit or group of units to which the goodwill is attributed.
For brands, they are based on a weighted average taking into account the country or countries where sales are made.
154 Diageo Annual Report 2013 For some intangible assets, management expects to achieve growth, driven by Diageos sales, marketing and distribution expertise, which is significantly in excess of the long term growth rates for the applicable countries or regions.
In these circumstances, the recoverable amount is calculated based on a five-year detailed plan and extended by up to an additional five to ten years using the annual growth rate of the real gross domestic product GDP of the country or region aggregated with its inflation rate, adjusted to take into account circumstances specific to the group.
In the calculation of the terminal recoverable amount, the long term annual inflation rate of the country is used as the growth rate.
For certain intangible assets more conservative long term assumptions are applied to calculate the recoverable amount.
The pre-tax discount rates and long term growth rates used for impairment testing are as follows: 2013 2012 Pre-tax Long term Pre-tax Long term discount growth discount growth rate rate rate rate % % % % North America United States 9 2 9 2 Western Europe Western Europe 12 2 12 2 Great Britain 8 2 8 2 Spain 13 1 13 2 Africa, Eastern Europe and Turkey East Africa 21 5 20 5 Africa Regional Markets 22 5 21 5 South Africa 14 5 13 5 Russia and Eastern Europe 13 5 12 5 Turkey 15 5 17 5 Latin America and Caribbean Paraguay, Uruguay and Brazil 17 5 15 5 Asia Pacific South East Asia 14 4 11 3 Korea 10 3 10 3 Australia 10 2 10 3 Greater China 12 3 10 3 Any impairment write downs identified are charged to other operating expenses in the income statement.
In the year ended 30 June 2013, an exceptional impairment of 50 million was charged in respect of the Cacique brand.
One of the principal markets for Cacique is Spain where the economy continued to suffer a significant downturn.
The forecast and long term growth assumptions for Cacique were further reduced due to a fall in demand which has resulted in an impairment of the brand value.
In the year ended 30 June 2012 the total impairment charge of 72 million included an exceptional impairment charge of 59 million in respect of Cacique.
In the year ended 30 June 2011 the exceptional impairment charge of 39 million was in respect of Ursus.
Sensitivity to change in key assumptions Impairment testing is dependent on managements estimates and judgements, particularly in respect of the forecasting of future cash flows, discount rates applied to those cash flows and expected long term growth rates.
The Cacique brand would be impaired further in case of an increase in discount rate of 1ppt, a decrease in long term growth rate of 2ppts and a decrease in forecast annual cash flows of 10% by 4 million, 3 million and 6 million against its current carrying value, respectively.
The impairment testing for the year ended 30 June 2013 has identified the Windsor Premier brand as being sensitive to reasonably possible changes in assumptions as the impairment model has been updated to reflect the challenging whisky market in Korea.
The brand would be impaired by less than 3 million if there was an increase in discount rate of 1ppt, a decrease in long term growth rates of 2ppts or a reduction in forecast annual cash flows of 10%.
An impairment charge of approximately 50 million would be required if forecast annual cash flows decreased by 20%.
Diageo has recently acquired Shui Jing Fang and Ypica brands in the emerging markets of China and Brazil, respectively.
Management recognises that a reasonable possible change in the key assumptions may cause carrying values to exceed their recoverable amounts.
Without mitigation, the Shui Jing Fang and Ypica brands could be impaired if there was a decrease of 10% in forecast annual cash flows by approximately 50 million and 15 million, respectively.
It remains possible that changes in assumptions in case of Cacique, Windsor Premier, Shui Jing Fang and Ypica brands could arise in excess of those indicated above.
For all intangibles with an indefinite life, other than those mentioned above, management has concluded that no reasonable possible change in the key assumptions on which it has determined the recoverable amounts would cause their carrying values to exceed their recoverable amounts.
