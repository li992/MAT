Notes forming part of the Group financial statements 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of properties, other investment, financial instruments and pension liability.
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as explained in the Report of the directors on page 129.
In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that may affect the financial statements.
The directors believe that the judgements made in the preparation of the financial statements are reasonable.
However, actual outcomes may differ from those anticipated.
Critical accounting judgements include the adoption of the external portfolio valuation without adjustment, the recognition of purchases and disposal of assets, the adoption of a single reporting segment and the level of control the Group has in respect of its joint ventures.
The accounting policies for these areas of judgement are set out below.
During the year ended 31 March 2013, the following accounting standards and guidance were adopted by the Group, the pronouncements either had no impact on the financial statements or resulted in changes to presentation and disclosure only: IFRS 7 amended Dec 2011 Disclosures Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities IFRS 7 amended Oct 2010 Disclosures Transfers of Assets The improvements to IFRSs May 2010 At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : IFRS 9 Financial Instruments will impact both the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interest in Other Entities will impact the disclosure of interests the Group has in other entities IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement will impact both the disclosure and measurement of fair value for certain assets and liabilities IAS 1 amended June 2011 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income IAS 12 Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets IAS 19 revised June 2011 Employee Benets IAS 27 revised May 2011 Separate Financial Statements IAS 28 revised May 2011 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures IAS 32 amended Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities will impact the measurement of certain assets and liabilities The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group, except as set out above.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings for the year ended 31 March 2013.
Subsidiary undertakings are those entities controlled by the Group.
Control is assumed when the Group directs the financial and operating policies of an entity to benefit from its activities.
Rental income This comprises rental income and premiums on lease surrenders on investment properties for the year, exclusive of service charges receivable.
Tenant leases The directors have considered the potential transfer of risks and rewards of ownership in accordance with IAS 17 Leases for all properties leased to tenants and in their judgement have determined that all such leases are operating leases.
Lease incentives Lease incentives including rent-free periods and payments to tenants, are allocated to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term or on another systematic basis, if applicable.
The value of resulting accrued rental income is included within the respective property.
72 Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2013 1 Accounting policies continued Other property expenses Irrecoverable running costs directly attributable to specic properties within the Groups portfolio are charged to the income statement as other property expenses.
Costs incurred in the improvement of the portfolio which, in the opinion of the directors, are not of a capital nature are written off to the income statement as incurred.
Administration expenses Costs not directly attributable to individual properties are treated as administration expenses.
Share-based payment The cost of granting share-based payments to employees and directors is recognised within administration expenses in the income statement.
The Group has used the Stochastic model to value the grants which is dependent upon factors including the share price, expected volatility and vesting period and the resulting fair value is amortised through the income statement over the vesting period.
The charge is reversed if it is likely that any non-market based criteria will not be met.
Investment property Investment properties and investment properties under development are professionally valued quarterly on a fair value basis by qualied external valuers and the directors must ensure that they are satisfied that the valuation of the Groups properties is appropriate for inclusion in the accounts without adjustment.
The valuations of investment properties and investment properties under development have been prepared in accordance with the RICS Valuation Professional Standards 2012 the Red Book.
For investment property this approach involves applying marketderived capitalisation yields to current and market-derived future income streams with appropriate adjustments for income voids arising from vacancies or rent-free periods.
These capitalisation yields and future income streams are derived from comparable property and leasing transactions and are considered to be the key inputs in the valuation.
Other factors that are taken into account in the valuations include the tenure of the property, tenancy details, planning, building and environmental factors that might affect the property.
In the case of investment property under development, the approach applied is the residual method of valuation, which is the investment method of valuation as described above with a deduction for the costs necessary to complete the development, together with an allowance for the remaining risk.
Depreciation No depreciation is provided in respect of freehold investment properties and leasehold investment properties.
Depreciation is provided on plant and equipment, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date of each asset evenly over its expected useful life, as follows: Fixtures and ttings over three to five years.
Leasehold improvements over the term of the lease.
Joint ventures Joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method where, in the directors judgement, the Group has joint control of the entity.
The Groups level of control in its joint ventures is driven both by the individual agreements which set out how control is shared by the partners and how that control is exercised in practice.
The Group balance sheet contains the Groups share of the net assets of its joint ventures.
Balances with partners owed to or from the Group by joint ventures are included within investments.
The Groups share of joint venture profits and losses are included in the Group income statement in a single line.
All of the Groups joint ventures adopt the accounting policies of the Group for inclusion in the Group financial statements.
Other investments Other investments are carried at fair value through profit and loss, with the loan element carried at cost less any recognised impairment loss.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences between the tax base of an asset or liability and its carrying amount in the balance sheet.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised when it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deferred tax asset can be utilised.
Pension benets The Group contributes to a dened benefit pension plan which is funded with assets held separately from those of the Group.
The full value of the net assets or liabilities of the pension fund is brought on to the balance sheet at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are taken to reserves: all other movements are taken to the income statement.
Annual Report 2013 Great Portland Estates 73 Notes forming part of the Group financial statements 1 Accounting policies continued Capitalisation of interest Interest associated with direct expenditure on investment properties under development is capitalised.
Direct expenditure includes the purchase cost of a site if it has been purchased with the specic intention to redevelop, but does not include the original book cost of a site previously held as an investment property.
Interest is capitalised from the start of the development work until the date of practical completion.
The rate used is the Groups weighted average cost of borrowings or, if appropriate, the rate on specic associated borrowings.
Financial instruments: i Derivatives The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency uctuations and interest rate risks.
The Groups derivatives are measured at fair value in the balance sheet.
To the extent that a derivative is a designated hedge and provides an effective cash ow hedge against the Groups underlying exposure the movements in the fair value of the hedge are taken to equity.
To the extent that the derivative is not a designated hedge or does not effectively hedge the underlying exposure the movement in the fair value of the hedge is taken to the income statement.
ii Borrowings The Groups borrowings in the form of its debentures, private placement notes and bank loans are recognised initially at fair value, after taking account of any discount or premium on issue and attributable transaction costs.
Subsequently borrowings are held at amortised cost, with any discounts, premiums and attributable costs charged to the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
iii Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into a known amount of cash and are subject to insignicant risk of changes in value.
iv Trade receivables and payables Trade receivables and payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Head leases The present value of future ground rents is added to the carrying value of a leasehold investment property and to long-term liabilities.
On payment of a ground rent virtually all of the cost is charged to the income statement, principally as interest payable, and the balance reduces the liability: an equal reduction to the assets valuation is charged to the income statement.
Segmental analysis All of the Groups revenue is generated from investment properties located in central London.
The properties are managed as a single portfolio by an asset management team whose responsibilities are not segregated by location or type, but are managed on an asset by asset basis.
The majority of the Groups assets are mixed use, therefore the ofce and retail space is managed together.
Within the investment property portfolio the Group has a number of properties under development.
The directors view the Groups development activities as an integral part of the lifecycle of each of its assets rather than a separate business or division.
The nature of developing property means that whilst a property is under development it generates no revenue and has no operating results.
Once a development has completed it returns to the investment property portfolio.
The directors have considered the nature of the business, how the business is managed and how they review performance and, in their judgement, the Group has only one reportable segment.
The components of the valuation, as provided by CBRE, are set out on page 28 of this Report.

The Groups net deferred tax at 31 March 2013 was nil 2012: nil.
This consists of a deferred tax liability of nil 2012: 0.1 million and a deferred tax asset of nil 2012: 0.1 million in respect of sundry short-term differences.
A deferred tax asset of 9.0 million based on a 23% tax rate, mainly relating to tax losses carried forward at 31 March 2013 and deferred tax arising in respect of contingent share awards, was not recognised because it is uncertain whether future taxable profits will arise against which these losses can be offset.
As a REIT, the Group is largely exempt from corporation tax in respect of its rental profits and chargeable gains relating to its property rental business.
The Group is otherwise subject to corporation tax.
The Group estimates that as the majority of its future profits will not be subject to corporation tax, it will have a very low tax charge over the coming years.
In order to ensure that the Group is able to both retain its status as a REIT and to avoid financial charges being imposed, a number of tests including a minimum distribution test must be met by both Great Portland Estates plc and by the Group as a whole on an ongoing basis.
These conditions are detailed in the Corporation Tax Act 2010.

As a result, an element of the Groups return on its investment in the joint venture is shown as a return on this liability.
This results in a revaluation deficit on the Groups equity investment and a revaluation surplus on the Groups balances with partners.

Eurohypo had a profit share arrangement dependent on the success of the two development schemes held by G. P. E. Marcol House Limited.
GPE and Eurohypo were considered to have joint control over the business of the entity despite GPE having a 100% equity interest.
Annual Report 2013 Great Portland Estates 81 Notes forming part of the Group financial statements 11 Investment in joint ventures continued In February 2013, GPE paid Eurohypo 25.5 million in respect of this profit share arrangement and accordingly Eurohypos interest in the business of the entity and the joint venture ceased.
Therefore, on GPE obtaining control, all subsequent results have been consolidated into the Groups results.
The inclusion of G. P. E. Marcol House Limited as a subsidiary had no impact on the Groups profit for the year.

The Group has a policy of only dealing with creditworthy tenants and obtaining sufficient rental cash deposits or third party guarantees as a means of mitigating financial loss from defaults.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the large and diverse tenant base.
Accordingly the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of rent deposits obtained.
Details of the Groups receivables are summarised in note 14 of the financial statements.
The Groups cash deposits are placed with a diversied range of banks and strict counterparty limits ensure the Groups exposure to bank failure is minimised.
Capital risk The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns and as such it aims to maintain an appropriate mix of debt and equity nancing.
The current capital structure of the Group consists of a mix of equity and debt.
Equity comprises issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Group statement of changes in equity.
Debt comprises long-term debenture stock, private placement notes and drawings against committed revolving credit facilities from banks.
The Group operates solely in the United Kingdom, and its operating profits and net assets are sterling denominated, as a result the Groups policy is to have no unhedged assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
The currency risk on overseas transactions is fully hedged through foreign currency derivatives to create a synthetic sterling exposure.
Annual Report 2013 Great Portland Estates 85 Notes forming part of the Group financial statements 17 Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The Group operates a framework for the management of the Groups short-, mediumand long-term funding requirements.
Cash ow and funding needs are regularly monitored to ensure sufficient undrawn facilities are in place.
The Groups funding sources are diversied across a range of bank and bond markets and strict counterparty limits are operated on deposits.
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through the utilisation of its revolving credit facilities.
The availability of these facilities depends on the Group complying with a number of key financial covenants: these covenants and the Groups compliance with these covenants are set out in the table below: March 2013 Key covenants Covenant actuals Group 1.25x 0.43x Net debt net equity Inner borrowing unencumbered asset value unsecured borrowings 1.66x 2.79x Interest cover 1.35x 2.44x The Group has undrawn credit facilities of 264.0 million and has substantial headroom above all of its key covenants.
As a result the directors consider the Group to have adequate liquidity to be able to fund the ongoing operations of the business.
The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity on its financial instruments and have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash ows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group is required to pay and conditions existing at the balance sheet date: Carrying Contractual Less than One to Two to More than amount cash ows one year two years five years five years At 31 March 2013 m m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities 5 142.9 million 5 8% debenture stock 2029 144.1 270.1 8.0 8.0 24.1 230.0 Bank loans revolving credit facilities 234.1 250.6 5.4 5.4 239.8 Other loan 0.9 0.9 0.9 Private placement notes 286.1 372.3 13.0 13.0 39.6 306.7 Derivative financial instruments Cross currency swaps 2.6 2.8 0.5 0.5 1.1 0.7 Interest rate swap 0.1 0.1 0.1 Interest rate oor 3.8 4.6 3.1 1.5 658.9 892.2 23.9 26.3 304.6 537.4 Carrying Contractual Less than One to Two to More than amount cash ows one year two years five years five years At 31 March 2012 m m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities 5 142.9 million 5 8% debenture stock 2029 144.2 278.1 8.0 8.0 24.1 238.0 Bank loans revolving credit facilities 200.1 220.2 4.6 4.6 211.0 Private placement notes 158.8 217.1 8.0 8.0 24.3 176.8 Derivative financial instruments Cross currency swaps 4.2 3.3 0.5 0.5 1.1 1.2 Interest rate swap 0.1 0.2 0.1 0.1 Interest rate oor 4.8 4.7 1.9 1.9 0.9 502.6 714.2 19.3 19.3 259.6 416.0 86 Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2013 17 Financial instruments continued Market risk Interest rate risk arises from the Groups use of interest-bearing financial instruments.
It is the risk that future cash ows from a financial instrument will uctuate due to changes in interest rates.
It is the Groups policy either to eliminate interest rate risk over the cash ows on its long-term debt finance through the use of xed rate debentures or to mitigate the risk through the use of oating to xed interest rate swaps, caps, oors, collars and swaptions.
It is the Groups policy to maintain the proportion of oating interest rate exposure to between 20%40% of forecast total interest rate cost.
Interest rate swaps Interest rate swaps enable the Group to exchange its oating rate interest payments on its bank debt for xed rate payments on a notional value.
Such contracts allow the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the cash ow exposures on its variable rate bank loans by locking in a xed rate on a proportion of its debt.
Interest rate oors Under the terms of an interest rate oor, one party the seller makes a payment to the other party the buyer if an underlying interest rate is below a specified rate.
The Group has bought an interest rate oor, which, when combined with its xed rate private placement notes raised in 2011, gives rise to the same economic effect as purchasing an interest rate cap in respect of oating rate debt.
Put option A put option is a contract between two parties to exchange an asset at a specified price by a set date.
The Group has a 12.5% holding in The 100 Bishopsgate Partnership and has a put option to enable it to sell its net investment to Brookeld Properties Corporation for 15.8 million in October 2014.
The value of the option will only be greater than a nominal amount in the event that the value of the underlying investment is impaired below its cost.
Therefore, the value of the underlying investment together with the put option total the 15.8 million put option price.
Cross currency swaps Cross currency swaps enable the Group to exchange receipts or payments denominated in currencies other than sterling for receipts or payments denominated in sterling.
Such contracts allow the Group to eliminate foreign exchange risk arising from uctuating exchange rates between sterling and other currencies.

24 Employee benets The Group contributes to a dened benefit final salary pension plan the Plan, the assets of which are held by trustees separately from the assets of the Group.
The Plan has been closed to new entrants since April 2002.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Plan was conducted at 1 April 2012 by a qualied independent actuary using the projected unit method.
The Plan was valued using the following main assumptions: 2013 2012 % % Discount rate 4.50 5.00 Expected return on Plan assets 3.85 4.12 Expected rate of salary increases 4.25 4.25 Future pension increases 5.00 3.25 To develop the expected long-term rate of return on the Plan assets, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the long-term rate of return on Plan assets for the portfolio.
This resulted in the selection of an assumption of 3.85% p. a.
