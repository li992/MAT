Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset where they relate to the same taxation authority and net settlement and offset is permitted.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 27 December 2013 28 December 2012 $000 $000 Deferred tax assets 109,181 89,193 Deferred tax liabilities 4,948 4,891 104,233 84,302 At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of $716,703,068 2012: $539,850,605 and unused tax credits of $38,192,791 2012: $33,945,792 available for offset against future profits.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining unused tax losses of $498,808,643 2012: $315,635,132 and unused tax credits of $26,728,251 2012: $25,454,151 due to either a history of tax losses, uncertain tax positions, or it is not considered probable that there will be sufficient future taxable profits to realise the benefit of all deferred tax assets within certain subsidiary entities.
Included in unrecognised tax losses and unrecognised tax credits are tax losses of $212,129,934 2012: $72,278,400 and tax credits of $26,728,251 2012: $25,454,151 that will expire in 5-19 years.
Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, no deferred tax liability has been recognised on temporary differences of $28,289,628 2012: $31,784,663 relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences at 27 December 2013 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the uK of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.
The recognition of the deferred tax asset is based on managements assessment of historic profitability, forecasted operating results based upon approved business plans and a review of the tax planning opportunities.
Based on this, management concluded that there is convincing evidence for the recognition of deferred tax assets in excess of the deferred tax liability by $88,250,962 2012: $21,892,569 in entities that have suffered a loss in the current or preceding periods.
12 Loss Earnings Per Share Basic loss earnings per share is calculated by dividing loss profit by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue throughout the period, adjusting for ordinary shares held in Treasury and ordinary shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust.
For diluted loss earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is further adjusted for the effect of potentially dilutive ordinary shares, arising from the assumed exercise of employee share options and share awards that are in the money and for which management has identified that performance conditions, associated with the vesting of certain employee share options and awards, are likely to be achieved.
For a description of the Groups employee share option and share award plans, refer to note 29.
Loss earnings per share is only diluted when the result for the period is a profit.
