As a result of that transaction, the parent company transferred 645.1 million of revaluation gains relating to these investments to the profit and loss reserve.
As the transfer of these revaluation gains arose as a result of a sale of assets within the Group, it is unlikely that the Company will seek to treat the profit and loss reserve thus arising as distributable.
Under the articles of association of certain Group investment undertakings, realised capital surpluses are not available for distribution as dividends.
