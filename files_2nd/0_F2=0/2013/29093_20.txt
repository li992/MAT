Asset Management principally comprises investment management including advisory services, equity products, fixed income securities, multi-asset investments, property and alternative asset classes such as commodities, private equity and funds of hedge funds.
Wealth Management principally comprises investment management, financial planning and banking services provided to high net worth individuals and charities.
Group principally comprises the Groups investment capital and treasury management activities, insurance arrangements and the management costs associated with governance and corporate management.
Insurance activities comprise acting as an insurer to the Group, including the results of the captive insurer which provides reinsurance for certain activities of the Group.
Provisions for actual and potential claims that are within the insurance cover are consequently recorded in the Group segment, net of any recognisable external insurance asset.
If it is concluded that there is no insurance cover available or the insurance cover will not cover the charge in full, the actual or estimated cost in excess of the insurance recovery is transferred to the relevant operating segment.
The expected insurance recovery may be in excess of the amount that is allowed to be recorded under accounting rules.
Segment information is presented on the same basis as that provided for internal reporting purposes to the Groups chief operating decision-maker, the Chief Executive.
Operating expenses include an allocation of costs between the individual business segments on a basis that aligns the charge with the resources employed by the Group in particular business areas.
This allocation provides management information on the business performance to manage and control expenditure.

Revenue The Groups primary source of revenue is fee income from investment management activities within both Asset Management and Wealth Management and includes fees that are paid away to intermediaries as part of cost of sales see note 3.
Management fees are generally based on an agreed percentage of the valuation of the AUM and are recognised as the service is provided and it is probable that the fee will be received.
If fees are received in advance, the amounts received are only recognised in the income statement once the Group provides the service for which the client has paid.
Performance fees are earned from some clients when contractually agreed performance levels are exceeded within specified performance measurement periods.
They are only recognised, at the end of these performance periods, when a reliable estimate of the fee can be made and it is almost certain that it will be received.
Revenue also includes other fees, principally transaction-based, which vary based on the volume of transactions, such as transfer agency fees which are recorded as income as the service is provided and the receipt of income is almost certain.
Wealth Management receives interest as a result of placing loans and deposits with other financial institutions, advancing loans and overdrafts to clients and holding debt and other fixed income securities.
For Wealth Management, earning a net interest margin is a core activity: interest income is therefore recorded separately from interest earned elsewhere in the business.
Interest income is recognised as it is earned using the effective interest method, which allocates interest income at a constant rate of return over the expected life of the financial instrument based on the estimated future cash flows.
Cost of sales Fee expense principally comprises commissions, external fund manager fees and distribution fees payable to financial institutions that distribute our products, investment platform providers and financial advisers.
The expense is generally based on an agreed percentage of the value of the investments placed with the Group and is recognised in the income statement as the service is provided.
Wealth Management pays interest to clients on deposits taken.
For Wealth Management, earning a net interest margin is a core activity: interest payable in respect of these activities is therefore recorded separately from interest payable elsewhere in the business.

Net gains on financial instruments and other income The Group holds investment capital, which is invested in a variety of financial instruments, and targets a low-volatility cash plus 1.5 per cent.
Investments are also held for regulatory capital purposes in certain operating entities and as a stock of units to facilitate purchases and sales by the UK unit trust manager.
Net gains and losses, principally representing market movements on financial instruments such as fixed income debt instruments, equities and certain loans and deposits in Wealth Management that are held at fair value to match the revaluation of interest rate swaps, are recognised in this line of the income statement as are any gains and losses on derivatives which mainly arise from hedging activities.
Of the Groups investments held at fair value, the majority are carried at fair value through profit or loss FVP and gains and losses arising are recognised in the income statement.
There are two types of FVP investment: those that are designated as FVP upon initial recognition, and those that are classified as held for trading.
Certain other investments are classified as available-for-sale.
This classification is selected typically when the investment is expected to be held for the long term but not necessarily to maturity and where short-term volatility does not reflect long-term expected returns.
Generally, unrealised gains and losses on available-for-sale investments are recorded in other comprehensive income, but the cumulative gains and losses are transferred to the income statement if the investment is impaired, sold or otherwise realised.
The fair value reserve in the statement of changes in equity represents the difference between the cost or, if the asset has been reclassified or impaired, the fair value at date of reclassification or impairment and the fair value of financial assets that are classified as available-for-sale.
Any impairments on loans and receivables are also included in the income statement.
The Group reviews its available-for-sale investments and loans and receivables for impairment at the end of each reporting period.
The total return on investments also includes interest, which is included in note 6 Net finance income.
Other income includes gains and losses on foreign exchange and rent receivable from subletting properties.

Operating expenses Operating expenses represent the Groups administrative expenses and are recognised as the services are provided.
Certain costs, including leases and capitalised costs, are charged evenly over the life of the relevant contract or useful life of the asset.
The biggest part is employee benefits, as shown below.
Other costs include accommodation, IT, electronic information systems and marketing, along with movements in provisions which are recorded based on an estimate of unavoidable costs relating to past transactions.
Control of compensation and total cost control are both key performance indicators of the Group.
Compensation is managed to a target long-term ratio of between 45 and 49 per cent.
compensation to operating net revenue.
Total costs are managed to a target long-term ratio of between 65 and 70 per cent.
total costs to total net revenue.
The compensation ratio in particular provides some flexibility to manage the overall cost base in response to market conditions.
Employee benefits expense includes salaries and wages, together with the cost of other benefits provided to employees such as pension and bonuses.
The Group makes some cash-based performance awards to employees which are deferred over a specified vesting period.
Such awards are charged to the income statement over the performance period and the vesting period.
Further detail on other types of employee benefit can be found elsewhere within these financial statements: see note 26 for pension costs, and note 27 for more detail on compensation that is awarded in Schroders plc shares.

Net finance income The Group earns interest on non-banking activities, principally on cash and deposits with banks, but also as a result of holding investments in debt and fixed income securities.
Fixed income investments and cash excluding those of Wealth Management entities are managed mainly by Group Treasury to earn competitive rates of return and ensure liquidity throughout the Group.
Significant amounts of the Group's cash and interest-earning securities are held within Wealth Management.
Interest earned on the assets held within Wealth Management is included in revenue: interest incurred on the liabilities assumed is included in cost of sales.
Interest is recognised using the effective interest method see note 2.
Tax expense The Group is headquartered in the UK and pays taxes according to the rates applicable in the countries and states in which it operates.
Most taxes are recorded in the income statement see part a and relate to taxes payable for the reporting period current tax.
The charge also includes benefits and charges relating to when income or expenses are recognised in a different period for tax and accounting purposes or specific treatment relating to acquisitions deferred tax see note 15.
Some current and deferred taxes are recorded through other comprehensive income, mainly relating to the Groups defined benefit pension schemes see part b, or directly to equity where the tax arises from changes in the value of remuneration settled as shares see part c. a Analysis of tax charge reported in the income statement 2013 2012 m m UK Corporation Tax on profits for the year 47.5 29.6 Adjustments in respect of prior year estimates 0.1 1.7 Foreign tax current 58.1 54.6 Foreign tax adjustments in respect of prior years 1.3 8.6 Current tax 104.2 77.3 Origination and reversal of temporary differences 8.1 6.5 Adjustments in respect of prior year estimates 0.5 4.6 Effect of changes in Corporation Tax rates 1.8 1.4 Deferred tax 9.4 0.5 Tax charge reported in the income statement 94.8 76.8 b Analysis of tax charge reported in other comprehensive income 2013 2012 m m Deferred tax on actuarial losses gains on defined benefit pension schemes 2.3 2.6 Deferred tax effect of changes in Corporation Tax rates 2.5 1.5 Tax charge reported in other comprehensive income 0.2 4.1 c Analysis of tax credit reported in equity 2013 2012 m m Current income tax on Equity Compensation Plan and other share-based remuneration 8.3 3.9 Deferred tax on Equity Compensation Plan and other share-based remuneration 11.2 3.1 Deferred tax effect of changes in Corporation Tax rates 1.9 0.7 Tax credit reported in equity 17.6 6.3 104 Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial report 7.

Earnings per share This key performance indicator shows the portion of the Groups profit after tax that is attributable to each share excluding shares held by the Group.
The calculation is based on the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
The diluted figure recalculates that number as if all share options, that would be expected to be exercised as they have value to the option holder, had been exercised in the period.
Shares that may be issued are not taken into account if the impact does not reduce earnings per share.

The recommended 2013 final dividend is payable on 7 May 2014 and will be accounted for in 2014.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables includes prepayments and deposits with banks in the form of bullion as well as amounts the Group is due to receive from third parties in the normal course of business.
Amounts due from third parties include fees yet to be received as well as settlement accounts for transactions undertaken on behalf of funds and investors.
Trade and other receivables, other than deposits with banks in the form of bullion which are recorded at fair value, are recorded initially at fair value and then at amortised cost see note 11, after the deduction of provisions for bad and doubtful debts.
Prepayments arise where the Group pays cash in advance for services.
As the service is provided, the prepayment is reduced and the operating expense recognised in the income statement.
Other receivables includes insurance recoveries.

106 Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial report 11.
Financial assets The Group holds financial assets including equities, debt securities and derivatives to support its Group capital strategies and its Wealth Management book and client loans.
The Group enters into derivatives on behalf of Wealth Management clients to enable them to participate in the derivatives market, referred to as client facilitation see note 21.
The Group initially records all financial assets at fair value, which is the cost of acquiring the asset or, in the case of loans, the amount loaned to clients.
The Group holds each financial asset either at fair value fair value through profit or loss and available-for-sale or at amortised cost held to maturity and loans and receivables.
Fair value is explained on the following page.
Amortised cost is the basis of moving the initial amount of the financial instrument normally fair value to the maturity value on a systematic basis using a fixed interest rate effective interest rate taking account of repayment dates and initial premiums or discounts.
The carrying value of amortised cost financial instruments is adjusted for impairments.
Impairment is normally determined based on a realistic assessment of future cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate compared with contractual amounts.
Hedge accounting Where derivatives are held for risk management purposes, the Group formally documents the relationship between the derivative and any hedged item, its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking the various hedging transactions.
It also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of hedged items.
For fair value hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the income statement.
Such accounting considerations are only required for available-for-sale hedged items which otherwise would be recorded in other comprehensive income.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or the instrument is derecognised.
In respect of hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
The ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
On disposal of the foreign operation, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised directly in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement.

Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable willing parties in an arms length transaction.
The fair value of financial instruments may require some judgement or may be derived from readily available sources.
The degree of judgement involved is reflected in the fair value measurements section below, although this does not necessarily indicate that the fair value is more or less likely to be realised.
For investments that are actively traded in financial markets, fair value is determined by reference to official quoted market bid prices.
For investments that are not actively traded, fair value is determined by using quoted prices from third parties such as brokers, market makers and pricing agencies.
For private equity investments where there is no quoted market price, fair value is determined with reference to International Private Equity and Venture Capital IPEVC Valuation Guidelines and by independent professional valuers.
Each instrument has been categorised using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the extent of judgements used in the valuation.
These levels are based on the degree to which the fair value is observable and are defined as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and principally comprise investments in quoted equities, daily-priced funds, gilts and exchange-traded derivatives: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from prices that are not traded in an active market but are determined using valuation techniques, which make maximum use of observable market data included within Level 1 for the asset or liability and principally comprise corporate bonds and foreign exchange contracts.
Valuation techniques may include using a broker quote in an inactive market, an evaluated price based on a compilation of primarily observable market information or industry standard calculations, utilising vendor feed data and information readily available via external sources.
For funds not priced on a daily basis, e. g. property funds, the net asset value which is issued monthly or quarterly is used: and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data and principally comprise investments in private equity and hedge funds.
These funds are managed by third parties and are measured at the values provided by the relevant fund managers.
Venture capital funds are valued based on the best available IPEVC valuation information.
The most recent available valuation data is used and adjusted for known events such as calls or distributions.
The valuation review is a continual process throughout the year.
The fair value of financial assets classified as held to maturity derived from level 1 inputs and loans and receivables derived from level 2 inputs was 871.0 million 2012: 1,017.4 million.

Financial assets continued Estimates and judgements Estimates and judgements used in preparing the financial statements are periodically evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable.
The resulting accounting estimates may not equal the related actual results.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on the carrying amounts of financial assets are discussed below.
Valuation of financial assets where there is no quoted price Such assets principally consist of investments in private equity, hedge funds, funds of hedge funds and certain loans in Wealth Management.
The determination of fair value requires significant judgement, particularly in determining whether changes in fair value have occurred since the last formal valuation by the fund manager or adviser.
In making this judgement the Group evaluates amongst other factors the effect of cash distributions and changes in the business outlook.
Impairment of financial assets categorised as available-for-sale, loans and receivables and held to maturity Such assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period for impairment.
If the year-end fair value of an asset is less than the cost or deemed cost of that asset, the Group will assess whether there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
In respect of equity products, consideration is given to the extent to which the fair value of an instrument is below cost and to the length of time that the fair value of an instrument has been below cost.
Associates and joint ventures Associates are companies the Group partly owns and over which it has significant influence but not control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions.
Joint ventures are companies in which the Group has an investment where it, along with one or more other shareholders, has contractually agreed to share control of the business and where the major decisions require the unanimous consent of the joint partners.
In both cases, the Groups income statement reflects its share of the entitys profit or loss after tax and amortisation of intangible assets, the statement of other comprehensive income records the Groups share of gains and losses arising from the entitys available-for-sale financial assets, the statement of financial position records the Groups share of the net assets of the entity plus any goodwill and intangible assets that arose on purchase less subsequent amortisation and the statement of changes in equity records the Groups share of other equity movements of the entity.
Goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed regularly for impairment.
The associates and joint ventures reserve in the statement of changes in equity represents the Groups share of profits in its investments yet to be received e. g. in the form of dividends or distributions, less any amortisation of intangible assets.
Investments in associates and joint ventures comprise: 2013 2012 Associates Joint ventures Total Associates Joint ventures Total m m m m m m At 1 January 77.5 1.9 79.4 56.4 2.0 58.4 Exchange translation adjustments 1.9 0.1 1.8 1.7 0.1 1.8 Additions 4.9 2.9 7.8 23.3 23.3 Profit for the year after tax 5.4 0.6 6.0 3.8 0.7 4.5 Losses gains recognised in other comprehensive income 0.9 0.9 1.5 1.5 Other movements in reserves of associates and joint ventures 0.9 0.9 Capital redemptions and distributions of profit 5.8 0.7 6.5 5.8 0.7 6.5 At 31 December 78.3 4.8 83.1 77.5 1.9 79.4 During the year, the Group increased its holding in RWC Partners Limited and acquired an interest in, Secquaero Advisors Limited, an insurance-linked securities investment management business based in Switzerland.
Information about the principal associates and joint ventures held by the Group at 31 December 2013 is shown on the following page.

Ltd. BoCom Associate Investment management China Ordinary shares 30% Axis Asset Management Company Limited Axis Associate Investment management India Ordinary shares 25% The Group holds 50% of each class of share.
The financial statements of SVIL are prepared to 30 June each year.
Accounts are prepared to this date so that the companys year end is the same as those of its major investments.
For the purposes of applying the equity method of accounting, the interim financial statements of SVIL at 31 December have been used.
Although the Group owns 51 per cent.
of the issued share capital of RWC, its voting power is limited to 49 per cent.
For this, and other accounting reasons, the Group considers that the investment is an associate.
In 2013 the Bank of Communications Schroders Fund Management Co. Ltd BoCom was reclassified from a joint venture to an associate.
The Group has updated its assessment of the substance of its agreements with its joint ventures and associates and believes that significant influence rather than joint control existed.
As a result, comparative data has been amended to reflect the reclassification.
Property, plant and equipment The Groups long-life assets provide the infrastructure to enable the Group to operate.
These principally comprise computer equipment and leasehold improvements.
The cost of these assets is recognised in the income statement over time as a depreciation charge.
The assets are normally depreciated over three to five years.

Goodwill and intangible assets Intangible assets other than software arise when the Group acquires a business and the fair value paid exceeds the fair value of the net tangible assets acquired.
This premium reflects additional value that the Group determines to be attached to the business.
Intangible assets include contractual agreements to manage client funds and gain additional access to new or existing clients, geographies and brand names.
Where such assets can be identified, they are recorded as intangible assets arising from business combinations and charged to the income statement over time.
Consideration paid to acquire the business in excess of the acquisition date fair value of net tangible and intangible assets is known as goodwill.
Goodwill is not charged to the income statement unless its value has diminished.
After acquisition, the business is normally integrated fully into the existing Group.
Assessment of whether goodwill has become impaired is based on the expected future returns of the relevant business segment as a whole.
Software purchased for use in the business is also referred to as an intangible asset.
The cost of purchasing software is taken to the income statement over time as an amortisation charge.
The treatment is similar to property, plant and equipment and the asset is normally amortised evenly over three to five years.
Of the total goodwill of 357.0 million 2012: 117.2 million, 288.1 million 2012: 108.1 million is allocated to Asset Management and 68.9 million 2012: 9.1 million to Wealth Management.
Of the goodwill relating to the acquisition of Cazenove Capital of 222.3 million, 162.3 million has been allocated to Asset Management and 60.0 million to Wealth Management.
All of the 19.8 million goodwill relating to the acquisition of STW has been allocated to Asset Management.
More information regarding these acquisitions is set out in note 28.
The majority of the Groups intangible assets from business combinations relate to the Cazenove Capital acquisition: the proportion of assets allocated to Asset Management 34.1 million at the acquisition date will be charged to the income statement over four years, and the proportion allocated to Wealth Management 66.7 million at the acquisition date over eight years.
Estimates and judgements At each reporting date, an assessment is made as to whether there is any indication that goodwill or an acquired intangible asset may be impaired.
If any indication exists and the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amount at that time, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined using a discounted cash flow model, details of which are provided on the next page.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and cannot be reversed.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
For all relevant acquisitions, the lowest level of CGU the Group uses to determine impairment is segment level.
The recoverable amount of acquired intangible assets is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and the updated discounted valuation of the remaining net residual income stream.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement but may be reversed if relevant conditions improve.
Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 113 Financial report Notes to the accounts 14.
Goodwill and intangible assets continued The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations applying a discounted cash flow model.
The key assumptions on which management have based their five-year cash flow projections are market growth rates of 11 per cent.
a pre-tax discount rate of 14 per cent.
expected fund flows based on expectations by individual countries : and expected changes to margins based on an analysis of the current fee structure flexed to take into account expected changes in product mix and the proportion of rebates payable to external distributors.
The results of the calculation indicates that goodwill for both CGUs is not impaired.
The sensitivity of the carrying amounts of goodwill to the methods and assumptions used in estimating the recoverable amounts of the CGUs is small.
This is due to the amount of goodwill allocated to a business segment relative to the size of the segments future profitability estimate.
Movements in the growth rate and or the discount rate of 1 per cent.
would not lead to any impairment.
A comparison of actual results to the projected results used to assess goodwill impairment in prior years reveals that the Group would have recognised no changes 2012: nil to its goodwill asset in the year as a result of inaccurate projections.
Deferred tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent amounts of tax that will become recoverable and payable in future accounting periods.
They generally arise as a result of temporary differences, where the time at which profits and losses are recognised for tax purposes differs from the time at which the relevant transaction is recorded in the accounts.
A deferred tax asset represents a tax reduction that is expected to arise in a future period.
A deferred tax liability represents taxes which will become payable in a future period as a result of a current or an earlier transaction.
Deferred tax liabilities also arise on acquisitions where the amortisation of the acquired intangible asset does not result in a tax deduction.
The deferred tax liability is established on acquisition and is released to the income statement to match the intangible asset amortisation.
In respect of assets, the Group only recognises a deferred tax asset when the availability of future profits necessary to support the deferred tax asset is probable.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the year-end date.
This rate is also applied to deferred tax liabilities arising on acquisitions.
a Deferred tax assets in respect of temporary differences 2013 2012 m m At 1 January 47.8 50.1 Acquired in business combinations 16.2 Income statement credit charge 9.3 0.2 Other comprehensive income expense 0.2 4.1 Credit taken to equity 9.3 2.4 Other movements 1.5 0.4 At 31 December 48.5 47.8 Included in deferred tax assets relating to other temporary differences is an asset relating to UK tax deductions for share-based remuneration which is dependent on the prices of the Companys ordinary and non-voting ordinary shares at the time the awards are exercised.
These have been recognised based on the share prices as at 31 December 2013.
A net deferred tax liability of 16.2 million has been recorded in respect of acquisitions in the year.
This principally comprises a deferred tax liability in respect of Cazenove Capital intangible assets see note 28 that will be credited to the income statement in line with the amortisation of those intangible assets.
This is required by accounting standards as the amortisation of intangible assets is not tax deductible.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where permitted by accounting standards.
114 Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial report 15.
Deferred tax continued A deferred tax asset of 19.5 million 2012: 21.5 million relating to realised and unrealised capital losses has not been recognised as there is insufficient evidence that there will be sufficient taxable gains in the future against which the asset could be utilised.
A deferred tax asset of 15.6 million 2012: 15.0 million relating to losses and other temporary differences has not been recognised as there is insufficient evidence that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which it can be utilised.
The aggregate amount of gross temporary differences arising from unremitted profits in subsidiaries is 7.0 million 2012: 4.1 million.
Deferred tax has not been provided as the relevant parent company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Unit-linked liabilities and assets backing unit-linked liabilities The Group operates a unit-linked life assurance business through the wholly-owned subsidiary, Schroder Pension Management Limited referred to as the Life Company.
The Life Company provides investment products through a life assurance wrapper.
The investment products do not provide cover for any insurance risk and are therefore recognised and accounted for as financial instruments and presented as financial liabilities due to Life Company investors policyholders within unit-linked liabilities.
The investment product is almost identical to a unit trust.
The Group earns revenue from managing the investment which is included in net revenue.
As it is a life assurance product the contractual rights and obligations of the investments remain with the Group and the AUM is therefore included on the Groups statement of financial position together with the liability to investors.
Where the Life Company has a controlling interest in an Authorised Unit Trust AUT, the AUT is consolidated.
The net assets attributable to third-party investors in the AUT are included in unit-linked liabilities.
Financial assets and liabilities held by the Life Company are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Other balances include cash and receivables, which are measured at amortised cost see note 11.
The Life Companys assets are regarded as current assets as they represent the amount available to Life Company investors or third-party investors in consolidated AUTs who are able to withdraw their funds on call, subject to certain restrictions in the case of illiquidity.
Gains and losses from assets and liabilities held to cover investor obligations are attributable to investors in the Life Company or third-party investors in the consolidated AUT.
As a result, any gain or loss is offset by a change in the obligation to investors.
Unit-linked liabilities comprise: 2013 2012 m m Financial liabilities due to Life Company investors 9,912.0 8,384.1 Financial liabilities due to third-party investors 1,219.7 962.2 11,131.7 9,346.3 Such liabilities arise in respect of assets controlled by the Group that are beneficially owned by third parties.
The Group has no primary exposure to market risk, credit risk or liquidity risk in relation to the investments of the Life Company.
The risks and rewards associated with its investments are normally borne by the investors in the Life Companys investment products or third-party investors in the consolidated AUTs and not by the Life Company itself.

Unit-linked liabilities and assets backing unit-linked liabilities continued Fair value measurements of Life Company financial assets and liabilities Each of the Life Companys financial assets and liabilities has been categorised using a fair value hierarchy.
These levels are based on the degree to which the fair value is observable and are defined in note 11.
The Life Companys financial instruments at the year-end date are analysed as follows: 2013 Financial instruments not Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 at fair value Total m m m m m Assets backing unit-linked liabilities 9,609.0 544.1 158.2 820.4 11,131.7 Unit-linked liabilities 11,096.6 8.5 26.6 11,131.7 Within assets backing unit-linked liabilities, 52.9 million was transferred from level 1 to level 2 and 224.0 million was transferred from level 2 to level 1.
The transfers from level 1 to level 2 relate primarily to a change in methodology whereby fixed income securities have been allocated to level 2 based on a reassessment of valuation information.
The transfers from level 2 to level 1 relate primarily to equities that have returned to daily-priced positions.

Trade and other payables Trade and other payables excluding deferred income represent amounts the Group is due to pay to third parties in the normal course of business.
These include expense accruals as well as settlement accounts amounts due to be paid for transactions undertaken.
Trade creditors are costs that have been billed: accruals represent costs, including remuneration, that are not yet billed or due for payment, but for which the goods or services have been received.
Trade and other payables held at fair value comprise deferred cash awards deferred employee remuneration payable in cash and bullion deposits by customers.
Deferred income represents fees received in advance of services being performed.
Trade and other payables are initially recorded at fair value, and subsequently at amortised cost or fair value see note 11, as shown below.
The fair value of bullion deposits by customers is derived from level 1 inputs see note 11.
Deferred cash awards derive their value from the fair value of units in funds to which the value of the employee award is linked fund awards.
The Groups trade and other payables contractually mature in the following time periods: 2013 2012 m m Less than 1 year 700.4 485.7 1 2 years 35.6 36.6 2 5 years 26.4 32.7 More than 5 years 1.7 4.3 63.7 73.6 764.1 559.3 Settlement accounts are generally settled within four working days and trade creditors have an average settlement period of 21 2012: 22 working days.
Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 117 Financial report Notes to the accounts 18.
Financial liabilities The Groups financial liabilities principally comprise deposits by Wealth Management clients and banking counterparties.
They also include derivatives held for client facilitation in Wealth Management see note 21, interest rate matching in Wealth Management, and the hedging of risk exposures within investment capital.
Client accounts other than those that are economically hedged for interest rate risk and deposits by banks are recorded at the value of the amount deposited: other financial liabilities together with economically hedged customer accounts are recorded at the fair value of the liability.
The fair value measurements section below reflects the level of judgement involved in determining fair value although this does not necessarily indicate that the fair value is more or less likely to equal the actual settlement cost.
Liabilities arise from time to time in respect of consolidated funds consolidation normally occurs when the Groups investment in a fund exceeds 50 per cent.
and frequently occurs in respect of seed capital investments.
When this happens, the Group accounts for the fund in its statement of financial position as if it were wholly-owned by the Group, but records an additional liability representing the fair value of the proportion of the fund owned by third-party investors.
Where the investment is held by the Life Company, the fair value of the proportion of the fund owned by third-party investors is shown as part of the unit-linked liabilities see note 16.
Financial liabilities are initially recorded at fair value, and subsequently at amortised cost or fair value see note 11, as shown below.

Maturity profiles of client accounts and deposits by banks and of derivative contracts can be found in notes 20 and 21 respectively.
Fair value measurements The Group holds financial liabilities that are measured at fair value subsequent to initial recognition.
Each instrument has been categorised within one of three levels using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
The Groups financial liabilities carried at fair value excluding those held in the Life Company see note 16 at the year-end date are analysed as follows: 2013 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m Non-current financial liabilities: Derivative contracts 5.2 5.2 Other financial liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss 9.7 3.3 13.0 14.9 3.3 18.2 Current financial liabilities: Derivative contracts 2.5 8.1 10.6 Other financial liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss 16.3 5.1 21.4 18.8 13.2 32.0 18.8 28.1 3.3 50.2 The financial liability recorded as level 3 relates to the contingent consideration payable in relation to STW see note 28.

Provisions and contingent liabilities Provisions are liabilities where there is uncertainty over the timing or amount of settlement and therefore usually require the use of estimates.
They are recognised when three conditions are fulfilled: when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, when it is probable that the Group will incur a loss in order to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
They are recorded at the Groups best estimate of the cost of settling the obligation.
Any differences between those estimates and the amounts for which the Group actually becomes liable are taken to the income statement as additional charges where the Group has underestimated and credits where the Group has overestimated.
Where the estimated timing and settlement is longer-term the amount is discounted using a rate reflecting specific risks associated with the provision.
Contingent liabilities are potential liabilities where there is even greater uncertainty, which could include a dependency on events not within the Groups control, but where there is a possible obligation.
Contingent liabilities are only disclosed and not included within the statement of financial position.

Legal and regulatory obligations associated with the Groups business arise from past events that are estimated to crystallise mainly within two years 2012: one year.
The Group has recorded a 15.0 million provision for a possible penalty payable in connection with the US Department of Justice DOJ programme announced on 29 August 2013 that applies industry wide to Swiss banks in order to identify accounts related to clients who may not have been US-tax compliant.
The Groups Swiss bank is participating voluntarily in the programme.
Where a Swiss bank is unable to provide fully sufficient evidence that a client is compliant, a penalty may be payable.
This programme is expected to complete in 2014 or 2015 and there is uncertainty as to the extent of any payment required by Schroders.
Details of the programme can be found at the DOJ website.
The Group has established a provision based on a review of relevant accounts which existed on or after 1 August 2008.
The provision relates principally to closed accounts.
There is uncertainty mainly in respect of the range of probabilities applied to relevant accounts which will only become certain following the conclusion of the DOJs analysis of the Swiss banks submission of its evidence.
As a result, the actual payment is expected to vary from the amount provided.
During the year, the Group has also recorded external insurance recoveries of 7.7 million 2012: 19.6 million, including an estimate of insurance cover that has not yet been settled, in respect of a provision booked in the prior year.
At 31 December 2013 0.4 million 2012: 19.6 million was recorded in trade and other receivables.
The insurance recovery is considered to be virtually certain.
Estimates and uncertainties The timing and amount of settlement of each legal claim or potential claim and constructive obligation is uncertain.
The Group has performed an assessment of the timing and amount and reviews this assessment periodically.
For certain provisions, including the provision for onerous leases, there is greater certainty as the cash flows have largely been determined.
However, the onerous lease provision also includes an assessment of potential cash inflows where these are not contractually binding from subletting arrangements.
Potential legal claims, regulatory related costs and other obligations to third parties arise as a consequence of normal business activity.
They can arise from actual or alleged breaches of obligations and may be covered by the Groups insurance arrangements, but subject to insurance excess.
In certain circumstances, legal and regulatory claims can arise notwithstanding there has been no error or breach.
Our risk management and compliance procedures are designed to mitigate, but are not able to eliminate, the risk of losses occurring.
Where such claims and costs arise there is often uncertainty over whether a payment will be required and the quantum and timing of that payment.
As a result there is also uncertainty over the timing and amount of any insurance recovery, although this does not change the likelihood of insurance cover being available, where applicable.
The Group makes periodic assessments of all cash flows, including taking external advice where appropriate, to determine an appropriate provision.
Some matters may be settled through commercial negotiation as well as being covered in whole or in part by the Groups insurance arrangement.
The Group has made provisions based on reasonable expectation of likely outflows.

Provisions and contingent liabilities continued b Contingent liabilities 2013 2012 m m Assets pledged as collateral security 33.3 38.6 Guarantees and irrevocable letters of credit 34.5 37.0 67.8 75.6 Transactions giving rise to contingent liabilities are in Wealth Management and are only entered into by the Group once it has received sufficient high-quality collateral from the client.
Assets pledged as collateral security reflect the value of instruments that the Group is required to hold with clearing agents in order to support the execution of the Groups security transactions.
The pledged shares provide collateral in the event of the Group not settling trades within agreed time frames.
Financial instrument risk management As a result of its operations, the Group is exposed to multiple forms of risk including: i the risk that money owed to the Group will not be received credit risk : ii the risk that the Group may not have sufficient cash available to pay its creditors as they fall due liquidity risk : and iii the risk that the value of assets will fluctuate as a result of movements in factors such as market prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates market risk.
The management of such risks is embedded in managerial responsibilities fundamental to the wellbeing of the Group.
This note sets out the nature of the risks and their quantification and management.
The Groups primary exposure to financial instrument risk is derived from the financial instruments that it holds as principal.
In addition, due to the nature of the business, the Groups exposure extends to the impact on investment management and other fees that are determined on the basis of a percentage of AUM and are therefore impacted by financial instrument risk exposure of our clients the secondary exposure.
This note deals with the primary exposure only.
Financial instruments give rise to market, liquidity and credit risk exposures.
Settlement of financial instruments on both a principal and agency basis gives rise to operational risk.
The execution and effectiveness of the Groups risk management process is, therefore, critical to its soundness and profitability and considerable resources are dedicated to this area.
Risk management is the direct responsibility of the Board and is then delegated to senior management.
The Audit and Risk Committee provide oversight and the Risk and Compliance functions are responsible for monitoring the overall risk environment.
The Group has established a control environment that ensures risks are reviewed regularly and that all risk controls operating throughout the Group are in accordance with regulatory requirements.
In addition, an independent assessment of the control environment is provided by Internal Audit.
The financial risks of these products are largely borne by the third-party investors, consistent with other investment products managed by the Group.
However, since the Life Company provides the investment products, both the investments and the third-party obligations are recorded in the statement of financial position.
Financial instrument risk management in respect of the Life Company is set out in note 16.

The Group holds surplus capital over the regulatory requirements which is managed by Group Treasury and in-house fund managers.
Regulators oversee the activities and impose minimum capital requirements on the Groups operating subsidiaries.
The Groups policy is for subsidiaries to have sufficient capital to meet regulatory requirements, keep an appropriate standing with counterparties and meet working capital requirements.
The Group Capital Committee reviews compliance with this policy.
Schroders plc is regulated by the PRA as a UK consolidated group.
Its last submitted capital resources, using the calculation of capital resources required for a Group holding a banking licence, amounted to 1,673 million 2012: 1,547 million and Pillar 1 minimum capital requirements of 342 million 2012: 316 million.
The Group holds sufficient capital to meet its regulatory capital requirements.
All regulated entities within the Group complied with all regulatory capital requirements during the year.
ii Investment capital Investment capital is shareholders investible equity held in excess of operational requirements.
It is managed with the aim of achieving a low-volatility cash plus 1.5 per cent.
It is mainly held in cash deposits, certificates of deposits, commercial paper,  bonds, Schroders funds and seed capital.
Investment capital is used to seed new investment strategies, co-invest selectively alongside our clients and finance organic and inorganic growth opportunities.
Seed capital is deployed principally to support the growth of Asset Management and where practical the market risk on its seed capital investments is hedged.
Surplus capital is deployed in accordance with limits approved by the Board.
Investment capital is also held to support the organic development of existing and new business strategies and to respond to other investment and growth opportunities as they arise, such as acquisitions that will accelerate the development of the business.

Financial instrument risk management continued b Credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk the main components of which are pricing, interest rate and foreign exchange risks i Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument, loan or commitment will cause the Group financial loss by failing to discharge an obligation.
For this purpose, the impact on fair value of a credit loss arising from credit spread price changes in a portfolio of investments is excluded.
This risk is addressed within Pricing risk.
The Group has exposure to credit risk from its normal activities where the risk is that a counterparty will be unable to pay, in full, amounts when due.
The Group carefully manages its exposure to credit risk by: approving lending policies that specify the type of acceptable collateral and minimum lending margins: setting limits for individuals exposures and sectors: and by taking security.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of its financial assets.
In addition the Group holds collateral on its loans and advances to clients and certain derivative positions.
Wealth Management activities All individual facility requests are presented to the relevant Wealth Management credit committees and counterparty exposures against limits are monitored daily.
Loans and advances to clients are secured on a range of assets including property both residential and commercial, cash, client portfolios and insurance policies.
There is a policy not to advance client facilities on an unsecured basis.
Where disposal of non-cash collateral is required, in the event of default, the terms and conditions relevant to the specific contract and country will apply.
Portfolios held as collateral are marked to market daily and positions compared to clients loans.
Limits are set for the reduction in market value of each type of collateral, depending on the perceived risk associated with the collateral.
Clients are contacted if these limits are breached so that action can be taken before the outstanding loan balances exceed the fair value of the collateral.
Provisions of 13.0 million 2012: 16.2 million are held against gross loan and receivables that are recorded at amortised cost.
The amount of change in the year in the fair value of loans and receivables held at fair value through profit or loss that is attributable to changes in credit risk is a loss of 0.1 million 2012: 5.6 million and 5.7 million 2012: 5.6 million cumulatively.
This is due to a shortfall in the value of the collateral held against the loans and receivables.
Wealth Management takes a conservative approach to its treasury investments placing them with, or purchasing debt securities issued by, UK and overseas banks, central banks, supranational banks and sovereigns.
Debt securities held within the Wealth Management treasury book are classified as loans and receivables or as held to maturity financial assets and are unsecured.
Policies covering various counterparty and market risk limits are set by the relevant Wealth Management asset and liability management and credit committees and monitored daily.
All instruments held within Wealth Management are rated Aor better investment grade.
Other activities Fee debtors and other receivables arise as a result of the Groups Asset Management activities and amounts are monitored regularly.
Historically, default levels have been insignificant and unless a client has withdrawn its funds, there is an ongoing relationship between the Group and the client.
124 Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial report 20.
Financial instrument risk management continued Fee debtors past due but not yet impaired as at 31 December 2013 were 10.0 million 2012: 12.6 million, the majority of which is less than 60 days past due.
Factors considered in determining whether impairment has taken place include how many days past the due date a receivable is, deterioration in the credit quality of a counterparty, and knowledge of specific events that could influence a debtors ability to pay.
The Group seeks to minimise its exposure to credit risk arising from debt securities and derivatives within the investment portfolio by adopting a conservative approach.
Within the cash and government bond portfolios, deposits are placed with well-rated banks that have been approved and which are continuously monitored by Group Risk.
Derivative positions are taken in exchange-traded securities where there is minimal credit risk.
Forward foreign exchange positions generally have a maturity of one month.
The Groups cash and cash equivalents in the non-Wealth Management entities are invested primarily in current accounts and on deposit with well-rated UK and overseas banks.
ii Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group cannot meet its obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a cost.
Wealth Management activities The principal liquidity risk the Group faces concerns its Wealth Management liabilities.
The liquidity policy is to maintain sufficient liquidity to cover any cash flow funding, meet all obligations as they fall due and maintain solvency in the Groups Wealth Management businesses.
2 Includes customer accounts held at fair value through profit or loss of 14.9 million 2012: 29.8 million.
Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 125 Financial report Notes to the accounts 20.
Financial instrument risk management continued Other activities Liquidity risk in the rest of the Group is low.
Excluding the Life Company, the Asset Management and Group segment together hold cash of 697.6 million 2012: 797.5 million.
The Groups policy is that its subsidiaries should trade solvently and have adequate liquidity for all activities undertaken in the normal course of business.
In particular, all companies should maintain sufficient liquid funds to meet peak working capital requirements.
Financial liabilities relating to other operating entities are 36.0 million 2012: 18.6 million, all of which are current.
The Group has a committed loan facility of 50.0 million 2012: 250.0 million that expires on 30 September 2018 and 8.4 million of loan notes as part of the acquisition of Cazenove Capital that are repayable on 12 July 2018 and subject to early redemption rights.
iii Market risk The sensitivities to market risk are estimated as follows: 31 December 2013 31 December 2012 A reasonable Increase A reasonable Increase change in the decrease change in the decrease variable within Increase in other variable within Increase in other the next decrease in components the next decrease in components calendar year post-tax profit of equity calendar year post-tax profit of equity 1 Variable % m m % m m 2 Interest ratesincrease 0.5 4 0.5 4 -decrease US dollar against sterlingstrengthen 8 2 17 8 3 18 -weaken 6 1 11 6 2 12 Euro against sterlingstrengthen 5 5 7 5 5 6 -weaken 6 5 7 8 7 8 3 FTSE All Share Indexincrease 20 5 20 6 -decrease 20 1 5 20 6 1 The underlying assumption is that there is one variable increase decrease with all other variables held constant.
2 Assumes that the fair value of assets and liabilities will not be affected by a change in interest rates.
3 Assumes that changes in the FTSE All Share Index correlate to changes in the fair value of the Groups equity funds.
Pricing risk Pricing risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk.
In respect of financial instrument risk, the Groups exposure to pricing risk is principally through investments held in investment capital as well as some investments held for regulatory capital.
However, the more significant risk is the impact on the Groups fee income as this is principally determined on percentages of the fair value of AUM.
This risk cannot be easily mitigated but is addressed to some extent by ongoing net new business.
The Group does not hedge exposure to price risk except in respect of seed capital and employee compensation awards in the form of fund awards when it is considered that the amount of risk is material and an effective hedge is available.
The changes used in the sensitivity analysis were provided by the Groups economist team using reasonable assumptions.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
Wealth Management activities In Wealth Management, interest rate risk is monitored against policies and limits set by the relevant risk committee on a daily basis.
Wealth Managements treasury policy is to manage its interest rate risk by matching funded asset positions and the use of interest rate swaps.
Within Wealth Management, there are sensitivity-based and stress-based models used for monitoring interest rate risk.
These involve assessing the impact on the Groups net worth against a prescribed basis point rise in interest rates with extreme scenarios for the stress tests.
The impact is calculated regularly for each currency and in aggregate.
126 Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial report 20.
Financial instrument risk management continued Other activities Cash held by the other operating companies is not normally expected to be placed on deposit for longer than three months.
The Groups capital includes investments in government bonds managed by the Groups Fixed Income fund managers.
These investments are concentrated in UK issues.
Government bonds issued by selected AA rated countries can also be held.
The fund managers may reduce the average duration with the use of future contracts at their discretion.
Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
Wealth Management activities In Wealth Management, some loans and advances to clients, as well as a proportion of the treasury activities, are undertaken in foreign currencies: however, this is managed on a daily basis to reduce currency exposures to low levels.
Limits regarding the amount of foreign currency risk are set by the relevant risk committee and monitored daily.
Other activities The Groups policy in relation to revenue, expenditure and capital currency exposure in Asset Management activities is generally not to hedge.
The Groups revenue is earned and expenditure incurred in many currencies and the resulting exposure is considered part of the business.
The Group also has exposure to foreign currency through investments in currencies other than sterling.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts with third parties to mitigate this exposure.
The gain or loss on the hedging instruments is included in the statement of other comprehensive income or the income statement as appropriate.
The use of such instruments is subject to the approval of the Group Capital Committee.
The Groups gross and net exposure to foreign currencies is set out below: 2013 2012 Gross exposure Hedged Net exposure Gross exposure Hedged Net exposure m m m m m m US dollar 305 107 198 331 122 209 Euro 204 74 130 158 59 99 Swiss franc 137 137 141 141 Australian dollar 27 27 37 37 Hong Kong dollar 39 39 41 41 Japanese yen 14 14 30 5 25 Other 135 20 115 147 13 134 Total currency exposures 861 201 660 885 199 686 Sterling 1,408 201 1,609 1,185 199 1,384 2,269 2,269 2,070 2,070 Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 127 Financial report Notes to the accounts 21.
Derivative contracts a The Groups use of derivatives The Group holds derivatives for risk management to assist its Wealth Management clients who wish to buy or sell derivative instruments client facilitation and, to a limited extent, within its investment portfolios to provide exposure to market returns.
The Group most commonly uses forward foreign exchange contracts where it agrees to buy or sell specified amounts of a named currency at a future date, allowing the Group effectively to fix exchange rates so that it can avoid unpredictable gains and losses on receivables and payables in foreign currencies.
The Group uses equity contracts to hedge market-related gains and losses on its seed capital investments where the purpose of investing is to establish a new product rather than gain additional market exposure.
Equity contracts are also used as a hedge against liabilities relating to remuneration that is deferred and settled in the form of fund awards.
Interest rate contracts are used to hedge exposures to fixed or floating rates of interest.
Risk management: the Group actively seeks to limit and manage its exposures to risk where that exposure is not desired by the Group.
This may take the form of unwanted exposures to a particular currency, type of interest rate or other price risk.
By entering into derivative contracts, the Group is able to mitigate or eliminate such exposures.
The principal financial instrument risk the Group faces through such use of derivative contracts is credit risk.
Client facilitation: The Groups Wealth Management entities are involved in providing portfolio management, banking and investment advisory services, primarily to private clients.
In carrying out this business they transact as agent and as principal in financial assets and liabilities in order to meet client facilitation requirements.
Wealth Managements policy is to hedge, as appropriate, exchange rate and interest rate risk on its client facilitation positions.
This hedging of equal and opposite risks seeks to mitigate market risk, but does not eliminate the possibility of credit risk.
For details of how the Group manages its exposure to credit risk, see b below and note 20. b The derivatives used by the Group Currency forwards represent commitments to sell or purchase foreign and domestic currency.
Currency forwards are contractual obligations to receive or pay amounts based on changes in currency rates or to buy or sell foreign currency or a financial instrument on a future date at a specified price.
For currency forward contracts, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the fair value of the contracts.
Currency and interest rate swaps are commitments to exchange one set of cash flows for another.
Swaps result in an economic exchange of currencies or interest rates for example, fixed rate for floating rate or a combination of all these i. e. cross-currency interest rate swaps.
No exchange of principal takes place, except for certain currency swaps.
The Groups credit risk represents the potential cost of replacing the swap contracts if counterparties fail to perform their obligations.
This risk is monitored on an ongoing basis with reference to the current fair value, a proportion of the notional amount of the contracts and the liquidity of the market.
To control the level of credit risk taken, the Group assesses counterparties in accordance with its internal policies and procedures.
Foreign exchange, equity and interest rate options are contractual agreements under which the seller grants the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, either to buy a call option or sell a put option at or by a set date or during a set period, a specific amount of a foreign currency or a financial instrument at a predetermined price.
The seller receives a premium from the purchaser and assumes foreign exchange, equity or interest rate risk.
Options may be either exchange-traded or negotiated between the Group and a customer or market counterparty.
The Group is exposed to credit risk on purchased options only, and only to the extent of their carrying amount, which is their fair value.
Futures contracts are standardised contracts to buy or sell specified items for an agreed price at a specified future date.
Contracts are negotiated at a futures exchange which acts as an intermediary between the two parties.
For futures contracts, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the fair value of the contracts.
128 Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial report 21.
Derivative contracts continued The fair value of derivative instruments becomes favourable assets or unfavourable liabilities as a result of fluctuations in market interest rates, indices, foreign exchange rates and other relevant variables relative to their terms.
The aggregate contractual amount of derivative financial instruments held, the extent to which instruments are favourable or unfavourable, and thus the aggregate fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities, can fluctuate significantly from time to time.
The fair values are set out below: 2013 2012 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Interest rate contracts 1.5 3.6 1.9 5.1 Forward foreign exchange contracts 9.0 6.0 13.8 9.7 Equity contracts 10.3 6.2 14.3 11.9 20.8 15.8 30.0 26.7 2013 2012 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m 1 2 Net-settled derivative contracts maturing repricing in: Less than 1 year 8.6 4.6 11.3 9.0 1 3 years 2.1 4.8 3.3 6.7 3 5 years 0.7 0.2 1.2 More than 5 years 0.4 0.4 1.4 0.1 11.8 9.8 16.2 17.0 3 2 Gross-settled derivatives maturing repricing in: Less than 1 year: Gross inflows 545.9 434.6 752.7 605.7 Gross outflows 541.1 435.3 745.0 606.9 Difference between future contractual cash flows and fair value 4.2 5.3 6.1 8.5 9.0 6.0 13.8 9.7 20.8 15.8 30.0 26.7 1 Comprise interest rate and equity contracts.
Share capital and share premium Share capital represents the number of issued ordinary and non-voting ordinary shares in Schroders plc multiplied by their par value of 1 each.
Share premium substantially represents the aggregate of all amounts that have ever been paid above par value to Schroders plc when it has issued ordinary and non-voting ordinary shares.
There are certain circumstances in which the share premium can be reduced but these have not arisen in 2013 or 2012.
The Company has no authority to issue or cancel ordinary shares in issue including those held in trust and has authority limited by shareholder resolution to issue and purchase non-voting ordinary shares, which may either be cancelled or held in treasury.

A further 0.1 million non-voting ordinary shares were issued to satisfy share option exercises.
By the year end, 1.6 million non-voting ordinary shares that had principally been bought back in the year were cancelled.
The difference between the share classes The non-voting ordinary shares carry the same rights as ordinary shares except they do not confer the right to attend and vote at any general meeting of the Company, and that on a capitalisation issue they carry the right to receive non-voting ordinary shares rather than ordinary shares.
Own shares Own shares are recorded by the Group when the Group itself owns shares in Schroders plc either directly or through employee benefit trusts.
There are two main reasons why this may happen: first, it enables the Group to meet share-based remuneration awards to employees in the form of shares see note 27 in a way that does not dilute the percentage holdings of existing shareholders.
Second, the Group may wish to hold some of its shares in treasury to settle option exercises or for other permitted purposes.
Own shares are held at cost and their purchase reduces the Groups net assets by the amount spent.
When shares vest unconditionally or are cancelled, they are transferred from own shares to the profit and loss reserve at their weighted average cost.
Movements during the year were as follows: 2013 2012 m m At 1 January 165.1 172.5 Own shares acquired 142.3 41.7 Cancellations of own shares held in treasury 30.8 5.6 Awards vested 46.7 43.5 At 31 December 229.9 165.1 The Group purchased its own shares during the year in order to hedge share-based awards made and also to buy back shares for cancellation to counteract the effect of having issued 1.7 million shares in July 2013 in respect of the Cazenove Capital acquisition see note 22.
Shares purchased as a result of the July 2013 issue see note 22 and those previously held in treasury and not required to hedge employee share options, were cancelled during the year.

Commitments Commitments represent amounts the Group has contractually committed to pay to third parties but which do not yet represent a charge or asset.
This gives an indication of committed future cash flows.
Commitments at the year end do not impact on the Groups financial results for the year.
The Group leases office space and equipment.
Lease agreements can commit the Group to significant future expenditure and the table below discloses the Groups commitments to make such payments.
Such commitments are not recorded on the Groups statement of financial position in advance of the period to which they relate.
The Group sublets a small number of its leased properties where such properties, or parts of such properties, are no longer required for use by the Group.
The table below discloses the commitments sublessees have made in respect of such arrangements.
These commitments are not recorded on the statement of financial position in advance of the period to which they relate.
However, they may be used to determine the onerous lease provision if the rental income does not equal or exceed the Groups own rental obligation see note 19.

Retirement benefit obligations The Group has two types of pension benefit for employees: defined benefit DB where the Group has an obligation to provide participating employees with pension payments that represent a specified percentage of their final salary for each year of service, and defined contribution DC, where the Groups contribution to an employees pension is measured as, and limited to, a specified percentage of salary.
Accounting for DB schemes requires an assessment of the likely quantum of future pension payments to be made.
If ring-fenced assets are held specifically to meet this cost, the scheme is funded, and if not, it is unfunded.
The Group periodically reviews its funded DB schemes using actuarial specialists to assess whether it is on course to meet the expected pension payments that current and former employees are or will be entitled to.
In the case of a projected shortfall, a plan must be formulated to reverse the deficit.
The income statement charge or credit represents the sum of pension entitlements earned by employees in the period, plus a notional net interest charge if the scheme is in deficit or income if it is in surplus based on the market yields on high-quality corporate bonds.
Experience differences, principally the difference between actual investment returns and the notional interest amount, as well as actuarial changes in estimating the present value of future liabilities, are recorded in other comprehensive income.
Assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position represent the differences between the fair value of plan assets if any and the  estimates of the present value of future liabilities.
The Group closed its largest DB scheme to future accrual on 30 April 2011, although it still operates some small unfunded schemes overseas.
This means that no future service will contribute to the closed scheme member benefits but those members continue to have the benefits determined by the Scheme rules as at 30 April 2011.
The Groups exposure to funding DC pension schemes is limited to the contributions it has agreed to make.
These contributions generally stop when employment ceases.
The income statement charge represents the contributions the Group has agreed to make into employees pension schemes in that period.
The disclosures within this note are provided mainly in respect of the principal DB scheme in the UK which is the DB section of the funded Schroders Retirement Benefits Scheme the Scheme.
Certain disclosures are also provided in respect of the Cazenove Capital Management Limited Pension Scheme the Cazenove Capital Scheme, a funded defined benefit scheme that is closed to future accrual and which provides post-employment benefits to certain current and former employees of Cazenove Capital, and the DC section of the Schroders Retirement Benefits Scheme the DC section.
The income statement charge for retirement benefit costs is as follows: 2013 2012 m m Pension costs defined contribution plans 30.0 27.2 Pension credit charge defined benefit plans 1.8 0.3 Other post-employment benefits 0.1 28.2 27.6 i Profile of the Scheme The Scheme is administered by a Trustee company, Schroder Pension Trustee Limited.
The board of the Trustee company comprises an independent chairman, three directors appointed by the employer and two directors elected by the Scheme members.
The Trustee is required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the benefits.
The Trustees investment committee comprises four of the Trustee directors, an independent member and two representatives of the Group.
This committee, which reports to the Trustee board, is responsible for setting the investment strategy and monitoring the performance of the investment manager.
Under the Scheme, employees are entitled to annual pensions on retirement based on a specified percentage of their final pensionable salary or, in the case of active members at 30 April 2011, actual pensionable salaries at that date, for each year of service.
These benefits are adjusted for the effects of inflation, subject to a cap of 2.5 per cent.
for pensions accrued after 12 August 2007 and 5.0 per cent.
for pensions accrued before that date.
At 31 December 2012 and 2013, there were no active members in the DB section and 1,598 active members in the DC section 2012: 1,182.
The weighted average duration of the Schemes defined benefit obligation is 21 years 2012: 22 years.

Retirement benefit obligations continued Membership details of the DB section of the Scheme as at 31 December are as follows: 2013 2012 Number of deferred members 1,622 1,668 Total deferred pensions at date of leaving Scheme 14.4m per annum 14.8m per annum Average age deferred 49 49 Number of pensioners 727 703 Average age pensioners 68 68 Total pensions in payment 16.4m per annum 15.7m per annum ii Funding requirements The last completed triennial valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2011.
It disclosed that the market value of the assets of the Scheme represented 101 per cent.
of the liabilities at that date, calculated on the funding basis applicable to the Scheme, for the benefits that had accrued to members at that date.
No additional funding was required.
No contributions were made to the Scheme in the year 2012: nil and the Group does not expect to make any contributions in 2014. iii Risks of the Scheme The Company and the Trustee have agreed a long-term strategy for reducing investment risk as and when appropriate.
This includes, as detailed below, an asset-liability matching policy which aims to reduce the volatility of the funding level of the Scheme by investing in assets such as swaps which perform in line with the liabilities of the Scheme so as to protect against inflation and or interest rates being higher than expected.
The most significant risks that the Scheme exposes the Company to are: Asset volatility The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
The Group manages this risk by holding 37.5 per cent.
of Scheme assets in a liability-driven investment LDI portfolio and the remainder in growth assets such as the Schroder Life Diversified Growth Fund and a Strategic Beta portfolio.
This asset mix is designed to provide returns that match or exceed the unwinding of the discount rate in the long term, but which can create volatility and risk in the short term.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Schemes long-term objectives.
Credit risk The assets of the Scheme include LDI and other fixed income instruments that expose the Group to credit risk.
A significant amount of this exposure is to the UK Government as a result of holding gilts and bonds guaranteed by the UK Government.
Other instruments held include derivatives, which are collaterised daily to cover unrealised gains or losses.
The minimum rating for any derivatives counterparty is A Standard & Poors.
Interest rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the Schemes liabilities for accounting purposes, although this should be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Schemes LDI portfolio which comprises gilts and other LDI instruments.
The LDI portfolio has been designed to mitigate interest rate exposures measured on a funding rather than an accounting basis.
One of the principal differences between these bases is that the liability under the funding basis is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to gilt yields: the latter uses corporate bond yields.
As a result, the LDI portfolio hedges against interest rate risk by purchasing instruments that seek to replicate movements in gilt yields rather than corporate bond yields.
Movements in the different types of instrument are not exactly correlated, and it is therefore likely that a tracking error can arise when assessing whether the LDI portfolio has provided an effective hedge against interest rate risk on an accounting basis.
At 31 December 2013, the LDI portfolio was designed to mitigate 70 per cent.
of the Schemes exposure to changes in gilt yields.
Inflation risk A significant proportion of the Schemes benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against inflation.
The majority of the growth assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also decrease any Scheme surplus.
The LDI portfolio includes instruments such as index-linked gilts to provide protection against inflation risk.
of the Schemes exposure to inflation risk.
Life expectancy The majority of the Schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liability.

Retirement benefit obligations continued iv Reporting at 31 December 2013 The principal financial assumptions used for the Scheme were as listed below.
These assumptions were not materially different from those used for the valuation of the Cazenove Capital Scheme.
2013 2012 % % Discount rate 4.5 4.6 RPI inflation rate 3.7 3.3 CPI inflation rate 2.7 2.7 Future pension increases for benefits earned before 13 August 2007 3.5 3.2 Future pension increases for benefits earned after 13 August 2007 2.3 2.2 Average number of years a current pensioner is expected to live beyond age 60: Men 29 29 Women 31 31 Average number of years future pensioners currently aged 45 are expected to live beyond age 60: Men 31 31 Women 33 33 The net interest for pension costs is determined by applying the corporate bond rate to the opening net surplus or deficit in the Scheme.
The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year.
This is the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension obligations.
In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the interest rates of high-quality, long-dated corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid.
Estimates and judgements Assumptions made on expected mortality rates are inherently uncertain.
The Groups mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables with Continuous Mortality Investigation core projection factors and a long-term rate of mortality improvement of 1.5 per cent.
Mortality tables for female pensioners are scaled back by 5 per cent.
to reflect the history of longer life expectancy of the Groups employees.
The Group reviews its assumptions annually in conjunction with its independent actuaries and considers this adjustment appropriate given the geographic and demographic profile of Scheme members.
Other assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market conditions.
The financial impact of the Scheme on the Group has been determined by independent qualified actuaries, Aon Hewitt Limited, and is based on an assessment of the Scheme as at 31 December 2013.

It is intended that this restructuring will enable the Scheme to benefit from the economies of scale, broader range of strategies and better liquidity that the unitised vehicle can offer, and the strategy aims at an overall reduction in funding level volatility without a significant decrease in expected returns.
Share-based payments Share-based payments are remuneration payments to selected employees that take the form of an award of shares in Schroders plc.
Such awards constituted 9.9 per cent.
of salaries and other remuneration.
Employees are generally not able to exercise such awards until three years after the award has been made, although conditions vary between different types of award.
Accounting for share-based awards differs from accounting for similar awards settled in cash.
The charge for equity-settled share-based payments is determined based on the fair value of the award on the grant date or, in the case of grandfathered awards arising on business combinations, the fair value of the share awards at the acquisition date.
Such awards can include share options or share awards which may or may not have performance criteria.
The initial fair value of the award takes into account the current value of shares expected to be issued i. e. estimates of the likely levels of forfeiture and achievement of performance criteria, the contribution, if required, by the employee and the time value of money.
This fair value is charged to the income statement reflecting benefits received from employment, where relevant, in the performance period and over the vesting period.
The income statement charge is offset by a credit to the statement of changes in equity, where the award is expected to be settled through the issue of shares.
The Group may make share-based payments to employees through awards over or linked to the value of ordinary and non-voting ordinary shares and by the grant of market value share options over ordinary or non-voting ordinary shares.
It is our practice to hedge all equity-settled awards to eliminate the impact of changes in the market value of shares.
Awards that lapse or are forfeited result in a credit to the income statement reversing the previous charge in the year in which they lapse or are forfeited.
The Group recognised total expenses of 59.8 million 2012: 47.0 million arising from share-based payment transactions during the year of which 56.6 million 2012: 45.3 million were equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
Included within equity-settled share-based payments were exceptional items of 7.5 million.
The Group has the following share-based payment arrangements further details of the current schemes may be found in the Remuneration report.

Share-based payments continued a 2000 Equity Compensation Plan and 2011 Equity Compensation Plan Awards over ordinary and non-voting ordinary shares made under the Groups Equity Compensation Plans are charged at fair value as Operating expenses in the income statement.
For the 2000 Equity Compensation Plan the fair value of an award is calculated using the market value of the shares on the date of grant, discounted for the dividends forgone over the average holding period of the award.
For the 2011 Equity Compensation Plan the fair value of an award is calculated using the market value of the shares on the date of grant.
The fair value charges, adjusted to reflect actual levels of vesting, are spread over the performance period and the vesting period of the awards.
The award is structured as a nil cost option.

Acquisitions Cazenove Capital Holdings Limited On 2 July 2013, the Group acquired 100 per cent.
of the issued share capital of Cazenove Capital Holdings Limited, a Jerseyregistered holding company of an asset and wealth management group Cazenove Capital, for 385.2 million.
The recommended acquisition was announced on 25 March 2013 and was completed by means of a scheme of arrangement under article 125 of the Companies Jersey Law 1991.
The acquisition added complementary asset classes in UK and European equities, fixed income and multi-manager.
It also materially expanded the Groups scale and capabilities for private clients and charities in the UK.
The acquisition contributed 6.9 billion of Asset Management and 13.2 billion of Wealth Management AUM.
STW Fixed Income Management LLC STW On 2 April 2013, the Group acquired 100 per cent.
of the net assets of STW, a fixed income fund manager based in the US, for consideration of 34.7 million.
The acquisition contributed 7.1 billion of Asset Management AUM and broadened the Groups product and service platform in fixed income and extended our institutional client base in the US.
Net assets acquired The fair values of the net assets acquired in the transaction, together with the goodwill and intangible assets arising, are as follows: Cazenove Capital STW Total m m m Net assets acquired: Non-current financial assets 10.3 0.1 10.4 Cash 95.4 0.3 95.7 Trade and other receivables 119.4 3.6 123.0 Other assets 5.3 5.3 Trade and other payables 145.2 0.8 146.0 Other liabilities 1.9 1.9 83.3 3.2 86.5 Goodwill 222.3 19.8 242.1 Intangible assets 100.8 11.7 112.5 Deferred tax arising on intangible assets 21.2 21.2 385.2 34.7 419.9 Satisfied by: Cash 129.1 31.1 160.2 1 Loan notes issued 217.1 217.1 Pre-acquisition share of share-based payment obligations 39.0 39.0 2 Contingent consideration liability 3.6 3.6 Total consideration 385.2 34.7 419.9 1 Following the completion of the Unit Trust rollover set out in the Cazenove Capital recommended offer, 208.7 million of the loan notes issued were redeemed for cash.

Payment of this amount is contingent upon certain levels of revenue in the two years after the acquisition date.
The amount accrued is the maximum payable under the purchase agreement.
An estimate of the range of outcomes is that a payment of between nil and 3.6 million will be payable in 2015.
Cazenove Capital The goodwill recognised on the Cazenove Capital acquisition represents the value of the acquired business arising from: Talented management and employees: Opportunities for synergies from combining operations and Asset Management distribution: and A broader platform for business growth.
Intangible assets recognised on the Cazenove Capital acquisition include the value of contractual customer relationships that existed at the acquisition date and the use of the Cazenove name.
In the period between the date of acquisition on 2 July 2013 and 31 December 2013, Cazenove Capital generated net revenue of 99.6 million.
The contribution to profit before tax and exceptional items was 58.1 million and exceptional costs of 28.8 million were incurred, including charges in respect of amortisation of acquired intangible assets, integration costs and the Restricted and Growth Share Plan see note 27 e. In addition, acquisition costs of 3.9 million were recorded within Operating expenses and classified as exceptional items in the income statement.

Acquisitions continued If the acquisition had been completed on 1 January 2013, the Groups net revenue for the period combined with that of the acquiree would have been 1,469.6 million, and the profit before tax and exceptional items for the period on the same basis would have been 521.0 million profit before tax and after exceptional items: 446.3 million.
The post-exceptional figures include deductions for the additional amortisation charges and legacy share-based payments that would have arisen had the acquisition taken place at that date.
STW The goodwill arising on the STW acquisition is attributable to the anticipated profitability of the business acquired and synergies arising from merging the business with the Group.
The intangible asset represents the value attributed to existing contractual arrangements between STW and its clients.
The full amount of goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes over a period of fifteen years.
In the period between the date of acquisition 2 April 2013 and 31 December 2013, STW generated net revenue of 10.1 million.
The contribution to profit before tax and exceptional items was a loss of 0.1 million and exceptional costs of 5.6 million were incurred, including charges in respect of amortisation of acquired intangible assets, integration costs and deferred cash compensation awards.
Costs of acquisition in 2013, recorded within Operating expenses and classified as exceptional items in the income statement, were 0.3 million.
A further 1.5 million of acquisition costs were incurred in 2012.
If the acquisition had been completed on 1 January 2013, an aggregation of the Groups net revenue for the period and those of the acquiree would have been 1,411.4 million, and the profit before tax and exceptional items for the period on the same basis would have been 508.8 million profit before tax and after exceptional items: 448.2 million.
Estimates and judgements The Group has determined the fair value of the intangible assets acquired as part of its acquisitions based on estimated profits, taking account of synergies, derived from contractual relationships that existed at the acquisition date.
This assessment involves judgements and assumptions relating to potential future revenues, appropriate discount rates and the expected duration of client relationships.
The difference between the fair value of the consideration and the value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, including intangible assets, has been accounted for as goodwill.
Events after the reporting period No events requiring disclosure under IAS 10 occurred after the year-end reporting date.

Financial instrument risk management The Companys policy is to have adequate capital for all activities undertaken in the normal course of business.
In particular, it should have adequate capital to maintain sufficient liquid funds to meet peak working capital requirements.
Generally, surplus capital is loaned back to the Groups investment capital management entities.
The risk management processes of the Company are aligned with those of the Group as a whole.
Details of the Groups risk management processes are outlined in the Key risks and mitigations section within the Strategic report and the Risk management and internal controls section within the Governance report of this document as well as in note 20.
The Companys specific risk exposures are explained below.
Credit risk The Company has exposure to credit risk from its normal activities where the risk is that a counterparty will be unable to pay in full amounts when due.
The Companys counterparties are predominantly its subsidiaries and therefore there is minimal external credit risk exposure.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company cannot meet its obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a cost.
The Groups liquidity policy is to maintain sufficient liquidity to cover any cash flow funding, meet all obligations as they fall due and maintain solvency.
The Company holds sufficient liquid funds to cover its normal course of business.
The Company can request to borrow through intragroup loans and the Group loan facility see below to maintain sufficient liquidity.
In 2013, the Group entered into a committed loan facility of 50.0 million which replaced the former facility of 250.0 million that expired on 23 September 2013.
The new facility expires on 30 September 2018.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
At 31 December 2013, if interest rates had been 50 basis points higher 2012: 50 basis points higher with all other variables held constant, the Company estimates that post-tax profit for the year would have increased by 3 million 2012: increased by 3 million respectively, mainly as a result of higher net interest income on the Companys interest-bearing intercompany receivables and payables and cash: other components of equity would have been unaffected.
The model used to calculate the effect on post-tax profits assumes that the fair value of assets and liabilities will not be affected by a change in interest rates.
Foreign exchange and pricing risk Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
Pricing risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
The Company is not directly exposed to foreign exchange or pricing risk.
The Companys investments in its directly held subsidiaries are in sterling and are held at historic cost.
It has indirect exposure to foreign exchange and pricing risk in the Group which could result in the impairment of these subsidiaries.
There are currently sufficient resources in subsidiaries to absorb any normal market events.
