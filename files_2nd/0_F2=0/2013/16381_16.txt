PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS For defined benefit plans, operating and finance costs are recognised separately in the income statement.
The amount charged to operating cost in the income statement is the cost of accruing pension benefits promised to employees over the year, plus the costs of individual events such as past service benefit changes, settlements and curtailments such events are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The amount charged or credited to finance costs is a net interest expense calculated by applying the liability discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
Any differences between the interest on assets and the return actually achieved, and any changes in the liabilities over the year due to changes in assumptions or experience within the plans, are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
The defined benefit plan surplus or deficit on the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit liabilities using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds, or a suitable alternative where there is no active corporate bond market.
All defined benefit plans are subject to regular actuarial review using the projected unit method, either by external consultants or by actuaries employed by Unilever.
The Group policy is that the most important plans, representing approximately 83% of the defined benefit liabilities, are formally valued every year.
Other major plans, accounting for a further 14% of the liabilities, have their liabilities updated each year.
Group policy for the remaining plans requires a full actuarial valuation at least every three years.
Asset values for all plans are updated every year.
For defined contribution plans, the charges to the income statement are the company contributions payable, as the companys obligation is limited to the contributions paid into the plans.
The assets and liabilities of such plans are not included in the balance sheet of the Group.
Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial statements 99 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNILEVER GROUP CONTINUED 4B.
PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED DESCRIPTION OF PLANS In many countries the Group operates defined benefit pension plans based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
The majority of plans are either final salary, career average or hybrid plans and are externally funded.
Benefits are determined by the plan rules and are linked to inflation in some countries.
The Group also provides other post-employment benefits, mainly post-employment healthcare plans in the United States.
These plans are predominantly unfunded.
The Group increasingly also operates a number of defined contribution plans, the assets of which are held in external funds.
GOVERNANCE The majority of the Groups externally funded plans are established as trusts, foundations or similar entities.
The operation of these entities is governed by local regulations and practice in each country, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the Trustees or equivalent and their composition.
Where Trustees or equivalent are in place to operate plans, they are generally required to act on behalf of the plans stakeholders.
They are tasked with periodic reviews of the solvency of the fund in accordance with local legislation and play a role in the long-term investment and funding strategy.
The Group also has an internal body, the Pensions and Equity Committee, that is responsible for setting the companys policies and decision making on plan matters, including but not limited to design, funding, investments, risk management and governance.
INVESTMENT STRATEGY The Groups investment strategy in respect of its funded plans is implemented within the framework of the various statutory requirements of the territories where the plans are based.
The Group has developed policy guidelines for the allocation of assets to different classes with the objective of controlling risk and maintaining the right balance between risk and long-term returns in order to limit the cost to the Group of the benefits provided.
To achieve this, investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
The plans continue to invest a good proportion of the assets in equities, which the Group believes offer the best returns over the long term commensurate with an acceptable level of risk.
The plans expose the Group to a number of actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and, in certain markets, inflation risk.
There are no unusual entity or plan specific risks to the Group.
For risk control, the pension funds also have significant investments in liability matching assets bonds as well as in property and other alternative assets: additionally, the Group uses derivatives to further mitigate the impact of the risks outlined above.
The majority of assets are managed by a number of external fund managers with a small proportion managed in-house.
Unilever has a pooled investment vehicle Univest which it believes offers its pension plans around the world a simplified externally managed investment vehicle to implement their strategic asset allocation models, currently for bonds, equities and alternative assets.
The aim is to provide high quality, well diversified, cost-effective, riskcontrolled vehicles.
The pension plans investments are overseen by Unilevers internal investment company, the Univest Company.
ASSUMPTIONS With the objective of presenting the assets and liabilities of the pensions and other post-employment benefit plans at their fair value on the balance sheet, assumptions under IAS 19 are set by reference to market conditions at the valuation date.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities vary according to the country in which the plan is situated.
The following table shows the assumptions, weighted by liabilities, used to value the principal defined benefit plans which cover approximately 97% of total pension liabilities and the plans providing other post-employment benefits.

Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for healthcare plans.

These assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the pension plans.
The years of life expectancy for 2013 above have been translated from the following tables: UK: the year of use S1 series all pensioners S1PA tables have been adopted, which are based on the experience of UK pension schemes over the period 2000-2006.
Scaling factors are applied reflecting the experience of our pension funds appropriate to the members gender and status.

PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED The actual return on plan assets during 2013 was 1,594 million, being the sum of 934 million and 660 million from the table above 2012:2,118 million.
The duration of the principal defined benefit liabilities at 31 December 2013 is between 9 and 17 years 2012: 10 and 17 years.
Theliabilities are split between different categories of plan participants as follows: active members 19.1% 2012: 21.3% deferred members 21% 2012: 19.4% retired members 59.9% 2012: 59.3% ASSETS The fair value of plan assets at the end of the reporting period for our major and principal plans for each category are as follows: million million 31 December 2013 31 December 2012 Restated Other post Other postemployment employment Pension benefit Pension benefit plans plans plans plans Total Assets 18,313 6 17,665 8 Equities Total 7,383 7,491 1 Europe 2,904 3,016 North America 2,433 2,375 Other 2,046 2,100 1 Fixed Income Total 7,075 5 6,070 6 Government bonds 3,541 2 3,081 Investment grade Corporate bonds 2,336 2,201 Other Fixed Income 1,198 3 788 6 Derivatives 18 430 Private Equity 706 686 Property and Real Estate 1,230 1,132 Hedge Funds 936 852 Other 693 1 574 1 Other plans 272 430 The fair values of the above equity and fixed income instruments are determined based on quoted market prices in active markets.
Thefair value of private equity, properties, derivatives and hedge funds are not based on quoted market prices in active markets.
The Group uses swaps to hedge some of its exposure to inflation and interest rate risk.
Foreign currency exposures in part are also hedged by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Assets included in the Other category are commodities, cash and insurance contracts which are also unquoted assets.
Equity securities include Unilever securities amounting to 67 million 0.4% of total plan assets and 32 million 0.2% of total plan assets at 31 December 2013 and 2012 respectively.
Property includes property occupied by Unilever amounting to 15 million and 16million at 31 December 2013 and 2012 respectively.
The pension assets above exclude the assets in a Special Benefits Trust amounting to 84 million 2012: 98 million to fund pension and similar liabilities in the US see also note 17A on page 126.
SENSITIVITIES The sensitivity of the overall pension liabilities to changes in the weighted key assumptions are: Change in assumption Change in liabilities Discount rate Increase by 0.5% 7% Inflation rate Increase by 0.5% 5% Life expectancy Increase by 1 year 3% Long-term medical cost inflation Increase by 1.0% 1% An equivalent decrease in each assumption would have an equal and opposite impact on liabilities.
The sensitivity analyses above have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period and may not be representative of the actual change.
It is based on a change in the key assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
When calculating the sensitivity to the assumption, the same method used to calculate the liability recognised in the balance sheet has been applied.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared with the previous period.

PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED CASH FLOW Group cash flow in respect of pensions and similar post-employment benefits comprises company contributions paid to funded plans and benefits paid by the company in respect of unfunded plans, as set out in the following table including the current estimate of contributions for 2014 : million million million million 2014 2013 2012 2011 Estimate Company contributions to funded plans: Defined benefit 470 453 435 297 Defined contributions 130 121 116 90 Benefits paid by the company in respect of unfunded plans: Defined benefit 150 141 170 166 Group cash flow in respect of pensions and similar benefits 750 715 721 553 The Groups funding policy is to periodically review the contributions made to the plans while taking account of local legislation.
SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS The fair value of the awards at the grant date is calculated using pricing models and recognised over the vesting period of the grantas aremuneration cost with a corresponding credit to equity.
The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of awards vesting, except where the failure to vest is as a result of not meeting a market condition.
Cancellations of equity instruments are treated as an acceleration of the vesting period and any outstanding charge is recognised in the income statement immediately.
As at 31 December 2013, the Group had share-based compensation plans in the form of performance shares, share options and other share awards.
The numbers in this note include those for Executive Directors shown in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 60 to 83 and those for key management personnel shown in note 4A on page 99.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the sharebased compensation plans.

The MCIP allows Unilevers managers to invest up to 60% of their annual bonus in shares in Unilever and to receive a corresponding award of performance-related shares.
Under GSIP Unilevers managers receive annual awards of NV and PLC shares.
The awards ofboth plans will vest after three years between 0% and 200% of grant level, depending on the satisfaction of performance metrics.
The performance metrics of both MCIP and GSIP are underlying sales growth, operating cash flow and core operating margin improvement.
There is an additional target based on relative total shareholder return TSR for senior executives.

INCOME TAX Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Current tax in the consolidated income statement will differ from the income tax paid in the consolidated cash flow statement primarily because of deferred tax arising on temporary differences and payment dates for income tax occurring after the balance sheet date.

For this reason the rate may vary from year to year according to the mix of profit and related tax rates.
DEFERRED TAX Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method on taxable temporary differences between the tax base and the accounting base of items included in the balance sheet of the Group.
Certain temporary differences are not provided for as follows: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, at the year end.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of unused tax losses of 1,641 million 2012: 1,234 million and tax credits of 390 million 2012: 120 million, asit is not probable that there will be future taxable profits within the entities against which the losses can be utilised.
The majority of these tax losses and credits arise in tax jurisdictions where they do not expire with the exception of 181 million 2012: 516 million of state and federal tax losses in the US which expire between now and 2031.
Other deductible temporary differences of 72 million 2012: 39 million have not been recognised as a deferred tax asset.
There is no expiry date for these differences.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 1,306 million 2012: 1,449 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.

COMBINED EARNINGS PER SHARE The calculations of combined earnings per share are based on the net profit attributable to ordinary share capital divided by the average number of share units representing the combined ordinary share capital of NV and PLC in issue during the year, after deducting shares held as treasury stock.
The calculations of diluted earnings per share and core earnings per share Core EPS are based on: i conversion into PLC ordinary shares of those shares in a group company which are convertible in the year 2038, as described in the Corporate Governance report on page 42: and ii the effect of share-based compensation plans, details of which are set out in note 4C on pages 104 to 105.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS GOODWILL Goodwill is initially recognised based on the accounting policy for business combinations see note 21.
Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less amounts provided for impairment.
The Groups cash generating units CGUs are based on the four product categories and the three geographical areas.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the Groups CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
These might not always be the same as the CGUs that include the assets and liabilities of the acquired business.
Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, and is not larger than an operating segment.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS Separately purchased intangible assets are initially measured at cost.
On acquisition of new interests in group companies, Unilever recognises any specifically identifiable intangible assets separately from goodwill.
Intangible assets are initially measured at fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Finite-life intangible assets mainly comprise patented and non-patented technology, know-how and software.
These assets are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis in the income statement over the period of their expected useful lives, or the period of legal rights if shorter.
None of the amortisation periods exceeds ten years.
Indefinite-life intangibles mainly comprise trademarks and brands.
These assets are capitalised at cost but are not amortised.
They are subject to a review for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate this is necessary.
Any impairment is charged to the income statement as it arises.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Development expenditure is capitalised only if the costs can be reliably measured, future economic benefits are probable, the product is technically feasible and the Group has the intent and the resources to complete the project.
Research expenditure is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

SIGNIFICANT CGUS The goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets held in the three CGUs relating to Foods across the geographical areas are considered significant within the total carrying amounts of goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets at 31 December 2013 in terms of size, headroom and sensitivity to assumptions used.
Noother CGUs are considered significant in this respect.
The goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets held in the significant CGUs are: billion billion billion billion 2013 2013 2012 2012 Indefinite Indefinitelife life Goodwill intangibles Goodwill intangibles Foods Europe 5.8 1.6 5.8 1.6 Foods The Americas 3.6 1.3 3.9 1.4 Foods Asia AMET RUB 1.4 0.4 1.4 0.4 Value in use has been calculated as the present value of projected future cash flows.
A pre-tax discount rate of 7.4% was used.
For the significant CGUs, the following key assumptions were used in the discounted cash flow projections: 110 Financial statements Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2013 9.
GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED Foods Foods Foods The Asia Europe Americas AMET RUB Longer-term sustainable growth rates 0.3% 1.6% 3.5% Average near-term nominal growth rates 0.9% 5.8% 10.3% Average operating margins 2224% 1921% 1517% The growth rates and margins used to estimate future performance are based on past performance and our experience of growth rates and margins achievable in our key markets.
The projections covered a period of five years, as we believe this to be the most appropriate timescale over which to review and consider annual performances before applying a fixed terminal value multiple to the final year cash flows.
The growth rates used are consistent with our annual planning and strategic planning processes.
We have performed sensitivity analyses around the base assumptions and have concluded that no reasonable possible changes in key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of the significant CGUs to be less than the carrying value.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost including eligible borrowing costs less depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the expected average useful lives of the assets.
Residual values are reviewed at least annually.
Estimated useful lives by major class of assets are as follows: Freehold buildings no depreciation on freehold land 40 years Leasehold land and buildings 40 years or life of lease if less Plant and equipment 2-20 years Property, plant and equipment is subject to review for impairment if triggering events or circumstances indicate that this is necessary.
If an indication of impairment exists, the assets or cash generating units recoverable amount is estimated and any impairment loss is charged to the income statement as it arises.

INVENTORIES Inventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct costs and, where appropriate, a proportion of attributable production overheads.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

In 2013, 155 million 2012:71million was utilised or released to the income statement from inventory provisions taken in earlier years.
TRADE AND OTHER CURRENT RECEIVABLES Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequently these assets are held at amortised cost, using the effective interest method and net of any impairment losses.
We do not consider the fair values of trade and other receivables to be significantly different from their carrying values.
Credit terms for customers are determined in individual territories.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited, due to the Groups customer base being large and diverse.
Our historical experience of collecting receivables, supported by the level of default, is that credit risk is low across territories and so trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial assets.
Balances are considered for impairment on an individual basis rather than by reference to the extent that they become overdue.

CAPITAL AND FUNDING CONTINUED Unilever considers the following components of its balance sheet to be managed capital: total equity retained profit, other reserves, share capital, share premium, non-controlling interests note 15A and 15B : short-term debt current financial liabilities note 15C : and long-term debt non-current bank loans, bonds and other loans note 15C.
The Group manages its capital so as to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to optimise returns to our shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity.
The capital structure of the Group is based on managements judgement of the appropriate balance of key elements in order to meet its strategic and day-to-day needs.
We consider the amount of capital in proportion to risk and manage the capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
Our current long-term credit rating is A A1 and our short-term credit rating is A1 P1.
We aim to maintain a competitive balance sheet which we consider to be the equivalent of a credit rating of A A1 in the long term.
This provides us with: appropriate access to the debt and equity markets: sufficient flexibility for acquisitions: sufficient resilience against economic and financial uncertainty while ensuring ample liquidity: and optimal weighted average cost of capital, given the above constraints.
Unilever monitors the qualitative and quantitative factors utilised by the rating agencies.
This information is publicly available and is updated by the credit rating agencies on a regular basis.

TREASURY RISK MANAGEMENT DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING Derivatives are measured at fair value with any related transaction costs expensed as incurred.
The treatment of changes in the value of derivatives depends on their use as explained below.
I FAIR VALUE HEDGES Certain derivatives are held to hedge the risk of changes in value of a specific bond or other loan.
In these situations, the Group designates the liability and related derivative to be part of a fair value hedge relationship.
The carrying value of the bond is adjusted by the fair value of the risk being hedged, with changes going to the income statement.
Gains and losses on the corresponding derivative are also recognised in the income statement.
The amounts recognised are offset in the income statement to the extent that the hedge is effective.
When the relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the fair value hedge adjustment made to the bond is amortised to the income statement using the effective interest method.
II CASH FLOW HEDGES Derivatives are also held to hedge the uncertainty in timing or amount of future forecast cash flows.
Such derivatives are classified as being part of cash flow hedge relationships.
For an effective hedge, gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in equity.
Any ineffective elements of the hedge are recognised in the income statement.
If the hedged cash flow relates to a non-financial asset, the amount accumulated in equity is subsequently included within the carrying value of that asset.
For other cash flow hedges, amounts deferred in equity are taken to the income statement at the same time as the related cash flow.
When a derivative no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss remains in equity until the related cash flow occurs.
When the cash flow takes place, the cumulative gain or loss is taken to the income statement.
If the hedged cash flow is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss is taken to the income statement immediately.
III NET INVESTMENT HEDGES Certain derivatives are designated as hedges of the currency risk on the Groups investment in foreign subsidiaries.
The accounting policy for these arrangements is set out in note 1.
IV DERIVATIVES FOR WHICH HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS NOT APPLIED Derivatives not classified as hedges are held in order to hedge certain balance sheet items and commodity exposures.
No hedge accounting is applied to these derivatives, which are carried at fair value with changes being recognised in the income statement.
The Group is exposed to the following risks that arise from its use of financial instruments, the management of which is described in the following sections: liquidity risk see note 16A : market risk see note 16B : and credit risk see note 17B.
MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDITY RISK Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will face in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities when due without incurring unacceptable losses.
In doing this, management considers both normal and stressed conditions.
A material and sustained shortfall in our cash flow could undermine the Groups credit rating, impair investor confidence and also restrict the Groups ability to raise funds.
The Group maintained a cautious funding strategy, with a positive cash balance throughout 2013.
This was the result of cash delivery from the business, coupled with the proceeds from bond issuances in 2013.
This cash has been invested conservatively with low risk counter-parties at maturities of less than six months.
Cash flow from operating activities provides the funds to service the financing of financial liabilities on a day-to-day basis.
The Group seeks to manage its liquidity requirements by maintaining access to global debt markets through short-term and long-term debt programmes.
In addition, Unilever has committed credit facilities for general corporate use.
On 31 December 2013 Unilever had undrawn revolving 364-day bilateral credit facilities in aggregate of US $6,400 million 2012: US $6,140 million with a 364-day term out.
On 31 December 2013 Unilever had no 364-day bilateral money market commitments 2012: US $110 million.

MANAGEMENT OF MARKET RISK Unilevers size and operations result in it being exposed to the following market risks that arise from its use of financial instruments: commodity price risk: currency risk: and interest rate risk.
The above risks may affect the Groups income and expenses, or the value of its financial instruments.
The objective of the Groups management of market risk is to maintain this risk within acceptable parameters, while optimising returns.
Generally, the Group applies hedge accounting to manage the volatility in profit and loss arising from market risk.
The Groups exposure to, and management of, these risks is explained below.
It often includes derivative financial instruments, the uses of which are described in note 16C.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING CONTINUED MASTER NETTING OR SIMILAR AGREEMENTS A number of legal entities within our Group enter into derivative transactions under International Swap and Derivatives Association ISDA master netting agreements.
In general, under such agreements the amounts owed by each counter-party on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same currency are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other.
In certain circumstances such as when a credit event such as a default occurs, all outstanding transactions under the agreement are terminated, the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable in settlement of all transactions.
The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting the positive and negative values in the consolidated balance sheet.
This is because the Group does not have any currently legally enforceable right to offset recognised amounts, between various Group and bank affiliates, because the right to offset is enforceable only on the occurrence of future credit events such as a default.
The column Related amounts not set off in the balance sheet-Financial instruments shows the netting impact of our ISDA agreements, assuming the agreements are respected in the relevant jurisdiction.

INVESTMENT AND RETURN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet include deposits, investments in money market funds and highly liquid investments.
To be classified as cash and cash equivalents, an asset must: be readily convertible into cash: have an insignificant risk of changes in value: and have a maturity period of three months or less at acquisition.
Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement also include bank overdrafts and are recorded at amortised cost.
OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS Other financial assets are first recognised on the trade date.
At that point, they are classified as: i held-to-maturity investments: ii loans and receivables: iii available-for-sale financial assets: or iv financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial statements 125 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNILEVER GROUP CONTINUED 17.
INVESTMENT AND RETURN CONTINUED I HELD-TO-MATURITY INVESTMENTS These are assets with set cash flows and fixed maturities which Unilever intends to hold to maturity.
They are held at cost plus interest using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
II LOANS AND RECEIVABLES These are assets with an established payment profile and which are not listed on a recognised stock exchange.
They are initially recognised at fair value, which is usually the original invoice amount plus any directly related transaction costs.
Afterwards, loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost, less any impairment.
III AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS Any financial assets not classified as either loans and receivables or financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are designated as available-for-sale.
They are initially recognised at fair value, usually the original invoice amount plus any directly related transaction costs.
Afterwards, they are measured at fair value with changes being recognised in equity.
When the investment is sold or impaired, the accumulated gains and losses are moved from equity to the income statement.
Interest and dividends from these assets are recognised in the income statement.
IV FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS These are derivatives and assets that are held for trading.
Related transaction costs are expensed as incurred.
Unless they form part of a hedging relationship, these assets are held at fair value, with changes being recognised in the income statement.
IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS Each year, the Group assesses whether there is evidence that financial assets are impaired.
A significant or prolonged fall in value below the cost of an asset generally indicates that an asset may be impaired.
If impaired, financial assets are written down to their estimated recoverable amount.
Impairment losses on assets classified as loans and receivables are recognised in profit and loss.
When a later event causes the impairment losses to decrease, the reduction in impairment loss is also recognised in profit and loss.
Impairment losses on assets classified as available-for-sale are recognised by moving the loss accumulated in equity to the income statement.
Any subsequent recovery in value of an available-for-sale debt security is recognised within profit and loss.
However, any subsequent recovery in value of an equity security is recognised within equity, and is recorded at amortised cost.
FINANCIAL ASSETS The Groups treasury function aims to protect the Groups financial investments, while maximising returns.

CREDIT RISK Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counter-party fails to meet its contractual obligations.
Additional information in relation to credit risk on trade receivables is given in note 13.
These risks are generally managed by local controllers.
Credit risk related to the use of treasury instruments is managed on a Group basis.
This risk arises from transactions with financial institutions involving cash and cash equivalents, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
To reduce this risk, Unilever has concentrated its main activities with a limited number of counter-parties which have secure credit ratings.
Individual risk limits are set for each counter-party based on financial position, credit rating and past experience.
Credit limits and concentration of exposures are actively monitored by the Groups treasury department.
Netting agreements are also put in place with Unilevers principal counterparties.
In the case of a default, these arrangements would allow Unilever to net assets and liabilities across transactions with that counter-party.
To further reduce the Groups creditexposures on derivative financial instruments, Unilever has collateral agreements with Unilevers principal counter-parties in relation to derivative financial instruments.
Under these arrangements, counter-parties are required to deposit securities and or cash as a collateral for their obligations in respect of derivative financial instruments.
At 31 December 2013 the collateral held by Unilever under such arrangements amounted to9 million 2012:6 million, of which 5 million 2012: 6 million was in cash, and 4 million 2012: nil was in the form of bond securities.
The non-cash collateral has not been recognised as an asset in the Groups balance sheet.
Further details in relation to the Groups exposure to credit risk are shown in note 13 and note 16A.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FAIR VALUE RISK The Group is exposed to the risks of changes in fair value of its financial assets and liabilities.
The following table summarises the fair values and carrying amounts of financial instruments.

FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY The fair values shown above have been classified into three categories depending on the inputs used in the valuation technique.
Thecategories used are as follows: Level 1: quoted prices for identical instruments: Level 2: directly or indirectly observable market inputs, other than Level 1 inputs: and Level 3: inputs which are not based on observable market data.

A change in one or more of the inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would not change fair value significantly.
CALCULATION OF FAIR VALUES The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are defined as being the amounts at which the instruments could be exchanged or liability settled in an arms length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties.
The following methods and assumptions have been used to estimate the fair values: ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE The fair values of quoted investments falling into Level 1 are based on current bid prices.
The fair values of unquoted available-for-sale financial assets are based on recent trades in liquid markets, observable market rates, discounted cash flow analysis and statistical modelling techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.
Derivatives are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs.
The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counter-parties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying commodities.
For listed securities where the market is not liquid, and for unlisted securities, valuation techniques are used.
These include the use of recent arms length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same and discounted cash flow calculations.
OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FAIR VALUES FOR DISCLOSURE PURPOSES ONLY Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other current receivables, bank loans and overdrafts, trade payables and other current liabilities have fair values that approximate to their carrying amounts due to their short-term nature.
The fair values of preference shares and listed bonds are based on their market value.
Non-listed bonds, other loans, bank loans and non-current receivables and payables are based on the net present value of the anticipated future cash flows associated with these instruments using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.
Fair values for finance lease creditors have been assessed by reference to current market rates for comparable leasing arrangements.
128 Financial statements Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2013 18.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FAIR VALUE RISK CONTINUED POLICIES AND PROCESSES USED IN RELATION TO THE CALCULATION OF LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUES Assets valued using Level 3 valuation techniques are primarily made up of long-term cash receivables and unlisted investments.
Valuation techniques used are specific to the circumstances involved.
Unlisted investments include 132 million 2012: 130 million of investments within Unilever Ventures Limited.
These investments are governed and administered by a dedicated management team.
The remaining assets in this category are held across several locations and valuations are managed locally, with oversight from corporate management.
PROVISIONS Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation exists at the balance sheet date, as a result of a past event, where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated and where the outflow of economic benefit is probable.

The provision for disputed indirect taxes is comprised of a number of small disputed items.
The largest elements relate to disputes with Brazilian authorities.
Due to the nature of the disputes, the timing of provision utilisation and any cash outflows is uncertain.
The majority of disputed items attract an interest charge.
No individual items within the remaining provisions are significant.
Unilever expects that the issues relating to these restructuring, legal and other provisions will be substantively resolved within five years.
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are initially recognised at the lower of fair value at the date of commencement of the lease and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Subsequent to initial recognition, these assets are accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy relating to that specific asset.
The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance costs in the income statement and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Lease payments under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Contingent liabilities are either possible obligations that will probably not require a transfer of economic benefits, or present obligations that may, but probably will not, require a transfer of economic benefits.
It is not appropriate to make provisions for contingent liabilities, but there isa chance that they will result in an obligation in the future.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES CONTINUED LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Group is involved from time to time in legal and arbitration proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.
As previously disclosed, along with other consumer products companies and retail customers, Unilever is involved in a number of ongoing investigations by national competition authorities.
These proceedings and investigations are at various stages and concern a variety of product markets.
In the second half of 2013 Unilever recognised provisions of 120 million related to these cases.
Ongoing compliance with competition laws is of key importance to Unilever.
It is Unilevers policy to co-operate fully with competition authorities whenever questions or issues arise.
In addition, the Group continues to reinforce and enhance our internal competition law compliance programme on an ongoing basis.
As disclosed above, where specific issues arise provisions are made and contingent liabilities disclosed to the extent appropriate.
During 2004 in Brazil, and in common with many other businesses operating in that country, one of our Brazilian subsidiaries received a notice of infringement from the Federal Revenue Service.
The notice alleges that a 2001 reorganisation of our local corporate structure was undertaken without valid business purpose.
The 2001 reorganisation was comparable with restructurings done by many companies in Brazil.
The original dispute has now been resolved in the courts in the Groups favour but a new assessment was raised during the course of the year in respect of a similar matter.
The Group believes that the likelihood of a successful challenge by the tax authorities is low, however, there can be no guarantee of success in court.
In many markets, there is a high degree of complexity involved in the local tax regimes.
In common with other businesses operating in this environment, the Unilever Group is required to exercise judgement in the assessment of any potential exposures in these areas.
Where appropriate, the Unilever Group will make provisions or disclose contingencies in accordance with the relevant accounting principles.
ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method as at the acquisition date, which is the date at which control is transferred to the Group.
Goodwill is measured at the acquisition date as the fair value of consideration transferred, plus non-controlling interests and the fair value of any previously held equity interests less the net recognised amount which is generally fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed.
Consideration transferred does not include amounts related to settlement of pre-existing relationships.
Such amounts are generally recognised in net profit.
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, other than those incurred in relation to the issue of debt or equity securities.
Any contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration are recognised in net profit.
Changes in ownership that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as equity transactions and therefore do not have any impact on goodwill.
The difference between consideration and the non-controlling share of net assets acquired is recognised within equity.
2013 On 3 January 2013 the Group announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to sell its global Skippy business to Hormel Foods for a total cash consideration of approximately US $700 million.
