The Group operates the following equity-settled employee option and share plans: Worldwide Save for Shares Plan Since 1994, the Group has operated a Save-As-You-Earn plan for UK employees.
In 1998, the Group introduced a Worldwide Save for Shares Plan.
Under these plans, employees can save a portion of their monthly salary over periods of three, five or seven years.
At the end of this period, the employee has the option to purchase ordinary shares with the accumulated funds at a purchase price equal to 80% of the market price prevailing at the time of the commencement of the employees participation in the plan.
Options that are not exercised within six months of the end of the savings period lapse unconditionally.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan In 2000, the Group established an Employee Stock Purchase Plan which allows all employees in the US to save a portion of their monthly salary over six-month periods.
At the end of the period, the employee has the option to purchase ADRs with their accumulated funds at a purchase price equal to 85% of the lower of the market price prevailing at the beginning or end of the period.
Long-Term Incentive Plan This plan was first introduced in 2001, renewed in 2006 and again in 2011.
The plan consists of restricted shares.
The vesting of restricted shares is normally dependent on continuing service over a three to five-year period, and in the case of senior management upon the satisfaction of corporate performance targets over a three-year period.
These targets may be based on market and or non-market performance criteria.
Restricted shares awarded to senior management in May and October 2013, and May 2012 vest dependent on relative total shareholder return, return on invested capital and earnings per share growth.
The award was split equally across all three measures.
Other restricted shares awarded in 2013 and 2012 vest depending on continuing service over a threeyear period.
Annual Bonus Share Matching Plan This plan permits executive directors and senior executives around the Group to invest up to 50% of any after tax annual bonus in Pearson shares.
If these shares are held and the Group meets an earnings per share growth target, the company will match them on a gross basis of up to one matching share for every invested share i. e. the maximum number of matching shares is equal to the number of shares that could have been acquired with the amount of the pre-tax annual bonus taken in invested shares.
The number and weighted average exercise prices of share options granted under the Groups plans are as follows: 2013 2012 Weighted Weighted Number of average Number of average share options exercise price share options exercise price 000s 000s Outstanding at beginning of year 3,373 8.24 3,203 7.15 Granted during the year 763 9.14 1,321 9.09 Exercised during the year 820 7.12 840 5.59 Forfeited during the year 516 8.75 294 7.84 Expired during the year 8 5.75 17 5.60 Outstanding at end of year 2,792 8.73 3,373 8.24 Options exercisable at end of year 35 6.95 106 5.58 184 Pearson plc Annual report and accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 26.
Share-based payments continued Options were exercised regularly throughout the year.
The weighted average share price during the year was 12.42 2012: 12.01.
Early exercises arising from redundancy, retirement or death are treated as an acceleration of vesting and the Group therefore recognises in the income statement the amount that otherwise would have been recognised for services received over the remainder of the original vesting period.
The options outstanding at the end of the year have weighted average remaining contractual lives and exercise prices as follows: 2013 2012 Weighted Weighted Number of average Number of average share contractual share contractual Range of exercise prices options life options life 000s Years 000s Years 0 5 5 10 2,792 2.31 3,373 2.56 10 2,792 2.31 3,373 2.56 In 2013 and 2012 options were granted under the Worldwide Save for Shares Plan.
The weighted average estimated fair value for the options granted was calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The weighted average estimated fair values and the inputs into the Black-Scholes model are as follows: 2013 2012 Weighted Weighted average average Fair value 2.27 2.38 Weighted average share price 11.71 11.51 Weighted average exercise price 9.14 9.09 Expected volatility 22.05% 23.62% Expected life 3.8 years 3.8 years Risk free rate 0.53% 0.74% Expected dividend yield 3.84% 3.65% Forfeiture rate 3.3% 3.3% The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility of the companys share price over the previous three to seven years depending on the vesting term of the options.
The following shares were granted under restricted share arrangements: 2013 2012 Weighted Weighted Number of average Number of average shares fair value shares fair value 000s 000s Long-Term Incentive Plan 3,482 11.52 4,503 11.56 Annual Bonus Share Matching Plan 99 12.06 237 11.52 The fair value of shares granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan that vest unconditionally is determined using the share price at the date of grant.
The number of shares expected to vest is adjusted, based on historical experience, to account for potential forfeitures.
Restricted shares granted under the Annual Bonus Share Matching Plan are valued using the share price at the date of grant.
Participants under both plans are entitled to dividends during the vesting period and therefore the share price is not discounted.
