BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2013 | 209 9.1 Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2 Segment reporting Business segments The Group operates five Businesses aligned with the commodities which we extract and market, reflecting the structure used by the Groups management to assess the performance of the Group.
During the financial year the Group completed the following changes: Following the sale of its diamonds business and interests in Richards Bay Minerals, the Group has consolidated its Potash development activity with the Petroleum Customer Sector Group CSG to form the Petroleum and Potash Business.
In view of the new management structure, this Business is now considered to be a single reportable segment.
There were no inter-segment transactions between the Petroleum CSG and Potash Business and therefore the comparative amounts reported for the new Petroleum and Potash segment for the years ended 30 June 2012 and 30 June 2011 are an aggregation of Petroleum and Potash.
The remaining amounts reported previously for the Diamonds and Specialty Products CSG have been included in Group and unallocated items.
The Base Metals CSG was renamed the Copper Business.
The consolidation of the Metallurgical Coal and Energy Coal CSGs to form the Coal Business.
There were no inter-segment transactions between the Metallurgical Coal and Energy Coal CSGs and therefore the comparative amounts reported for the new Coal segment for the years ended 30 June 2012 and 30 June 2011 are an aggregation of previously reported amounts.
The consolidation of the Aluminium, Manganese and Stainless Steel Materials CSGs to form the Aluminium, Manganese and Nickel Business.
There were no inter-segment transactions between the Stainless Steel Materials, Aluminium and Manganese CSGs and therefore the comparative amounts reported for the new Aluminium, Manganese and Nickel segment for the years ended 30 June 2012 and 30 June 2011 are an aggregation of previously reported amounts.
Reportable segment Principal activities Petroleum and Potash Exploration, development and production of oil and gas Potash development Copper Mining of copper, silver, lead, zinc, molybdenum, uranium and gold Iron Ore Mining of iron ore Coal Mining of metallurgical coal and thermal energy coal Aluminium, Manganese and Nickel Mining of bauxite, refining of bauxite into alumina and smelting of alumina into aluminium metal Mining of manganese ore and production of manganese metal and alloys Mining and production of nickel products Group and unallocated items represent Group centre functions, unallocated operations and consolidation adjustments.

Of the US$463 million of tax credits, US$356 million expires later than five years and not later than ten years.
The remainder of the tax credits do not have an expiration date.
Temporary differences relating to MRRT and PRRT At 30 June 2013, the Group had US$19,419 million of unrecognised deductible temporary differences 2012: US$19,338 million that arose due to the enactment of the Australian MRRT and PRRT extension legislation in March 2012.
Recognition of a deferred tax asset for MRRT and PRRT depends on benefits expected to be obtained from deduction against MRRT and PRRT liabilities based on the 1 May 2010 market value of Australian coal, iron ore and petroleum assets.
Recognition of a deferred tax asset associated with MRRT and PRRT of US$19,419 million 2012: US$19,338 million would result in a corresponding additional deferred tax liability for income tax purposes of US$5,826 million 2012: US$5,801 million.
Other deductible temporary differences At 30 June 2013, the Group had deductible temporary differences for which deferred tax assets of US$3,350 million 2012: US$3,192 million have not been recognised because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits.
The deductible temporary differences do not expire under current tax legislation.
Temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities At 30 June 2013, deferred tax liabilities of US$2,174 million 2012: US$1,997 million associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities have not been recognised because the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is not probable that such differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.

The recoverable amounts of the Onshore US group of CGUs and the Fayetteville CGU were determined based on fair value less costs to sell FVLCS.
FVLCS was determined as the present value of the estimated future cash flows expressed in real terms expected to arise from the continued use of the assets life of asset, including any expansion prospects, and its eventual disposal, using assumptions that an independent market participant may take into account.
These cash flows were discounted using a real after-tax discount rate that reflected current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU.
The determination of FVLCS was most sensitive to the following assumptions: Production volumes Crude oil prices Natural gas prices Discount rate 226 | BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2013 7 8 9 10 11 Directors Report Legal proceedings Financial Statements Glossary Shareholder information 14 Intangible assets continued Production volumes estimated production volumes were based on detailed data for the fields and took into account development plans for the fields established by management as part of the long-term planning process.
Production volumes are dependent on variables, such as the recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons, the production profile of the hydrocarbons, the cost of the development of the infrastructure necessary to recover the hydrocarbons, the production costs, the contractual duration of the production leases and the selling price of the hydrocarbons produced.
As each producing field has specific reservoir characteristics and economic circumstances, the cash flows of the fields were computed using appropriate individual economic models and key assumptions established by management.
The production profiles used were consistent with the resource volumes approved as part of the Groups process for the estimation of proved reserves and total resources.
Crude oil and natural gas prices key assumptions for oil and gas prices were derived from forward price curves and long-term views of global supply and demand, building upon past experience of the industry and consistent with external sources.
These prices were adjusted to arrive at appropriate consistent price assumptions for different qualities of oil and gas, or where appropriate, contracted oil and gas prices were applied.
The crude oil and natural gas prices used in the FVLCS determinations were either lower or within the range of prices published by market commentators: 2013 2012 Crude oil price US$ boe 71.00 125.00 75.82 101.93 Natural gas price US$ MMBtu 4.45 6.51 2.74 6.21 Discount rate in arriving at the FVLCS, a real post-tax discount rate of 5.9 per cent 2012: 5.9 per cent was applied to the post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms.
This discount rate was derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC, with appropriate adjustments made to reflect the risks specific to the CGU.
Onshore US The goodwill of US$3,591 million that arose from the acquisition of Petrohawk Energy Corporation has been allocated to the Onshore US group of CGUs which comprises the Fayetteville, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and the Permian Basin CGUs.
The Onshore US group of CGUs comprises the natural gas and liquid reserves and resources, gas production wells and associated facilities, and gas gathering systems in the Eagle Ford, Haynesville and the Permian areas in Texas and Louisiana US and the Fayetteville area in Arkansas US.
The Onshore US group of CGUs is part of the Petroleum and Potash reportable segment.
The Onshore US group of CGUs was tested for impairment after testing each of the individual CGUs that it comprises.
Year ended 30 June 2013 The impairment tests for the Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Fayetteville CGUs indicated that no impairments were required.
However, an impairment of US$266 million was recognised in relation to the Permian Basin.
In the prior year the Permian Basin had been identified as one CGU.
However, the current development plan identifies two distinct regions that would have to be developed independently: North Reeves Pecos region Delaware Basin and South Midland Midland Basin region.
Management also noted that each region has a separate and distinctive basin: they are geographically distant: and they do not share common infrastructure.
Accordingly, management determined that each region represents a separate CGU.
The US$266 million impairment relates to the South Midland CGU and was recognised against property, plant and equipment, refer to note 3 Exceptional items for further discussion.
The impairment test of the Onshore US group of CGUs was therefore performed after the Permian assets were written down to their recoverable amount which was based on FVLCS measured using discounted cash flow projections.
The result indicated that the recoverable amount of the Onshore US group of CGUs exceeded its carrying amount including goodwill by US$4,104 million and no further impairment was required.
The table below shows the key assumptions used in the FVLCS as well as the amount by which each key assumption must change in isolation in order for the estimated recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of the Onshore group of CGUs, including goodwill.
Owing to the complexity of the analysis caused by relationships between each key assumption, such that a change in one would cause a change in several other inputs to the calculation, the analysis below was performed for each assumption individually.
BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2013 | 227 9.1 Consolidated Financial Statements continued 14 Intangible assets continued Change required for the carrying amount to equal Assumptions used in FVLCS the recoverable amount Production volumes Managements long-term plan decrease of 7% Crude oil prices US$ boe 82.50 91.54 decrease of 23% Natural gas prices US$ MMBtu 4.14 5.66 decrease of 18% Discount rate 5.9% increase of 160 basis points Year ended 30 June 2012 The impairment tests for the Eagle Ford, Haynesville and the Permian Basin CGUs indicated that no impairments were required.
As indicated below, an impairment was recognised in relation to the Fayetteville CGU.
The impairment test of the Onshore US group of CGUs was therefore performed after the Fayetteville assets were written down to their recoverable amount.
The result indicated that the recoverable amount of the Onshore US group of CGUs exceeded its carrying amount and no further impairment was required.
With regard to the assessment of FVLCS for the Onshore US group of CGUs, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the group of CGUs to exceed its recoverable amount.
Fayetteville The goodwill of US$552 million that arose from the acquisition of the Fayetteville gas business in March 2011 was allocated to the Fayetteville CGU.
The Fayetteville CGU comprises the Fayetteville natural gas reserves and resource: gas production wells and associated facilities: and the gas gathering system located in Arkansas, US.
Year ended 30 June 2013 Goodwill allocated to Fayetteville was fully impaired in the year ended 30 June 2012.
Accordingly, a goodwill impairment test was not required to be performed in the year ended 30 June 2013.
Year ended 30 June 2012 For the interim period ended 31 December 2011, impairment testing indicated that the Fayetteville CGU was not impaired.
However, during the second half of the year ended 30 June 2012 there was a significant fall in US domestic gas prices, which prompted the Group to adjust its development plans.
Consequently, a further impairment test was performed as at 30 June 2012 and resulted in a total impairment charge of US$2,835 million being recognised for the year ended 30 June 2012, including impairment of the Fayetteville goodwill of US$552 million and property, plant and equipment of US$2,283 million.

b Actual or potential litigation amounts relate to a number of actions against the Group, none of which are individually significant and where the liability is not probable and therefore the Group has not provided for such amounts in these financial statements.
Additionally, there are a number of legal claims or potential claims against the Group, the outcome of which cannot be foreseen at present, and for which no amounts have been included in the table above.
In addition to the amounts reported above, following requests for information in August 2009 from the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC, the Group commenced an internal investigation and disclosed to relevant authorities including the US Department of Justice DOJ evidence that it has uncovered regarding possible violations of applicable anti-corruption laws involving interactions with government officials.
As has been publicly reported, the Australian Federal Police has indicated that it has commenced an investigation.
The Group is fully cooperating with the relevant authorities as it has since the US investigations commenced.
As part of the US process, the SEC and DOJ notified the Group in August 2013 of the issues they consider could form the basis of enforcement actions and discussions are continuing.
The issues relate primarily to matters in connection with previously terminated exploration and development efforts, as well as hospitality provided as part of the Companys sponsorship of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
In light of the continuing nature of the investigations it is not appropriate at this stage for BHP Billiton to predict outcomes, and therefore no amount has been included in the contingent liabilities above.

242 | BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2013 7 8 9 10 11 Directors Report Legal proceedings Financial Statements Glossary Shareholder information 29 Financial risk management Financial risk management strategy The financial risks arising from the Groups operations comprise market, liquidity and credit risk.
These risks arise in the normal course of business, and the Group manages its exposure to them in accordance with the Groups portfolio risk management strategy.
The objective of the strategy is to support the delivery of the Groups financial targets while protecting its future financial security and flexibility by taking advantage of the natural diversification provided by the scale, diversity and flexibility of the Groups operations and activities.
A Cash Flow at Risk CFaR framework is used to measure the aggregate and diversified impact of financial risks upon the Groups financial targets.
The principal measurement of risk is CFaR measured on a portfolio basis, which is defined as the worst expected loss relative to projected business plan cash flows over a one-year horizon under normal market conditions at a confidence level of 95 per cent.
Market risk The Groups activities expose it to market risks associated with movements in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodity prices.
Under the strategy outlined above, the Group seeks to achieve financing costs, currency impacts, input costs and commodity prices on a floating or index basis.
This strategy gives rise to a risk of variability in earnings which is measured under the CFaR framework.
In executing the strategy, financial instruments are potentially employed in three distinct but related activities.
The following table summarises these activities and the key risk management processes.
Activity Key risk management processes 1 Risk mitigation On an exception basis, hedging for the purposes of mitigating risk related to specific and significant Execution of transactions within expenditure on investments or capital projects will be executed if necessary to support the Groups approved mandates.

As part of this strategy swaptions may also be used.

at risk and stop loss limits.
Execution of transactions within approved mandates.
Primary responsibility for identification and control of financial risks, including authorising and monitoring the use of financial instruments for the above activities and stipulating policy thereon, rests with the Financial Risk Management Committee under authority delegated by the Group Management Committee.
BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2013 | 243 9.1 Consolidated Financial Statements continued 29 Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its outstanding borrowings and investments from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair value of fixed interest rate financial instruments.
Interest rate risk is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.
The majority of the Groups debt is raised under central borrowing programs.
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps to convert most of the centrally managed debt into US dollar floating interest rate exposures.
As at 30 June 2013, the Group holds US$5,377 million 2012: US$4,317 million of centrally managed fixed interest rate borrowings as well as US$4,412 million 2012: US$4,039 million of other fixed interest rate borrowings that have not been swapped to floating interest rates, arising from debt raised during the financial years ended 30 June 2013 and 30 June 2012, debt assumed as part of the acquisition of Petrohawk Energy Corporation and debt raised prior to the DLC merger.
The Groups earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on the floating interest rate component of the Groups net borrowings.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps in hedge relationships used to hedge both interest rate and foreign currency risks are as follows: Fair value 2013 2012 US$M US$M Interest rate swaps US dollar swaps Pay floating receive fixed Not later than one year 36 51 Later than one year but not later than two years 14 66 Later than two years but not later than five years 307 428 Later than five years 56 297 US dollar swaps Pay fixed receive floating Later than five years 362 31 Cross currency interest rate swaps UK pound sterling to US dollar swaps Pay floating receive fixed Later than five years 136 UK pound sterling to US dollar swaps Pay fixed receive fixed Later than five years 22 Australian dollar to US dollar swaps Pay floating receive fixed Later than two years but not later than five years 117 Canadian dollar to US dollar swaps Pay fixed receive fixed Later than five years 31 Euro to US dollar swaps Pay floating receive fixed Not later than one year 27 Later than two years but not later than five years 17 Later than five years 33 108 Euro to US dollar swaps Pay fixed receive fixed Later than two years but not later than five years 45 117 Later than five years 16 Swaptions Pay floating receive fixed Not later than one year 173 6 Total fair value of derivatives 215 597 Based on the net debt position as at 30 June 2013, taking into account interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps and swaptions, it is estimated that a one percentage point increase in the US LIBOR interest rate will decrease the Groups equity and profit after taxation by US$136 million 2012: decrease of US$103 million.
This assumes that the change in interest rates is effective from the beginning of the financial year and the fixed floating mix and balances are constant over the year.
However, interest rates and the net debt profile of the Group may not remain constant over the coming financial year and therefore such sensitivity analysis should be used with care.
244 | BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2013 7 8 9 10 11 Directors Report Legal proceedings Financial Statements Glossary Shareholder information 29 Financial risk management continued Currency risk The US dollar is the functional currency of most operations within the Group and as a result currency exposures arise from transactions and balances in currencies other than the US dollar.
The Groups potential currency exposures comprise: translational exposure in respect of non-functional currency monetary items: transactional exposure in respect of non-functional currency expenditure and revenues.
The Groups foreign currency risk is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.
Translational exposure in respect of non-functional currency monetary items Monetary items, including financial assets and liabilities, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of an operation are periodically restated to US dollar equivalents, and the associated gain or loss is taken to the income statement.
The exception is foreign exchange gains or losses on foreign currency denominated provisions for closure and rehabilitation at operating sites, which are capitalised in property, plant and equipment.
The following table shows the foreign currency risk arising from financial assets and liabilities, which are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar.
2013 2012 Net financial liabilities assets by currency of denomination US$M US$M Australian dollars 4,144 5,347 South African rand 251 366 UK pound sterling 58 11 Other 94 113 Total 3,741 5,105 The principal non-functional currencies to which the Group is exposed are the Australian dollar, South African rand and UK pound sterling.
Based on the Groups net financial assets and liabilities as at 30 June 2013, a weakening of the US dollar against these currencies as illustrated in the table below, with all other variables held constant, would decrease increase profit after taxation and equity as follows: 2013 2012 US$M US$M Profit after Profit after Currency movement taxation Equity taxation Equity 1 cent movement in Australian dollar 31 31 38 37 0.2 rand movement in South African rand 2 4 2 6 1 pence movement in UK pound sterling 1 The Groups financial asset and liability profile may not remain constant, and therefore these sensitivities should be used with care.
Transactional exposure in respect of non-functional currency expenditure and revenues Certain operating and capital expenditure is incurred by some operations in currencies other than their functional currency.
To a lesser extent, certain sales revenue is earned in currencies other than the functional currency of operations, and certain exchange control restrictions may require that funds be maintained in currencies other than the functional currency of the operation.
These currency risks are managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.
When required under this strategy the Group enters into forward exchange contracts.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding to manage short-term foreign currency cash flows relating to operating activities is an asset of US$1 million and a liability of US$1 million 2012: an asset of US$14 million and a liability of US$6 million.
Commodity price risk Contracts for the sale and physical delivery of commodities are executed whenever possible on a pricing basis intended to achieve a relevant index target.
Where pricing terms deviate from the index, derivative commodity contracts may be used when available to return realised prices to the index.
Contracts for the physical delivery of commodities are not typically financial instruments and are carried in the balance sheet at cost typically at nil : they are therefore excluded from the fair value and sensitivity tables below.
Accordingly, the financial instrument exposures set out in the tables below do not represent all of the commodity price risks managed according to the Groups objectives.
Movements in the fair value of contracts included in the tables below are offset by movements in the fair value of the physical contracts, however only the former movement is recognised in the Groups income statement prior to settlement.
The risk associated with commodity prices is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.
Financial instruments with commodity price risk included in the following tables are those entered into for the following activities: economic hedging of prices realised on commodity contracts as described above: purchases and sales of physical contracts that can be cash-settled: derivatives embedded within other supply contracts.
All such instruments are carried in the balance sheet at fair value.

Provisional pricing mechanisms embedded within these sales arrangements have the character of a commodity derivative and are carried at fair value as part of trade receivables.
The Groups exposure at 30 June 2013 to the impact of movements in commodity prices upon provisionally invoiced sales volumes is set out in the following table.
2013 2012 Impact on equity Impact on equity and profit after and profit after taxation of 10% taxation of 10% Net exposure increase in Net exposure increase in deliver market price deliver market price Units of exposure receive US$M receive US$M Copper Tonnes 000s 284 135 279 150 The sensitivities in the above tables have been determined as the absolute impact on fair value of a 10 per cent increase in commodity prices at each reporting date, while holding all other variables, including foreign currency and exchange rates, constant.
The relationship between commodity prices and foreign currencies is complex and movements in foreign exchange rates can impact commodity prices.
The sensitivities should therefore be used with care.
Liquidity risk The Groups liquidity risk arises from the possibility that it may not be able to settle or meet its obligations as they fall due and is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.
Operational, capital and regulatory requirements are considered in the management of liquidity risk, in conjunction with shortand long-term forecast information.
Additional liquidity risk arises on debt related derivatives due to the possibility that a market for derivatives might not exist in some circumstances.
To counter this risk the Group only uses derivatives in highly liquid markets.
During the year ended 30 June 2013, Moodys Investors Service made no change to the Groups long-term credit rating of A1 the short-term credit rating is P-1.
Standard & Poors made no change to the Groups long-term credit rating of A the short-term credit rating is A-1.
On 21 August 2013, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the Groups long-term credit rating of A1 the short-term credit rating is P-1.
Standard & Poors are currently conducting their annual review of the Groups long-term credit rating of A the short-term credit rating is A-1.
The Groups strong credit profile, diversified funding sources and committed credit facilities ensure that sufficient liquid funds are maintained to meet its daily cash requirements.
The Groups policy on counterparty credit exposure ensures that only counterparties of a high credit standing are used for the investment of any excess cash.

248 | BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2013 7 8 9 10 11 Directors Report Legal proceedings Financial Statements Glossary Shareholder information 29 Financial risk management continued Credit risk Credit risk arises from the non-performance by counterparties of their contractual financial obligations towards the Group.
To manage credit risk the Group maintains Group-wide procedures covering the application for credit approvals, granting and renewal of counterparty limits and daily monitoring of exposures against these limits.
As part of these processes the financial viability of all counterparties is regularly monitored and assessed.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the total carrying value of relevant financial assets on the balance sheet as at the reporting date.
The Groups credit risk exposures are categorised under the following headings: Counterparties The Group conducts transactions with the following major types of counterparties: Receivables counterparties Approximately half of sales to the Groups customers are made on open terms.
Payment guarantee counterparties Approximately half of sales to the Groups customers occur via secured payment mechanisms.
Derivative counterparties Counterparties to derivative contracts consist of a diverse number of financial institutions and industrial counterparties in the relevant markets.
Cash investment counterparties As part of managing cash flow and liquidity, the Group holds short-term cash investments with a range of approved financial institutions.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk with any single counterparty or group of counterparties.
Geographic The Group trades in all major geographic regions.
Countries in which the Group has a significant credit risk exposure include South Africa, Australia, the United States, Japan and China.
Where appropriate, secured payment mechanisms and other risk mitigation instruments are used to protect revenues from credit risk losses.
Industry In line with our asset portfolio, the Group sells into a diverse range of industries and customer sectors.
This diversity means that the Group is not materially exposed to any individual industry or customer.
The following table shows the Groups receivables at the reporting date that are exposed to credit risk and the ageing and impairment profile thereon.

These terms and conditions are determined on a case-by-case basis with reference to the customers credit quality and prevailing market conditions.
Receivables that are classified as past due in the above tables are those that have not been settled within the terms and conditions that have been agreed with that customer.
For an analysis of movements in impaired trade receivables, refer to note 10 Trade and other receivables.
The credit quality of the Groups customers is monitored on an ongoing basis and assessed for impairment where indicators of such impairment exist.
The solvency of each debtor and their ability to repay the receivable is considered in assessing receivables for impairment.
In certain circumstances the Group may seek collateral as security for the receivable.
Where receivables have been impaired, the Group actively seeks to recover the amounts in question and enforce compliance with credit terms.
No other financial assets were past due or impaired at 30 June 2013 30 June 2012: nil.
BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2013 | 249 9.1 Consolidated Financial Statements continued 29 Financial risk management continued Fair values All financial assets and financial liabilities, other than derivatives, are initially recognised at the fair value of consideration paid or received, net of transaction costs as appropriate, and subsequently carried at fair value or amortised cost, as indicated in the tables below.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The financial assets and liabilities are presented by class in the tables below at their carrying values, which generally approximate to the fair values.

BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2013 | 251 9.1 Consolidated Financial Statements continued 29 Financial risk management continued Valuation hierarchy The carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value is principally calculated with reference to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Where no price information is available from a quoted market source, alternative market mechanisms or recent comparable transactions, fair value is estimated based on the Groups views on relevant future prices, net of valuation allowances to accommodate liquidity, modelling and other risks implicit in such estimates.
Movements in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities may be recognised through the income statement or in other comprehensive income.

The Group will invest capital in assets where they fit our strategy.
The Groups priorities for cash flow are: reinvestment in projects that carry attractive rates of return regardless of the economic climate: commitment to a solid A credit rating: and returning excess capital to shareholders firstly with its progressive dividends policy and thereafter via capital management initiatives for example share buy-backs.
Further information relevant to the actions and outcomes of the Groups capital management strategy is contained in section 9.1.
4 Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, note 9 Dividends, note 19 Share capital and note 20 Other equity.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, being the ratio of net debt to net debt plus net assets.

Post-retirement mortality assumptions in the Americas, Europe and South Africa are based on post-retirement mortality tables that are standard in these regions.
For the main funds, these tables imply the following expected future lifetimes in years for employees aged 65 as at the balance sheet date: US males 19.8 2012: 19.8, US females 21.6 2012: 21.6 : Canadian males 19.8 2012: 19.7, Canadian females 22.2 2012: 22.1 : Netherlands males 22.2 2012: 21.5, Netherlands females 24.0 2012: 24.0 : UK males 23.6 2012: 23.3, UK females 26.2 2012: 25.7 : South African males 19.0 2012: 18.8, South African females 23.4 2012: 23.3.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is the weighted average of the expected rate of return on each applicable asset class and reflects the long-term target asset allocation as at the reporting date.

ended 30 June 2013: the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, Group Incentive Scheme GIS, Management Award Plan MAP and Group Short Term Incentive Plan GSTIP.
These awards take the form of Performance Shares, Deferred Shares and or Options, and Restricted Shares in either BHP Billiton Limited or BHP Billiton Plc.
Awards made are subject to performance hurdles LTIP and service conditions all plans.
Subject to the performance conditions and service conditions being met and the extent to which they are met, the awards will vest and the participant will become entitled to the appropriate number of ordinary shares or, if relevant, entitled to exercise options over the relevant number of ordinary shares.
Awards under the plans do not confer any rights to participate in a share issue: however, there is discretion under each of the plans to adjust the awards in response to a variation of BHP Billitons share capital.
A description of the plans follows: i GIS and GSTIP The GIS awards are split equally between a cash award being a percentage of base salary and a grant of Deferred Shares and or Options.
The GSTIP is a replacement plan to the GIS for certain employees below the GMC and was first introduced during the year ended 30 June 2009.
Awards are split equally between a cash award being a percentage of base salary and a grant of Deferred Shares and or Options.
Deferred Shares and or Options are subject to a two-year vesting period before they can be exercised.
If, during that period, an individual resigns without the Remuneration Committees consent, or is dismissed for cause, their entitlement is forfeited.
Deferred Shares and or Options in respect of the year ended 30 June 2013 will be awarded during the year ending 30 June 2014.
270 | BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2013 7 8 9 10 11 Directors Report Legal proceedings Financial Statements Glossary Shareholder information 33 Employee share ownership plans continued ii LTIP and MAP The LTIP awards are in the form of Performance Shares, and are awarded annually.
The performance hurdle applicable to the awards granted requires the Groups Total Shareholder Return TSR over a five-year performance period to be greater than a combination of the weighted average TSR of a peer group of companies and of the Morgan Stanley Capital Index World.
To the extent that the performance hurdle is not achieved, awards are forfeited.
For all Performance Shares to vest, the Groups TSR must exceed the weighted average TSR of the Index by a specified percentage, determined each year by the Remuneration Committee.
Since the establishment of the LTIP in 2004, this percentage has been set each year at 5.5 per cent.
For performance between the weighted average TSR of the Index and 5.5 per cent per annum above the Index, vesting occurs on a sliding scale.
The MAP is a replacement plan to the LTIP for employees below the GMC.
Under the MAP participants receive an Award of Restricted Shares, the number of which is determined by role, performance and organisational level.
There are no performance conditions attached to the Award and all the shares that have been granted will vest at the end of three years providing participants remain in employment over that time.
iii Transitional GMC Grants These awards have two tranches.
Tranche one has a three-year service and performance condition and may vest in 2015.
Tranche two has a four-year service and performance condition and may vest in 2016.
The Remuneration Committee has absolute discretion to determine if the performance condition has been met and whether any, all or some of the Restricted Shares will vest or otherwise lapse, having regard to but not limited to BHP Billitons Total Shareholder Return over the threeor four-year performance period respectively, the participants contribution to Group outcomes and the participants personal performance with guidance on this assessment from the CEO.
No Dividend Equivalent Payment is payable on these awards.
All awards issued prior to 1 July 2011 are eligible to receive a payment equal to the dividend amount that would have been earned on the underlying shares represented by the Deferred Shares, Options, Restricted Shares and Performance Shares awarded to those participants the Dividend Equivalent Payment.
The Dividend Equivalent Payment is made to the participants once the underlying ordinary shares are issued or transferred to them.
No Dividend Equivalent Payment is made in respect of Deferred Shares, Options, Restricted Shares and Performance Shares that lapse.
Awards issued after 1 July 2011 under the GSTIP and MAP plans are no longer eligible to receive the Dividend Equivalent Payment.
b Shareplus, an all-employee share purchase plan, commenced in April 2007.
Employees may contribute up to US$5,000 to acquire shares Acquired Shares in any Plan year.
On the third anniversary of the start of a Plan year, the Company will match the number of Acquired Shares held by the employee at that time with Matched Shares.
The employees have no beneficial entitlement to the Matched Shares until they are awarded.
Acquired Shares are purchased on a quarterly basis.
Employees can sell their Acquired Shares at any time.
If, prior to the third anniversary, an individual sells their Acquired Shares, resigns without the Remuneration Committees consent or is dismissed for cause, their entitlement to Matched Shares is forfeited.
c The fair value of awards as presented in the tables above represents the fair value at grant date.
The fair values of awards granted were estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation methodology, Black-Scholes option pricing technique and net present value technique.
d The risk-free interest rate used is an applicable government bond rate.
e Historical volatility has been used to estimate the volatility of the share price.

BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2013 | 285 9.7 Supplementary oil and gas information unaudited continued Standardised measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves Standardised measure The purpose of this disclosure is to provide data with respect to the estimated future net cash flows from future production of proved developed and undeveloped reserves of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas.
The Standardised measure is based on the Groups estimated proved reserves as presented in section 2.13.1 Petroleum reserves and this data should be read in conjunction with that disclosure, which is hereby incorporated by reference into this section.
The Standardised measure is prepared on a basis which presumes that year-end economic and operating conditions will continue over the periods in which year-end proved reserves would be produced.
The effects of future inflation, future changes in exchange rates, expected future changes in technology, taxes, operating practices and any regulatory changes have not been included.
The Standardised measure is prepared by projecting the estimated future annual production of proved reserves owned at period end and pricing that future production to derive future cash inflows.
Estimates of future cash flows for 2013, 2012 and 2011 are computed using the average  price during the 12-month period.
Future price increases for all periods presented are considered only to the extent that they are provided by fixed and determinable contractual arrangements in effect at year-end and are not dependent upon future inflation or exchange rate changes.
Future cash inflows for all periods presented are then reduced by future costs of producing and developing the year-end proved reserves based on costs in effect at year-end without regard to future inflation or changes in technology or operating practices.
Future development costs include the costs of drilling and equipping development wells and construction of platforms and production facilities to gain access to proved reserves owned at year-end.
They also include future costs, net of residual salvage value, associated with the abandonment of wells, dismantling of production platforms and rehabilitation of drilling sites.
Future cash inflows are further reduced by future income taxes based on tax rates in effect at year-end and after considering the future deductions and credits applicable to proved properties owned at year-end.
The resultant annual future net cash flows after deductions of operating costs including resource rent taxes, development costs and income taxes are discounted at 10 per cent per annum to derive the Standardised measure.
There are many important variables, assumptions and imprecisions inherent in developing the Standardised measure, the most important of which are the level of proved reserves and the rate of production thereof.
The Standardised measure is not an estimate of the fair market value of the Groups oil and gas reserves.
An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves, anticipated future changes in prices, costs and exchange rates, anticipated future changes in secondary tax and income tax rates and alternative discount factors representing the time value of money and adjustments for risks inherent in producing oil and gas.
Comparative information has been reclassified accordingly.
b Other is comprised of Algeria, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, and the United Kingdom.

The number of wells drilled refers to the number of wells completed at any time during the respective year, regardless of when drilling was initiated.
Completion refers to the installation of permanent equipment for production of oil or gas, or, in the case of a dry well, to reporting to the appropriate authority that the well has been abandoned.
An exploratory well is a well drilled to find oil or gas in a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or gas in another reservoir.
A development well is a well drilled within the limits of a known oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.
A productive well is an exploratory, development or extension well that is not a dry well.
A dry well hole is an exploratory, development, or extension well that proves to be incapable of producing either oil or gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or gas well.
Oil and gas properties, wells, operations, and acreage The following tables show the number of gross and net productive crude oil and natural gas wells and total gross and net developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas acreage as at 30 June 2013.
A gross well or acre is one in which a working interest is owned, while a net well or acre exists when the sum of fractional working interests owned in gross wells or acres equals one.
Productive wells are producing wells and wells mechanically capable of production.
Developed acreage is comprised of leased acres that are within an area by or assignable to a productive well.
Undeveloped acreage is comprised of leased acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic quantities of oil and gas, regardless of whether such acres contain proved reserves.
The number of productive crude oil and natural gas wells in which we held an interest at 30 June 2013 was as follows: Crude Oil Wells Natural Gas Wells Total Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Australia 353 174 119 43 472 217 United States 124 62 7,154 2,275 7,278 2,337 a Other 72 30 59 13 131 43 Total 549 266 7,332 2,331 7,881 2,597 a Other is primarily comprised of Algeria, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, and the United Kingdom.
