This decrease has been consistent during the past 12-month period, which is considered to be prolonged: therefore, an impairment of US$2.1 million, of the US$64.2 million fair value change, was recognised as other expenses, in the income statement.
The fair value of the available-for-sale financial assets is determined by reference to published price quotations in an active market.
