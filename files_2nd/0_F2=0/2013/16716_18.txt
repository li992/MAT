The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 30 September 2013 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
These consolidated financial statements have been approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 9 December 2013.
Basis of preparation Both the consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU endorsed IFRS and on the historical cost basis except that derivative financial instruments are measured at their fair value.
The Groups business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 4 to 36.
In addition, note 13 on financial risk management details the Groups exposure to a variety of financial risks, including currency and credit risk.
The Group has significant positive cash balances and has a committed bank facility of 40m which expires in 2017.
This facility was undrawn at 30 September 2013 and remained undrawn at 9 December 2013 when these consolidated financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors.
The Directors have performed a robust assessment, including review of the budget for the year ending September 2014 and longer-term plans including consideration of the principal risks faced by the Company, as detailed on pages 21 and 22.
Following this review the Directors are satisfied that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue to operate for the foreseeable future.
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis for preparing the financial statements.
Details of the Groups policy onliquidity risk and capital management areincluded in note 13 to the financialstatements.
On publishing the Company financial statements here together with the consolidated financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of section408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form part of the approved financial statements.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with endorsed IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates andassociated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Details of significant estimates and assumptions are set out in note 20.
The accounting policies set out in these notes have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
The accounting policies have been consistently applied by Group entities.
A number of new standards and amendments to existing standards were effective for the financial year ended 30 September 2013.
None ofthese have had a material impact.
A number of standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued and endorsed by the EU but are not yet effective and accordingly the Group has not yet adopted.
The cumulative impact of the adoption of these standards is not expected to be significant.
Effective for the Groups financial year ending 30 September 2014: amendments to IAS 12 Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets: IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement: and amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
Effective for the Groups financial year ending 30 September 2015: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities: IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements: and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: improvements to IFRSs 2011: IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment: IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentations: and IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting.

Income tax expense Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to theextent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income or equity as appropriate.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balancesheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries except to the extent that they will probably reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount ofdeferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset canbe utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

Property, plant and equipment Owned assets All owned items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment.
The cost of self constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful economic lives as follows: Buildings 3050 years Plant and machinery 1030 years Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 510 years Computers and motor vehicles 35 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed annually for continued appropriateness and indications of impairment, and adjustedif appropriate.
Depreciation on assets classified as in the course of construction commences when the assets are ready for their intended use, the point ofwhich they are reclassified from assets under construction, on the same basis as other assets of that class.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount.
These are included in the income statement.

Intangible assets Goodwill m Cost At 1 October 2011, 30 September 2012 and 30 September 2013 10.1 Amortisation At 1 October 2011, 30 September 2012 and 30 September 2013 Carrying amounts At 1 October 2011, 30 September 2012 and 30 September 2013 10.1 Goodwill Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
Anyimpairment provisions that arose during impairment testing would not be reversed.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 October 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the net amount recorded previously under UK GAAP.
In prior years the amortisation element of the deemed cost at 30 September 2004 was shown separately, inthe current year this has been deducted from gross cost.
In respect of acquisitions that have occurred since 1 October 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment by reference to the estimated future cash flows of the relevant cash-generating unit CGU, discounted to their present value using risk adjusted discount factors to give its value in use.
A CGU is the smallest identifiable asset group that generates cash flows that are largely independent from other assets and groups.
Impairment losses are recognised if the carrying amount of the CGU to which goodwill has been allocated exceeds its value in use and are recognised in the income statement.
Goodwill comprises 10.1m in Victrex Polymer Solutions.
The goodwill is measured against the discounted future cash flow projections of ourVictrex Polymer Solutions business unit.
The long-term average growth rate used was 2.5% 2012: 2.5% and the risk adjusted pre-tax discount rate was 8.0% 2012: 6.0%.
The impairment test results in more than 100% headroom and so it is unlikely that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would result in an impairment of goodwill.
Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, isrecognised within the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred unless it meets all the criteria to be capitalised under IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
Research and development expenditure of 14.6m 2012: 13.1m was expensed to the income statement in the year within administrative expenses.
Investments Investments In the Companys financial statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any impairment in the value of the investment.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered in assessing control.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated inpreparing the consolidated financial statements.

Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in, first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.
The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads allocated based on normal operating capacity.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.

Financial risk management Group Currency risk Currency risk is managed by the Currency Committee, the membership and operations of which are described on page 43.
The Group currently exports 97% of sales from the UK and also makes raw material purchases overseas.
In addition, the Group includes a number offoreign subsidiaries.
As a result of these factors, the Groups financial statements are exposed to currency fluctuations.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US Dollar, Euro and Yen.
The Groups hedging policy is described on page 43.
The impact of a 5% movement in the average Sterling US Dollar, Sterling Euro and Sterling Yen rates on profit for 2013 is 4.2m, 3.8m and0.7m respectively 2012: 4.5m, 3.5m and 0.9m.
The impact of a 5% movement in the average Sterling US Dollar, Sterling Euro andSterling Yen rates on equity for 2013 is 1.8m, 0.6m and 0.4m 2012: 1.8m, 0.4m and 0.5m respectively.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risks.
In accordance with its treasury policy, theGroup does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivatives are recognised at fair value.
The method of recognising any gain or loss on remeasurement of fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
At the inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.
For derivatives not used in hedging transactions, the gain or loss on remeasurement of fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Cash flow hedges The Group hedges a proportion of forecast sales, purchases and capital expenditure, denominated in a foreign currency.
The Board is responsible for setting the hedging policy which is detailed on page 43.
Most of the forward exchange contracts have maturities of less thanone year after the balance sheet date.
The Group buys or sells foreign currency at spot where necessary to address any short-term imbalances.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts, hedging forecast transactions, as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective portion of changes in fair value is recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time is recognised in the income statement when the forecast transaction occurs.
When a forecast transaction isno longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.

These are categorised as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.
The following table indicates the periods in which cash flows associated with the maturity date of the forward foreign exchange contracts forwhich hedge accounting is applied are expected to occur: As at 30 September 2013 As at 30 September 2012 Expected 6 months 6 to 12 12 to 18 Expected 6 months 6 to 12 12 to 18 cash flows or less months months cash flows or less months months m m m m m m m m Forward exchange contracts: Assets 134.9 64.2 64.4 6.3 124.2 75.7 48.5 Liabilities 12.3 8.3 4.0 21.3 2.3 17.3 6.3 147.2 72.5 68.4 6.3 145.5 73.4 65.8 6.3 Gains and losses deferred in the hedging reserve in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts at 30 September 2013 will be recognised inthe income statement during the period in which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement.
At 30 September 2013, there are a number of hedged foreign currency transactions which are expected to occur at various dates during the next 12 months.
During the year, gains of 0.5m 2012: 0.9m relating to forward exchange contracts on the balance sheet at 30 September 2013 were released tothe income statement.
Credit risk The Group manages exposure to credit risk at many levels ranging from Board approval being required for the credit limits of larger customers, to the use of letters of credit and cash in advance where appropriate.
Internal procedures require regular due consideration ofcredit ratings, payment history, aged items and proactive debt collection.
All customers are assigned a credit limit which is subject toannual review.
Trade receivables can be analysed as follows: 2013 2012 As at 30 September m m Amounts neither past due nor impaired 17.9 18.3 Amounts past due but not impaired: Less than 30 days 3.0 3.1 3060 days 0.4 0.5 More than 60 days 0.2 1.2 Total past due but not impaired 3.6 4.8 Amounts impaired 0.6 0.7 Impairment allowances 0.6 0.7 Carrying amount of impaired receivables Trade receivables net of allowances 21.5 23.1 Trade receivables are considered to be impaired when the amount is in dispute, customers are believed to be in financial difficulty or if any other reason exists which implies that there is a doubt over the recoverability of the debt.
No provision has been made in respect of the amounts shown as past due but not impaired as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable in full.

Financial risk management continued Credit risk continued Movements in the allowance for impairments were: 2013 2012 m m At beginning of year 0.7 0.3 Charge in the year 0.4 Release of allowance 0.1 At end of year 0.6 0.7 The credit risk in respect of cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties with significant balances are established, international banks whose credit ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances, call deposits and other short-term deposits with original maturities typically of three months or less.
As at 30 September 2013, the maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits was 26.1m 2012: 43.1m for the Group.
As at 30September 2013, the largest mark to market exposure for gains on forward foreign exchange contracts to a single bank was 2.7m 2012: 1.5m.
The amounts on deposit at the year end represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk on cash and deposits.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective in terms of funding capacity is to ensure that it always has sufficient short-term and long-term funding available, either in the form of the Groups cash resources or committed bank facilities.
The Group has sufficient funds available in order to meet its current funding requirements for both revenue and capital expenditure.
In order to further manage liquidity risk to an acceptable level, the Group has acommitted bank facility of 40m, all of which was undrawn at the year end.
This facility expires in September 2017.
As at 30 September 2013 the Group had a cash and cash equivalents balance of 91.6m.
Price risk The Groups products contain a number of key raw materials and its operations require energy, notably electricity and natural gas.
Any increase or volatility in prices and any significant decrease in the availability of raw materials or energy could affect the Groups results.
Victrex strives to obtain the best prices and uses contractual means to benefit where appropriate and possible.
The Group has a significant degree ofcontrol over its supply chain which enables it to effectively manage the risk in this area.
Capital management The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Groups total equity.
The Groups policy for managing capital is to maintain a strong balance sheet with the objective of maintaining customer, supplier and investor confidence in the business and to ensure that the Group hassufficient resources to be able to invest in future development and growth of the business.
The Board does not expect to make significant share repurchases in 2014, although there is a resolution proposed at each Annual General Meeting AGM to authorise the Company to make one or more market purchases of its ordinary shares up to a maximum number of shares equal to 10% of its issued ordinary share capital as at the date of the AGM notice.
The Groups capital and equity ratio is as follows: 2013 2012 As at 30 September m m Total equity 313.7 271.1 Total assets 367.6 325.7 Equity ratio 85% 83% www.

For trade and other payables there are no amounts due after one year, the majority falling due in 30 days or less.
Company The only trade receivables of the Company are amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings.
As a result of US Dollar denominated intragroup loans with subsidiary undertakings, the Company is exposed to currency fluctuations.
TheCompany does not actively manage the risk of exchange rate movements given that the counterparty to the loans is a subsidiary of the Company and therefore any gains or losses would be eliminated at Group level.
The impact of a 5% movement in the average Sterling US Dollar rate on these loans is 1.0m.
These intragroup loans are financial assets designated as loans and receivables.
As at 30 September 2013 the Company has intragroup loans outstanding totalling 19.9m 2012: 20.0m.

Retirement benefit obligations Employee benefits Defined contribution pension schemes Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit pension schemes The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension schemes recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the future benefits that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods less the fair value of plan assets, together withadjustments for past service costs not yet recognised.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the total of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
In order to calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any minimum funding requirements that apply.
An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the plan or on settlement of the plan liabilities.
When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised in the profit or loss on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
To the extent that the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised in profit or loss.
Victrex has decided to take advantage of the option under IAS 19 Employee Benefits to recognise actuarial gains and losses through the statement of comprehensive income as opposed to the income statement.
Ongoing actuarial gains and losses are immediately recognised in full through the statement of comprehensive income.
The Group operates a number of pension schemes for its employees throughout the world.
The majority of schemes outside the UK are defined contribution.
The principal scheme operated by the Group is a funded UK pension scheme in which certain employees of subsidiary undertakings participate.
The scheme has two sections.
One section provides benefits on a defined benefit basis with benefits related to final pensionable pay.
The defined benefit section was closed to new members from 31 December 2001.
From this date new employees have been invited tojoin the second section that provides benefits on a defined contribution basis.

The expected return on assets in 2012 of 5.64% per annum was derived from assumed returns of 7.5% per annum from equity assets, 3.8% per annum from gilts, 5.3% per annum from bonds and 0.5% per annum from cash, applied to the proportion of each asset class held by the scheme as at 30 September.

Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate, inflation rate and expected salary increase.
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period assuming that all other assumptions are held constant: Increase in fund deficit Change in assumption as at 30 September 2013 Reduce discount rate by 1% p. a.
12.4m Increase inflation expectations by 1% p. a.
10.3m Increase salary inflation by 1% p. a.
2.8m In reality one might expect interrelationships between the assumptions, especially between discount rate and expected salary increases that both depend to a certain extent on expected inflation rates.
The above analysis does not take the effect of these interrelationships into account.

Share-based payments All options are settled by the physical delivery of shares.
The terms and conditions of all the grants are as follows: Victrex 2005 Executive Share Option Plan ESOP All employees are eligible to participate.
The Remuneration Committee currently excludes executive Directors from participating in this plan.
Option awards are based on a percentage of basic salary, not exceeding 100% of salary.
The exercise price of the options is equal to the market price of the shares on the date of grant.
ESOP options are conditional on the employee completing three years service the vesting period.
These options are exercisable starting three years from date of grant.
The level of awards vesting will vary depending on EPS growth.
In order for awards to vest the Group must achieve EPS growth exceeding the Retail Prices Index by an average of at least 2%, 3% and 4% per annum, over the three year vesting period, for awards up to 33%, from 33% to 66% and from 66% to 100% of salary respectively.
Straight line vesting will occur to the extent that EPS growth falls between these average annual EPS growth targets.
These options have amaximum term of ten years.
Victrex 2005 Sharesave Plan UK resident employees and full-time Directors of the Company or any designated participating subsidiary are eligible to participate.
The exercise price of the granted Sharesave Plan options is equal to the market price of the ordinary shares less 20% on the date of grant.
Victrex 2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan US based employees including executive Directors are eligible to participate.
The price payable for each ordinary share shall be a price determined by the Board, provided that it shall not be less than 85% of the lower of the market value of an ordinary share on the date ofgrant or the date of purchase.
Awards may be granted over a number of ordinary shares determined by the amount employees have saved by the end of a one year savings period.
Victrex 1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan 1999 LTIP The 1999 LTIP came to the end of its ten year life in 2009.
Each year executive Directors were eligible to be awarded options to acquire, at no cost, market purchased ordinary shares in the Company up to a maximum equivalent of 100% of basic salary.
The awards have normally become exercisable between the fifth and tenth anniversaries of the grant date, subject to continued employment and the Groups performance over the three year period commencing at the start of the financial year in which the grant is made.
The extent to which an award has been exercisable is dependent on two independent performance conditions with 50% determined by reference to the Companys total shareholder return TSR and 50% determined by reference to the Groups earnings per share EPS : the TSR element of an award will vest in full if the TSR ranks in the upper quartile, as measured over the three year period, relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index, excluding investment trusts, at the beginning of that period.
This element of the award is reduced to 12.5% on a pro-rata basis for median performance and is reduced to nil for below median performance.
Notwithstanding these provisions, no shares will vest under this performance condition unless, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group over the relevant performance period: and the EPS element of an award will vest in full if EPS growth exceeds inflation, as measured by the Retail Prices Index, by an average of 12% per annum or more over the three year period.
This element of the award is reduced to 10% on a pro-rata basis if EPS growth exceeds inflation by an average of 5% per annum over the period and is reduced to nil if EPS growth fails to exceed inflation by 5% per annum.
Victrex 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan 2009 LTIP The 2009 LTIP was approved by shareholders at the 2009 AGM and replaced the 1999 LTIP.
Each year executive Directors, and senior executives by invitation, are eligible to be awarded options to acquire, at no cost, market purchased ordinary shares in the Company up to a maximum equivalent of 150% of basic salary.
In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment or retention, this limit is increased to 200% of an employees annual basic salary.
Details of the 2009 LTIP can be found within the Directors Remuneration Report on page 54. www.

Share-based payment transactions are recharged from the Company to those subsidiaries benefiting from the service of the employees to whom options are granted.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest and include employee service periods and performance targets which are not related to the Companys share price, such as earnings per share growth.
The fair value of the options is measured by the Stochastic model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
At each balance sheet date the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that areexpected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement and acorresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
Any failure to meet market conditions, which includes performance targets such as share price or total shareholder return, would not result ina reversal of original estimates in the income statement.
The proceeds received, net of any directly attributable costs, are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
The Group and Company provide finance to the ESOT to purchase Company shares in the open market.
Costs of running the ESOT are charged to the income statement.
The cost of shares held by the ESOT are deducted in arriving at equity until they are exercised by employees.
All share-based payment costs are recharged to the trading entities.

Details of Directors remuneration, including non-cash benefits and contributions to post-employment defined benefit plans, are given in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 48 to 61.

Details of Directors indemnities are given on page 63.
Critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The following are the critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty that the Directors have made in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Management has discussed these with the Audit Committee.
These should be read in conjunction with the significant accounting policies provided in the notes to the financial statements.
Inventory valuation The valuation of inventory includes the absorption of directly attributable costs over a normal level of production.
Judgement is used both inidentification of directly attributable costs and normal production.
Management use their detailed experience in this process.
Inventory provisions are put in place where cost is considered to be higher than net realisable value, the latter being a judgement based on ageing, customer order profiles, scrap values and the option to re-process.
Pension scheme The valuation of pension scheme liabilities is calculated in accordance with Group policy.
The valuation is prepared by independent qualified actuaries but significant judgements are required in relation to the assumptions for future salary and pension increases, inflation, the discount rate applied, investment returns and member longevity which underpin the valuations.
Note 14 contains information about the assumptions relating to retirement benefit obligations.
Property, plant and equipment In relation to the Companys property, plant and equipment, useful economic lives and residual values of assets have been established using historical experience and an assessment of the nature of the assets involved.
Assets are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine whether circumstances exist that could lead to a change in the useful economic life or a potential impairment of the carrying value of such assets.
Historically, changes in carrying value, useful lives or residual values have not resulted in material changes to either the carrying value of theGroups assets or the annual depreciated expense.
Tax provisioning The Group operates in a number of geographies and different tax jurisdictions.
There is an inherent uncertainty in some of these jurisdictions requiring judgement at period ends over the amount of taxation payable.
Management use their experience of each geography along with that of their advisors in estimating the tax charge for the period.
Research and development expenditure The Group incurs significant expenditure on research and development, both in respect of internal process improvement and product and application development.
IAS 38 Intangible Assets sets out strict criteria in respect of capitalising development costs which require an element of judgement to assess if these have been made.
The nature of our business is such that new products and applications often need to go through lengthy client testing and regulatory approval, the success of which is inherently uncertain and therefore predicting the outcome requires a significant level of judgement.
Assuch until these phases are complete the expenditure is not considered to meet the IAS 38 criteria, by which point the significant majority of development expenditure has been incurred.
Accordingly no development expenditure hasbeen capitalised in the current or prior years.
