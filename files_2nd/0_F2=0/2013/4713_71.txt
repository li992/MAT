Financial instruments and risk management Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price movements that arise in the normal course of the groups business.
The groups funding, liquidity and exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risks are managed by the groups treasury department.
The treasury department uses a range of financial instruments to manage these underlying risks.
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of board-approved policies and guidelines, which are recommended and subsequently monitored by the finance committee.
This committee is described in the Corporate governance report.
The policies and guidelines include benchmark exposure and or hedge cover levels for key areas of treasury risk.
The benchmarks, hedge cover levels and overall appropriateness of Diageos risk management policies are reviewed by the board following, for example, significant business, strategic or accounting changes.
The framework provides for limited defined levels of flexibility in execution to allow for the optimal application of the board-approved strategies.
Transactions arising on the application of this flexibility may give rise to exposures different from the defined benchmark levels that are separately monitored on a daily basis using Value at Risk analysis.
These transactions are carried at fair value and gains or losses are taken to the income statement as they arise.
In the year ended 30 June 2013 gains and losses on these transactions were not material.
The group purchases insurance for commercial or, where required, for legal or contractual reasons.
In addition, the group retains insurable risk where external insurance is not considered an economic means of mitigating these risks.
The finance committee receives monthly reports on the activities of the treasury department, including any exposures different from the defined benchmarks.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 161 Financial 19.
Financial instruments and risk management continued statements a Currency risk 125 The group presents its consolidated financial statements in sterling and conducts business in many foreign currencies.
As a result, it is Auditors report in respect of the Group subject to foreign currency risk due to exchange rate movements, which will affect the groups transactions and the translation of the 126 results and underlying net assets of its foreign operations.
To manage the foreign currency risk the group uses certain financial Consolidated instruments.
Where hedge accounting is applied, hedges are documented and tested for effectiveness on an ongoing basis.
Diageo income statement expects hedges entered into to continue to be effective and therefore does not expect the impact of ineffectiveness on the 127 consolidated income statement to be material.
Consolidated statement of Hedge of net investment in foreign operations comprehensive income The group hedges a substantial portion of its exposure to fluctuations in the sterling value of its foreign operations by designating net borrowings held in foreign currencies andusing foreign currency spots, forwards, swaps and other financial derivatives.
The groups 128 Consolidated policy is to maintain total net investment Value at Risk below 1 billion with additional limits for individual currencies, where Value at Risk balance sheet is defined as the maximum amount of loss not exceeded over a one year period with a 95% probability confidence level.
129 Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of foreign currency borrowings including foreign currency forwards, swaps and Consolidated other financial derivatives, to the extent that they are in an effective hedge relationship, are recognised in other comprehensive income statement of to offset exchange differences on net investments in foreign operations.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings not in a changes in equity hedge relationship and any ineffectiveness are taken to the income statement.
130 Consolidated statement of Transaction exposure hedging cash flows The groups policy is to hedge up to 24 months forecasted transactional foreign currency risk in the three major currency pairs US dollar sterling, euro sterling and euro US dollar targeting 75% coverage of the current financial year and up to 18 months for other 131 Accounting policies currency pairs.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and recycled into of the group the income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the income statement.
Any ineffectiveness is 135 taken to the income statement.
Notes to the consolidated Hedge of foreign currency debt financial statements The group uses cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain foreign currency 183 denominated borrowings.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and Auditors report inrespect of recycled into the income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the income statement.
Any thecompany ineffectiveness is taken to the income statement.
184 Company b Interest rate risk balance sheet The group has an exposure to interest rate risk, arising principally on changes in US dollar, euro and sterling interest rates.
To manage 185 interest rate risk, the group manages its proportion of fixed to floating rate borrowings within limits approved by the board, primarily Accounting policies through issuing fixed and floating rate borrowing and commercial paper, and by utilising interest rate derivatives.
These practices aim to of the company minimise the groups net finance charges with acceptable year on year volatility.
To facilitate operational efficiency and effective hedge 187 accounting, the groups policy is to maintain fixed rate borrowings within a band of 40% to 60% of forecast net borrowings.
Due to the Notes to the company financial exceptionally low interest rate environment, the board has approved an exception to this policy, permitting fixed rate debt to reach up statements to 100% of forecast net debt.
For these calculations, net borrowings exclude interest rate related fair value adjustments.
The majority of Diageos existing interest rate derivatives are legacy fair value hedges that have locked in positive market values.
These instruments are 190 Principal group no longer involved in hedge relationships and the fair value change is recognised in the income statement which is partially offset by companies the net interest earned on these derivatives.
c Commodity price risk The group is exposed to commodity price risk.
Commodity price risk is managed in line with principles approved by the board either through long term purchase contracts with suppliers or, where appropriate, derivative contracts.
Commodity price risk exposure is normally hedged up to 18 months forecast volume usage with a target of 80% coverage.
Where derivative contracts are used the group manages exposures principally through exchange-traded futures, forwards, swaps and options.
d Market risk sensitivity analysis The group is using a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the estimated impacts on the consolidated income statement and other comprehensive income of either an instantaneous increase or decrease of 0.5% 50 basis points in market interest rates or a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling against all other currencies, from the rates applicable at 30 June 2013 and 30 June 2012, for each class of financial instruments with all other variables remaining constant.
The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of market risks on the net post employment benefit liability and corporate tax payable.
This analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice interest and foreign exchange rates rarely change in isolation.
162 Diageo Annual Report 2013 The sensitivity analysis is based on the following: Financial instruments are valued at the balance sheet date using discounted cash flow techniques.
Changes in interest rates affect the interest income or expense of variable interest financial instruments.
Changes in interest rates only affect interest income or expense in relation to financial instruments with fixed interest rates if these are recognised at fair value.
Changes in interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments.
Changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments and other financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using rates prevailing at the year end.
All interest rate, net investment and foreign currency cash flow hedges are expected to be highly effective.
The sensitivity analysis estimates the impact of changes in interest and foreign exchange rates.
Actual results in the future may differ from these results materially due to developments in the global financial markets which may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the table below, which therefore should not be considered as projections of likely future events, gains or losses.
Reasonably possible hypothetical changes in other risk variables would not significantly affect the fair value of financial instruments at 30 June 2013 and 30 June 2012.

ii Impact on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income includes the impact on the income statement.
The above analysis considers the impact of all financial instruments including financial derivatives, cash and cash equivalents, borrowings and other financial assets and liabilities.
e Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the group.
Credit risk arises from cash balances including bank deposits and cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and credit exposures to customers, including outstanding loans, trade and other receivables, financial guarantees and committed transactions.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the groups exposure to credit risk at the reporting date as disclosed in note 19 i, excluding the impact of any collateral held or other credit enhancements.
Credit risk is managed separately for financial and business related credit exposures.
Financial credit risk Diageo aims to minimise its financial credit risk through the application of risk management policies approved and monitored by the board.
Counterparties are limited to major banks and financial institutions, primarily with a long term credit rating within the A band or better, and the policy restricts the exposure to any one counterparty by setting credit limits taking into account the credit quality of the counterparty.
The groups policy is designed to ensure that individual counterparty limits are adhered to and that there are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The board also defines the types of financial instruments which may be transacted.
The credit risk arising through the use of financial instruments for currency and interest rate risk management is estimated with reference to the fair value of contracts with a positive value, rather than the notional amount of the instruments themselves.
When derivative transactions are undertaken with bank counterparties, the group may, where appropriate, enter into certain agreements with such bank counterparties whereby the parties agree to post cash collateral for the benefit of the other if the net valuations of the derivatives are above a pre-determined threshold.
Diageo annually reviews the credit limits applied and regularly monitors the counterparties credit quality reflecting market credit conditions.
Business related credit risk Loan, trade and other receivables exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the customer.
There is no concentration of credit risk with respect to loans, trade and other receivables as the group has a large number of customers which are internationally dispersed.

Financial instruments and risk management continued statements f Liquidity risk 125 Liquidity risk is the risk that Diageo may encounter difficulties in meeting its obligations associated with financial liabilities that are Auditors report in respect of the Group settled by delivering cash or other financial assets.
The groups policy with regard to the expected maturity profile of borrowings is to 126 limit the amount of such borrowings maturing within 12 months to 50% of gross borrowings less money market demand deposits, and Consolidated the level of commercial paper to 30% of gross borrowings less money market demand deposits.
In addition, it is group policy to income statement maintain backstop facilities with relationship banks to support commercial paper obligations.
127 The following tables provide an analysis of the anticipated contractual cash flows including interest payable for the groups Consolidated financial liabilities and derivative instruments on an undiscounted basis.
Where interest payments are on a floating rate basis, rates of statement of each cash flow until maturity of the instruments are calculated based on the forward yield curve prevailing at 30 June 2013 and 30 June comprehensive income 2012.
Cash flows are presented on a net or gross basis in accordance with the settlement arrangements of the instruments.

Borrowings under these facilities will be at prevailing LIBOR rates dependent on the period of drawdown plus an agreed margin.
These facilities can be used for general corporate purposes and, together with cash and cash equivalents, support the groups commercial paper programmes.
There are no financial covenants on the groups short and long term borrowings.
Certain of these borrowings contain cross default provisions and negative pledges.
The committed bank facilities are subject to a single financial covenant, being minimum interest cover ratio of two times defined as the ratio of operating profit before exceptional items, aggregated with share of associates profits after tax, to net interest.
They are also subject to pari passu ranking and negative pledge covenants.
Any non-compliance with covenants underlying Diageos financing arrangements could, if not waived, constitute an event of default with respect to any such arrangements, and any non-compliance with covenants may, in particular circumstances, lead to an acceleration of maturity on certain borrowings and the inability to access committed facilities.
Diageo was in full compliance with its financial, pari passu ranking and negative pledge covenants throughout each of the years presented.
g Hedging instruments The group designates derivatives which qualify for hedge accounting as either: i a hedge of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability fair value hedge : ii a hedge of a forecast transaction or the cash flow risk from a change in foreign exchange or interest rates cash flow hedge : or iii a hedge of a net investment in foreign operations.
The accounting treatment for hedges is disclosed in Accounting policies of the group.
The group tests effectiveness on a prospective and retrospective basis.
Methods for testing effectiveness include dollar offset, critical terms, regression analysis and hypothetical derivative method.
Loss on fair value hedging instruments for the year was 3 million 2012 84 million gain: 2011 8 million loss and the gain on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risks was 3 million 2012 86 million loss: 2011 19 million gain.
In respect of cash flow hedging instruments, a loss of 41 million 2012 29 million gain: 2011 25 million gain has been recognised in other comprehensive income due to changes in fair value.
A gain of 8 million and 25 million have been transferred out of other comprehensive income to other operating expenses and to other finance charges, respectively, in the year 2012 a loss of 4 million and a gain of 19 million: 2011 a loss of 2 million and 54 million, respectively.
For cash flow hedges of forecast transactions at 30 June 2013, based on year end interest and foreign exchange rates, there is expected to be a charge to the income statement of 24 million in 2014 and 7 million in 2015.
With respect to hedges of the cash flow risk from a change in forward foreign exchange rates using cross currency interest rate swaps, the retranslation of the related bond principal to closing foreign exchange rates and recognition of interest on the related bonds will affect the income statement in each year until the related bonds mature in 2016 and 2036.
Foreign exchange retranslation and the interest on the hedged bonds in the income statement are expected to offset those on the cross currency swaps in each of the years.
Net borrowings designated in net investment hedge relationships amounted to 5,539 million as at 30 June 2013 2012 4,249 million.
h Fair value measurements Fair value measurements of financial instruments are presented through the use of a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritises the valuation techniques used in fair value calculations.
The levels can be broadly described as follows: Level 1 use of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 use of observable inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets: and Level 3 use of inputs not based on observable market data but reflecting managements own assumptions about pricing the asset or liability.
The group maintains policies and procedures to value instruments using the most relevant data available.
If multiple inputs that fall into different levels of the hierarchy are used in the valuation of an instrument, the instrument is categorised on the basis of the most subjective input.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 165 Financial 19.
Financial instruments and risk management continued statements Derivatives and other financial liabilities at fair value 125 Foreign currency forwards and swaps, cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps are valued using discounted cash flow techniques.

These market inputs are used 126 in the discounted cash flow calculation incorporating the instruments term, notional amount and discount rate, and taking credit risk Consolidated into account.
As significant inputs to the valuation are observable in active markets, these instruments are categorised as level 2 in income statement the hierarchy.

ii Only receivables and payables that meet the definition of financial instruments under IAS 32 are included in this line.
All derivative financial instruments not in a hedge relationship are classified as trading derivatives with fair value changes recorded in the income statement.
The group does not use derivatives for speculative purposes.
All transactions in derivative financial instruments are initially undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities.
The fair values of borrowings are based on market data.
The fair values of derivatives and financial instruments are estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows using the appropriate yield curves prevailing at 30 June each year.
At 30 June 2013 and 30 June 2012, the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, other financial assets and liabilities were considered to approximate fair values.
