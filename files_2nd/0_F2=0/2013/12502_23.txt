For 2013, the rates of longevity for the UK Plan are based on the standard tables known as the SI tables projected from 2002 using the 2011 Core Projection Model with a long term rate of 1.25%.
For 2012, the rates of longevity for the UK Plan are based on standard tables known as the 2000 series with long cohort improvements from 2000 and a plus two year age rating.
For the US Plan, the rates of longevity are based on standard tables RP-2000 with generational projections using scale BB for 2013 and scale AA for 2012.

At 3 February 2013, 94.0% of the US plans assets were invested under this strategy, which comprised a mixture of corporate bonds, government bonds, swaps and futures.
The US plan assets at 3 February 2013 included ordinary shares issued by Premier Farnell plc with a fair value of 5.0 million 2012: 4.8 million.
