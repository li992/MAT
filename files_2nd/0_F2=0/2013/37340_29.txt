The restated total dividend payable represents the theoretical dividend per share that would have been paid had the bonus shares inherent in the Rights Issue been in existence at the relevant dividend dates.
In 2012 adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share were restated to exclude profits on disposals of trading properties and long-term development contracts.
The prior years have been adjusted accordingly.
