PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE COMPANY Basis of preparation The Company Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified for the treatment of financial instruments in accordance with applicable UK Accounting Standards consistently applied and under the Companies Act 2006.
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis.
No Profit and Loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by the Companies Act 2006 section 408.
The Company profit after tax for the year was 1,127 million 2012: 625 million.
Presentation of derivative financial instruments In line with the Groups accounting policy for derivative financial instruments, the Company has classified those derivatives held for the purpose of treasury management as current or non-current, based on expected settlement dates.
Employee share schemes The Group has a number of employee share schemes under which it makes equity-settled share-based payments as detailed in the Remuneration Report on pages 65 to 82 and in note S2 to the Group Financial Statements.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis together with a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the number of awards that will vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
The issue of share incentives by the Company to employees of its subsidiaries represents additional capital contributions.
The addition to the Companys investment in subsidiary undertakings is reduced on the issue of share incentives as these are recharged to the subsidiaries.
Fair value is measured using methods detailed in note S2 to the Group Financial Statements.
Foreign currencies The Companys functional and presentational currency is pounds sterling.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into pounds sterling at closing rates of exchange.
Exchange differences on monetary assets and liabilities and transactions are taken to the Profit and Loss Account, unless hedge accounting is applied whereby the differences are taken to reserves until the hedged item is realised.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are held at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the cost attributable to bringing it to its working condition for its intended use.
Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis at rates sufficient to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of individual assets over their estimated useful lives of up to ten years.
Leases Rentals under operating leases are charged to the Profit and Loss Account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Investments Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries shares are held at cost, less any provision for impairment as necessary.
Fixed asset investments in the form of loans are held at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any provision for impairment as necessary.
Current asset investments are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits The Companys employees participate in a number of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes.
The total Group cost of providing benefits under defined benefit schemes is determined separately for each of the Groups schemes under the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
The key assumptions used for the actuarial valuation are based on the Groups best estimate of the variables that will determine the ultimate cost of providing post-employment benefits, on which further detail is provided in note 22 to the Group Financial Statements.
The Companys share of the total Group surplus or deficit at the end of the reporting period for each scheme is calculated in proportion to the Companys share of ordinary employer contributions in to that scheme during the year: ordinary employer contributions are determined by the pensionable pay of the Companys employees within the scheme and the cash contribution rates set by the scheme trustees.
Current service cost is calculated with reference to the pensionable pay of the Companys employees.
The Companys share of the total Group interest on scheme liabilities, expected return on scheme assets and actuarial gains or losses is calculated in proportion to ordinary employer contributions in the prior accounting period.
Changes in the surplus or deficit arising as a result of the changes in the Companys share of total ordinary employer contributions are also treated as actuarial gains or losses.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the Balance Sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred at the Balance Sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the Financial Statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the Financial Statements.
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 | 161 Financial Statements Notes to the Company Financial Statements I.
PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE COMPANY A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits in the foreseeable future from which the reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis.
Financial instruments and borrowings The Companys accounting policies for financial instruments and borrowings are consistent with those of the Group, and are disclosed in note S2 to the Group Financial Statements.
The Companys financial risk management policies are consistent with those of the Group and are described in the Strategic Report Principal Risks and Uncertainties on pages 42 to 48 and in note S3 to the Group Financial Statements.
The Company is exempted by FRS 29 from providing detailed disclosures in respect of its financial instruments because the Company is included within the Groups consolidated Financial Statements and its financial instruments are incorporated into the disclosures in the notes to the Group Financial Statements prepared under IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
The Company has reclassified the interest accruals on bank overdrafts, loans and other borrowings from non-current liabilities to current liabilities because the amounts are due for payment within 12 months.
The effect of this change has been to increase current liabilities and reduce non-current liabilities by 102 million as at 31 December 2013 and by 94 million as at 31 December 2012.
The prior year comparatives have been restated accordingly.
Provisions A provision is recognised when the Company has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation.
DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES Details of Directors remuneration, share-based payments and pension entitlements in the Remuneration Report on pages 65 to 82 form part of these Financial Statements.
