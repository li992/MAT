During the period the Group tested its balance of goodwill for impairment in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of Assets.
The test was based on a calculation of the recoverable amount based on value in use, using projected cash flows for the Technology business.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations were: Period over which the directors have projected cashflows a three year forecast period is used which is based on management forecasts of future profits, with an assumed terminal growth rate after 2016 of 2.5% per annum 2012: 2.5%.
The terminal growth rate is assessed taking into account general economic conditions.
Forecast revenue growth the revenue projections are consistent with those used by the Group for financial planning purposes.
Forecast operating margins the operating margin projections are consistent with those used by the Group for financial planning purposes.
Discount rate future cash flows are discounted at a rate of 10% which represents a pre tax rate that reflects the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks specific to the Technology business 2012: 10%.
The directors do not believe that any reasonably foreseeable changes to key assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill, such is the margin by which the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value.
The 820,000 adjustment made to goodwill in the prior year represented a correction of the goodwill balance recorded in the year ended 30 April 2011 in relation to the HelloSoft acquisition.
Goodwill was increased in the prior year to reflect HelloSofts pre-acquisition deferred income balance which was inadvertently excluded from the fair value of net assets at acquisition date and hence from the calculation of goodwill.
