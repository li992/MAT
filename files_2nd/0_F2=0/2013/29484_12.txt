Therefore, to assist shareholders, the table below provides a high level analysis of shareholder tax and the implied tax rate.
A more detailed analysis is included in Note 8 to the financial statements.
Year ended Year Ended 31 december 31 December 2013 2012 million Million Expected shareholder tax 41.9 33.7 Recognition of capital losses 27.9 Market related tax effects 4.0 Other tax adjustments 1.6 2.0 Corporation tax rate change 12.0 8.2 actual shareholder tax 0.4 27.5 Expected shareholder tax rate 22.0% 25.0% Actual shareholder tax rate 0.2% 20.4% The expected shareholder tax principally reflects the current corporation tax rate applicable and will vary from year to year depending upon the emergence of profit between the different tax regimes which apply to the St. Jamess Place Group companies.
More detail is included in Note 8 to the financial statements.
As commented on in Section 1, the recognition of the future effect of Group capital losses reduced the shareholder tax recognised in the year by 27.9 million.
The refinement of the method of estimation of policyholder tax during the year means the market related tax effects will normally be zero in future.
The other tax adjustments are also typically small.
The impact of the corporation tax rate change on deferred tax has been a recurring feature in recent years and reduced the tax charge in both years.
The impact on shareholder tax in 2012 reflects implementation of corporation tax rate reductions totalling 2%, from 25% to 23%.
The impact in 2013 reflects the implementation of a 2% reduction from 23% to 21% effective from April 2014 and a further 1% reduction to 20% effective from April 2015.
The overall impact of all of the above effects is to decrease the tax charge reported in the IFRS results to 0.4 million 2012: 27.5 million.
However it is worth noting that the current year tax charge in the year was 38.3 million see Note 8 on page 121 IFRs Profit after tax The following additional analysis of the IFRS profit after tax result identifies the different contributions from the business in-force at the start of the year, and the new business added during the year.
