Julian Roberts Philip Broadley Group Chief Executive Group Finance Director 28 February 2014 Old Mutual plc 128 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financials GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF OLD MUTUAL PLC ONLY For year ended 31 December 2013 Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit 1.
Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified We have audited the financial statements of Old Mutual plc for the year ended 31 December 2013, which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Financial Position, the Consolidated and Parent Company Cash Flow Statements, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity and the related notes which include the reconciliation of adjusted operating profit to profit after tax.
In our opinion: The financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Groups and of the Parent Companys affairs as at 31 December 2013 and of the Groups profit for the year then ended The Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRSs as adopted by the EU The Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, and The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit were as follows: Loans and advances 33,386 million Refer to page 97 Audit Committee Report, pages 144 and 176 accounting policy and the disclosures in notes A3, E1, E2 and E3 to the financial statements The risk: The Groups loans and advances impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgement and the use of subjective assumptions.
Due to the significance of loans and advances and the related estimation uncertainty, this is considered to be a key audit risk, both in respect of the mature, established clusters and the unsecured lending books within Nedbank, as well as the Emerging Markets exposure through a joint venture, Old Mutual Finance.
Our response: For all banking clusters, our procedures included, among others, testing the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of key controls in operation over the loan approval, administration and monitoring processes.
We involved our own internal valuation specialists to assess each of the portfolio loan loss provisioning models employed by the Group and to compare the Groups assumptions to externally available data in relation to key inputs such as historical default rates, recovery rates, collateral valuation, and economic growth rates.
Specific focus was given to the Business banking, Corporate banking and Retail books, in response to increasing credit loss ratios during 2013.
We also performed detailed testing over the specific provisions held against loans and advances, by reviewing latest correspondence and Credit Committee minutes, assessing collateral values and re-performing key calculations.
Policyholder liabilities 81,141 million Refer to page 97 Audit Committee Report, pages 144 and 196 accounting policy and the disclosures in notes A3, E1, E2 and E8 to the financial statements The risk: The main risk associated with policyholder liabilities is in respect of the insurance contracts within the life businesses: Emerging Markets and Old Mutual Wealth.
Judgement is required over the variety of uncertain future outcomes, including the policy for creating and releasing discretionary reserves.
Economic assumptions, such as investment return and associated discount rates, and operating assumptions, such as mortality and persistency, are the key inputs used to estimate the valuation of these long-term liabilities and the wide variety of uncertain future outcomes results in this being one of the key judgemental areas that our audit focused on.
Our response: Our procedures in this area included testing the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of key controls over the identification, measurement and management of the Groups calculation of insurance liabilities and evaluation of the consistency of methodologies and the appropriateness of the assumptions used by the Group.
We involved our own internal actuarial specialists to assist us in our challenge of the assumptions used and the process followed for setting and updating these assumptions, particularly around expense and mortality morbidity assumptions.
Our challenge was provided in the context of our own industry knowledge, external data and our views of experience to date, an understanding of which was enhanced through our attendance at the Groups own Independent Review Committee meetings.
In respect of the discretionary reserves held within the South African business we reviewed and challenged the Groups use and application of the established policy, with reference to industry-wide practice and applicable accounting standards.
129 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF OLD MUTUAL PLC ONLY continued For year ended 31 December 2013 Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit continued 2.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement continued Goodwill and intangibles 2,835 million Refer to page 97 Audit Committee Report, page 207 accounting policy and the disclosures in note F1 to the financial statements The risk: The determination of the recoverable amount of intangible assets both acquired and internally generated and goodwill is complex and typically requires a high level of judgement, taking into account the different economic environments in which the Group operates.
We consider the greatest risk to be within Old Mutual Wealth.
Our response: The most significant judgements arise over the forecast cash flows and the discount rate applied in the value-in-use valuation models.
Our procedures included, among others, challenging the cash flow forecasts and the corresponding assumptions applied by the Group in the consideration of potential impairment of intangible assets, based on our understanding of the relevant business and the industry and economic environment in which it operates.
We compared forecasts to business plans and also previous forecasts to actual results to assess the performance of the business and the accuracy of forecasting and considered the appropriateness of the scenarios used, in the context of our wider business understanding.
We involved our own valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating the assumptions and methodologies used by the Group, in particular those relating to the discount rates and in evaluating these assumptions with reference to independently derived inputs.
Taxation 171 million tax risk provision Refer to page 97 Audit Committee Report, page 145 accounting policy and the disclosures in notes D1 and F7 to the financial statements The risk: Accruals for uncertain tax positions require the Group to make judgements and estimates in relation to tax exposures and in response to enquiries raised by the tax authorities.
This is one of the key judgemental areas that our audit is concentrated on due to the Group operating in a number of different tax jurisdictions and the complexities of and developments in international tax legislation, particularly in relation to South Africa given the proportion of the Groups income earned there.
Our response: In understanding the accruals held, we inspected the correspondence with the relevant tax authorities and associated advice and held discussions with relevant members of management.
We involved our own local and international tax specialists to assist us in analysing the Groups tax positions and challenged assumptions used to determine tax provisions based on our knowledge and experiences of the application of the international and local legislation by relevant authorities and courts.
For all of the risk areas set out above, we have assessed whether the Groups disclosures about the sensitivity of the relevant financial statement items to changes in the respective key assumptions appropriately reflect the associated risks and comply with the requirements of relevant accounting standards.
Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at 80 million.
This has been determined with reference to a benchmark of Group profit before taxation, which we consider to be one of the principal considerations for members of the Company in assessing the financial performance of the Group.
Materiality represents 5.2% of Group profit before tax and 5.0% of Group Adjusted Operating Profit, the definition of which is set out within the primary statements and notes to the financial statements.
We agreed with the Group Audit Committee to report to it all corrected and uncorrected misstatements we identified through our audit with an individual value in excess of 4 million in addition to other audit misstatements below that threshold which we believe warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Audits for Group reporting purposes were performed at the key components, being Emerging Markets, Old Mutual Wealth, Nedbank, US Asset Management and Bermuda businesses, by separate component teams.
These audits covered 94% of total revenues, 99% of profit before tax, and 95% of total Group assets.
The audits undertaken for Group reporting purposes at the significant reporting components of the Group were all performed to materiality levels set by the Group audit team, ranging from 32 million to 65 million.
To support the audit instructions sent to our component teams, the Group audit team visited the teams in South Africa, the US, Bermuda and elsewhere in the UK for planning and risk assessment meetings and maintained regular communication with the auditors at these locations throughout the audit cycle to discuss work progress and identify matters of relevance to our audit of the Group financial statements.
The Senior Statutory Auditor, in conjunction with other senior staff in the Group audit team, also regularly attends Audit Committee meetings held at the significant components to understand key risks and audit issues at a component level which may affect the Group financial statements.

Basis of preparation of adjusted operating profit Adjusted operating profit AOP reflects the directors view of the underlying long-term performance of the Group.
AOP is a measure of profitability which adjusts the standard IFRS profit measures for the specific items detailed in note C1 and, as such, it is a non-GAAP measure.
This reconciliation explains the differences between adjusted operating profit and profit after tax as reported under IFRS.
Old Mutual plc 134 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financials For core life assurance and property & casualty businesses, AOP is based on a long-term investment return, including returns on investments held by life funds in Group equity and debt instruments, and is stated net of income tax attributable to policyholder returns.

AOP includes dividends declared to holders of perpetual preferred callable securities.
Old Mutual Bermuda and Nordic are treated as non-core operations in the AOP disclosure, as such they are not included in AOP.
Refer to note B1 for further information on the basis of segmentation.
Adjusted operating earnings per share is calculated on the same basis as AOP.
It is stated after tax attributable to AOP and non-controlling interests.
It excludes income attributable to Black Economic Empowerment trusts of listed subsidiaries.
The calculation of the adjusted weighted average number of shares includes own shares held in policyholders funds and Black Economic Empowerment trusts.

143 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2013 A: Significant accounting policies continued A3: Critical accounting estimates and judgements In the preparation of these financial statements, the Group is required to make estimates and judgements that affect items reported in the consolidated income statement, statement of financial position, other primary statements and related supporting notes.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements are those which involve the most complex or subjective judgements or assessments.
Where applicable the Group applies estimation and assumption setting techniques that are aligned with relevant actuarial and accounting guidance based on knowledge of the current situation.
This requires assumptions and predictions of future events and actions.
The only change to critical accounting estimates that the Group applied during the year ended 31 December 2013 has been in respect of consolidation of certain entities in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 10.
There have been no other significant methodology changes to the critical accounting estimates and judgements that the Group applied at 31 December 2012.
The significant accounting policies are described in the relevant notes.
The key areas of the Groups business that typically require such estimates and the relevant accounting policies and notes are as follows: Area Policy note More detail Financial assets and liabilities E1 E4 Life assurance contract provisions E8 E8 Deferred acquisition costs E8 F3 Intangible assets and goodwill F1 F1 Consolidation A3 d G3 Tax A3 c D1 F7 Specific areas that have required closer attention in respect of the estimates and judgements during the year ended 31 December 2013 are explained in more detail below: a Loans and advances Provisions for impairment of loans and advances The majority of loans and advances are in respect of Nedbank, which assesses its loan portfolios for impairment at each financial reporting date.
Nedbank actively manages its exposure to loans and advances through robust credit approval processes.
The credit loss ratio at year ended 31 December 2013 was 1.06% 2012: 1.05%.
The impairment for performing loans is calculated on a portfolio basis, based on historical loss experience, adjusted for national and industry specific economic conditions and other indicators present at the reporting date that correlate with defaults on the portfolio.
These include early arrears and other indicators of potential default, such as changes in macro-economic conditions and legislation affecting credit recovery.
These annual loss ratios are applied to loan balances in the portfolio and scaled to the estimated loss emergence period.
For portfolios which comprise large numbers of small homogeneous assets with similar risk characteristics where credit scoring techniques are generally used, statistical techniques are used to calculate impairment allowances on the portfolio, based on historical recovery rates and assumed emergence periods.
There are a number of models in use, each tailored to a product, line of business or client category.
Judgement and knowledge are needed in selecting the statistical methods to use when the models are developed or revised.
For wholesale larger exposures, impairment allowances are calculated on an individual basis and all relevant considerations that have a bearing on the expected future cash flows are taken into account.
The level of impairment allowance is the difference between the value of the discounted expected future cash flows and its carrying amount.
Subjective judgements are made in the calculations of future cash flows and change with time as new information becomes available or as strategies evolve, resulting in frequent revisions to the impairment provision as individual decisions are taken.
Further detail is provided in note E3.
b Policyholder liabilities Emerging Markets discretionary reserves Technical provisions in South Africa are derived as the aggregate of: Best estimate liabilities, with assumptions allowing for the best estimate of future experience and a market-consistent valuation of financial options and guarantees Compulsory margins, prescribed in the South African professional actuarial guidance note SAP 104 as explicit changes to actuarial assumptions that increase the level of technical provisions held, and Discretionary margins, permitted by SAP 104, to allow for the uncertainty inherent in estimates of future experience after considering available options of managing that experience over time, or to defer the release of profits consistent with policy design or company practice.
Discretionary margins are held as either implicit or explicit margins.
Explicit discretionary margins are derived as conscious changes to assumptions used to project future experience to increase technical provisions.
Implicit discretionary margins arise where the method used to calculate overall technical provisions results in liabilities that are greater than the sum of best estimate liabilities and compulsory margins.
Old Mutual plc 144 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financials Explicit discretionary margins of 489 million 1.9% of total technical provisions were held at 31 December 2013.
This consisted largely of: Margins held for Mass Foundation Cluster protection business, which allow for the uncertainty related to the future progression of the AIDS pandemic in South Africa, as well as future lapse experience and future investment returns, and to ensure that profit is released appropriately over the term of the policies Margins to allow for the uncertainty inherent in the assumptions used to value financial options and guarantees, implied volatility assumptions in particular, which are difficult to hedge due to the short-term nature of the equity option market in South Africa Margins on non-profit annuities, due to the inability to fully match assets to liabilities as a result of the limited availability of long-dated bonds, and to provide for longevity risk, and A margin set up in 2013 to allow for the uncertainty inherent in future economic assumptions used to calculate, mainly protection product liabilities, in the Retail Affluent business.
Although interest rate hedging is used to manage interest rate risk on these products, the volatility of bond yields in South Africa means that it is difficult to maintain appropriate hedging positions without incurring significant trading costs.
The discretionary margin therefore caters for the residual uncertainty present after allowing for the hedge programme that is in place.
Emerging Markets Financial Soundness Valuation discount rate The calculation of the Groups South African life assurance contract liabilities is sensitive to the discount rate used to value the liabilities.
The methodology applied by the Group requires discount rates to be set according to the South African professional guidance note SAP 104.
In line with these principles, the reference rate is selected as the Bond Exchange of South Africa BESA par bond 10-year yield.
The reference rate was relatively volatile over 2013, ranging from 6.2% to 8.5% during the year ended 31 December 2013 2012: 6.9% to 8.2%.
At 31 December 2013 the reference discount rate was 8.1% 2012: 6.9%.
The volatile interest rate environment had a much smaller impact on the operating profit for the South African life assurance businesses in 2013, given the management actions taken over 2013 to mitigate these impacts.
These included the continuance of the hedging program put in place during the second half of 2012, the establishment of discretionary margins to allow for the uncertainty in respect of interest rate volatility in Retail Affluent, and changes to the annual premium and cover increase policy on Mass Foundation Cluster funeral products.
The Group estimates that a 1% reduction in the reference discount rate will result in an increase in policyholder liabilities of 6 million 2012: 39 million, allowing for the impact of the hedging program.
The 2013 impact is significantly lower than 2012 mainly, due to the management actions taken to reduce the impact of changing discount rates on operating profit, as well as the depreciation of the Rand which reduced the impact in Sterling terms.
Further disclosure of the policyholder sensitivity to interest rates is provided in note E8 g. Old Mutual Bermuda guarantees Since the closure of Old Mutual Bermuda to new business in March 2009, managements key priorities have been to fide-risk the business, manage the risk and solvency position and preserve shareholder value.
The run-off of the book and hedging of the guarantees significantly reduces the Groups risk exposure.
The active contracts for which reserves are held are deferred and fixed index annuity investments and variable annuity products, which include guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits GMAB and guaranteed minimum death benefits GMDB.
The key risk to the Group relates to the 120% of the initial deposit or, if elected, the highest anniversary account value on the 10th anniversary which will commence in 2017.
The Group has implemented a hedging strategy to protect against markets rising above the 120% guarantee and then subsequently falling, which would reset some guarantees above 120%, with account values at a lower level.
This reduces the uncertainty and volatility of capital exposure and cash flows arising from the highest anniversary value guarantees.
The remaining 120% of premium guarantee, relating to equity and foreign exchange downside risks, for the 10-year obligations are being managed by the dynamic hedge programme.
There are no significant risks to the Group associated with GMDB and management continues to operate strong oversight over the business.
During 2013 the business continued to experience high rates of surrender activity which can be attributed to the variable annuity UGO Universal Guarantee Option GMAB policyholders passing through a top-up process on the fifth anniversary following product inception.
This process was completed in 2013.
The reduced size of the book has meant that the associated GMAB reserves have reduced from $229 million at 31 December 2012 to $84 million at 31 December 2013. c Tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The Group is regularly in discussion with the respective tax authorities in each of the jurisdictions where the Group is active.
The Group applies its judgement to determine if a provision for future tax uncertainties should be recognised based on detailed reviews of any potential exposure to tax authorities and the assessment of the most probable outcome of the tax uncertainty.
As these provisions are based on estimates and rely on judgements made by the Group, the actual amount of future taxes paid by the Group could be different to the amounts provided.
145 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2013 A: Significant accounting policies continued A3: Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued d Consolidation set of standards The Group has applied the following key judgements in the application of the requirements of the consolidation set of standards IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements : Consolidation of investment funds and securitisation vehicles The Group acts as a fund manager to a number of investment funds.
In determining whether the Group controls such a fund, it will focus on an assessment of the aggregate economic interests of the Group comprising any carried interests and expected management fees and the investors rights to remove the fund manager.
The Group assesses, on an annual basis, such interests to determine if the fund will be consolidated.
See note G3 b for disclosures in respect of the investment funds in which the Group has an interest.
The Group has sponsored certain asset backed financing securitisation vehicles under its securitisation programme which are run according to pre-determined criteria that are part of the initial design of the vehicles.
The Group is exposed to variability of returns from the vehicles through its holding of junior debt securities in the vehicles.
It has concluded that it controls these vehicles and therefore has consolidated these asset backed financing vehicles.
Structured entities The Group is required to make judgements on what constitutes a structured entity.
Accounting standards define a structured entity as an entity designed so that its activities are not governed by way of voting rights.
In assessing whether the Group has power over such investees in which it has an interest, the Group considers factors such as the purpose and design of the investee, its practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee, the nature of its relationship with the investee and the size of its exposure to the variability of returns of the investee.
The Group has evaluated all exposures and has concluded that all investments in investment funds and securitisation vehicles represent investments in structured entities.
A4: Liquidity analysis of the statement of financial position The Groups statement of financial position is in order of liquidity as is permitted by IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.
In order to satisfy the requirements of IAS 1, the following analysis is given to describe how the statement of financial position lines are categorised between current and non-current balances, applying the principles laid out in IAS 1.
The following statement of financial position captions are generally classified as current cash and cash equivalents, non-current assets held for sale, client indebtedness for acceptances, current tax receivable, third-party interests in the consolidation of funds, current tax payable, liabilities under acceptances and non-current liabilities held for sale.
The following balances are generally classified as non-current goodwill and other intangible assets, mandatory reserve deposits with central banks, property, plant and equipment, investment property, deferred tax assets, investments in associated undertakings and jointly controlled operations, deferred acquisition costs, deposits held with reinsurers, provisions, deferred revenue and deferred tax liabilities.
The following balances include both current and non-current portions reinsurers shares of life assurance and general insurance business policyholder liabilities, loans and advances, investments and securities, other assets, derivative financial assets and liabilities, life assurance and general insurance policyholder liabilities, borrowed funds, amounts owed to bank depositors and other liabilities.
The split between the current and non-current portions for these assets and liabilities is given either by way of a footnote to the relevant note to the accounts or by way of a maturity analysis in respect of major financial liability captions.
A5: Standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations adopted in the 2013 annual financial statements The following standards, amendments to standards and interpretations, which are relevant to the Group, have been adopted in these financial statements: Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures require that the Group discloses additional information to evaluate the actual or potential effect of netting arrangements relating to financial assets and financial liabilities in the statement of financial position IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, and IFRS 12 Disclosures of interests in other entities.
These standards all relate to how the Group accounts for its interests in subsidiaries and joint ventures, together with new disclosures regarding these investments.
The revised accounting policy is described in the detailed accounting policies.
The Group continually assesses those entities which require consolidation IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement is a new standard clarifying the principles on the determination of fair value and containing a comprehensive disclosure framework.
The standard defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The standard does not require the recognition of any assets or liabilities at fair value other than those prescribed by other standards Old Mutual plc 146 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financials Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income require that an entity present separately the items of OCI that may be reclassified to profit or loss in the future from those that would never be reclassified to profit or loss.
This amendment affected presentation only and had no impact on the shareholders equity or profit Amendments to IAS 19 Defined Benefit Plans: specifically for defined benefit plans.
The key amendments are: the corridor method has been removed and all actuarial gains and losses are required to be recognised in OCI rather in profit or loss.
Expected returns on plan assets are no longer recognised in profit or loss.
Instead, interest is recognised on the net defined benefit liability or asset in profit or loss, calculated using the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation past service costs arising from plan amendments or curtailment are now recognised in profit or loss at the earlier of when the amendment occurs or when the related restructuring or termination costs are recognised.
The option to amortise such cost over future years has also been eliminated Amendments to IAS 36 Impairment of Assets which, among other minor amendments, eliminates certain disclosure requirements.
The adoption of this amendment did not have an effect on the financial statements The adoption of the above standards has been according to the effective date published by the International Accounting Standards Board, which for IFRS 10, 11, 12 and 13 is earlier than required by the EU.
The impact of the adoption of these standards can be found in J1.
A6: Future standards, amendments to standards and interpretations not early-adopted in the 2013 annual financial statements At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations, which are relevant to the Group, have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments The IASB has issued components of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which is the first step in its project to replace IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement in its entirety.
The project has three main phases: Phase I: Classification and measurement of financial instruments Phase II: Amortised cost and impairment of financial assets, and Phase III: Hedge accounting.
IFRS 9, as currently issued, includes requirements for the classification and measurement, derecognition and hedge accounting for financial assets and liabilities and additional disclosure requirements.
The main changes from IAS 39 are: Financial assets are to be classified and measured based on the business model for managing the financial asset and the cash flow characteristics of the financial asset, either at fair value or amortised cost A financial asset or liability that would otherwise be at amortised cost may only be designated at fair value through profit or loss if such a designation reduces an accounting mismatch For financial liabilities designated as fair value through profit or loss a further requirement is that all changes in the fair value of financial liabilities attributable to credit risk be transferred to Other Comprehensive Income with no recycling through profit or loss on disposal A hedge accounting model that establishes a principles based approach that is more aligned to an entitys risk management model.
The current effective date for IFRS 9 is 1 January 2018.
However, the IASB adopted a phased approach for the release of IFRS 9, with complex rules for the early adoption of portions of the standard.
The implementation of IFRS 9 is anticipated to have a significant impact on the preparation of the Groups financial statements.
The adoption of the standard will have the biggest impact on Emerging Markets and Nedbank.
Other standards The following amendments to the IASB standards which are effective for the Group on 1 January 2014 are unlikely to have a material impact on the Groups financial statements: Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Amendments to IAS 32 Investment Entities Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting Amendments to IAS 39 Amendments as a result of the annual improvements projects Recognition of levies imposed by a government IFRIC 21.
147 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2013 B: Segment information B1: Basis of segmentation The Groups segmental results are analysed and reported on a basis consistent with the way that management and the Board of directors assesses performance and allocates resources.
Information is presented to the Board on a consolidated basis in pounds sterling the presentation currency and in the functional currency of each business.
Adjusted operating profit is one of the key measures reported to the Groups management and Board of directors for their consideration in the allocation of resources to and the review of performance of the segments.
The Group utilises additional measures to assess the performance of each of the segments, depending on the business line, this typically includes net client cash flows, funds under management, gross earned premiums, underwriting results, net interest income and non-interest revenue and credit losses.
A reconciliation between the segment revenues and expenses and the Groups revenues and expenses is shown in note B3.
Consistent with internal reporting, assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses that are not directly attributable to a particular segment are allocated between segments where appropriate and where there is a reasonable basis for doing so.
The Group accounts for inter-segment revenues and transfers as if the transactions were with third parties at current market prices.
Given the nature of the operations, there are no major trading activities between the segments.
The revenues generated in each reported segment can be seen in the analysis of profits and losses in note B3.
The segmental information in notes B3 and B4, reflects the adjusted and IFRS measures of profit and loss and the assets and liabilities for each operating segment as provided to management and the Board of directors.
There are no differences between the measurement of the assets and liabilities reflected in the primary statements and that reported for the segments.
There are four primary business activities from which the Group generates revenues.
These are life assurance premium income, asset management business fee and commission income, banking banking interest receivable and general insurance premium income.
The principal lines of business from which each operating segment derives its revenues are as follows: Core operations Emerging Markets life assurance and asset management Old Mutual Wealth life assurance and asset management Property & Casualty general insurance Nedbank banking and asset management US Asset Management asset management Non-core operations Old Mutual Bermuda life assurance Segment presentation In the 2012 Annual Report and Accounts, the Group announced that, with effect from 1 January 2013, all of the Groups Property & Casualty activities would be reported as a single segment.
Consequently, the Mutual & Federal segment has been renamed as Property & Casualty.
This segment includes Mutual & Federal, 100% of iWyze, previously reported as a 50% joint venture between Emerging Markets and Mutual & Federal, and the general insurance businesses in Namibia and Botswana.
The name change has been applied to all reporting periods.
Comparative information for the year ended 31 December 2012 has been restated accordingly.
In addition to the above, the Long-Term Savings aggregation has been removed from the adjusted operating profit statement, segmental information and in the statement of financial position in notes B3 and B4 of the annual financial statements.
The Long-Term Savings segment was a sub total of the Emerging Markets and Old Mutual Wealth segments which the Group previously elected to disclose.
This presentational change has been applied to all reporting periods.
The Groups reported segments are now Emerging Markets, Old Mutual Wealth, Property & Casualty, Nedbank and US Asset Management USAM.
The Other segment includes Group head office.
Old Mutual Bermuda is the principal component of the non-core operations.
For all reporting periods, Old Mutual Bermuda is classified as a continuing operation in the IFRS income statement, but as non-core in determining the Groups adjusted operating profit.
The Group continues to incur costs related to the sale of its Nordic business in 2012.
These costs largely relate to the transition of IT information and support services that were previously provided by the Nordic business to the wider Group, back to the Group.
These costs are included in the expenses related to the discontinued operations in the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013.
Further information on the results of discontinued operations is provided in note I1.
The Nordic business has been classified as a discontinued operation in the IFRS consolidated income statement and its results as non-core in determining the Groups adjusted operating profit.
All other businesses have been classified as continuing operations for all reporting periods.

157 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2013 C: Other key performance information C1: Operating profit adjusting items a Summary of adjusting items for determination of AOP In determining the AOP of the Group for core operations, certain adjustments are made to profit before tax to reflect the directors view of the underlying long-term performance of the Group.
The following table shows an analysis of those adjustments from AOP to profit before and after tax.

These are reversed in the acquisition statement of financial position and replaced by goodwill, other intangible assets and the value of the acquired present value of in-force business acquired PVIF.
In determining AOP, the Group recognises deferred revenue and acquisition costs and deferred revenue in relation to policies sold by acquired businesses pre-acquisition.
The Group excludes the impairment of goodwill and the amortisation and impairment of acquired other intangibles and acquired PVIF and the movements in certain acquisition date provisions.
Costs incurred on successful acquisitions are also excluded from AOP.
If the intangible assets recognised as a result of a business combination are subsequently impaired, this is excluded from AOP.
The effect of these adjustments to determine AOP are summarised below: m Emerging Old Mutual Year ended 31 December 2013 Markets Wealth USAM Total Amortisation of acquired PVIF 76 76 Amortisation of acquired deferred costs and revenue 11 11 Amortisation of other acquired intangible assets 2 46 48 Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 8 20 28 10 131 141 m Emerging Old Mutual Year ended 31 December 2012 Markets Wealth USAM Total Amortisation of acquired PVIF 84 84 Amortisation of acquired deferred costs and revenue 12 12 Amortisation of other acquired intangible assets 2 48 1 51 Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 2 120 1 123 Old Mutual plc 158 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financials c Loss on disposal of subsidiaries, associated undertakings and strategic investments Loss on disposal of subsidiaries, associated undertakings and strategic investments is analysed below: m Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2013 2012 USAM 4 16 Emerging Markets 15 Old Mutual Wealth 25 Loss on disposal of subsidiaries, associated undertakings and strategic investments 4 56 USAM On 2 January 2013, USAM completed the sale of five of its affiliates incurring a loss of 1 million.

AOP is stated after recalculating shareholder asset investment returns based on a long-term investment return rate.
The difference between the actual and the long-term investment returns is referred to as the short-term fluctuation in investment return.
Long-term rates of return are based on achieved rates of return appropriate to the underlying asset base, adjusted for current inflation expectations, default assumptions, costs of investment management and consensus economic investment forecasts.
The underlying rates are principally derived with reference to 10-year government bond rates, cash and money market rates and an explicit equity risk premium for South African businesses.
The rates set out below reflect the apportionment of underlying investments in cash deposits, money market instruments and equity assets.
Long-term rates of return are reviewed frequently by the Board, usually annually, for appropriateness.
The review of the long-term rates of return seeks to ensure that the returns credited to AOP are consistent with the actual returns expected to be earned over the long-term.
For Emerging Markets, the return is applied to an average value of investible shareholders assets, adjusted for net fund flows.
For Old Mutual Wealth, the return is applied to average investible assets.
For Property & Casualty, the return is an average value of investible assets supporting shareholders funds and insurance liabilities, adjusted for net fund flows.

e Investment return adjustment for Group equity and debt instruments held in policyholder funds AOP includes investment returns on policyholder investments in Group equity and debt instruments held by the Groups life funds.
These include investments in the Companys ordinary shares and the subordinated liabilities and ordinary shares issued by Nedbank.
These investment returns are eliminated within the consolidated income statement in arriving at profit before tax in the IFRS income statement, but are included in AOP.
During the year ended 31 December 2013, the investment return adjustment increased AOP by 100 million 2012: increase of 113 million.
f Dividends declared to holders of perpetual preferred callable securities Dividends declared to the holders of the Groups perpetual preferred callable securities on an AOP basis were 42 million for the year ended 31 December 2013 2012: 42 million.
These are recognised in finance costs on an accruals basis for the purpose of determining AOP.
In accordance with IFRS the total cash distribution of 47 million 2012: 42 million is recognised directly in equity.
This distribution included 5 million accrued interest paid in respect of securities accepted for repurchase.
g US Asset Management equity plans US Asset Management has a number of long-term incentive arrangements with senior employees in its asset management affiliates.
The Group has issued put options in equities in the affiliates to senior employees as part of its US affiliate incentive schemes.
The impact of revaluing these instruments is recognised in accordance with IFRS, but excluded from AOP.
At 31 December 2013, these instruments were revalued, the impact of which was a loss of 38 million 2012: loss of 13 million.
h Credit-related fair value gains and losses on Group debt instruments The widening of credit spread is related to the Groups debt instruments and causes the market value of these instruments to decrease, resulting in gains being recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Conversely, if the credit spread narrows and the market value of debt instruments rises then losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
In the directors view, such movements are not reflective of the underlying performance of the Group and will reverse over time and they have therefore been excluded from AOP.
For the year ended 31 December 2013 a net loss of 31 million was recognised 2012: loss of 55 million.
On 1 August 2012, the Group redeemed 388 million of the 500 million senior bond due in 2016 at a cash consideration of 459 million.
The 71 million excess over the nominal value reflected the market value of the instrument prior to redemption.
i Old Mutual Wealth restructuring expenditure The Old Mutual Wealth business embarked on a significant change project to fundamentally restructure the way in which its UK platform business operates.
Over the next two to three years, it will migrate certain elements of service provision to International Financial Data Services IFDS.
Costs related to decommissioning of existing technology and service provision and the migration of service to IFDS will be excluded from AOP.
These costs will comprise payments to IFDS and directly attributable internal project costs and totalled 20 million in 2013.
Old Mutual plc 160 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financials C2: Earnings and earnings per share The Group calculates earnings per share EPS on several different bases.
IFRS requires the calculation of basic and diluted EPS.
Adjusted operating EPS reflects earnings per share consistent with the Groups alternative profit measure.
JSE Limited JSE listing requirements also require the Group to calculate headline EPS.
The Groups EPS on these different bases are summarised below: Pence Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2012 Source of guidance Notes 2013 Restated 1 Basic earnings per share IFRS C2 a 15.0 24.9 1 Diluted basic earnings per share IFRS C2 b 13.9 23.1 1 Adjusted operating earnings per share Group policy C2 c 18.4 17.5 2 Headline earnings per share Gross of tax JSE Listing Requirements C2 d 15.6 13.5 2 Headline earnings per share Net of tax JSE Listing Requirements C2 d 15.2 13.8 2 Diluted headline earnings per share Gross of tax JSE Listing Requirements C2 d 14.6 12.7 2 Diluted headline earnings per share Net of tax JSE Listing Requirements C2 d 14.3 12.9 1 Restatement for the impact of changes in policies did not result in changes to basic, diluted basic and adjusted operating earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2012.
2 The prior year has been restated for the impact of changes in accounting policies.
a Basic earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the financial year attributable to ordinary equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding own shares held in policyholder funds, ESOP trusts, Black Economic Empowerment trusts and other related undertakings.

2 For the year ended 31 December 2012, the weighted average number of shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted EPS was adjusted for the seven-for-eight share consolidation that was effected on 23 April 2012.
For adjusted operating EPS, the adjustment of the weighted average number of shares has been made effective from 1 January 2012.
This adjustment had the effect of presenting adjusted EPS on a more consistent basis, but resulted in a difference between the adjusted weighted average number of shares for IFRS and AOP.
Old Mutual plc 162 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financials d Headline earnings per share The Group is required to calculate headline earnings per share HEPS in accordance with the JSE Limited JSE Listing Requirements, determined by reference to the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants circular 02 2013 Revised Headline Earnings.
The table below sets out a reconciliation of basic EPS and HEPS in accordance with that circular.
Disclosure of HEPS is not a requirement of IFRS, but it is a commonly used measure of earnings in South Africa.

As a consequence of the exchange control arrangements in place in certain African territories, dividends to ordinary equity holders on the branch registers of those countries or, in the case of Namibia, the Namibian section of the principal register are settled through Dividend Access Trusts established for that purpose.
A final dividend of 6.0 pence or its equivalent in other applicable currencies per ordinary share in the Company has been recommended by the directors.
The final dividend will be paid on 30 May 2014 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 14 April 2014 for the Malawi register, 16 April 2014 for the South African, Zimbabwe and Namibian registers and 22 April 2014 for the UK register.
The dividend will absorb an estimated 275 million of shareholders funds.
The Company is not planning to offer a scrip dividend alternative.
In March and November 2013, 22 million and 25 million respectively, were declared and paid to holders of perpetual preferred callable securities March 2012: 22 million, November 2012: 20 million.

E: Financial assets and liabilities E1: Group statement of financial position The Group is exposed to financial risk through its financial assets investments and loans, financial liabilities investment contracts, customer deposits and borrowings, reinsurance assets and insurance liabilities.
The key focus of financial risk management for the Group is ensuring that the proceeds from its financial assets are sufficient to fund the obligations arising from its insurance and banking operations.
The most important components of financial risk are credit risk, market risk arising from changes in equity, bond prices, interest and foreign exchange rates, and liquidity risk.
a Recognition and derecognition A financial asset or liability is recognised when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument.
The Group derecognises a financial asset when, and only when: The contractual rights to the cash flows arising from the financial assets have expired or been forfeited by the Group or It transfers the financial asset including substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset or It transfers the financial asset and neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control.
A financial liability is derecognised when and only when the liability is extinguished, that is when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, assigned, cancelled or has expired.
The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability or part thereof extinguished or transferred to another party and consideration received, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss.
All purchases and sales of financial assets that require delivery within the timeframe established by regulation or market convention regular way purchases and sales are recognised at trade date, which is the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Loans and receivables are recognised at fair value plus attributable transaction costs when cash is advanced to borrowers.
b Initial measurement Financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability.
c Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognised in the statement of financial position at fair value.
Fair values are obtained from quoted market prices, discounted cash flow models and option pricing models as appropriate.
All derivatives are carried as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges for hedge accounting purposes are included in investment income or finance costs as appropriate.
169 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2013 E: Financial assets and liabilities continued E1: Group statement of financial position continued d Hedge accounting Qualifying hedging instruments must either be derivative financial instruments or non-derivative financial instruments used to hedge the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in fair value or changes in cash flows.
Changes in the value of the financial instrument should be expected to offset changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying hedged item.
The Group designates certain qualifying hedging instruments as either 1 a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment fair value hedge or 2 a hedge of a future cash flow attributable to a recognised asset or liability, or a forecasted transaction, and could affect profit or loss cash flow hedge or, 3 a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.
Hedge accounting is used for qualifying hedging instruments designated in this way provided certain criteria are met.
The Groups criteria in accordance with reporting standards for a qualifying hedging instrument to be accounted for as a hedge include: Upfront formal documentation of the hedging instrument, hedged item or transaction, risk management objective and strategy, the nature of the risk being hedged and the effectiveness measurement methodology that will be applied is prepared before hedge accounting is adopted The hedge is documented showing that it is expected to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, consistent with the risk management and strategy detailed in the upfront hedge documentation The effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured The hedge is assessed and determined to have been highly effective on an ongoing basis For cash flow hedges of a forecast transaction, an assessment that it is highly probable that the hedged transaction will occur and will carry profit or loss risk.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges and that prove to be highly effective in relation to hedged risk, are recorded in profit or loss, along with the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to that specific hedged risk.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges or hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, and that prove to be highly effective in relation to the hedged risk, are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in profit or loss.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.
For fair value hedge accounting, any previous adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged interest-bearing financial instrument carried at amortised cost as a result of previous hedge accounting, is amortised in profit or loss from the date hedge accounting ceases, to the maturity date of the financial instrument, based on the effective interest method.
For hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, any cumulative gains or losses in equity are recognised in profit or loss on disposal of the foreign operation.
e Embedded derivatives Certain derivatives embedded in financial and non-financial instruments, such as the conversion option in a convertible bond, are treated as separate derivatives and recognised as such on a stand alone basis, when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value with unrealised gains and losses reported in profit or loss.
If it is not possible to determine the fair value of the embedded derivative, the entire hybrid instrument is categorised as fair value through profit or loss and measured at fair value.
f Offsetting financial instruments and related income Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position only when there is a legally enforceable right to set off and there is intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Income and expense items are offset only to the extent that their related instruments have been offset in the statement of financial position, with the exception of those relating to hedges, which are disclosed in accordance with profit or loss effect of the hedged item.
g Interest income and expense Interest income and expense in relation to financial instruments carried at amortised cost or held as available-for-sale are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method, taking into account the expected timing and amount of cash flows.
Interest income and expense include the amortisation of any discount or premium or other differences between the initial carrying amount of an interest-bearing instrument and its amount at maturity calculated on an effective interest basis.
Interest income and expense on financial instruments carried at fair value through profit or loss are presented as part of interest income or expense.
Old Mutual plc 170 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financials h Non-interest revenue Non-interest revenue in respect of financial instruments principally comprises fees and commission and other operating income.
These are accounted for as set out below.
Fees and commission income Loan origination fees, for loans that are probable of being drawn down, are deferred together with related direct costs and recognised as an adjustment to the effective yield on the loan.
Fees and commission arising from negotiating, or participating in the negotiation of a transaction for a third party, such as the acquisition of loans, shares or other securities or the purchase or sale of businesses, are recognised on completion of the underlying transaction.
Other Revenue other than interest, fees and commission including fees and insurance premiums, which includes exchange and securities trading income, dividends from investments and net gains on the sale of banking assets, is recognised in profit or loss when the amount of revenue from the transaction or service can be measured reliably and it is probable that the economic benefits of the transaction or service will flow to the Group.
i Financial assets Non-derivative financial assets are recorded as held-for-trading, designated as fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-tomaturity or available-for-sale.
An analysis of the Groups statement of financial position, showing the categorisation of financial assets, together with financial liabilities is set out in note E1 o. j Classification of financial instruments Held-for-trading financial assets Held-for-trading financial assets are those that were either acquired for generating a profit from short-term fluctuations in price or dealers margin, or are securities included in a portfolio in which a pattern of short-term profit taking exists, or are derivatives that are not designated as effective hedging instruments.
Financial assets designated as fair value through profit or loss Financial assets that the Group has elected to designate as fair value through profit or loss are those where the treatment either eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise when using a different measurement basis for instance with respect to financial assets supporting insurance contract provisions or are managed, evaluated and reported using a fair value basis for instance financial assets supporting shareholders funds.
All financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss, whether held-for-trading or designated, are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured at fair value based on bid prices quoted in active markets.
If such price information is not available for these instruments, the Group uses other valuation techniques, including internal models, to measure these instruments.
These techniques use market observable inputs where available, derived from similar assets and liabilities in similar and active markets, from recent transaction prices for comparable items or from other observable market data.
For positions where observable reference data are not available for some or all parameters, the Group estimates the non-market observable inputs used in its valuation models.
Where discounted cash flow techniques are used, estimated future cash flows are based on managements best estimates and the discount rate used is a market-related rate at the reporting date for an instrument with similar terms and conditions.
Fair values of certain financial instruments, such as over-the-counter OTC derivative instruments, are determined using pricing models that consider, among other factors, contractual and market prices, correlations, yield curves, credit spreads and volatility factors.
Realised and unrealised fair value gains and losses on all financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are included in investment return non-banking or in banking trading, investment and similar income as appropriate.
Interest earned whilst holding financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is reported within Investment return non-banking or banking interest and similar income, as appropriate.
Dividends receivable are included separately in dividend income, within Investment return nonbanking or banking trading, investment and similar income, when a dividend is declared.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, other than those classified by the Group as fair value through profit or loss or available-for-sale.
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost less any impairment write-downs.
Third-party expenses such as legal fees incurred in securing a loan are treated as part of the cost of the transaction.
Held-to-maturity financial assets Financial assets with fixed maturity dates which are quoted in an active market and where management has both the intent and the ability to hold the asset to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity.
These assets are carried at amortised cost less any impairment write-downs.
Interest earned on held-to-maturity financial assets is reported within investment return non-banking or banking interest and similar income, as appropriate.
171 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2013 E: Financial assets and liabilities continued E1: Group statement of financial position continued j Classification of financial instruments continued Available-for-sale financial assets Financial assets intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices other than those designated fair value through profit or loss or as loans and receivables, are classified as available-for-sale.
Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of the purchase.
Available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value based on bid prices quoted in active markets.
If such prices are unavailable or determined to be unreliable, the fair value of the financial asset is estimated using pricing models or discounted cash flow techniques.
Where pricing models are used, inputs are based on observable market data where available at the reporting date.
Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in other comprehensive income.
When available-for-sale financial assets are disposed the related accumulated fair value adjustments are included in profit or loss as gains and losses from available-for-sale financial assets.
When available-for-sale assets are impaired the resulting loss is shown separately in profit or loss as an impairment charge.
Interest earned on available-for-sale financial assets is reported within Investment return non-banking or banking interest and similar income, as appropriate.
Dividends receivable are included separately in dividend income, within Investment return non-banking or banking trading, investment and similar income, as appropriate when a dividend is declared.
Financial liabilities other than investment contracts and derivatives Non-derivative financial liabilities, including borrowed funds, amounts owed to depositors and liabilities under acceptances, are recorded as held-for-trading, designated as fair value through profit or loss or as financial liabilities at amortised cost.
Liabilities that the Group has elected to designate as fair value through profit or loss are those where the treatment either eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise when using a different measurement basis or the financial liabilities managed, evaluated and reported using a fair value basis.
For financial liabilities recorded at fair value and which contain a demand feature, the fair value of the liability is not less than the amount payable on demand, discounted from the first date that the amount could be required to be paid.
Financial liabilities categorised at amortised cost are recognised initially at fair value, which is normally represented by the transaction price, less directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition these financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Equity classified conversion options included within financial liabilities are recorded separately in shareholders equity.
The Group does not recognise any change in the value of this option in subsequent periods.
The remaining obligation to make future payments of principal and interest to bondholders is calculated using a market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond and is presented on the amortised cost basis in other borrowed funds until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bonds.
If the Group purchases its own debt, it is removed from the statement of financial position and the difference between the carrying amount of a liability and the consideration paid is included in other income.
k Reclassifications of financial assets A non-derivative financial asset that would have met the definition of loans and receivables at initial recognition that was required to be categorised as held-for-trading on the basis that it was held for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term may under exceptional circumstances be reclassified out of the fair value through profit or loss category if the Group intends and is able to hold the financial asset for the foreseeable future or until maturity.
If a financial asset is so reclassified, it is reclassified at its fair value on the date of reclassification.
Any gain or loss already recognised in profit or loss is not reversed.
The fair value at the date of reclassification becomes its new cost or amortised cost, as applicable.
Other non-derivative financial assets that were required to be categorised as held-for-trading at initial recognition may be reclassified out of the fair value through profit or loss category in rare circumstances.
Measurement of the asset after reclassification depends on the subsequent categorisation.
Old Mutual plc 172 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financials A non-derivative financial asset that would have met the definition of loans and receivables at initial recognition that was designated as availablefor-sale may under exceptional circumstances be reclassified out of the available-for-sale category to the loans and receivables category if it meets the loans and receivables definition at the date of reclassification and if the Group intends and is able to hold the financial asset for the foreseeable future or until maturity.
In the case of a financial asset with a fixed maturity, the gain or loss already recognised in the available-for-sale reserve in equity is amortised to profit or loss over the remaining life using the effective interest method together with any difference between the new amortised cost and the maturity amount.
In the case of a financial asset that does not have a fixed maturity, the gain or loss already recognised in the available-for-sale reserve in equity is recognised in profit or loss when the financial asset is sold or otherwise disposed.
l Sale and repurchase agreements and lending of securities Securities sold subject to linked repurchase agreements are retained in the financial statements as appropriate when considering the fiderecognition criteria contained within IAS 39.
The securities that are retained in the financial statements are reflected as trading or investment securities and the counterparty liability is included in amounts owed to other depositors, deposits from other banks, or other money market deposits, as appropriate.
Securities purchased under agreements to resell at a pre-determined price are recorded as loans and advances to other banks or customers as appropriate.
The difference between the sale and repurchase price is treated as interest and accrued over the lives of agreements using the effective interest method.
Securities lent to counterparties are retained in the financial statements and any interest earned recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.
Securities borrowed are not recognised in the financial statements, unless these are sold to third parties, in which case the purchase and sale are recorded with the gain or loss included in trading income.
The obligation to return them is recorded at fair value as a trading liability.
m Parent Company investments in subsidiary undertakings and associates Parent Company investments in subsidiary undertakings and associates are recorded at cost.
Impairments of Parent Company investments in subsidiary undertakings and associates are accounted for in the same way as impairments of other non-financial assets.
n Impairments of financial assets Indicators of impairment A provision for impairment is established if there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover all amounts relating to the financial asset.
Observable data that could come to the attention of the Group that could lead to a provision for impairment to be made include: Significant financial difficulty of the counterparty A breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments The Group, for economic or legal reasons relating to the counterpartys financial difficulty, grants to the counterparty a concession that the Group would not otherwise consider It becoming probable that the counterparty will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation Observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows from a group of assets since the initial recognition of those assets, although the decrease cannot yet be identified with the individual financial assets, including: adverse changes in the payment status of counterparties in the group of financial assets: or national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on the assets in the group of financial assets.
In addition, for an available-for-sale financial asset, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value below its cost is also objective evidence of impairment.
Financial assets at amortised cost The amount of the impairment of a financial asset held at amortised cost is the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount, being the value of expected cash flows, including amounts recoverable from guarantees and collateral, discounted based on the effective interest rate at initial recognition.
In estimating future expected cash flows the Group looks at the contractual cash flows of the assets and adjusts these contractual cash flows for historical loss experience of assets with similar credit risks, with this adjusted to reflect any additional conditions that are expected to arise or to account for those which no longer exist.
This is done to predict inherent losses which exist in the asset as at the reporting date but have not been reported.
The impairment provision also covers losses where there is objective evidence that losses are present in components of the loan portfolio at the reporting date, but these components have not yet been specifically identified.
When a loan is uncollectable, it is written off against the related impairment provision.
If the amount of impairment subsequently decreases due to an event occurring after the write-down, the release of the impairment provision is credited to profit or loss.
Impairment reversals are limited to what the carrying amount would have been, had no impairment losses been recognised.
Interest income on impaired loans and receivables is recognised on the impaired amount using the original effective interest rate before the impairment.
173 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2013 E: Financial assets and liabilities continued E1: Group statement of financial position continued n Impairments of financial assets continued Available-for-sale financial assets The amount of the impairment loss of an available-for-sale financial asset is the cumulative loss that has been recognised in other comprehensive income, being the difference between the acquisition cost and the assets current fair value, less any impairment loss on that asset previously recognised in profit or loss.
For available-for-sale debt securities, fair value is determined as is the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of interest.
All such impairments are recognised in profit or loss.
The release of an impairment allowance in respect of a debt instrument categorised as available-for-sale is credited to profit or loss, the release in respect of an equity instrument categorised as available-for-sale is credited to the available-for-sale reserve within equity.
o Categories of financial instruments The analysis of assets and liabilities into their categories as defined in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement is set out in the following table.
Assets and liabilities of a non-financial nature, or financial assets and liabilities that are specifically excluded from the scope of IAS 39, are reflected in the non-financial assets and liabilities category.

The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price, that is, the fair value of the consideration given or received.
In certain circumstances, however, the initial fair value may be based on other observable current market transactions in the same instrument, without modification or repackaging, or on a valuation technique whose variables include only observable data.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the fair values of financial instruments measured at fair value that are quoted in active markets are based on bid prices for assets, which in certain circumstances includes using quotations from independent third parties such as brokers and pricing services, and offer prices for liabilities.
When quoted prices are not available, fair values are determined by using valuation techniques that refer as far as possible to observable market data.
These include comparison with similar instruments where market observable prices exist, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.
A number of factors such as bid-offer spread, credit profile, servicing costs and model uncertainty are taken into account, as appropriate, when values are calculated using a valuation technique.
Changes in the assumptions used in such valuations could impact the reported value of such instruments.
All derivative instruments are measured at fair value.
In general none of the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost have a fair value significantly different to their carrying amounts.
Such assets and liabilities primarily comprise variable-rate financial assets and liabilities that re-price as interest rates change, short-term deposits or current assets.
All financial assets and liabilities that are measured at amortised cost are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs.
Loans and advances Loans and advances include mortgage loans, other asset-based loans, including collateralised debt obligations, and other secured and unsecured loans.
In the absence of an observable market for these instruments, the fair value is determined by using internally developed models that are specific to the instrument and that incorporate all available observable inputs.
These models involve discounting the contractual cash flows by using a credit-adjusted zero-coupon rate.
Investments and securities Investments and securities include government and  securities, listed and unlisted debt securities, preference shares and debentures, listed and unlisted equity securities, listed and unlisted pooled investments see below, short-term funds and securities treated as investments and certain other securities.
Pooled investments represent the Groups holdings of shares units in open-ended investment companies, unit trusts, mutual funds and similar investment vehicles.
Pooled investments are stated at fair value.
The fair values of pooled investments are based on widely published prices that are regularly updated or models based on the market prices of investments held in the underlying pooled investment funds.
Amounts owed to bank depositors The fair values of amounts owed to bank depositors corresponds with the carrying amount shown in the statement of financial position, which generally reflects the amount payable on demand.
Borrowed funds The fair values of amounts included in borrowed funds are based on quoted market prices at the reporting date where applicable, or by reference to quoted prices of similar instruments.
Other financial assets and liabilities The fair values of other financial assets and liabilities which comprise cash and cash equivalents, cash with central banks, other assets and liabilities are reasonably approximated by the carrying amounts reflected in the statement of financial position as they are short-term in nature or re-price to current market rates frequently.
Old Mutual plc 176 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financials ii Fair value hierarchy Fair values are determined according to the following hierarchy: Level 1 quoted market prices: financial assets and liabilities with quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Instruments classified as Level 1 generally comprise listed equity securities, government securities and other listed debt securities and similar instruments, actively traded pooled investments, certain quoted derivative assets and liabilities, listed borrowed funds and investment contract liabilities linked to Level 1 pooled investments and other assets Level 2 valuation techniques using observable inputs: financial assets and liabilities with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and financial assets and liabilities valued using models where all significant inputs are observable.
Instruments classified as Level 2 generally comprise unlisted equity and debt securities where the valuation is based on models involving no significant unobservable data.
Certain inputs, such as discount rates and credit spreads may be unobservable but these inputs do not have a significant impact on the fair value of the instrument.
This includes certain loans and advances, certain privately placed debt instruments, third-party interests in consolidated funds and amounts owed to bank depositors Level 3 valuation techniques using significant unobservable inputs: financial assets and liabilities valued using valuation techniques where one or more significant inputs are unobservable.
Instruments classified as Level 3 generally comprise unlisted equity and securities with significant unobservable inputs, securities where the market is not considered sufficiently active, including certain inactive pooled investments, and derivatives embedded in certain portfolios of insurance contracts where the derivative is not closely related to the host contract and the valuation contains significant unobservable inputs The Group deems a transfer to have occurred between Level 1 and Level 2 when an active, traded primary market ceases to exist for that financial instrument.
The best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an active market.
In the event that the market for a financial asset or liability is not active, or quoted prices cannot be obtained without undue effort, another valuation technique is used.
The judgement as to whether a market is active may include, for example, consideration of factors such as the magnitude and frequency of trading activity, the availability of prices and the size of bid offer spreads.
In inactive markets, obtaining assurance that the transaction price provides evidence of fair value or determining the adjustments to transaction prices that are necessary to measure the fair value of the asset or liability requires additional work during the valuation process.
The majority of valuation techniques employ only observable data and so the reliability of the fair value measurement is high.
However, certain financial assets and liabilities are valued on the basis of valuation techniques that feature one or more significant inputs that are unobservable and, for them, the derivation of fair value is more judgemental.
A financial asset or liability in its entirety is classified as valued using significant unobservable inputs if a significant proportion of that asset or liabilitys carrying amount is driven by unobservable inputs.
In this context, unobservable means that there is little or no current market data available for which to determine the price at which an arms length transaction would be likely to occur.
It generally does not mean that there is no market data available at all upon which to base a determination of fair value.
Furthermore, in some cases the majority of the fair value derived from a valuation technique with significant unobservable data may be attributable to observable inputs.
Consequently, the effect of uncertainty in determining unobservable inputs will generally be restricted to uncertainty about the overall fair value of the asset or liability being measured.
Details of the Groups valuation techniques can be found in note E1 q iii.
There have been no significant changes to the valuation techniques applied.

This relates to Old Mutual Wealth investments in illiquid property investment funds.
Observable inputs which can be utilised to value these funds are not readily available.
These investment funds back policyholder liabilities investment contracts for which there is a corresponding 464 million Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The backing of liabilities by assets means that the Group is not exposed to any profit or loss arising on the realisation of these investment funds.

When parameters are not amenable to statistical analysis, quantification of uncertainty is judgemental.
When the fair value of a financial asset or liability is affected by more than one unobservable assumption, the figures shown reflect the most favourable or most unfavourable change from varying the assumptions individually.
In respect of private equity investments which are included as investment securities, the valuations are assessed on an asset-by-asset basis using a valuation methodology appropriate to the specific investment, in line with industry guidelines.
In many of the methodologies, the principal assumption is the valuation multiple to be applied to the main financial indicators including, for example, multiples for comparable listed companies and discounts for marketability.
For asset-backed securities whose prices are unobservable, models are used to generate the expected value of the asset, incorporating benchmark information on factors such as prepayment patterns, default rates, loss severities and the historical performance of the underlying assets.
The models used are calibrated by using securities for which external market information is available.
181 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2013 E: Financial assets and liabilities continued E1: Group statement of financial position continued q Fair value disclosure for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value continued For structured notes and other derivatives, principal assumptions concern the future volatility of asset values and the future correlation between asset values.
These principle assumptions include credit volatilities and correlations used in the valuation of the structured credit derivatives.
For such unobservable assumptions, estimates are based on available market data, which may include the use of a proxy method to derive a volatility or correlation from comparable assets for which market data is more readily available, and examination of historical levels.
The table below summarise the significant input used to value instruments categorised as Level 3 hierarchy and their sensitivity to changes in the inputs used: Fair value measurement Fair values at Significant Range of estimates sensitivity to unobservable Type of financial 31 December 2013 Valuation unobservable for unobservable inputs at 31 December 2013 instruments m techniques input inputs m Assets Investments and 1,713 Discounted cash Valuation multiples Nedbank: Favourable: 212 securities: 2012: 1,128 flows DCF -14% to 14% 2012: 98 Correlations EBITDA multiple Emerging Markets: Unfavourable: 198 Volatilities -10% to 10% 2012: 101 Adjusted Net Asset Credit spreads Value Old Mutual Wealth: Dividend growth -10% to 10% Price earnings ratios rates Third party fund Internal rates of manager valuation return cost of capital suspended funds Inflation rates Exchange price Market adjusted price infrequently traded shares Loans and advances 2 Discounted cash Correlations -14% to 14% Unfavourable: nil 2012: 9 flows DCF 2012: 1 Volatilities Favourable: nil Credit spreads 2012: 1 Derivatives 8 Option pricing Interest rates -10% to 10% Favourable: 6 2012: nil model 2012: nil Volatilities Unfavourable: nil 2012: nil Liabilities Policyholder liabilities 932 Third party fund Interest rates -10% to 10% Favourable: 85 2012: 480 manager 2012: 64 Volatilities Valuation suspended Unfavourable: 74 funds linked to 2012: 64 asset valuation Option pricing model Financial instruments that are classified as Level 2 in terms of the fair value hierarchy tend to use market observable inputs such as risk free interest rates that are used to determine the value of the instruments.
Such instruments would include the value of bonds and debt instruments.
Financial instruments that are classified as Level 3 use more market unobservable inputs such as an entitys earnings and adjusted price earning volatilities.
The valuation of the majority of Level 3 instruments uses extensive inputs, which are unobservable in order to determine their value.
Alternative assumptions Accounting standards require consideration of the effect of reasonable possible alternative assumptions on the fair value of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities.
Alternative assumptions are assessed in terms of possible favourable and unfavourable changes in the key market inputs for the major types of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities, ranging from, for example, a 10% change in the price earnings multiple for equity securities, to a 25% change in the discount rates applied to debt securities and volatility assumptions in derivative contracts.
Changes in business risk inputs such as lapses and non-performance risk were also considered.
The impact of reasonable possible alternative assumptions on other comprehensive income was nil in both years.
Old Mutual plc 182 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financials iv Financial instruments designated as fair value through profit or loss Certain items in the Groups statement of financial position that would otherwise be categorised as loans and receivables under IAS 39 have been designated as fair value through profit or loss.
Information relating to the change in fair value of these items as it relates to credit risk is shown in the table below: m At 31 December 2013 At 31 December 2012 Maximum Current Maximum Current exposure to financial exposure to financial Change in fair value due to change in credit risk credit risk year Cumulative credit risk year Cumulative Loans and advances 3,434 1 4,068 2 2 Investments and securities 6,547 7 2 7,404 3 11 Other financial assets 19 8 24 10,000 16 2 11,496 1 13 Certain items in the Groups statement of financial position that would otherwise be categorised as financial liabilities at amortised cost under IAS 39 have been designated as fair value through profit or loss.
Information relating to the change in fair value of these items as it relates to credit risk is shown in the table below: m At 31 December 2013 At 31 December 2012 Current Contractual Current Contractual Change in fair value due to financial maturity financial maturity change in credit risk Fair value year Cumulative amount Fair value year Cumulative amount Borrowed funds 747 32 87 709 956 57 12 887 Amounts owed to bank depositors 5,179 1 4 5,177 5,728 2 4 5,718 5,926 31 83 5,886 6,684 59 16 6,605 The fair values of other categories of financial liabilities designated as fair value through profit or loss do not change significantly in respect of credit risk.
The change in fair value due to change in credit risk shown above is determined as the amount of the change in fair value of the instrument that is not attributable to changes in market conditions that give rise to market risk.
For loans and receivables that have been designated as at fair value through profit or loss, individual credit spreads are determined at inception as the difference between the benchmark interest rate and the interest rate charged to the client.
Subsequent changes in the benchmark interest rate and the credit spread give rise to changes in fair value of the financial instrument.
Loans and advances are reviewed for observable changes in credit risk, and the credit spread is adjusted at subsequent dates if there has been an observable change in credit risk relating to a particular loan or advance.
No credit derivatives are used to hedge the credit risk on any of the financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss.
The change in fair value due to credit risk of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss has been determined as the difference between fair values determined using a liability curve adjusted for credit and a risk-free liability curve.
This difference is cross-checked to market-related data on credit spreads, where available.
183 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2013 E: Financial assets and liabilities continued E1: Group statement of financial position continued r Fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities not measured at fair value The following table presents the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities, which are recognised at other than fair value, but for which fair value is provided.
Fair value is not the value ascribed to a financial asset or liability by management but is representative of what the market would be willing to pay for an asset or to settle or transfer the liability.

The fair value of investment in associated undertakings and joint ventures that is not categorised as designated at fair value through profit or loss approximates the carrying value of 103 million 2012: 91 million.
Of this, 10 million 2012: 26 million has been categorised as Level 2 and 93 million 2012: 65 million as Level 3.
The fair value of life assurance policyholder liabilities that are not categorised as designated at fair value through profit or loss is equal to the carrying value of 17,954 million 2012: 21,096 million and is categorised as Level 3. s Non-recurring assets and liabilities at fair value Non-recurring assets and liabilities recognised at fair value arise from assets and liabilities which have been acquired as a result of a business combination.
The assets and liabilities are valued based on expected future cash flows which will be received from the assets or paid to settle the liability which have been discounted at an appropriate rate.
The majority of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations are classified as Level 3.
Properties classified as held for sale are classified as Level 3.
The total non-recurring assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 amounts to 86 million 2012: 48 million.
Old Mutual plc 184 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financials t Risks Market risk i Overview Market risk is the risk of a financial impact arising from the changes in values of financial assets or financial liabilities from changes in equity, bond and property prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
Market risk arises differently across the Groups businesses depending on the types of financial assets and liabilities held.
Each of the Groups business units has an established set of policies, principles and governance processes to manage market risk within their individual businesses and in accordance with their local regulatory requirements.
A monitoring process established at a Group level overlies these individual approaches to the management of market risk.
The impacts of changes in market risk are monitored and managed through the business units own regulatory processes, with reference to the Groups economic capital processes, and by other means.
The sensitivity of the Groups earnings, capital position and embedded value is monitored through the Groups embedded value and economical capital reporting processes.
ii Insurance operations For the Groups insurance operations, equity, property, volatility and interest rate risk exposure are quantified in accordance with the Groups risk-based capital practices, which require sufficient capital to be held in excess of the statutory minimum.
Additional detail is provided in the Risk and Capital Management section.
In South Africa, the stock selection and investment analysis process is supported by a well-developed research function.
For fixed annuities, market risks are managed where possible by investing in fixed interest securities with a duration closely corresponding to those liabilities.
Market risk on policies that include specific guarantees and where shareholders carry the investment risk principally reside in the South African guaranteed non-profit annuity book, which is closely matched with gilts and semi-gilts.
Other non-profit policies are also suitably matched based upon comprehensive investment guidelines.
Market risk on with-profit policies with guarantees is managed through appropriate asset-liability matching, which includes hedging, as per the PPFM Principles and Practices of Financial Management.
In Old Mutual Wealths unit-linked assurance operations, policyholders carry the full market risk, with the only risk to the Group being asset-based fee risk from charges on policyholder funds.
In respect of Old Mutual Wealths shareholders funds, market risk is addressed in Old Mutual Wealths investment policy, which provides for very limited opportunity for entities to invest their shareholder capital in equities and other volatile assets.
Within Old Mutual Wealths Europe heritage business the Group has exposure to market risks arising from guarantees in the traditional life insurance business.
Typically the policyholder is guaranteed a certain return regardless of the asset return achieved during the term of the policy.
The Groups exposure to these guarantees is small and the risks are closely monitored and mitigated by applying asset and liability management techniques, ensuring that the proceeds from sale of assets are sufficient to meet the obligations to policyholders.
For the variable annuity business in Old Mutual Bermuda, market risk to shareholders arises from offering policyholder guaranteed returns.
In addition, these guarantees are US dollar denominated and a significant portion of the underlying assets invested in by Old Mutual Bermudas clients are exposed to currencies other than US dollar.
The market and currency risk is dynamically managed, with the overall exposures to changes in markets monitored closely so that timely actions can be taken to re-establish hedging as required.
Sensitivities to adverse impacts of changes in market prices arising in the Groups insurance operations are set out in the Old Mutual audited Market Consistent Embedded Value supplementary basis information section of the Annual Report and Accounts on pages 247 to 275. iii Banking operations The principal market risks arising in the Groups banking operations arise from: Trading risk in Nedbank Capital and Banking book interest rate risk from repricing and or maturity mismatches between onand off-balance sheet components in all banking businesses.
A comprehensive market risk framework is used to ensure that market risks are understood and managed.
Governance structures are in place to achieve effective independent monitoring and management of market risk.
185 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2013 E: Financial assets and liabilities continued E1: Group statement of financial position continued t Risks continued Trading risk Market risk exposures from trading activities at Nedbank Capital are measured using Value-at-Risk VaR, supplemented by sensitivity analysis and stress-scenario analysis, and limit structures are set accordingly.
The VaR risk measure for Nedbank estimates the potential loss in pre-tax profit over a given holding period for a specified confidence level.
The VaR methodology is a statistically defined, probability-based approach that takes into account market volatilities as well as risk diversification by recognising offsetting positions and correlations between products and markets.
Risks can be measured consistently across all markets and products, and risk measures can be aggregated to arrive at a single risk number.
The one-day 99% VaR number used by Nedbank represents the overnight loss that has less than 1% chance of occurring under normal market conditions.
By its nature, VaR is only a single measure and cannot be relied upon on its own as a means of measuring and managing risk.
m Average Minimum Maximum Year-end At 31 December 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 Historical VaR one-day, 99% by risk type Foreign exchange 0.1 0.3 0.0 0.1 0.5 1.1 0.1 0.1 Interest rate 0.3 0.6 0.1 0.3 0.6 1.1 0.6 0.4 Equity product 0.1 0.3 0.0 0.1 0.3 0.9 0.1 0.2 Other 0.2 0.3 0.1 0.1 0.4 0.5 0.2 0.3 Diversification 0.3 0.5 0.3 0.4 Total VaR exposure 0.4 1.1 0.2 0.5 0.7 2.4 0.6 0.6 Banking book interest rate risk Banking book interest rate risk at Nedbank arises because: The bank writes a large amount of prime-linked assets and raises fewer prime-linked deposits Funding is prudently raised across the curve at fixed-term deposit rates that re-price only on maturity Short-term demand-funding products re-price to different short-end base rates Certain ambiguous maturity accounts are non-rate-sensitive The bank has a mismatch in net non-rate-sensitive balances, including shareholders funds that do not re-price for interest rate changes.
Nedbank uses standard analytical techniques to measure interest rate sensitivity within its banking book.
This includes static re-price gap analysis and a point-in-time interest income stress testing for parallel interest rate moves over a forward-looking 12-month period.
At 31 December 2013 the sensitivity of the banking book to a 1% instantaneous reduction in interest rates would have led to a reduction in net interest income and equity of 54 million 2012: 59 million.
The table below shows the re-pricing profile of Nedbanks banking book: m Up to 3 3 to 6 6 months 1 to 5 Over Trading and At 31 December 2013 months months to 1 year years 5 years non-rate Total Interest rate re-pricing gap Total assets 29,940 1,099 450 2,632 1,065 7,825 43,011 Total liabilities and shareholders funds 26,479 2,025 1,602 989 224 11,692 43,011 Interest rate hedging activities 497 1,572 1,035 1,418 692 Repricing profile 2,964 646 117 225 149 3,867 Cumulative repricing profile 2,964 3,610 3,493 3,718 3,867 Expressed as a % of total assets 6.9% 8.4% 8.1% 8.6% 9.0% m Up to 3 3 to 6 6 months 1 to 5 Over Trading and At 31 December 2012 months months to 1 year years 5 years non-rate Total Interest rate re-pricing gap Total assets 33,489 1,156 1,316 3,358 1,366 8,914 49,599 Total liabilities and shareholders funds 30,353 1,971 1,643 1,275 177 14,180 49,599 Interest rate hedging activities 425 1,593 959 2,057 920 Repricing profile 3,561 778 632 26 269 5,266 Cumulative repricing profile 3,561 4,339 4,971 4,997 5,266 Expressed as a % of total assets 7.2% 8.7% 10.0% 10.1% 10.6% The analysis indicates that the maturity profile of financial assets is broadly matched to the financial liabilities due to derivative hedging activities.
This means that in the event of increasing interest rates, net interest income will remain stable in the short-term.
Old Mutual plc 186 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financials u Currency translation risk The Group is exposed, from an earnings and capital management perspective, to movements in exchange rates from reducing the sterling value of assets and earnings denominated in foreign currencies.
The functional currencies of the Groups principal overseas operations are South African rand, US dollar and euro.
The Group reduces this risk through the use of currency swaps, currency borrowings and forward foreign exchange contracts.
Suck risk mitigation techniques are reflected in the currency analysis that follows.
The derivative instruments are stated at their fair value and not their notional amounts.
Therefore, this table does not necessarily reflect the results of risk management activities undertaken by the Group.
187 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2013 E: Financial assets and liabilities continued E1: Group statement of financial position continued v Master netting or similar agreements This table is presented to provide further information on financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements.
The Group offsets financial assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position when it has a legal enforceable right to do so and intends to settle on a net basis or simultaneously.
Certain master netting agreements do not provide the Group with the current legally enforceable right to offset the instruments.
The majority of these transactions are governed by the principles of ISDA or similar type of agreements.
These agreements aim to protect the parties in the case of default.
The following tables present information on the potential effect of netting offset arrangements after taking into consideration these types of agreements.

Old Mutual plc 188 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financials w Capital management The Group actively manages its capital with a focus on capital efficiency and effective risk management.
The capital objectives are to maintain the Groups ability to continue as a going concern while supporting the optimisation of return relative to the risks.
The Group ensures that it can meet its expected capital and financing needs at all times having regard to the Groups business plans, forecasts and strategic initiatives.
The Groups overall capital risk appetite is set with reference to the requirements of the relevant stakeholders and seeks to: Maintain sufficient, but not excessive, financial strength to support stakeholder requirements Optimise debt to equity structure to enhance shareholder returns Retain financial flexibility by maintaining liquidity including unutilised committed credit lines.
The primary sources of capital used by the Group are equity shareholders funds, preference shares, subordinated debt and borrowings.
Alternative resources are utilised where appropriate.
Targets are established in relation to regulatory solvency, ratings, liquidity and dividend capacity and are a key tool in managing capital in accordance with our risk appetite and the requirements of our various stakeholders.
The individual companies in the Group are subject to regulatory capital requirements at an individual level.
In addition the Group as a whole is subject to the solvency requirements of the Financial Groups Directive FGD as implemented by the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA.
Further detail as to the Groups regulatory capital surplus and that of subsidiaries is provided in the Annual Report and Accounts.
As at the date of issue of these financial statements the unaudited proforma surplus was estimated to be 2.1 billion 2012: 2.0 billion.
The FGD position will be submitted to the PRA by 30 April 2014.
It is critical that the Groups capital management policies are aligned with the Groups overall strategy, business plans and risk appetite.
The Groups Capital Management Committee GCMC reviews the capital structure regularly.
Further detail on the Capital Management of the Group is included in the Risk and Capital Management section of the Annual Report and Accounts.
E2: Credit risk Overall exposure to credit risk The Group is exposed to banking credit risk from lending and other financing activities, through its exposure to Nedbank.
Nedbanks lending portfolio forms a substantial part of the Groups loans and advances, as analysed in Note E3.
Credit risk represents the most significant risk type facing Nedbank, accounting for 60% of its economic capital requirements.
Nedbanks credit risk profile is managed in terms of its credit risk management framework, which encompasses comprehensive credit risk policy, mandate limits and governance structures, and is approved by the Nedbank Board.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the financial loss from defaults.
The Groups exposure and the credit rating of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
The Group does not have significant credit exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics.
The credit risk on liquid funds, derivative financial instruments and portfolios of debt and similar securities is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies and limits are placed on exposures to below investmentgrade holdings.
The Group is also exposed to the risk of credit defaults and movements in credit spreads from our insurance businesses.
This includes counterparty default risk, which arises mainly from lending activities, and reinsurance and hedging arrangements.
Other than the above, the Group has other limited credit risk exposures in respect of amounts due from policyholders, intermediaries and reinsurers.
Credit risk exposure from our property and casualty business is small and none of the life assurance operations cedes significant risk through reinsurance.
Loans to policyholders are secured on the surrender value of the relevant policies.

i Financial collateral The Group takes financial collateral to support exposures in its banking and securities and lending activities.
Collateral held includes cash and debt securities.
Cash collateral is included as part of cash equivalents.
These transactions are entered into under terms and conditions that are standard industry practice to securities borrowing and lending activities.
ii Non-financial collateral The Group takes other physical collateral to recover outstanding lending exposures in the event of the borrower being unable or unwilling to fulfil its obligations.
This includes mortgage over property both residential and commercial, and liens over business assets including, but not limited to plant, vehicles, aircraft, inventories and trade debtors and guarantees from parties other than the borrower.
Should a counterparty be unable to settle its obligations, the Group takes possession of collateral as full or part settlement of such amounts.

At 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012, the Group has not provided any cash collateral for security lending arrangements.
E6: Derivative financial instruments assets and liabilities The Group utilises derivative instruments for both hedging and non-hedging purposes.
The derivative instruments become in-the-money or out-of-the-money as a result of fluctuations in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates or asset prices relative to their terms.
The aggregate contractual or notional amount of derivative financial instruments on hand, the extent to which instruments are in-the-money or out-of-the-money and, therefore, the aggregate fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly from time to time.
The Group undertakes transactions involving derivative financial instruments with other financial institutions.
Management has established limits commensurate with the credit quality of the institutions with whom it deals and manages the resulting exposures such that a default by any individual counterparty is unlikely to have a materially adverse impact on the Group.
The following tables provide a detailed breakdown of the Groups derivative financial instruments outstanding at year-end.
These instruments allow the Group and its customers to transfer, modify or reduce their credit, equity market, foreign exchange and interest rate risks.

E8: Insurance and investment contracts Life assurance Classification of contracts Contracts sold as life assurance with the exception of unit-linked assurance contracts are categorised into insurance contracts, contracts with a discretionary participation feature or investment contracts, being in accordance with the classification criteria set out in the following paragraphs.
For the Groups unit-linked assurance business, contracts are separated into an insurance component and an investment component known as unbundling and each unbundled component is accounted for separately in accordance with the accounting policy for that component.
Unitlinked assurance contracts are savings contracts with a small or insignificant component of insurance risk.
Contracts under which the transfer of insurance risk to the Group from the policyholder is not significant are classified as investment contracts.
Such contracts include savings and or investment contracts sold without life assurance protection.
Contracts under which the Group accepts significant insurance risk from another party the policyholder by agreeing to compensate the policyholder or other beneficiary if a specified uncertain future event the insured event adversely affects the policyholder are classified as insurance contracts.
Insurance risk is risk other than financial risk.
Contracts accounted for as insurance contracts include life assurance contracts and savings contracts providing more than an insignificant amount of life assurance protection.
Financial risk is the risk of a possible future change in one or more of a specified interest rate, security price, security index, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or rates, a credit rating or credit index, or other variable, provided, in the case of a non-financial variable, that the variable is not specific to a party to the contract.
Contracts with a discretionary participating feature are those under which the policyholder holds a contractual right to receive additional payments as a supplement to guaranteed minimum payments.
These additional payments, the amount or timing of which is at the Groups discretion, represent a significant portion of the total contractual payments and are contractually based on 1 the performance of a specified pool of contracts or a specified type of contract, 2 realised and or unrealised investment returns on a specified pool of assets held by the Group or 3 the profit or loss of the Group.
Investment contracts with discretionary participating features, which have no life assurance protection in the policy terms, are accounted for in the same manner as insurance contracts.
195 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2013 E: Financial assets and liabilities continued E8: Insurance and investment contracts continued Life assurance continued Premiums on life assurance Premiums and annuity considerations receivable under insurance contracts and investment contracts with a discretionary participating feature are stated gross of commission and exclude taxes and levies.
Premiums in respect of linked insurance contracts are recognised when the liability is established.
Premiums in respect of other insurance contracts and investment contracts with a discretionary participating feature are recognised when due for payment.
Outward reinsurance premiums are recognised when due for payment.
Amounts received under investment contracts other than those with a discretionary participating feature and unit-linked assurance contracts are recorded as deposits and credited directly to investment contract liabilities.
Revenue on investment management service contracts Fees charged for investment management services provided in conjunction with an investment contract are recognised as revenue as the services are provided.
Initial fees, which exceed the level of recurring fees and relate to the future provision of services are deferred and amortised over the anticipated period in which services will be provided.
Fees charged for investment management service contracts by asset management businesses are also recognised on this basis.
Claims paid on life assurance Claims paid under insurance contracts and investment contracts with a discretionary participating feature include maturities, annuities, surrenders, death and disability payments.
Maturity and annuity claims are recorded as they fall due for payment.
Death and disability claims and surrenders are accounted for when notified.
Reinsurance recoveries are accounted for in the same period as the related claim.
Amounts paid under investment contracts other than those with a discretionary participating feature and unit-linked assurance contracts are recorded as deductions from investment contract liabilities.
Insurance contract provisions Insurance contract provisions for African businesses have been computed using a gross premium valuation method.
Provisions in respect of African business have been made in accordance with the Financial Soundness Valuation basis as set out in the guidelines issued by the Actuarial Society of South Africa in Standard of Actuarial Practice SAP 104 2012.
Under this guideline, provisions are valued using realistic expectations of future experience, with margins for prudence and deferral of profit emergence.
Provisions for investment contracts with a discretionary participating feature are also computed using the gross premium valuation method in accordance with the Financial Soundness Valuation basis.
Surplus allocated to policyholders but not yet distributed related to these contracts is included as part of life assurance policyholder liabilities.
Reserves on immediate annuities and guaranteed payments are computed on the prospective deposit method, which produces reserves equal to the present value of future benefit payments.
For other territories, the valuation bases adopted are in accordance with local actuarial practices and methodologies.
Derivatives embedded in an insurance contract are not separated and measured at fair value if the embedded derivative itself qualifies for recognition as an insurance contract.
In this case the entire contract is measured as described above.
The Group performs liability adequacy testing at a business unit level on its insurance liabilities to ensure that the carrying amount of its liabilities less related deferred acquisition costs and intangible assets is sufficient in view of estimated future cash flows.
When performing the liability adequacy test, the Group discounts all contractual cash flows and compares this amount to the carrying value of the liability at discount rates appropriate to the business in question.
Where a shortfall is identified, an additional provision is made.
The provision estimation techniques and assumptions are periodically reviewed, with any changes in estimates reflected in profit or loss as they occur.
Whilst the directors consider that the gross insurance contract provisions and the related reinsurance recoveries are fairly stated on the basis of the information currently available to them, the ultimate liability will vary as a result of subsequent information and events and may result in significant adjustments to the amount provided.
In respect of the South Africa life assurance, shadow accounting is applied to insurance contract provisions where the underlying measurement of the policyholder liability depends directly on the value of owner-occupied property and the unrealised gains and losses on such property, which are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The shadow accounting adjustment to insurance contract provisions is recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the unrealised gains or losses on owner-occupied property backing insurance contract provisions are also recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Financial guarantee contracts are recognised as insurance contracts.
Liability adequacy testing is performed to ensure that the carrying amount Old Mutual plc 196 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financials of the liability for financial guarantee contracts is sufficient.
Investment contract liabilities Investment contract liabilities in respect of the Groups non-linked business are recorded at amortised cost unless they are designated at fair value through profit or loss in order to eliminate or significantly reduce a measurement or recognition inconsistency, for example where the corresponding assets are recorded at fair value through profit or loss.
Investment contract liabilities in respect of the Groups linked business are recorded at fair value.
For such liabilities, including the deposit component of unbundled unit-linked assurance contracts, fair value is calculated as the account balance, which is the value of the units allocated to the policyholder, based on the bid price of the assets in the underlying fund adjusted for tax.
Investment contract liabilities measured at fair value are subject to a deposit floor such that the liability established cannot be less than the amount repayable on demand.
Acquisition costs Acquisition costs for insurance contracts comprise all direct and indirect costs arising from the sale of insurance contracts.
As the gross premium valuation method used in African territories to determine insurance contract provisions makes implicit allowance for the deferral of acquisition costs, no explicit deferred acquisition cost asset is recognised in the statement of financial position for the contracts issued in these areas.
Deferral of costs on insurance business in other territories is limited to the extent that they are deemed recoverable from available future margins.
Costs incurred in acquiring investment management service contracts Incremental costs that are directly attributable to securing an investment management service contract are recognised as an asset if they can be identified separately and measured reliably and it is probable that they will be recovered.
Deferred acquisition costs represent the contractual right to benefit from providing investment management services and are amortised as the related revenue is recognised.
Costs attributable to investment management service contracts in the asset management businesses are also recognised on this basis.
General insurance Contracts under which the Group accepts significant insurance risk from another party and are not classified as life insurance are classified as general insurance.
All classes of general insurance business are accounted for on an annual basis.
Premiums in general insurance Premiums stated gross of commissions exclude taxes and levies and are accounted for in the period in which the risk commences.
The proportion of the premiums written relating to periods of risk after the reporting date is carried forward to subsequent accounting periods as unearned premiums, so that earned premiums relate to risks carried during the accounting period.
Outward reinsurance premiums are accounted for in the same accounting period as the premiums for the related direct insurance.
Claims on general insurance Claims incurred comprise the settlement and handling costs of paid and outstanding claims arising during the year and adjustments to prior year claim provisions.
Outstanding claims comprise claims incurred up to, but not paid, at the end of the accounting period, whether reported or not.
Outstanding claims do not include any provision for possible future claims where the claims arise under contracts not in existence at the reporting date.
The Group performs liability adequacy testing at a business unit level on its claim liabilities to ensure that the carrying amount of its liabilities less related deferred acquisition costs and the unearned premium reserve is sufficient in view of estimated future cash flows.
Whilst the directors consider that the gross provisions for claims and the related reinsurance recoveries are fairly stated on the basis of the information currently available to them, the ultimate liability will vary as a result of subsequent information and events and may result in significant adjustments to the amount provided.
Adjustments to the amounts of claims provisions established in prior years are reflected in the financial statements for the period in which the adjustments are made and disclosed separately if material.
The methods used and estimates made are reviewed regularly.
Acquisition costs on general insurance Acquisition costs, which represent commission and other related expenses, are deferred and amortised over the period in which the related premiums are earned.
Reinsurance The Group cedes reinsurance in the normal course of business for the purpose of limiting its net loss potential through the diversification of its risks.
Assets, liabilities and income and expense arising from ceded reinsurance contracts are presented separately from the related assets, liabilities, income and expense from the related insurance contracts because the reinsurance arrangements do not relieve the Group from its direct obligations to its policyholders.
Only rights under contracts that give rise to a significant transfer of insurance risk are accounted for as reinsurance assets.
Rights under contracts that do not transfer significant insurance risk are accounted for as financial instruments.
197 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2013 E: Financial assets and liabilities continued E8: Insurance and investment contracts continued Reinsurance premiums for ceded reinsurance are recognised as an expense on a basis that is consistent with the recognition basis for the premiums on the related insurance contracts.
For general insurance business, reinsurance premiums are expensed over the period that the reinsurance cover is provided based on the expected pattern of the reinsured risks.
The unexpensed portion of ceded reinsurance premiums is included in reinsurance assets.
The net amounts paid to a reinsurer at the inception of a contract may be less than the reinsurance assets recognised by the Group in respect of its rights under such contracts.
Any difference between the premium due to the reinsurer and the reinsurance asset recognised is included in profit or loss in the period in which the reinsurance premium is due.
The amounts recognised as reinsurance assets are measured on a basis that is consistent with the measurement of the provisions held in respect of the related insurance contracts.
Reinsurance assets include recoveries due from reinsurance companies in respect of claims paid.
Reinsurance assets are assessed for impairment at each reporting date.
An asset is deemed impaired if there is objective evidence, as a result of an event that occurred after its initial recognition, that the Group may not recover all amounts due and that the event has a reliably measurable impact on the amounts that the Group will receive from the reinsurer.
a Policyholder liabilities The Groups insurance and investment contracts are analysed as follows: m At 31 December 2013 At 31 December 2012 Gross Reinsurance Net Gross Reinsurance Net Life assurance policyholder liabilities Insurance contracts 11,953 119 11,834 14,457 129 14,328 Investment contracts Unit-linked investment contracts and similar contracts 60,769 1,620 59,149 56,886 1,159 55,727 Other investment contracts 786 786 937 937 Discretionary participating investment contracts 7,460 7,460 7,710 7,710 Outstanding claims 173 22 151 198 19 179 81,141 1,761 79,380 80,188 1,307 78,881 General insurance liabilities Claims incurred but not reported 49 7 42 42 3 39 Unearned premiums 92 49 43 99 45 54 Outstanding claims 191 58 133 205 51 154 332 114 218 346 99 247 Total policyholder liabilities 81,473 1,875 79,598 80,534 1,406 79,128 Of the 1,875 million 2012: 1,406 million included in reinsurers share of life assurance policyholder and general insurance liabilities is an amount of 1,774 million 2012: 1,314 million which is classified as current, the remainder being non-current.

The Group acknowledges that for general insurance the unearned premium provision, which will be recognised as earned premium in the future, will most likely not lead to claim cash outflows equal to this provision.
The Group has estimated the potential claim outflows that may be associated with this unearned premium.

Insurance risk includes mortality and morbidity risk in the case of life assurance or risk of loss from fire, accident, or other source in the case of general insurance.
Insurance risk arises through exposure to unfavourable claims experience on life assurance, critical illness and other protection business and exposure to unfavourable operating experience in respect of factors such as persistency levels and management expenses.
Uncertainty in persistency, expenses and mortality and morbidity claim rates, relative to the actuarial assumptions made in the pricing process, may prevent the Group from achieving its profit objectives.
For accounting purposes insurance risk is defined as risk other than financial risk.
Contracts issued by the Group may include both insurance and financial risk: contracts with significant insurance risk are classified as insurance contracts, while contracts with no or insignificant insurance risk are classified as investment contracts.
The Group has developed a risk policy which sets out the practices which are used to manage insurance risk and the management information and stress testing requirements.
The policy is cascaded to all entities across the Group who each have their own risk policy suite aligned to the Group.
As well as management of persistency, expense and claims experience, the risk policy sets requirements and standards on matters such as underwriting and claims management practices and the use of reinsurance to mitigate insurance risk.
The insurance risk profile and experience is closely monitored to ensure that the exposure remains acceptable.
The financial impact of insurance risk events is examined through stress tests carried out within the MCEV and IFRS sensitivities, ICA and Economic Capital assessment.
Mortality and morbidity Mortality and morbidity risk is the risk that death, critical illness and disability claims are higher than expected and recovery rates on disability are lower than expected.
Possible causes are new and unexpected epidemics and widespread changes in lifestyle such as eating, smoking and exercise habits.
Higher than expected claims levels will reduce expected emerging profits.
For contracts where the insured risk is survival, the most significant factor that is likely to adversely impact the claims experience is continued improvement in medical science and social conditions that increase longevity.
For unit-linked contracts, a risk charge is applied to meet the expected cost of the insured benefit in excess of the unit value.
This risk charge can be altered in the event of significant changes in the expectation for future claims experience, subject to Treating Customers Fairly principles.
The operations manage mortality and morbidity risks through its underwriting policy and external reinsurance arrangements where its policy is to retain certain types of insurance risks within specified maximum single event loss limits.
Exposures above accepted limits are transferred to reinsurance counterparties.
Persistency Persistency risk is the risk of higher than expected policyholder surrenders, transfers or premium cessation on contracts, leading to a reduction in financial profit.
In order to limit this risk to an acceptable level, products including charging and commission structures are designed to limit the risk of direct financial loss on surrender, subject to Treating Customers Fairly principles.
Persistency statistics are monitored monthly and a detailed persistency analysis at a product level is carried out on an annual basis.
Management actions may be triggered if statistics show significant adverse movement or emerging trends in experience.
Expenses Expense risk is the risk that actual expenses and expense inflation exceed expected levels.
This may result in emerging profit falling below the Groups profit objectives.
Expense levels are monitored quarterly against budgets and forecasts.
An activity-based costing process is used to allocate costs relating to processes and activities to individual product lines.
Some products structures include maintenance charges.
These charges are reviewed annually in light of changes in maintenance expense levels.
This review may result in changes in charge levels, subject to Treating Customers Fairly principles.
Tax Tax risk is the risk that insufficient tax is collected from the policyholders because the projected taxation basis for basic life assurance business is incorrect, resulting in contracts being incorrectly priced.
Tax risk also represents potential changes in the interpretation or application of prevailing tax legislation as paid by either policyholders or shareholders, resulting in higher taxes reducing profitability or increasing shareholder tax burdens.
The taxation position of the operations is projected annually and tax changes will result in changes to new business pricing models as part of the annual control cycle.
High-risk issues and emerging trends are reported internally on a quarterly basis.
g Sensitivity analysis life assurance Changes in key assumptions used to value insurance contracts would result in increases or decreases to the insurance contract provisions recorded, with impact on profit loss and or shareholders equity.
The effect of a change in assumption is mitigated by the offset partial or full to the bonus stabilisation reserve in the case of smoothed bonus products in South Africa.
201 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2013 E: Financial assets and liabilities continued E8: Insurance and investment contracts continued g Sensitivity analysis life assurance continued The net increase or decrease to insurance contract provisions recorded at 31 December 2013 has been estimated as follows: % m m m Emerging Old Mutual Old Mutual Assumption Change Markets Wealth Bermuda Mortality and morbidity rates assurance 10 256 2 Mortality rates annuities 10 42 Discontinuance rates 10 7 1 3 Expenses maintenance 10 52 3 Emerging Markets The changes in insurance contract liabilities shown are calculated using the specified increase or decrease to the rates, with no change in charges paid by policyholders.
The insurance contract liabilities recorded for the Emerging Market business are also impacted by the valuation discount rate assumed.
Lowering this rate by 1% with a corresponding reduction in the valuation inflation rate assumption would result in a net increase to the insurance contract liabilities, and decrease to profit, of 6 million 2012: 39 million.
This impact is calculated with no change in charges paid by policyholders.
The 2013 impact is lower than the 2012 impact due to further management actions taken to reduce the impact of changing interest rates on operating profit.
It should be noted that where the assets and liabilities of a product are closely matched eg.
non-profit annuity business or where the impact of a lower valuation discount rate is hedged or partially hedged, the net effect has been shown since the asset movement fully or partially offsets the liability movement.
Old Mutual Wealth The changes in insurance contract liabilities shown are calculated independently using the specified increase or decrease to the rates, with no change in premiums paid by policyholders.
The assumption changes have no impact on the linked UK business.
Whole of Life is the main product group affected by the lapse assumption change.
This is because the policies have the longest duration and represent close to 89% of the reserve.
The main product groups impacted by the expense, mortality and morbidity sensitivities are Whole of Life and Accelerated Critical Illness.
In the Old Mutual Wealth business, non-linked liabilities are well matched by gilts so that the net impact of a valuation interest rate change taking asset and liability movement into account is negligible.
Old Mutual Bermuda Lapses and partial withdrawals have the largest impact where increased activity reduces the guarantee portion of the business since less death and living benefit exposure is expected in the future.
Mortality plays a much smaller part in Bermuda since all the business is accumulation savings type business.
Increased deaths do accelerate payment of guaranteed minimum death benefits but there is a comparable release of reserve on the maturity guarantee providing an offset about 78% of the variable annuity business has both death living benefits.
h Sensitivity analysis general insurance An increase of 10% in the average cost of claims would require the recognition of an additional loss of 49 million 2012: 40 million net of reinsurance.
Similarly, an increase of 10% in the ultimate number of claims would result in an additional loss of 49 million 2012: 40 million net of reinsurance.
The majority of the Property & Casualty contracts are classified as short-tailed, meaning that most claims are settled within a year after the loss date.
This contrasts with long-tailed classes where the claims take longer to materialise and settle.
For Property & Casualty, long-tailed business broadly comprises of accident & health, engineering, guarantee, liability and transportation classes.
In total the long-tail business comprises less than 10 per cent of an average years claim costs.
i Reinsurance assets credit risk None of the Groups reinsurance assets are either past due or impaired.
Of the reinsurance assets shown in the statement of financial position, all are considered investment grade with the exception of 73 million of unrated exposures 2012: 134 million.
Collateral is not taken against reinsurance assets or deposits held with reinsurers other than in limited circumstances.

Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short-, mediumand long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities, continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Individual businesses separately maintain and manage their local liquidity requirements according to their business needs, within the overall liquidity framework established by Old Mutual plc.
The Group continues to meet Group and individual entity capital requirements, and day-to-day liquidity needs through the Groups available cash resources and, if necessary, available credit facilities.
Given the nature of the Groups investments and securities, liquid resources are generally speaking readily available, as the Group holds large portfolios of highly marketable securities, for example listed bonds, actively traded pooled investments, equities and cash and cash equivalents.
Whilst most of the Groups policyholder and banking liabilities are generally repayable on demand, the Groups expectation is that policyholders and banking depositors will only require funds on an ongoing basis.
Cash resources and other liquid assets are maintained in the event of a need for additional liquidity.
Information on the nature of the investments and securities held is given in note E4.
The Groups existing revolving credit facility of 800 million 2012: 1,200 million does not mature until April 2016 2012: April 2016.
Details, together with information on the Groups borrowed funds, are given in note E9.
The key information reviewed by the Groups Executive Directors and Executive Committee, together with the Groups Capital Management Committee, is a detailed management report on the Groups and holding companys current and planned capital and liquidity position together with summary information on the current and planned liquidity positions of the Groups operating segments.
Forecasts are updated regularly based on new information received and also as part of the Groups annual business planning cycle.
The Group and holding companys liquidity and capital position and forecast are presented to the Old Mutual plc Board of directors on a regular basis.
Group operating segments are required, both in terms of their local requirements and in accordance with direction from the holding company, to establish their own processes for managing their liquidity and capital needs and these are subject to review by their local oversight functions, with representation from the Group.
Further information on liquidity and holding company cash flow is contained in other sections of this Annual Report and Accounts.
The Group does not have material liquidity exposure to special purpose entities or investment funds.
The contractual maturities of the Groups financial liabilities are set out in notes E6, E8, E9 and E10 to the Group financial statements.
Old Mutual plc 206 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financials F: Other statement of financial position notes F1: Goodwill and other intangible assets a Goodwill and goodwill impairment Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking is recognised as an asset at the date that control is achieved the acquisition date.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirers previously-held equity interest in the acquiree if any over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
If the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirers previouslyheld equity interest if any, this excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment at least once annually.
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
On loss of control of a subsidiary undertaking, any attributable goodwill is included in the determination of any profit or loss on disposal.
On disposal of a business, where goodwill on acquisition is allocated to the entire cash-generating units CGU, goodwill is allocated to the disposal on a relative basis.
Goodwill is allocated to one or more CGUs, being the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets.
The directors annually test for impairment of each CGU or group of CGUs containing goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, at a level that is no larger than that of the Groups identified operating segments for the purposes of segment reporting.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU or group of CGUs exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Impairment losses relating to goodwill are not reversed.
b Present value of acquired in-force for insurance and investment contract business The present value of acquired in-force for insurance and investment contract business is capitalised in the consolidated statement of financial position as an intangible asset.
The capitalised value is the present value of cash flows anticipated in the future from the relevant book of insurance and investment contract policies acquired at the date of the acquisition.
This is calculated by performing a cash flow projection of the associated life assurance fund and book of in-force policies in order to estimate future after tax profits attributable to shareholders.
The valuation is based on actuarial principles taking into account future premium income, mortality, disease and surrender probabilities, together with future costs and investment returns on the assets supporting the fund.
These profits are discounted at a rate of return allowing for the risk of uncertainty of the future cash flows.
The key assumptions impacting the valuation are discount rate, future investment returns and the rate at which policies discontinue.
The asset is amortised over the expected profit recognition period on a systematic basis over the anticipated lives of the related contracts.
The amortisation charge is stated net of any unwind in the discount rate used to calculate the asset.
The recoverable amount of the asset is re-calculated at each reporting date and any impairment losses recognised accordingly.
c Other intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination Contractual banking and asset management customer relationships, relationships with distribution channels and similar intangible assets, acquired as a part of a business combination, are capitalised at their fair value, represented by the estimated net present value of the future cash flows from the relevant relationships acquired at the date of acquisition.
Brands and similar items acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at their fair value based on a relief from royalty valuation methodology.
Subsequent to initial recognition such acquired intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as set out below: Distribution channels 10 years Customer relationships 10 years Brand 15 20 years The estimated useful life is re-evaluated on a regular basis.
d Internally developed software Internally developed software is amortised over its estimated useful life, where applicable.
Such assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Software is recognised in the statement of financial position if, and only if, it is probable that the relevant future economic benefits attributable to the software will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably.
Costs incurred in the research phase are expensed whereas costs incurred in the development phase are capitalised subject to meeting specific criteria, set out in the relevant accounting guidance.
The main criteria being that future economic benefits can be identified as a result of the development expenditure.
Amortisation is charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the relevant software, which range between two and five years.
207 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2013 F: Other statement of financial position notes continued F1: Goodwill and other intangible assets continued e Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.
For properties reclassified during the year from property, plant and equipment to investment properties, any revaluation gain arising is initially recognised in profit or loss to the extent that impairment losses were previously recognised.
Any residual excess is taken to the revaluation reserve.
Revaluation deficits are recognised in the revaluation reserve to the extent of previously recognised gains and any residual deficit is accounted for in profit or loss.
Investment properties that are reclassified to owner-occupied property are revalued at the date of transfer, with any difference being taken to profit or loss.

An impairment charge is recognised when the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value.
Emerging Markets and Old Mutual Wealth Emerging Markets and Old Mutual Wealth CGUs generate revenues through their life assurance and asset management businesses.
The value-in-use calculations for the life assurance operations are determined using the reported embedded value methodology plus a discounted cash flow calculation for the value of new business.
The value of new business represents the present value of future profits from expected new business.
Embedded value represents the shareholders interest in the life assurance business and is calculated in accordance with MCEV principles.
The methodology and significant assumptions underlying the determination of embedded value is disclosed in the supplementary information shown on pages 255 to 263.
The differences between the key assumptions applied in the current year and in the prior year are disclosed on page 266.
The cash flows attributable to the value of new business are determined with reference to latest approved three-year business plans.
Projections beyond the plan period are extrapolated using an inflation based growth assumption.
The value-in-use calculations for the asset management operations are similarly determined based on discounted cash flow models derived from the latest approved three-year business plans.
An additional two years of projections beyond the plan period are extrapolated using inflation based growth rates.
The cash flows are discounted at economic profit rates applicable to each individual CGU.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations for the Emerging Markets and Old Mutual Wealth CGUs are as follows: The growth rate The rate used is an inflation-based growth assumption, which varies by CGU and is based on external market factors particular to that CGU.
Emerging Markets applied the growth rate of 9.7% 2012: 9.6% to both its life assurance business and asset management business in Mexico and Colombia.
Old Mutual Wealth applied a weighted average calculation to determine the growth rate of 2.1% 2012: 2.2% The discount rate The applied rate used the relevant 10-year government bond rate as a starting point, which was adjusted for an equity market risk premium and other relevant risk adjustments, which were determined using market valuation models and other observable references.
Rates applied were 13.3% 2012: 13.2% for Emerging Markets and 9.6% 2012: 9.3% for Old Mutual Wealth.
The directors are satisfied that any reasonable change in the assumptions would not cause the recoverable amounts of the Emerging Markets and Old Mutual Wealth CGUs to fall below their carrying amounts.
Nedbank The impairment test in respect of the Nedbank CGU has been performed by comparing the CGUs net carrying amount to its estimated value-in-use.
The value-in-use has been determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation are the discount rate and growth rate, which are based on market factors relevant to that CGU.
A 5.0% 2012: 5.5% growth rate was applied to extrapolate cash flows for an additional two years beyond the three-year business plan period.
A terminal value, using the same growth rate, is added for the value of cash flows beyond five years.
The discount rate applied was approximately 12.0% 2012: 11.2%.
The directors are satisfied that a reasonable change in assumptions would not cause the recoverable amount of the goodwill to fall below the carrying amount.
US Asset Management The impairment test in respect of the USAM CGU has been performed by comparing the CGUs net carrying amount to its value-in-use determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations for USAM are as follows: The three-year business plan plus two further years have growth rate assumptions based on managements expectation of performance over this period.
A terminal value, using a long-term growth rate of 4.0% 2012: 4.0% is added for the value of cash flows beyond five years.
The assumed long-term growth rate was determined with reference to nominal historical gross domestic product GDP growth and the outlook for nominal GDP growth for the US The risk-adjusted discount rate applied was 12.0% 2012: 12.0%.

The Group uses revised weighted average effective ownership interests when calculating the non-controllable interest applicable to the adjusted operating profit of its Southern African businesses.
These reflect the legal ownership of the businesses following the implementation for Black Economic Empowerment BEE schemes in 2005.
In accordance with IFRS accounting rules the shares issued for BEE purposes are deemed to be, in substance, options.
Therefore the effective ownership interest of the minorities reflected in arriving at profit after tax in the consolidated income statement is lower than that applied in arriving at adjusted operating profit after tax.
In 2013 the increase in adjusted operating profit attributable to non-controlling interests as a result of this was 20 million 2012: 25 million.

b Consolidation considerations for structured entities In structured entities voting rights are not the predominant factor in deciding who controls the entity but rather the Groups exposure to the variability of returns from these entities.
The Group acts as fund manager to a number of investment funds.
Determining whether the Group controls such an investment fund usually focuses on the assessment of decision making rights as fund manager, the investors rights to remove the fund manager and the aggregate economic interests of the Group in the fund in the form of interest held and exposure to variable returns.
In most instances the Groups decision-making authority, in capacity as fund manager, with regard to these funds is regarded to be well-defined.
Discretion is exercised when decisions regarding the relevant activities of these funds are being made.
For funds managed by the Group where the investors have the right to remove the Group as fund manager without cause, the fees earned by the Group are considered to be market related.
These agreements include only terms, conditions or amounts that are customarily present in arrangements for similar services and level of skills negotiated on an arms length basis.
The Group has concluded that it acts as agent on behalf of the investors in all instances.
The Group is considered to be acting as principal where Old Mutual is the fund manager and is able to make the investment decisions on behalf of the unit holders earn a variable fee and there are no kick out rights that would remove the Group as fund manager.
This is considered to be a critical accounting judgment and is discussed in A3 d. There have been no changes in facts or circumstances which have changed the Groups conclusion on the consolidation of funds.
The Group has not provided any non-contractual support to any consolidated or unconsolidated structured entities.
The Group has committed to providing certain liquidity facilities for certain securitisation vehicles.
c Securitisation vehicles consolidated in the Groups statement of financial position Nedbank Securitisations The Group through Nedbank uses securitisation primarily as a funding diversification tool and to add flexibility in mitigating structural liquidity risk.
Nedbank currently has three active securitisation transactions: Synthesis Funding Limited Synthesis, an assetbacked commercial paper ABCP programme launched in 2004 GreenHouse Funding Pty Limited, Series 1 GreenHouse, a residential mortgage-backed securitisation programme launched in December 2007 restructured in November 2012 and Precinct Funding 1 RF Limited Precinct, a commercial mortgage-backed securitisation programme launched in 2014.
These vehicles are the full extent of the Groups current securitisation exposure.

Old Mutual plc 224 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financials H: Other notes H1: Post-employment benefits The Group operates a number of pension schemes around the world.
These schemes have been designed and are administered in accordance with local conditions and practices in the countries concerned and include both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes.
The assets of these schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
Pension costs and contributions relating to defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
Actuarial advice confirms that the current level of contributions payable to each pension scheme, together with existing assets, are adequate to secure members benefits over the remaining service lives of participating employees.
The schemes are reviewed at least on a triennial basis or in accordance with local practice and regulations.
In the intervening years, the actuary reviews the continuing appropriateness of the assumptions applied.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the projected benefit obligations of the Groups pension schemes vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which they operate.

Share options are granted under a service and non-market based performance condition.
Such conditions are not taken into account in the grant date fair value measurement of the share options granted.
There are no market conditions associated with the share option grants.
The grant date for the UK and South African plan awards is deemed to be 1 January in the year prior to the date of issue.
As such the Group is required to estimate, at the reporting date, the number and fair value of the options that will be granted in the following year.

The grant date for all other awards is the award issue date.
227 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2013 H: Other notes continued H2: Share-based payments continued c Share-based payment arrangements relating to US Asset Management During the year ended 31 December 2013, US Asset Management had the following share-based payment arrangements: Acadian Asset Management AAM Class B equity interests in AAM acquired by employees during 2007 entitled the participating employees to 28.57% of the earnings of AAM in excess of $120 million and to a liquidation preference proportionate to their shareholding.
In consideration for the equity acquired, the participating employees agreed to forego a portion of existing long-term incentive payments owed.
The difference between the carrying amount of this consideration and the fair value of the interest acquired was treated as share-based compensation expense in 2007.
Fair value was determined based on the discounted projected future cash flows of AAM.
Effective 1 April 2011, certain terms of the plan were modified to provide for greater participation by Class B interest holders in Acadians profits and cash distributions.
In addition, provisions were added to provide greater liquidity and transferability for the holders of Class B interests.
The plan has since included a feature whereby participating employees may sell their equity back to OMAM based on a multiple of prior 12 month earnings above a Class A equity holders minimum preference amount, subject to certain restrictions.
The surrender-date fair value of the Class B interests prior to these modifications amounted to $7.2 million and this amount was reclassified from non-controlling interests to cash-settled share-based payments liabilities as a result of the liquidity features added.
The excess of the fair value of the modified award over its premodification fair value was $21.1 million and was accounted for as incremental cash-settled share-based payments compensation expense and liability.
As the implementation of the modifications were subject to a two-year vesting period, the incremental cash-settled share-based payments compensation expense and subsequent revaluations of the liability each period to its fair value, along with the reclassification of the $7.2 million pre-modification fair value of the award from non-controlling interests as a liability, was recognized rateably over that period commencing 1 April 2011.
The remaining $35.3 million of the initial fair value of the equity-settled plan that was surrendered by Class B interest holders was transferred to controlling interest equity at the conclusion of the vesting period.
IPO Incentive Plan During 2011, a stock-based compensation plan was implemented for certain key employees of US Asset Management in connection with the stated intention of exploring a potential initial public offering IPO of the business.
The plan is designed to reward participants for achievement of strategic objectives and metrics and value creation over the period of exploring an initial public offering.
The awards will consist of a mix of cash, payable in the first quarter of 2014, and a deferred award in Old Mutual plc shares or shadow shares, which will be granted during the second quarter of 2014, and vest rateably over 3 years from that date.
The awards are currently accounted for as a share-based payment liability, with an aggregate value of $6.8 million at 31 December 2013 2012: $3.3 million.
At grant date, any portion payable in forfeitable shares of Old Mutual plc will be reclassified to the share-based payments reserve.
The expense recognised during 2013 in relation to this plan was $3.7 million 2012: $2.3 million, with $0.2 million paid out in relation to terminated participants.
OMAM Affiliate Equity Plans Equity granted during the year to employees of firms participating in the OMAM Affiliate Equity Plans vests three to five years from the date of grant, conditional upon continued employment over this period.
Grant date fair value and fair value used for reassessment was determined based on a multiple of prior year earnings.
Under the terms of the arrangements, participating employees may sell their equity back to Old Mutual which acts as a buyer of last resort at a fixed multiple of prior year earnings, subject to certain restrictions.
Accordingly, the schemes are accounted for as cash-settled share-based payments, despite the fact the initial purchase and or grants of equity are settled in equity instruments.

US Asset Management annual bonus awards The OMAM Affiliate Equity Plans are incorporated into annual bonus awards of employees at participating firms, which are to be settled partly in cash and partly in equity.
The level of bonus is contingent upon current year financial and individual performance and therefore, the vesting period for bonus equity to be granted during 2014 in respect of the 2013 financial year has been determined to commence from 1 January 2013.
It is anticipated that instruments with a fair value of $15.0 million 2012: $11.1 million and 2011: $15.8 million will be granted during 2014 to firms participating in the OMAM Affiliate Equity Plans based on 2013 financial performance.

Expected dividends were not incorporated into the measurement of fair value where the holder of the restricted share is entitled to dividends throughout the vesting period.
e Annual bonus awards The UK and South Africa Plan Awards give rise to annual bonus awards.
The level of annual bonus awards is contingent upon the satisfactory completion of individual and company performance targets, measured over the financial year prior to the date the employees receive the award.
The accounting grant date for the South African and UK annual bonus plans other than the new joiner and newly qualified grants has therefore been determined as 1 January in the year prior to the date of issue of the grants.
The Group anticipates awards under the South African scheme of 9,331,684 restricted shares 2012: 9,337,461.
The restricted shares have been valued using a share price of R32.79 2012: R24.49.
The Group estimate of the total fair value of the annual bonus expected to be paid in the form of options and forfeitable shares is outlined below.
The fair value is determined by making an estimate of the level of bonus to be paid out following the attainment of personal and company performance conditions.

These amounts represent assets that have been transferred but do not qualify for derecognition under IAS 39.
Contingent liabilities tax The Revenue authorities in the principal jurisdictions in which the Group operates South Africa and the United Kingdom routinely review historic transactions undertaken and tax law interpretations made by the Group.
The financial statements accordingly include provisions that reflect the Groups assessment of liabilities which might reasonably be expected to materialise.
231 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2013 H: Other notes continued H4: Contingent liabilities continued Nedbank litigation There are a number of legal or potential claims against Nedbank and its subsidiary companies, the outcome of which cannot at present be foreseen.
As previously disclosed, the largest of these potential actions are claims in the High Court against Nedbank by certain shareholders in Pinnacle Point Group Ltd, alleging that Nedbank had a legal duty of care to them arising from a share swap transaction.
In 2013, two of these claims of R147 million and of R802 million were dismissed by the North Gauteng High Court.
The only claim remaining is for R355 million.
Originally these shareholders and others lodged proceedings with the Securities Regulation Panel SRP for an order declaring that an affected transaction took place.
The SRP ruled that no affected transaction took place.
The last remaining claimant brought an application to the South Gauteng High Court for the review of the SRP ruling.
This application was dismissed with costs on 15 November 2013.
The applicant filed a notice to apply for leave to appeal this judgment, which Nedbank will oppose.
During 2011, further actions were instituted against Nedbank Ltd by other stakeholders for R210 million and by Absa Bank Limited for R773 million.
In both these actions Nedbank have filed exceptions against the claims.
Nedbank Ltd and its legal advisers remain of the opinion that the remaining claims are ambitious, and that the remaining claimants will have great difficulty succeeding.
Consumer protection Old Mutual is committed to supporting its customers in meeting their lifetime goals and treating customers fairly is central to how our businesses operate.
We routinely engage with customers and regulators to ensure that we meet this commitment, but there is the risk of regulatory intervention across various jurisdictions, giving rise to the potential for customer redress which can result in retrospective changes to policyholder benefits, penalties or fines.
Where this occurs, the Group makes financial provision for the related costs.
H5: Commitments Capital commitments The Groups capital commitments are detailed in the table below.
The Groups management is confident that future net revenues and funding will be sufficient to cover these commitments.

Those assets that are held in a fiduciary capacity are not included in these financial statements.
Some of these arrangements involve the Group accepting targets for benchmark levels of returns for the assets under the Groups care.
These services give rise to the risk that the Group will be accused of misadministration or under-performance.

H9: Events after the reporting date On 28 February 2014, the Group announced the acquisition of Intrinsic Financial Services Limited, the third largest adviser network in the UK with more than 3,000 advisers, both restricted and independent.
This will enable the Old Mutual Wealth business to provide advice to UK retail customers.
The purchase of Intrinsic Financial Services Limited is a critical part of the Old Mutual Wealth strategy to create a leading wealth management business that combines financial advice, investment solutions and high quality asset management to deliver first class outcomes for our customers.
On 28 February 2014, the Group announced that during 2014 it intends to proceed with an Initial Public Offering of a minority stake in its US Asset Management Business USAM, subject to market conditions.
The offering will enhance USAMs financial and operating flexibility to deploy capital to continue to grow and further develop the business.
This transaction will require a registration statement to be filed with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The registration statement will include additional information.
The announcement was made pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 135 under the U. S. Securities Act 1933.
This disclosure does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities, and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of that jurisdiction.
In line with Nedbanks scheduled capital plans, there was a full capital redemption of NED8, the R1.7 billion unsecured subordinated note that qualified as Tier 2 capital under Basel II, with effect from 8 February 2014.
This event is not an adjusting post balance sheet event.
Old Mutual plc 234 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financials I: Discontinued operations and disposal groups held for sale I1: Discontinued operations Discontinued operations relate to the results of the Groups Swedish, Danish and Norwegian life businesses, collectively Nordic.
The disposal of Nordic was completed on 21 March 2012 following shareholder and regulatory approval and was reported up until that date.
The Group continues to incur costs that are directly related to the sale of Nordic.
These costs relate to the transition of IT and other services, previously provided by Nordic to the wider Group, back to the Group.
These costs are included in the expenses related to the discontinued operations.
The profit on disposal of discontinued operations for the year ending 31 December 2013 was recognised following the finalisation of the transfer of Old Mutual Guodian Life Assurance Company Ltd, the Groups Chinese joint venture, from Nordic to Old Mutual Life Assurance Company South Africa Limited.

These arise from sale warranties and indemnities that are typical in transactions of this nature, including in respect of certain litigation including class actions and regulatory enforcement actions arising from events that occurred before completion of the sale.
The residual commitments are in effect for varying periods of time.
The sale agreement contemplated that Harbinger would establish certain internal reinsurance arrangements after completion, which were subject to regulatory approval.
If such regulatory approval was not forthcoming, there was potential for a reduction in the purchase price of US Life of up to a maximum of $50 million.
In July 2012, Harbinger filed a lawsuit against the Group, claiming payment of a purchase price adjustment of $50 million.
The Group has filed its defence and is vigorously defending this claim.
In view of the ongoing uncertainty and the Groups current assessment of this claim, the Group has not raised a provision against this exposure.
J: Changes in accounting policies J1: Accounting policies adopted for the year ended 31 December 2013 Several new accounting standards are applicable to the Group for the year ended 31 December 2013, with restatement of the comparative information for the year ended 31 December 2012 and of the opening statement of financial position as at 1 January 2012, as required.
The standards that were relevant and have required restatement include IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, IAS 19 Revised 2011 Employee Benefits, IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements.
Three other standards and amendments have also been applied for the first time in 2013 but these are disclosure standards and have not required a restatement of the statement of financial position.
These include IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Amended 2011, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interest in Other Entities and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement and IAS 36 Amended Impairment of Assets.
Refer to note A5 for further information.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements replaces IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and SIC-13 Jointly Controlled Entities and removes the option to account for joint arrangements using proportionate consolidation.
Jointly controlled entities that meet the definition of a joint arrangement under IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements must now be accounted for using the equity method.
This did not have a material impact on the Groups statement of financial position.
The following standards adopted by the Group had an impact on the financial statements: Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income The amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income require that an entity present separately the items of other comprehensive income OCI that may be reclassified to profit or loss in the future, from those that will never be reclassified to profit or loss.
The amendment affected presentation only and had no impact on the shareholders equity or profit.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits Revised 2011 The Group has adopted IAS 19 Employee Benefits Revised 2011 with a date of initial application of 1 January 2013.
The key amendments are: The corridor method has been removed and all actuarial gains and losses are required to be recognised in OCI rather than in profit or loss.
Instead, interest is recognised on the net defined benefit liability or asset in profit or loss, calculated using the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation Past service costs arising from plan amendments or curtailment are now recognised in profit or loss at the earlier of when the amendment occurs or when the related restructuring or termination cost is recognised.
The option to amortise such cost over future years has also been eliminated Administration costs, other than costs of managing plan assets, are recognised in the profit and loss when the service is provided.
The change in accounting policy has been applied retrospectively and, as a result, the comparative information for the year ended 31 December 2012 has been restated accordingly.
The major impact of the adoption of the standard was an increase in operating and administrative expenses and a net increase in OCI.
The overall impact on the Group was a decrease in equity, an increase in the assets and an increase in the liabilities of the Group.
The standard affects the accounting for certain defined pension schemes in Emerging Markets, Nedbank and Old Mutual plc.
The transitional adjustment, applied to the opening statement of financial position as at 1 January 2013, had an effect of decreasing equity by 17 million, increasing total assets by 81 million and increasing total liabilities by 98 million.
Old Mutual plc 236 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financials IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements The Group has early adopted IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements with a date of initial application of 1 January 2013.
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements introduces a single control model that applies to all entities, including special purpose entities.
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements replaces the parts of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements that dealt with consolidated financial statements and SIC-12 Consolidation Special Purpose Entities.
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements changes the definition of control such that an investor controls an investee when it has power over the investee, when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and when it has the ability to use its power over the investee to affect those returns.
To meet the definition of control in IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, all three of these criteria must be met.
The implementation of this standard did not have a significant financial impact on the Groups assessment of its interests in investment funds, but it did increase the number of investment funds consolidated.
The principal effect was a gross up of the consolidated statement of financial position for the difference between the value of the newly consolidated assets and liabilities and the carrying value of the Groups interest, and the equal and opposite liability for the interests of external parties in these investment funds.
The transitional adjustment, applied to the opening statement of financial position as at 1 January 2013, had an effect of decreasing noncontrolling interest by 8 million, increasing total assets by 3,384 million and increasing total liabilities by 3,392 million.
The Group has only considered the consolidation suite of standards for interests that existed at 1 January 2013.
The change in accounting policy has been applied retrospectively and, as a result, the comparative information for the year ended 31 December 2012 and the opening position at 1 January 2012 have been restated accordingly.
Effect of the adoption of IAS 19 Revised and IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements The following tables summarise the impact of the restatements in the financial statements: m Adjustments Adjustments As previously for adoption for adoption Year ended 31 December 2012 reported of IAS 19 of IFRS 10 As restated Consolidated income statement Profit after tax from continuing operations 923 1 8 914 Profit after tax for the financial year 1,487 1 8 1,478 Non-controlling interests 314 8 306 Consolidated statement of comprehensive income 1 Total other comprehensive income for the financial year 811 4 807 1 Total comprehensive income for the financial year 676 3 8 671 Reconciliation of adjusted operating profit to profit after tax Adjusting items 459 8 467 Adjusted operating profit after tax attributable to equity holders of the parent 842 1 841 Consolidated statement of financial position Total assets 143,497 81 3,384 146,962 Total liabilities 133,699 98 3,392 137,189 Equity attributable to ordinary shareholders of the parent 7,833 17 7,816 Non-controlling interests 1,965 8 1,957 1 The comparative information has been restated to reflect the fact that all movements on the share-based payment reserve are reflected directly in equity and no longer in other comprehensive income.
