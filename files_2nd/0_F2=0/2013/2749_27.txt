Significant accounting policies specific to one note are included with that note.
Accounting policies relating to non-material items are not included in these financial statements.
This section also includes new EU endorsed accounting standards, amendments and interpretations and their expected impact, if any, on the performance of the Group.
1.1 Significant Accounting Policies a Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of Cairn Energy PLC Cairn or the Group for the year ended 31 December 2013 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 17 March 2014.
Cairn is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom whose shares are publicly traded.
The registered office is located at 50 Lothian Road, Edinburgh, Scotland, EH3 9BY.
Cairn prepares its financial statements on a historical cost basis, unless accounting standards require an alternate measurement basis.
Where there are assets and liabilities calculated on a different basis this fact is disclosed either in the relevant accounting policy or in the notes to the financial statements.
The Groups financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.
b Accounting standards Cairn prepares its financial statements in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as adopted by the EU.
The Groups financial statements are also consistent with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as they apply to accounting periods ended 31 December 2013 with the exception of IFRS 10, 11 and 12 which Cairn will adopt from 1 January 2014.
Effective 1 January 2013, Cairn has adopted the following standards impacting the Groups accounting policies and or presentation in the Groups financialstatements: IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement: effective 1 January 2013 IAS 1 amended Presentation of Financial Statements: effective 1 January 2013 IAS 19 revised Employee Benefits: effective 1 January 2013 The amendments to accounting policies will result in minor changes in disclosures within the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income and notes to these financial statements but have no material impact on the results for the year.
Other changes to IFRS effective 1 January 2013 have no impact on Cairns accounting policies or financial statements.
The following new standards, issued by the IASB and endorsed by the EU, have yet to be adopted by the Group : IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: effective 1 January 2014 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: effective 1 January 2014 IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in Other Entities effective 1 January 2014 IAS 27 amendment Separate Financial Statements effective 1 January 2014 IAS 28 amendment Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures effective 1 January 2014 The adoption of these new standards will result in the Groups participating interests in material exploration and development licences, currently disclosed as joint ventures, being re-classified as joint operations.
No other changes to the financial statements are expected.
No other standards issued by the IASB and endorsed by the EU, but not yet adopted are expected to have any material impact on the Groups financial statements.
c Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the results of Cairn Energy PLC and its subsidiary undertakings to the Balance Sheet date.
Where subsidiaries follow differing accounting policies from those of the Group, those accounting policies have been adjusted to align with those of the Group.
Inter-company balances and transactions between group companies are eliminated on consolidation, though foreign exchange differences arising on inter-company balances between subsidiaries with differing functional currencies are not offset.
The results of subsidiaries acquired in any year are included in the Income Statement and Statement of Cash Flows from the effective date of acquisition while the results of subsidiaries disposed of during the year are included in the Income Statement and Statement of Cash Flows to the date at which control passes from theGroup.
d Joint Ventures Cairn participates in several unincorporated joint ventures which involve the joint control of assets used in the Groups oil and gas exploration and development activities.
Cairn recognises its share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenditure of jointly controlled assets in which the Group holds an interest, classified in the appropriate Balance Sheet and Income Statement headings.
Cairns principal licence interests are jointly controlled assets.
A list of Cairns oil and gas licence interests is given on page 147.
108 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Strategic Review Leadership and Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Section 1 Basis of Preparation Continued 1.1 Significant Accounting Policies Continued e Foreign currencies The financial statements are presented in US dollars US$, the functional currency of most companies in the Group.
In the financial statements of individual Group companies, Cairn translates foreign currency transactions into the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the transaction date.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the Balance Sheet date.
Exchange differences arising are taken to the Income Statement except for those incurred on borrowings specifically allocable to development projects, which are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
The Group maintains the accounts of the parent and subsidiary undertakings in their functional currency.
Where applicable, the Group translates subsidiary accounts into the presentation currency, US$, using the closing rate method for assets and liabilities which are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the Balance Sheet date and rates at the date of transactions for Income Statement accounts.
Cairn takes exchange differences arising on the translation of net assets of Group companies whose functional currency is non-US$ directly to reserves.
Rates of exchange to US$1 were as follows: YTD YTD Closing Average Closing Average 2013 2013 2012 2012 Sterling 0.604 0.639 0.615 0.631 Indian Rupee 61.810 58.316 54.995 53.284 Norwegian Kroner 6.068 5.871 5.567 5.814 Euro 0.728 0.730 0.758 0.777 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 109 Section 2 Oil and Gas Assets and Related Goodwill This section focuses on the assets in the Balance Sheet which form the core of Cairns business.
This includes exploration and appraisal assets in frontier and mature basins, development assets in the UK and Norwegian North Sea and goodwill relating to the Groups oil and gas assets that has arisen on past corporate transactions.
This section quantifies the financial impact of the operations for the year fully described in the operational review on pages 30 to 37.
Significant accounting judgements in this section: Indicators of impairment for intangible exploration appraisal assets Cairn has reviewed intangible exploration appraisal assets for indicators of impairment and concluded that such indicators did exist on one of the Groups assets.
Impairment tests were therefore conducted on the asset where indicators of impairments were identified.
Impairment testing of goodwill The Group recognised goodwill on business combinations in the prior year see Appendix 1.
This goodwill was largely attributable to deferred tax provided on the temporary taxable difference between the fair value of the assets acquired and their underlying tax base cost.
When testing goodwill for impairment at each subsequent reporting date, the remaining deferred tax provision relating to the business combinations is included in the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill is allocated.
Key estimates and assumptions in this section: Impairment testing of intangible exploration appraisal assets Where an indicator of impairment is identified on an intangible exploration appraisal asset, an impairment test is conducted by comparing the carrying value of the assets within the cash-generating unit containing the asset to the recoverable amount of those assets.
The cash-generating unit represents the smallest group of assets that are expected to generate separately identifiable cash flows.
These include exploration appraisal assets and any development producing assets within that area.
The recoverable amount of the assets in the cash-generating unit represents its fair value less costs of disposal.
Where there is no verifiable third party arms-length transaction from which a market value can be obtained, the fair value of an asset is calculated using discounted cash flow models.
This represents a fair value measurement categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Where the cash-generating unit contains assets with discovered resource, fair value is calculated using forecast net cash flows based on estimated production profiles and cost and oil price assumptions over the expected life of the field discounted to the Balance Sheet date.
Where resource is prospective, fair value represents the expected net present value of the prospect, risk-weighted for future exploration success.
Given the inherent risk associated with exploration activities, valuations of prospective resource are highly subjective.
The key assumptions used in the Groups discounted cash flow models reflect past experience and take account of external factors.
These assumptions are: Long-term oil price of US$90 per boe escalated at 2.5% per annum: Reserve estimates of discovered resource 2P and 2C based on P50 reserve estimates: Production profiles based on Cairns internal estimates: Cost profiles for the development of the field and subsequent operating costs supplied by the operator and escalated at 2.5% per annum: and Discount rates of 10% for the Groups UK and Norwegian North Sea assets.
Impairment testing of goodwill The goodwill arising from past corporate transactions in the UK and Norwegian North Sea is tested for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount against the carrying value of the underlying oil and gas assets in the UK and Norwegian North Sea operating segment.
As with intangible exploration appraisal assets, fair value less cost of disposal are based on discounted cash flow models as no recent third party transactions exist on which a reliable market-based fair value can be established.
The key assumptions are therefore consistent with those for testing intangible exploration appraisal assets.
Key estimates and assumptions used in the measurement of deferred tax liabilities, which are included in the cash generating unit, will also impact on the goodwill impairment test.
110 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Strategic Review Leadership and Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Section 2 Oil and Gas Assets and Related Goodwill Continued 2.1 Intangible Exploration Appraisal Assets Accounting Policy Cairn follows a successful efforts based accounting policy for oil and gas assets.
Costs incurred prior to obtaining the legal rights to explore an area are expensed immediately to the Income Statement.
Expenditure incurred on the acquisition of a licence interest is initially capitalised on a licence-by-licence basis.
Costs are held, un-depleted, within intangible exploration appraisal assets until such time as the exploration phase on the licence area is complete or commercial reserves have been discovered.
Exploration expenditure incurred in the process of determining oil and gas exploration targets is capitalised initially within intangible exploration appraisal assets and subsequently allocated to drilling activities.
Exploration appraisal drilling costs are initially capitalised on a well-by-well basis until the success or otherwise of the well has been established.
The success or failure of each exploration appraisal effort is judged on a well-by-well basis.
Drilling costs are written off on completion of a well unless the results indicate that hydrocarbon reserves exist and there is a reasonable prospect that these reserves are commercial.
Following appraisal of successful exploration wells, if commercial reserves are established and technical feasibility for extraction demonstrated, then the related capitalised intangible exploration appraisal costs are transferred into a single field cost centre within property, plant & equipment development producing assets, after testing for impairment see below.
Where results of exploration drilling indicate the presence of hydrocarbons which are ultimately not considered commercially viable, all related costs are written off to the Income Statement.
Impairment Intangible exploration appraisal assets are reviewed regularly for indicators of impairment and tested for impairment where such indicators exist.
An indicator that one of the Groups assets may be impaired is most likely to be one of the following: There are no further plans to conduct exploration activities in the area: Exploration drilling in the area has failed to discover commercial reserve volumes: or Development proposals for appraisal assets in the pre-development stage indicate that it is unlikely that the carrying value of the exploration appraisal asset will be recovered in full.
In such circumstances the intangible exploration appraisal asset is allocated to property, plant & equipment development producing assets within the same cash generating unit and tested for impairment.
Any impairment arising is recognised in the Income Statement for the year.
Where there are no development producing assets within the cash generating unit, the excess of the carrying amount of exploration appraisal asset over its recoverable amount are charged immediately to the Income Statement.

Costs of US$23.6m relating to certain licences in Greenland where no future exploration activity is planned have been charged to the Income Statement as unsuccessful exploration costs.
Disposals in 2012 relate to proceeds received from Statoil to cover back costs and bonuses under the terms of the farm down agreement for the Pitu block in NorthWest Greenland.
Republic of Ireland additions of US$8.6m in 2013 represent costs incurred post the farm-in completed in the year.
Africa Morocco, Senegal and Mauritania The first well in Cairns Atlantic Margin drilling campaign offshore Morocco was drilled on the Foum Draa block and completed in early 2014.
Subsequently the rig moved to the Juby Maritime block, also offshore Morocco and completed the second exploration well in March 2014.
Both wells failed to encounter commercial hydrocarbons and were plugged and abandoned.
Costs of US$107.4m incurred to 31 December 2013 have been charged to the Income Statement: US$93.1m relating to the Foum Draa well and US$14.3m to Juby Maritime costs incurred in advance of drilling.
Further additions in the year of US$70.5m include back-costs paid of US$27.0m as Cairn farmed-in to the C19 licence offshore Mauritania and costs incurred in relation to the current drilling programme.
An additional US$41.6m was incurred in three blocks offshore Senegal, including back-costs following the farm-in completed in the year and subsequent additions, of which US$17.4m will be recovered following completion of a farm-down to ConocoPhillips see section 6.2.
Mature Basin UK and Norwegian North Sea Acquisition costs of US$976.5m in 2012 represent the fair value of exploration and appraisal assets added through the acquisitions of Agora Oil & Gas AS now Capricorn Norge AS US$411.0m and Nautical Petroleum plc US$565.5m.
Additions in the current year of US$160.5m 2012: US$82.1m relate to expenditure on exploration and appraisal wells drilled and new prospects added to the portfolio.
From the date of acquisition, Cairn has participated in 12 exploration and appraisal wells: seven in 2012 and five in 2013.
Four of these wells were successful, of which three are in the Skarfjell field.
A summary of the unsuccessful costs, by well, is as follows: 2013 2012 US$m US$m UK: Timon 5.5 29.4 Tybalt 50.2 Bardolph 0.3 22.3 Spaniards East 0.3 7.3 Other non-drilling costs 1.7 Norway: Frode 53.5 Klara 18.6 Kakelborg 1.4 34.1 Geite 15.7 Unsuccessful exploration costs 81.3 159.0 During 2013, Cairn and its joint venture partners received approval of the development plan of the Kraken field, and consequently costs of US$298.7m were transferred from intangible exploration appraisal assets to property, plant & equipment development producing assets, after testing for impairment.
The similar transfer in 2012 of US$70.4m related to the Mariner field.
During the year end impairment review of exploration appraisal assets, an indicator of impairment was identified on the Catcher asset which consists of the main Catcher project, satellite discoveries and additional prospects.
Revisions to the project economics, with lower resource estimates and increased cost assumptions, have reduced the recoverable amount of the asset below its carrying value.
The subsequent impairment test conducted resulted in a US$251.4m charge to the Income Statement.
Details of the sensitivity of the impairment charge to changes in assumptions are given in section 2.5.
Exploration costs remaining at the year end include the net book value of the Catcher and Skarfjell fields and associated satellite prospects.
The Group added additional prospects to its existing exploration portfolio through the acquisition of non-operated interests in the Klara and Grosbeak prospects in the Norwegian North Sea and through licences awarded under the latest rounds in the UK and Norway.

The disposal of Mariner resulted in a US$24.7m loss to the Income Statement.
Costs of the Kraken field were transferred to development producing assets in 2013 and this asset represents the carrying value as at 31 December 2013.

As all Cairn joint ventures are jointly controlled assets, these commitments include Cairns share of the capital commitments of the joint ventures themselves.
The capital commitments for intangible exploration appraisal assets relate to operations in Morocco, Senegal, Republic of Ireland and the UK and Norwegian NorthSea and do not reflect additional or reduced commitments relating to transactions that completed after the balance sheet date see section 6.2.
Cairn has entered into operating lease agreements to contract two rigs for drilling in the North Atlantic and Africa.
The drilling rig commitments disclosed do not reflect the rig costs of US$37.3m that Cairn expects to recover from joint venture partners.
Capital commitments for property, plant & equipment development producing assets include US$330.0m relating to a lease commitment due over the next 10years.
The lease term for this asset has not yet commenced.
The Group has no further material capital expenditure committed at the Balance Sheet date.
Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 113 Section 2 Oil and Gas Assets and Related Goodwill Continued 2.4 Intangible Assets Goodwill Accounting policy Goodwill Cairn allocates the purchase consideration on the acquisition of a subsidiary to the assets and liabilities acquired on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the assets and liabilities is recognised as goodwill.
Any goodwill arising is recognised as an asset and is subject to annual review for impairment.
Goodwill is written off where circumstances indicate that the recoverable amount of the underlying cash generating unit including the asset may no longer support the carrying value of goodwill.
Any such impairment loss arising is recognised in the Income Statement for the year.
Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.
In testing for impairment, goodwill arising on business combinations is allocated from the date of acquisition to the group of cash-generating units representing the lowest level at which it will be monitored.
Cairns policy is to monitor goodwill at operating segment level before combining segments for reporting.
The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit, or group of cash generating units, within the segment is based on its fair value less costs of disposal, using estimated cash flow projections over the licence period of the exploration assets risk-weighted for future exploration success.
The key assumptions are sensitive to market fluctuations and the success of future exploration drilling programmes.
The most likely factor which will result in a material change to the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is the result of future exploration drilling, which will determine the licence areas future economic potential.

Details of the corporate acquisitions can be found in Appendix 1.
This goodwill is fully allocated to the UK and Norwegian North Sea operating segment.
At 31 December 2012, the goodwill impairment test did not identify any impairment, with the carrying value of the UK and Norwegian North Sea operating segment being equal to the recoverable amount of the underlying assets, notably the Catcher, Kraken and Skarfjell assets.
The impairment of the Catcher asset in 2013 see section 2.1 reduces both the carrying value of the operating segment and its recoverable amount in equal measures.
The release of deferred tax provided on the Catcher asset however, increases the carrying value of the segment in relation to the recoverable amount.
Additionally, the recognition of tax credits for field allowances to which the Kraken asset is eligible, further increases the carrying value of the segment.
As a result, the recoverable amount of the assets can no longer support their carrying value and at 31 December 2013, the year end impairment test identified an impairment and a charge of US$324.2m was recorded.
The remaining carrying value of goodwill at 31 December 2013 is supported by fair value less costs of disposal of the Groups UK and Norwegian North Sea assets, principally through its three main projects Catcher, Kraken and Skarfjell.
Additional fair value is attributed to other exploration prospects that have been identified in this segment.
The values are calculated internally and the key assumptions used in the valuations include a high level of subjectivity reflecting the nature of oil and gas exploration activities.
114 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Strategic Review Leadership and Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Section 2 Oil and Gas Assets and Related Goodwill Continued 2.5 Impairment Sensitivity Analysis At 31 December 2013, impairment was recognised on one intangible exploration appraisal asset in the UK North Sea and on goodwill allocated to the UK and Norwegian North Sea operating segment.
The key assumptions that Cairn has used to value its assets are subjective and reasonable changes to the oil price assumption, discount rate or oil and gas reserve estimates could materially impact the impairment charges recognised in the year.
Cairn has run sensitivities on its oil price assumption of US$90 per boe looking at a variance of US$5 above and below and discount rate sensitivities of 8% and 12% either side of the 10% currently used.
The impact of these changes on the carrying value of the Groups Catcher asset and goodwill is summarised below: Increase Decrease in Intangible Exploration Increase Appraisal Decrease in assets Goodwill US$m US$m Decrease in oil price assumption to US$85 per boe 27.0 11.5 Increase in oil price assumption to US$95 per boe 59.0 123.5 Decrease in discount rate to 8% 73.0 174.1 Increase in discount rate to 12% 25.0 46.8 The Groups proved and probable and contingent reserve estimates are based on P50 probabilities.
P10 and P90 estimates are also produced but would not provide a reasonable estimate to be used in calculating the fair value of the Groups assets.
Cost assumptions are based on the latest estimates provided by the operators and are consistent with the forecast costs included in field development plans whereapplicable.
Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 115 Section 3 Financial Assets, Working Capital and Provisions Cairns financial assets and liquid cash resources ensure the Group is fully funded to meet its current exploration programme.
This section focuses on those assets, together with the working capital position of the Group and provisions that exist at the year end.
Significant accounting judgements in this section: Impairment of Available-for-sale Financial Asset At 30 June 2013, the Groups 10.3% shareholding in Cairn India Limited, classified as a non-current available-for-sale financial asset, had suffered a significant fall in value from that at the date of initial recognition in 2011.
Though the fall is not expected to be a permanent diminution, the size of the deficit was such that cumulative mark-to-market valuation movements recognised in Other Comprehensive Income were recycled to the Income Statement as an impairment.
Key estimates and assumptions in this section: There were no key estimations or assumptions in this section.
3.1 Available-for-sale Financial Assets Accounting policy The Groups available-for-sale financial assets represent listed equity shares which are held at fair value the quoted market price.
Movements in the fair value during the year are recognised directly in equity and are disclosed in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The cumulative gains or losses that arise on subsequent disposal of available-for-sale assets are recycled through the Income Statement.
At each reporting date, the fair value of the financial asset is compared to the value at the date of its initial recognition for signs of a prolonged or significant deficit in the valuation, which would indicate impairment.
Where impairment is identified, cumulative losses recognised in Other Comprehensive Income are recycled to the Income Statement.
In the event of a subsequent recovery in the valuation of the asset, there is no reversal of impairment: any such post-impairment gains are recognised as a surplus through other comprehensive income.
Any further impairment losses will be recognised through the Income Statement.
Listed equity shares US$m Fair Value As at 1 January 2012 2,463.3 Disposals 1,380.5 Surplus on valuation 55.6 As at 1 January 2013 1,138.4 Deficit on valuation 110.8 As at 31 December 2013 1,027.6 Available-for-sale financial assets represent the Groups remaining investment in the fully-diluted share capital of Cairn India Limited, listed in India, which by its nature has no fixed maturity or coupon rate.
These listed equity securities present the Group with an opportunity for return through dividend income and trading gains.
At 30 June 2013, the value of the investment in Cairn India Limited had fallen to US$955.6m.
As this represented a significant fall in value from its original recognition, the accumulated deficit of US$267.5m in the available-for-sale reserve was recycled to the Income Statement and recorded as impairment.
In the second half of the year the value of the asset increased by US$72.0m.
This increase is included within other comprehensive income.
During 2012, the Group disposed of 11.5% of its shareholding in Cairn India Limited in two separate transactions resulting in the recognition of a loss of US$81.5m in the Income Statement, including US$12.8m recycled from the reserves.
The remaining minority holding of 10.3% is not held for trading and continues to be classified as non-current available-for-sale financial asset.
Subsequent to the year end, the Indian Income Tax department have placed a restriction on Cairn selling further shares in Cairn India Limited.
As no restriction existed at the measurement date there is no impact on the closing valuation of the available-for-sale financial asset or on the results for the year.
Full details are given in section 6.1.

3.7 Financial Instruments Accounting policy A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.
Financial assets are categorised as financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments, loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets.
The Group holds financial assets which are classified as either available-for-sale financial assets or loans and receivables.
Financial liabilities generally substantiate claims for repayment in cash or another financial asset.
Financial liabilities are categorised as either fair value through profit or loss or held at amortised cost.
All of the Groups financial liabilities are held at amortised cost.
Financial instruments are generally recognised as soon as the Group becomes party to the contractual regulations of the financial instrument.
Set out below is the comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of all the Groups financial instruments that are carried in the financial statements.

Maturity analysis All of the Group financial liabilities have a maturity of less than one year, other than the Groups provision of US$2.6m 2012: US$2.6m that falls due after one year.
Fair value The Group holds listed equity shares as a non-current available-for-sale financial asset.
The Group determines and discloses the fair value of these by reference to the quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for those shares at the measurement date.
At 31 December 2013 the Group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value: 2013 2012 Assets measured at fair value Level 1 US$m US$m Available-for-sale financial assets Equity shares listed 1,027.6 1,138.4 1,027.6 1,138.4 120 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Strategic Review Leadership and Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Section 4 Results for the Year This section includes the results and performance of the Group, with segmental disclosures highlighting the core areas of the Groups operations in frontier and mature basin exploration activities within a balanced, sustainable portfolio including development projects.
This section also includes details of the Group tax credits in the year and deferred tax assets and liabilities held at the year end.
Significant accounting judgements in this section: Deferred taxation The deferred tax liability relating to the Groups investment in Cairn India Limited, classified as an available-for-sale financial asset, is provided on the assumption that any future disposal will result in a tax liability.
At the year end Cairn recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of UK North Sea oil and gas assets.
This deductible temporary difference represents eligible field allowances on the Kraken asset, offset by other taxable temporary differences.
Cairn believes it is probable that UK North Sea assets will generate taxable profits to allow the temporary difference arising on the field allowances to be utilised in full.
Key estimates and assumptions in this section: Deferred taxation Deferred tax liabilities relating to UK and Norwegian North Sea assets are measured using the tax rates and laws that are expected to apply to the period when the assets are realised, based on the conditions that existed at the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are not adjusted for field allowances that certain assets in the UK may qualify for in future periods, but which are subject to Government approval of respective field development plans which did not exist at the Balance Sheetdate.
4.1 Segmental Analysis Operating Segments Cairns operations focus on frontier exploration activities in areas within similar geological structures which have the potential to add material value to the Group, balanced by lower risk exploration and development assets in mature basins.
For management purposes, the operations of the Group are organised based on geographical regions within either the frontier exploration or mature basin categories.
Geographical regions are combined into regional business units which form the Groups operating segments.
Each business unit is headed by its own regional director a regional director may be responsible for more than one business unit and management monitors the results of each separately for the purposes of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
Frontier exploration The Groups frontier exploration activities currently focus on the Atlantic Margin and the Mediterranean.
The Atlantic Margin comprises two operating segments: the North Atlantic, with assets in Greenland and Republic of Ireland, and Africa, which includes Cairns interests in Morocco, Senegal and Mauritania.
The Groups current operated multi-well exploration drilling programme, which commenced in 2013 and will continue through 2014, includes exploration drilling offshore Morocco, Senegal and Republic of Ireland.
The Mediterranean operating segment includes licences in Spain, France and Malta which are at the early stages of exploration activity and have yet to incur significant costs.
Mature Basin The mature basin assets are held in one operating segment in the UK and Norwegian North Sea.
This segment includes the Catcher and Skarfjell fields held in intangible exploration appraisal assets and the Kraken field, now included in property, plant & equipment development producing assets.
Details of exploration wells drilled in 2013 can be found in section 2.1.
Other The results of the Mediterranean operating segment are reported along with the Groups corporate assets in the Other Cairn Energy reportable segment.

In 2013, the Group eliminated inter-company debt through a series of loan waivers and capital contribution.
Eliminating the inter-company debt reduces the Groups Income Statement exposure to foreign exchange movements which is reflected in the fall in exchange gains from 2012 to the current year.
Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 123 Section 4 Results for the Year Continued 4.3 Taxation on Loss Accounting policy The total tax charge or credit represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
The current tax is based on taxable profit or loss for the year.
Taxable profit or loss differs from net profit or loss as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences that exist only where it is probable that taxable profits will be generated against which the carrying value of the deferred tax asset can be recovered.
A deferred tax asset or liability is not recognised if a temporary difference arises on initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Current and deferred tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.

The UK main rate of corporation tax was 24% prior to 1 April 2013, and 23% from that date onwards.
The reduction in the tax rate from 24% to 23% has resulted in an average rate of corporation tax of 23.25% for the year ended 31 December 2013, as shown above.
The rate will reduce to 21% on 1 April 2014 and to 20% on 1 April 2015.
Special rates of tax apply to oil and gas activities in the UK and Norwegian North Sea operating segment.
The applicable UK statutory tax rate applying to North Sea oil and gas activities is 62% and the applicable Norwegian rate applying to oil and gas activities is 78%.

The UK other temporary difference of US$211.9m 2012: US$nil represents field allowances on the Kraken development which will reduce future Ring Fence profits subject to Supplementary Charge.
The eligible field allowances were confirmed when DECC approved the Kraken field development plan and will be claimed when production commences.
A deferred tax asset has also been recognised in respect of Norwegian tax losses of US$7.3m 2012: US$7.3m against a Norwegian deferred tax liability arising on temporary differences in respect of non-current assets.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets At the Balance Sheet date, the Group had a potential deferred tax asset of US$0.3m 2012: US$0.3m in respect of future UK corporation tax deductions for equity-based remuneration.
This asset has not been recognised as it is not considered probable that there will be sufficient profits to utilise these tax deductions.
In addition, no deferred tax liability has been recognised at the year end on UK fixed asset temporary differences of US$163.8m 2012: US$1,274.0m and no deferred tax asset has been recognised on UK Ring Fence pre-trade losses of US$16.1m 2012: US$0.5m, UK non-Ring Fence pre-trade losses of US$5.3m 2012: US$37.8m, UK excess management expenses of US$205.4m 2012: US$319.6m, UK non-trade deficits of US$53.2m 2012: US$0.7m and UK other temporary differences of US$5.0m 2012: US$0.6m as it is not considered probable that the net deferred tax asset will be utilised in future periods.
d Tax strategy and governance The Groups tax strategy is fully aligned with its overarching business objectives and principles.
Cairn commits to managing its tax affairs in a transparent and responsible manner and ensuring that all statutory obligations and disclosure requirements are met.
We aim to comply with both the letter and spirit of the law in the relevant jurisdictions in which we operate, to ensure that the right amount of tax is paid, at the right time, within the right jurisdiction.
As the Group is currently at an early stage in the value creation cycle and the level of its exploration activities is high, there are currently no taxable profits in the UK.
Taxable profits in other jurisdictions are also minimal, and as a result cash payments of corporation taxes are currently low.
Cairns policy is to not enter into any artificial tax avoidance schemes and to build and maintain strong collaborative working relationships with all relevant tax authorities, based on honesty, integrity and proactive cooperation.
The Group aims for certainty in relation to the tax treatment of all items, however we acknowledge that this will not always be possible, for example where transactions are complex and there is a lack of maturity in the tax regime in the relevant jurisdiction in which we are operating.
In such circumstances the Group will seek external advice where appropriate and ensure that the approach adopted in any relevant tax return is supportable and includes full disclosure of the position taken.

This share re-purchase arrangement follows shareholder approval for the Company to repurchase up to 14.99% of its issued share capital granted at the Companys Annual General Meeting on 16 May 2013, and in accordance with Chapter 12 of the UKLA Listing Rules and the Companys authorities to repurchase shares.
At the year end the first US$50.0m irrevocable and non-discretionary arrangement with Cairns brokers had been entered into.
US$36.3m of shares had been repurchased by the year end with the remaining US$13.7m accrued.
Estimated costs of this arrangement are US$0.6m.
Consolidation of shares and cash returned to shareholders By special resolution effective from 6 February 2012 the share capital was subdivided and consolidated on the basis of 13 new ordinary shares of 231 169 pence for every 33 ordinary shares of 8 13 pence held.
1 B Share of 1 13 pence each was also issued for each ordinary share of 8 13 pence held at the time of the capital reorganisation.
The B share scheme allowed Cairn to return to shareholders approximately US$3.6 billion of cash in February and April 2012.
All B shares were repurchased by Cairn and cancelled during 2012.

Merger and capital reserves The merger reserve of US$255.9m arose in 2012 on shares issued by Cairn on the acquisition of Agora Oil and Gas AS.
Capital reserves non-distributable include non-distributable amounts arising on various Group acquisitions and the capital redemption reserve arising from the current share buy-back programme.
Available-for-sale reserve The available-for-sale reserve represents fair value movements on the available-for-sale financial assets disclosed in section 3.1 less amounts recycled to the Income Statement as impairment.
Foreign currency translation Unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses arising on consolidation of subsidiary undertakings are taken directly to reserves in accordance with IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.
In accordance with IAS 21, foreign exchange differences arising on intra-group loans are not eliminated on consolidation: this reflects the exposure to currency fluctuations where the subsidiaries involved have differing functional currencies.
These intra-group loans are not considered to be an investment in a foreign operation.
5.2 Capital Management The objective of the Groups capital management structure is to ensure that there remains sufficient liquidity within the Group to carry out committed work programme requirements.
The Group monitors the long-term cash flow requirements of the business in order to assess the requirement for changes to the capital structure to meet that objective and to maintain flexibility.
Cairn manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes to economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, Cairn may buy-back shares, make a special dividend payment to shareholders, return capital, issue new shares for cash, repay debt, put in place new debt facilities or other such restructuring activities as appropriate.
No significant changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the year ended 31 December 2013.

The share-based payments charge includes amounts in respect of both equity and cash-settled phantom options and associated National Insurance Contributions.
The average number of full time equivalent employees, including executive directors and individuals employed by the Group working on joint venture operations, was: Number of employees 2013 2012 UK 158 144 Norway 15 12 Spain 5 6 Greenland 12 12 Nepal 2 3 Morocco 1 Group 193 177 5.4 Share-based Payments Accounting Policy The cost of awards to employees under Cairns LTIP and share option plans are recognised over the three year period to which the performance relates.
The amount recognised is based on the fair value of the shares as measured at the date of the award.
The shares are valued using a Monte Carlo model with the exception of the SIP awards which have been valued using a Black Scholes model.
Awards in prior years were valued using a binomial model.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award the vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Companys best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The Income Statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense as recognised at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
The Group operates a number of share-based schemes for the benefit of its employees.

Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 131 Section 6 Post Balance Sheet Events 6.1 Restriction on Sale of Available-for-sale Financial Asset In January 2014, Cairn was contacted by the Indian Income Tax Department to provide information in relation to the year ending 31 March 2007.
The information requested focused on the internal restructuring of the Cairn Group which took place prior to the IPO of Cairn India Limited in January 2007.
Specifically, the Indian Income Tax Department is examining the taxable gain, if any, on the sale recorded in the 2006 year end accounts of the subsidiary that holds the Groups remaining 10% interest in Cairn India Limited.
Cairn has re-confirmed with its advisers that throughout its history of operating in India the Group have been fully compliant with the tax legislation in force in each year.
The Indian Income Tax Department are continuing their examination and presently there is no determination whether Cairn has any further liability to Indiantaxation.
While interaction with the Indian Income Tax Department continues, Cairn has been restricted by the Indian Income Tax Department from selling its shares in Cairn India Limited.
Cairn classifies the remaining investment in Cairn India Limited as a non-current available-for-sale financial asset.
This asset is measured at fair value at the Balance Sheet date.
As the restriction was not effective at the year end, no adjustment is made to the fair value reflected in the Groups 31 December 2013 Balance Sheet.
6.2 Farm-down of Senegal Licences On 9 January 2014, Cairn received formal approval for the farm-down agreement entered into with ConocoPhillips for 25% of its three contiguous blocks, Rufisque 2 Offshore, Sangomar Offshore and Sangomar Deep, located offshore Senegal, West Africa where a 2,050km 3D seismic survey has been used to identify prospects.
Cairn will operate the exploration phase with a reduced 40% working interest.
The planned two well exploration programme will commence on completion of the operated drilling offshore Morocco using the Cajun Express rig.
In the event of a commercial success, ConocoPhillips would have the option to apply to operate the future development of the resource.
Under the agreement, ConocoPhillips will pay Cairn a payment inclusive of a portion of back costs on the blocks, along with promoted terms of future .
