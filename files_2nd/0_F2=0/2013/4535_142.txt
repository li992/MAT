116 Notes to the financial statements continued 23 Retirement benefit obligation The Group operates defined benefit type pension schemes, being the Debenhams Executive Pension Plan DEPP and the Debenhams Retirement Scheme DRS together the Groups pension schemes, the assets of which are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
Both pension schemes were closed for future service accrual from 31 October 2006.
The closure to future accrual will not affect the pensions of those who have retired or the deferred benefits of those who have left service or opted out before 31 October 2006.
Future pension arrangements are provided through a money purchase stakeholder plan in the UK and Hong Kong or a defined contribution scheme for the employees in the Republic of Ireland and Denmark.
In accordance with the recovery plan for the Groups pension schemes, which is intended to restore the schemes to a fully funded position on an ongoing basis, the Group agreed to contribute to the pension schemes 8.9 million per annum, on 1 April each year, for the period from 1 April 2012 to 31 August 2021 increasing by the percentage increase in the RPI over the year to the previous December.
Additionally, the Group has agreed to cover the non-investment expenses and levies of the pension schemes, including those payable to the Pension Protection Fund.
The investment strategy for the Groups pension schemes was changed during the year ended 3 September 2011.
Investment of the schemes assets is now arranged by AON Hewitt Limited under a delegated consulting service agreement.
As at 31 August 2013 most of the schemes assets are invested in a delegated liability fund or a delegated growth fund, with some legacy holdings from the former investment strategy due to be transferred to the delegated consulting service arrangement in the future.
Actuarial valuations of the Groups pension schemes using the projected unit basis were carried out at 31 March 2011 and updated as at each relevant year end for the purposes of IAS 19 Employee Benefits by Towers Watson Limited, a qualified independent actuary.
The 31 March 2011 actuarial valuation has been used when calculating the IAS 19 Employee Benefits valuation at 31 August 2013.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 31 August 1 September 2013 2012 per annum per annum % % Inflation assumption 3.30 2.90 General salary and wage increase 3.30 2.90 Rate of increase in pension payments and deferred payments 3.30 2.90 Pension increase rate 3.00 2.80 Discount rate 4.60 4.70 The expected return on scheme assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the year for return over the entire life of the defined benefit obligation.
The inflation assumption is based on the RPI rate as pension increases both in payment and deferment within the schemes are set out with reference to this measure.
