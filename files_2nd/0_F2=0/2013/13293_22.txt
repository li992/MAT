Financial Shareholder Overview Performance Governance statements information Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2013 69 Financial statements notes FoRminG PaRt oF the FinanCial statements 1. aCCountinG PoliCies Basis of preparation Renishaw plc the Company is a company incorporated in the uK.
the group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and equity account the Groups interest in associates.
the group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with international Financial Reporting standards as adopted by the eu adopted iFRs and those parts of the Companies act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under iFRs.
the Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with uK GaaP.
the accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these group financial statements.
Judgements made by the directors, in the application of these accounting policies, that have a significant effect on the financial statements andestimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are noted below.
Basis of accounting the financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, subject to items referred to in the derivative financial instruments note below.
the accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied in preparing both the 2012 and 2013 financial statements.
Critical accounting judgements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted iFRs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
the estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
actual results may differ from these estimates.
the estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
the estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities inthenext financial year are listed below: i Impairment of goodwill determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of cash-generating units CGus to which goodwill has been allocated.
the value in use calculation involves an estimation of the future cash flows of CGus and also the selection of appropriate discount rates, which involves judgement, to calculate present values see note 11. ii Defined benefit pension scheme liabilities determining the value of the future defined benefit obligation requires judgement in respect of the assumptions used to calculate present values.
theseinclude future mortality, discount rate, inflation and salary increases.
management makes these judgements in consultation with an independent actuary.
details of the estimates and judgements in respect of the current year are given in note 16. iii Amortisation of intangibles and impairment the periods of amortisation of intangible assets require judgements to be made on the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets todetermine anappropriate rate of amortisation.
Future assessments of impairment may lead to the writing off of certain amounts ofintangible assets and the consequent charge in the Consolidated income statement for the accelerated amortisation.
iv Capitalisation of development costs Product development costs are capitalised once a project has reached a certain stage of development and these costs are subsequently amortised over a five-year period.
Judgements are required to assess whether the new product development has reached the appropriate point for capitalisation of costs to begin.
should a product be subsequently obsoleted, the accumulated capitalised development costs would need to be immediately written off in the Consolidated income statement.
Pension scheme cash escrow account the Company holds a pension scheme escrow account as part of the security given for the uK defined benefit pension scheme.
this account is shown within current assets in the Consolidated balance sheet as it may be used to settle pension scheme liabilities at any time.
Inventory and work in progress inventory and work in progress is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
in respect of work in progress and finished goods, cost includes all production overheads and the attributable proportion of indirect overhead expenses which are required to bring inventories to their present location and condition.
overheads are absorbed into inventories on the basis of normal capacity.
Renishaw plc 70 Annual report and accounts 2013 Financial statements notes Continued 1. aCCountinG PoliCies continued New, revised or changes to existing accounting standards the following adopted iFRs has been issued but has not been applied by the Group in these financial statements.
its adoption is expected tohave an effect on the financial statements as indicated below.
amendments to ias 19 employee Benefits mandatory for years commencing on or after 1st January 2013, for defined benefit schemes, theamendments introduce various changes: i past service costs are recognised immediately and no longer deferred: ii the expected return on plan assets and the interest cost on liabilities in the income statement are replaced by interest on the net defined benefit asset liability using the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation: this changes the allocation of the total return on plan assets between the income statement and other comprehensive income: iii asset management costs are recognised in other comprehensive income while other administrative costs are charged to operating profits.
Both were previously charged to operating profits: iv the Group continues to assess the impact of the amended standards requirement to recognise employee contributions over the employees period of service, rather than as the contributions are received: and v removal of the accounting policy choice for recognition of actuarial gains and losses is not expected to have any impact on the Group, since it already recognises them immediately in other comprehensive income.
the amended standard is required to be applied retrospectively.
had the standard been applied to the 2013 results, the currently quantifiable effect items i to iii above is that profit for the year would have been approximately 2.3m lower, with a compensating credit in other comprehensive income.
Consolidation subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern thefinancial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
the financial statements of subsidiaries areincluded in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
theconsolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised income and expense of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the Consolidated income statement when the significant risks and rewards ofownership have been transferred to the buyer, which is the time of despatch.
where certain products require installation, partoftherevenue may be deferred until the installation is complete.
no revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due, or the possible return ofgoods.
Foreign currencies Foreign subsidiaries results are translated into sterling at weighted average exchange rates for the year, which is effected by translating each foreign subsidiarys monthly results at exchange rates applicable to each of the respective months.
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies atthe balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
differences on exchange resulting from the translation of overseas assets and liabilities are recognised directly in equity.
Gains and losses arising on currency borrowings used to hedge the foreign currency exposure on the net assets of the foreign operations are accounted for directly in equity, to the extent that hedge accounting criteria are met and are included in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income and expense.
see the note on derivative financial instruments below, for the accounting policies for forward exchange contracts and currencyborrowings.
Derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value.
the gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the Consolidated income statement.
however, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends onthe nature of the item being hedged.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operation the portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be aneffectivehedge is recognised directly in equity.
any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated income statement.
theeffectiveness of the hedging is tested monthly.
Financial Shareholder Overview Performance Governance statements information Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2013 71 1. aCCountinG PoliCies continued Goodwill and other intangible assets Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred tothe Group.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
deferred consideration relating to acquisitions is subject to discounting to the date of acquisition and subsequently unwound to the date of the final payment.
Goodwill arising on acquisition represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired, net of deferred tax.
identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable.
where there exists an option to purchase the non-controlling interest of a subsidiary and the option is deemed to have been exercised, the Group has adopted the  method.
any changes to the carrying amount of the liability are recognised in the Consolidated income statement.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
it is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment or earlier ifthere are anyindications of impairment.
the annual impairment review involves comparing the carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount and recognising an impairment loss if the recoverable amount is lower.
impairment losses are recognised through the Consolidated income statement.
intangible assets such as customer lists, patents, trade marks, know-how and intellectual property that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less amortisation and impairment losses.
amortisation is charged to the Consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets.
the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets included in the Consolidated balance sheet reflect the benefit derived by the Group and vary from 5 to 10 years.
on a transaction by transaction basis, the Group elects to measure non-controlling interests, which have both present ownership interests and are entitled to a proportionate share of net assets of the acquiree in the event of liquidation, either at its fair value or atitsproportionate interest in the recognised amount of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree at the acquisition date.
all other non-controlling interests are measured at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Intangible assets research and development costs expenditure on research activities is recognised in the Consolidated income statement as an expense as incurred.
expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group intends and has the technical ability andsufficient resources to complete development, future economic benefits are probable and the Group can measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.
development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes.
the expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
other development expenditure is recognised in the Consolidated income statement as an expense as incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets software licences intangible assets comprising software licences, that are acquired by the Group, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets.
the useful life of each ofthese assets is assessed on an individual basis and they range from 2 to 10 years.
Property, plant and equipment Freehold land is not depreciated.
other assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
depreciation is provided to write off the cost of assets less their estimated residual value on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Plant and equipment 3 to 10 years vehicles 3 to 4 years Warranty provisions the Group provides a warranty from the date of purchase on all its products.
this is typically for a 12-month period, although up tothree years is given for a small number of products.
a warranty provision is included in the financial statements, which is calculated on the basis of historical returns and internal quality reports.
Employee benefits the Group operates contributory pension schemes, largely for uK, ireland and usa employees, which were of the defined benefit type up to 5th april 2007, 31st december 2007 and 30th June 2012 respectively, at which time they ceased any future accrual for existing members and were closed to new members.
the schemes are administered by trustees who are independent of the group finances.
Pension scheme assets of the defined benefit schemes are measured using market value.
Pension scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the current rate ofreturn onahigh-quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.
the expected return on the schemes assets and theinterest on the schemes liabilities arising from the passage of time are included in financial income and financial expenses respectively.
theGroup recognises actuarial gains and losses in full in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income and expense.
Renishaw plc 72 Annual report and accounts 2013 Financial statements notes Continued 1. aCCountinG PoliCies continued the pension schemes surpluses, to the extent that they are considered recoverable, or deficits are recognised in full and presented on the face of the Consolidated balance sheet under employee benefits.
where a guarantee is in place in relation to a pension scheme deficit, liabilities are reported in accordance with iFRiC 14.
Foreign-based employees are covered by state, defined benefit and private pension schemes in their countries of residence.
actuarial valuations of foreign pension schemes were not obtained, apart from ireland and usa, because of the limited number of foreign employees.
For defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the Consolidated income statement represents the contributions payable tothe schemes inrespect of the accounting period.
accruals are made for holiday pay, based on a calculation of the number of days holiday earned during the year, but not yet taken.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term with an original maturity of less than three months deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand form part of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Consolidated statement of cash flow.
Dividends dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately declared and authorised and no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Taxation tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
tax is recognised in the Consolidated income statement except tothe extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income andexpense.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in previous years.
deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and theamounts used for taxation purposes.
the following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination and differences relating toinvestments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
the amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
a deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Exceptional items exceptional items are items which due to their size, incidence and non-recurring nature have been classified separately in order to draw them to the attention of the reader of the accounts and, in managements judgement, to show more accurately the underlying results of the Group.
such items areincluded within the Consolidated income statement caption to which they relate and are disclosed separately on the face of the Consolidated income statement.
Going concern the Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the Business review, where also given are details of the financial and liquidity positions.
in addition, note 23 in the financial statements includes the Groups objectives and policies for managing its capital, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to credit risk and liquidityrisk.
the Group has considerable financial resources at its disposal and the directors have considered the current financial projections.
as a consequence, the directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
after making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue inoperational existence for the foreseeable future.
accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report andaccounts.
Cash flow hedges Forward exchange contracts are recognised at fair value.
where a forward contract is designated as a hedge of the variability in future cash inflows, the effective part of any gain or loss on the forward contract is recognised directly in equity.
any effective cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the Consolidated income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction.
theineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised in the Consolidated income statement immediately.
if the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss held in equity is recognised in theConsolidated income statement immediately.
the effectiveness of cash flow hedges is tested on a monthly basis by comparing thecash inflows with the hedging amounts.
Financial Shareholder Overview Performance Governance statements information Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2013 73 2. seGmental analysis Renishaw manages its operations in two segments, comprising metrology and healthcare products.
the results of these segments are regularly reviewed by the Board to allocate resources to segments and to assess their performance.
the Group evaluates performance of the segments on the basis of revenue and profits.
within metrology, there are multiple operating segments that are aggregated into a reporting segment for reportable purposes, where the nature of the products and their customer base are similar.

the original shareholders agreement provided Renishaw with the option to purchase the remaining shareholding in three tranches in may 2012, may 2013 and may 2014. the price per share to be paid was calculated as seven times earnings before interest and tax, with a minimum price per share of 2 and a maximum price per share of 8.94. the Group had applied the  method to this transaction, and an estimate of the outstanding purchase price, based on mdls three-year forecast, was provided within the financial statements as deferred contingent consideration.
this consideration totalled 7,403,000 in november 2012 June 2012 7,200,000 and the subsequent re-measurement resulted in an exceptional gain of 2,903,000 recognised in the Consolidated income statement.

additions to assets in the course of construction of 8,310,000 2012 19,437,000 comprise 1,208,000 2012 8,285,000 for freehold land and buildings and 7,102,000 2012 11,152,000 for plant and equipment.
therefore it is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually and at any point during the year when an indicator of impairment exists.
Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash-generating units CGus, which are currently the statutory entities acquired.
this is the lowest level in the Group at which goodwill is monitored for impairment and is at a lower level than the Groups operating segments.
in the table below, only the goodwill relating to the acquisition of R&R Fixtures, llC formerly R&R sales, llC is expected to be subject to tax relief.
the analysis of acquired goodwill on consolidation is: 2013 2012 000 000 itp Gmbh 2,960 2,886 Renishaw diagnostics limited 92.4% 1,784 1,784 Renishaw mayfield s. a.

these calculations use cash flow projections with assumptions as follows: itp Gmbh part of the metrology reportable segment actual operating results and an average growth rate of 5% for five years with anil growth rate to perpetuity 2012 same basis.
Renishaw diagnostics limited, Renishaw mayfield s. a. both in the healthcare reportable segment, measurement devices limited and R&RFixtures, llC both in the metrology reportable segment five-year business plans with a nil growth rate to perpetuity 2012samebasis where applicable.
these are considered prudent estimates based on managements view of the future and experience of past performance.
the growth rates used in the business plans vary from 11% to 28%, except for Renishaw diagnostics limited, which is in its research and development phase and thus has negligible revenue to date.
a pre-tax discount rate of 12% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows of itp Gmbh, measurement devices limited and R&RFixtures, llC 2012 12%.
a pre-tax discount rate of 15% has been used for Renishaw diagnostics limited and Renishaw mayfield s. a.
these have been set on the basis of them being appropriate rates for a market participant.
on this basis, no impairment write-downs are required.
there is significant headroom in all the above and for an impairment to arise, there would need to be a significant material deterioration in business: this is considered to be remote.

as noted in the accounting policies, actuarial valuations of foreign pension schemes are not obtained for the most part because of the limited number of foreign employees.
this year, the Board decided that for the usa defined benefit pension scheme, whilst the net financial position of the scheme is not material, the gross asset and liability amounts have become more material in relation to the Consolidated balance sheet and so have now been included.
the major scheme, which covers the uK-based employees, was of the defined benefit type.
this scheme, along with the ireland and usa defined benefit schemes, has ceased any future accrual for current members and these schemes are closed to new members.
uK, ireland and usa employees are now covered by defined contribution schemes.
the latest full actuarial valuation of the uK defined benefit scheme was carried out at september 2009 and updated to 30th June 2013 by aqualified independent actuary.
the mortality assumption used for 2013 is PCa00, year of birth, medium cohort, which reflects increasing lifeexpectancy.

For a sensitivity analysis of certain elements of the uK defined benefit pension scheme, see the note in the financial review section of theBusiness review.
it is expected that contributions to defined benefit schemes for the next financial year will be at a similar level to the currentyear.

FinanCial instRuments the Group has exposure to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk arising from its use of financial instruments.
this note presents information about the Groups exposure to these risks, along with the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing the risks.
Credit risk the Group carries a credit risk, being the risk of non-payment of trade receivables by its customers.
Credit evaluations are carried out on all new customers before credit is given above certain thresholds.
there is a spread of risks among a large number of customers with no significant concentration with one customer or in any one geographical area.
the Group establishes an allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables where recoverability is considered doubtful.
an analysis by currency of Group financial assets at the year end is as follows: trade receivables other receivables Cash 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 Currency 000 000 000 000 000 000 Pound sterling 7,639 7,374 7,566 7,493 11,187 7,512 us dollar 22,408 35,908 305 327 4,174 2,744 Japanese yen 6,403 8,142 11,510 1,548 1,319 2,337 euro 18,277 17,852 1,428 6,397 3,141 866 other 13,355 14,131 1,621 1,514 6,784 7,668 68,082 83,407 22,430 17,279 26,605 21,127 the above trade receivables, other receivables and cash are predominately held in the functional currency of the relevant entity, with the exception of 2,400,000 of euro-denominated trade receivables being held in the Company, along with some foreign currency cash balances which are of a short-term nature.
the ageing of trade receivables past due, but not impaired, at the end of the year was: 2013 2012 000 000 Past due 01 month 9,412 14,654 Past due 12 months 3,860 5,808 Past due more than 2 months 2,931 1,219 Balance at the end of the year 16,203 21,681 movements in the provision for impairment of trade receivables during the year were: 2013 2012 000 000 Balance at the beginning of the year 3,829 4,007 Changes in amounts provided 85 40 amounts utilised 389 218 Balance at the end of the year 3,525 3,829 Liquidity risk the Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
the Group is cash generative and uses monthly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements.
in respect of net cash, the carrying value approximates to fair value because of the short maturity of the deposits and borrowings.
interest rates are floating and based on liBoR liBid, which can change over time, affecting the Groups interest income.
an increase of 1% in interest rates would result in an increase in interest income of approximately 350,000. the market value of forward exchange contracts is determined by reference to market data.
Financial Shareholder Overview Performance Governance statements information Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2013 89 23.
there is no significant difference between the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities and their carrying value in the Consolidated balance sheet.
under the disclosure requirements of iFRs 7, all fair value measurements of financial assets and liabilities are considered to be categorised as level 2, except for the deferred consideration, which is categorised as level 3. all financial assets and liabilities are held at amortised cost, apart from the forward exchange contracts, which are held at fair value, with changes going through the Consolidated income statement unless subject to hedge accounting.
Market risk as noted in the Business review under Principal risks and uncertainties, the Group operates in a number of foreign currencies with the majority of sales being made in these currencies but with most manufacturing being undertaken in the uK, ireland and india.
Exchange rates and sensitivity analysis the Group has hedged a significant proportion of its forecasted us dollar, Japanese yen and euro cash flows and hence there is not expected to be a material impact on the Groups results resulting from fluctuations in their exchange rates against sterling.
the following are the exchange rates which have been applicable during the financial year.
also noted is the increase in profit that a one us dollar cent change, a one Japanese yen change and a one euro cent change in exchange rate, where the foreign currency is strengthening against sterling, might have on the Groups results.
the method of estimation involves assessing the impact of this currency on the Groups transactions assuming all other variables are unchanged.
