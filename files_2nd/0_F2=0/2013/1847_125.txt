These loans are secured by way of a second legal charge on the respective property after the first mortgage.
These loans are held at the present value of expected future cash ows, taking into account the estimated market value of the property at the estimated time of repayment.
The income statement includes a net impairment of 6.1m 2012: 11.8m in cost of sales.
The present value of expected future cash ows is calculated using a discount rate consistent with the interest rate payable on a third party second charge loan of a similar amount and duration.
This is considered to be the most appropriate rate as the interest free loans are similar in nature to second charge loans offered by third party financial institutions.
The average discount rate used for the year ended 30 June 2013 was 8.0% 2012: 7.5%.
The movement in the discount rate during the year has resulted in a fair value adjustment charge, which has been taken through other comprehensive income of 6.2m 2012: 3.4m.
The estimated fair value is based on original selling prices and local market conditions with an allowance for low single-digit sales price in ation.
The Group has also used independent valuation specialists to review and assess the estimated portfolio value.
The repayment pro le used to calculate the timing of future cash ows is based on historical data for first-time buyers selling their property.
The net impairment of the available for sale financial assets taken through the income statement relates to borrower default including an estimate made for losses incurred that have not yet been reported to the Group by the home owner or the first charge provider and the impact of the decline in UK house prices on the present value of the estimated future cash ows of these assets.
