142 | Capita plc Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies a Basis of preparation The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
There were no new Financial Reporting Standards issued by the UK Financial Reporting Council FRC which were required to be adopted in the year.
A separate profit and loss account dealing with the results of the parent undertaking only has not been presented as provided by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. b Tangible fixed assets Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned, as follows: Computer equipment 3 to 10 years Furniture, fixtures and equipment 4 to 5 years Leasehold improvements over the period of the lease c Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost, less provisions for impairment.
Investments held as current assets are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The carrying values of fixed asset investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable.
d Pension schemes The Company maintains a number of contracted-out defined contribution schemes and contributions are charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which they are due.
These schemes are funded and the payment of contributions is made to separately administered trust funds.
The assets of these schemes are held separately from the Company.
The Company remits monthly pension contributions to Capita Business Services Limited, a subsidiary undertaking of the Company, which pays the Group liability centrally.
Any unpaid contributions at the year-end have been accrued in the accounts of that company.
e Leasing commitments Assets obtained under finance leases are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful economic lives.
The finance charges under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are allocated to accounting periods over the period of the lease and represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals due under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
f Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more, taxation, with the following exceptions: provision is made for taxation on gains arising from the revaluation and similar fair value adjustments of fixed assets, and gains on disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned.
However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to taxation only where the replacement assets are sold provision is made for deferred taxation that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable deferred taxation assets are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred taxation is measured on an undiscounted basis at the taxation rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on taxation rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
g Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction or at the contracted rate if the transaction is covered by a forward exchange contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
All differences are taken to the profit and loss account with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings, to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against foreign equity investments, which are taken directly to reserves together with the exchange difference on the carrying amount of the related investments.
h National Insurance on share option gains National Insurance on outstanding share options at the year-end has been grossed up and shown as a provision and a receivable on the balance sheet.
i Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation A separate note dealing with the disclosures of FRS 29 has not been presented as provided by paragraph 2D b of FRS 29.
