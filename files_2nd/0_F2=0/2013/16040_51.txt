During the year the Company announced the retirement of Geoff Cooper as CEO of the Group and as a director of the Board from 6 march 2014, with the appointment of John Carter as his successor.
Geoff Cooper will remain in the Companys employment until 6 march 2015 as a senior management adviser to the new management team.
