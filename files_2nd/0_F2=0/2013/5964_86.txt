Merger reserve The merger reserve arises from the acquisition of LatentZero Limited in 2007.
The merger reserve represents the excess of the fair value over the nominal value of shares issued to acquire at least 90% equity interest in an acquiree company.
A purchaser company acquiring at least 90% equity interest in an acquiree company under an arrangement which provides for the allotment of equity shares by the purchaser in return for the equity interest in the acquiree must apply Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006.
When applicable, the section requires that the premium on the issue of equity shares by the purchaser company be disregarded.
Accordingly, a premium was not recorded on the shares issued but a merger reserve was recognised in the consolidated balance sheet.
Cumulative translation adjustment The cumulative translation adjustment comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations.
