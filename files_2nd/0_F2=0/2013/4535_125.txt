99 Taxation and deferred taxation The Group is subject to income taxes in the UK, the Republic of Ireland, Denmark and Hong Kong.
At each financial period end, judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on the best estimates at the balance sheet date.
Significant judgement is also required in determining the deferred tax on developers contributions, fair value losses and gains, retirement benefit assets and liabilities and other provisions.
The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the best estimate at the balance sheet date.
Where the final tax outcome of the above matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the corporation tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
The final outcome of some of these tax items may give rise to material profit or loss and or cash flow movements.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period.
The fair value is calculated using the appropriate fair value model with the estimated level of vesting being reviewed annually by management.
The key assumptions of this model are set out in note 28.
