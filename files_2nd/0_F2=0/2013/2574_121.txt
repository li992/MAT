In order to maintain the independence of the external auditors, the Board has determined policies as to what non-audit services can be provided by the companys external auditors and the approval processes related to them.
Under those policies work of a consultancy nature will not be offered to the external auditors unless there are clear efficiencies and value-added benets to the company.
A description of the work performed by the Audit & Risk Committee in order to safeguard auditor independence when non-audit services are provided is set out in the Audit & Risk Committee Chairmans Report on page 72.
In this context audit related assurance services are considered to pose a low threat to auditor independence and therefore the proportion of other non-audit services to total services is considered the most suitable measure of the level of non-audit services provided.
