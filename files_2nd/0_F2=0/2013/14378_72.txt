Smith & Nephew ANNuAl report 2013 114 FiNANCiAl StAtemeNtS Notes to the Group accounts continued 8 Goodwill ACCOUNTING POLICY Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment annually.
Goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating unit CGU that is expected to benefit from the acquisition.
The recoverable amount of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually.
The CGUs, monitored by management, are at the business segment level, Advanced Surgical Devices and Advanced Wound Management.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount then an impairment loss is determined to have occurred.
Any impairment losses that arise are recognised immediately in the income statement and are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill and then to the carrying amounts of the other assets of the CGU.
In carrying out impairment reviews of goodwill a number of significant assumptions have to be made when preparing cash flow projections.
These include the future rate of market growth, discount rates, the market demand for the products acquired, the future profitability of acquired businesses or products, levels of reimbursement and success in obtaining regulatory approvals.
If actual results should differ, or changes in expectations arise, impairment charges may be required which would adversely impact operating results.

Each of the Groups business segments represent a CGU and include goodwill as follows: 2013 2012 $ million $ million Advanced Surgical Devices 918 886 Advanced Wound Management 338 300 1,256 1,186 In September 2013 and 2012 impairment reviews were performed by comparing the recoverable amount of each CGU with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
These are updated during December, taking into account significant events that occurred between September and December.
For each CGU, the recoverable amounts are based on value-in-use which is calculated from pre-tax cash flow projections for five years using data from the Groups budget and strategic planning process, the results of which are reviewed and approved by the Board.
These projections exclude any estimated future cash inflows or outflows expected to arise from future restructurings.
The five-year period is in-line with the Groups strategic planning process.
The calculation of value-in-use for the identified CGUs is most sensitive to discount and growth rates as set out below: The discount rate reflects managements assessment of risks specific to the assets of each CGU.
The pre-tax discount rate used in the Advanced Surgical Devices business is 10% 2012 10% and for the Advanced Wound Management business it is 10% 2012 9%.
In determining the growth rate used in the calculation of the value-in-use, the Group considered the annual revenue growth and trading profit margins.
Projections are based on anticipated volume and value growth in the markets served by the Group and assumptions as to market share movements.
Each year the projections for the previous year are compared to actual results and variances are factored into the assumptions used in the current year.
Growth rates for the five-year period for the Advanced Surgical Devices business vary up to 7% 2012 7% and for the Advanced Wound Management business up to 18% 2012 9%.
