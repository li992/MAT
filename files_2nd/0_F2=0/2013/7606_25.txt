Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
Basis of Preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and those International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and IFRIC Interpretations as adopted by the European Union.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of available for sale financial assets and those financial assets and financial liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss.
Where a change in the presentational format between the prior year and current year financial statements has been made during the period, comparative figures have been restated accordingly.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out in note 43.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented.
Change in Functional Currency IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates describes functional currency as the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates.
A change in functional currency reflects the accumulation over time of those factors which are the main determinants of functional currency.
Having considered the aggregate effect of all relevant factors, the Directors concluded that the functional currency of Hunting PLC had changed from Sterling to US dollars in the first quarter of 2013.
Accordingly, the change in functional currency of Hunting PLC is effective from 1 January 2013.
In accordance with IAS 21 this change has been accounted for prospectively from this date.
Change in Presentational Currency Following the acquisition programme undertaken in recent years that focused on US domiciled businesses, the Hunting Groups US operations have expanded and become the most significant operations of the Group.
The dominant functional currency of the operating subsidiaries is the US dollar.
This is not only driven by US domiciled businesses but also by businesses outside the US, which have a US dollar functional currency.
The Groups revenues, cash flows and economic returns are now principally denominated in US dollars.
Hunting PLC has changed the currency in which it presents its consolidated and parent Company Financial Statements from Sterling to US dollars, as this will give a more meaningful view of the Groups and Companys financial performance and position.
A change in presentational currency is a change in accounting policy which is accounted for retrospectively.
Financial information reported in Sterling in the Groups 2012 Annual Report has been restated into US dollars using the procedures outlined below: a assets and liabilities denominated in non-US dollar currencies were translated into US dollars at closing rates of exchange.
Non-US dollar trading results were translated into US dollars at average rates of exchange.
Differences resulting from the retranslation of the opening net assets and the results for the year have been taken to the translation reserve: b the cumulative translation reserve was set to nil at 1 January 2004 i. e. the transition date to IFRS.
All subsequent movements comprising differences on the retranslation of the opening net assets of non-US dollar subsidiaries have been charged to the translation reserve: and c share capital, share premium and capital redemption reserves were translated at the historic rates prevailing at the dates of transactions.
The average exchange rates used to translate the Groups results into US dollars and the closing rates for each reporting period included in this report are as follows: Exchange rates 2012 2011 2010 2009 US$ average 0.6309 0.6233 0.6452 0.6369 US$ period end 0.6152 0.6435 0.6369 0.6211 Reclassification of Costs Within the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2012, certain costs within cost of sales and operating expenses have been reclassified to correctly present these in line with the Groups accounting policies.

Basis of Preparation continued Adoption of New Standards, Amendments and Interpretations IAS 19 revised Employee Benefits IAS 19 revised Employee Benefits has been adopted from 1 January 2013.
The Group has applied the standard retrospectively in accordance with the transition provisions of the standard.
Under IAS 19 revised, scheme expenses are now recognised as incurred rather than charged against a reserve within the defined benefit obligation.
This has increased operating expenses by $1.7m for the year ended 31 December 2012.
The cost reserve is consequently no longer required and its derecognition has increased the retirement benefit net asset by $13.0m at 31 December 2012 and $12.4m at 31 December 2011.
The combination of the expected return on assets and interest cost on the defined benefit obligation is replaced by the net interest on the defined benefit asset.
This change, combined with the effect of removing the scheme expenses reserve, results in a credit to the total expense recognised in profit or loss of $1.1m in the year ended 31 December 2012.
The impact on the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 has been set out in the tables on pages 94 and 95.
The impact on the Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2011 was to increase the retirement benefit asset by $12.4m to $19.9m, decrease deferred tax assets by $3.1m to $4.6m, decrease other components of equity by $1.3m to $30.8m and increase retained earnings by $10.6m to $882.4m.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, which is to be applied prospectively as of 1 January 2013, describes how fair value is to be measured for all IFRS reporting standards and extends the disclosures to be made on fair value measurement, but does not stipulate in which cases fair value is to be used.
For the disclosures resulting from the first-time application of IFRS 13, see note 28, Financial instruments: Fair Values.
Amendment to IAS 36 Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets The Group has adopted early the amendment to IAS 36, which removes the requirement to disclose the recoverable amount of CGUs with significant carrying amounts of goodwill.
There are no other new IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2013 that have a material impact on the Groups financial performance or position.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements and assumptions about the future, resulting in the use of accounting estimates.
These will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results and adjustments will consequently be necessary.
Estimates are continually evaluated, based on experience, consultation with experts and reasonable expectations of future events.
Accounting estimates are applied in determining the carrying amounts of the following significant assets and liabilities: Asset liability Nature of estimates Goodwill The Group comprises a number of cash generating units CGUs with each one having independent business profiles and cash flows.
When goodwill is initially recognised upon a business Carrying value at combination, it is allocated to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from the combination.
31December 2013 The goodwill of each CGU is subsequently reviewed for impairment at least annually by comparing $495.2m 2012 $495.0m its carrying value with the present value of the estimated future gross cash flows that are expected to be generated by the CGU.
The estimated future gross cash flows are based on the Directors view of their future trading prospects and are discounted at a rate that is determined for each CGU in isolation by consideration of their business risk profiles.
Any shortfall in the present value of the cash flows is charged to the income statement immediately.
Details of goodwill are disclosed in note 16.
Property, plant and The Groups property, plant and equipment and intangible assets except goodwill are depreciated equipment and other at rates that are intended to spread the irrecoverable cost of the assets over their useful lives.
The intangible assets Directors must therefore estimate the useful lives of the assets, their residual values and the pattern of consumption of their carrying values.
Each asset is also regularly reviewed to ensure it remains Combined carrying value consistent with the Directors assumptions and, when required, adjustments are made prospectively.
at 31 December 2013 The depreciation rates currently in use are disclosed in note 43.
Further details of the Groups $694.8m 2012 $704.9m property, plant and equipment and the other intangible assets are disclosed in notes 15 and 17 respectively.
Provisions The measurement of provisions is predominantly based on the Directors estimate of the present value of the Groups onerous net cash outflows that are expected to be paid after the balance sheet Carrying value at date but to which the Group is committed at the balance sheet date.
31December 2013 The provisions at 31 December 2013 are principally in respect of onerous property leases for which $33.4m 2012 $48.0m the Directors have estimated the period of time each property is expected to remain onerous, the cash flows expected to arise during that period and the risk-free discount rate required to measure the present value of the cash flows.
Details of the Groups provisions are disclosed in note 26.
Taxation The deferred tax balances at 31 December 2013 represent an estimate of the amounts that are expected to be paid or recovered from the tax authorities in future periods if assets and liabilities in Carrying value of net tax the balance sheet were recovered at their carrying values based on tax laws and rates that have been liability at 31 December substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
2013 $48.7m 2012 Measurement of deferred tax balances therefore requires management to assess the substantively $40.1m enacted tax laws and rates, the timing of the reversal of existing taxable and deductible temporary differences and the nature, timing and amount of taxable income which would potentially be available to support the recognition of deferred tax assets.
Details of the Groups deferred tax are disclosed in note 21.
In determining current tax estimates, management has to consider the likelihood of tax authority challenges and estimates tax payable accordingly.

Segmental Reporting Group The Group reports on seven operating segments, two of which are discontinued operations, in its internal management reports, which are used to make strategic decisions.
The Groups segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services to international oil and gas companies, undertake exploration and production activities and provide broking services to the shipping sector.
The discontinued operations comprise Field Aviation, which was sold on 27 April 2012, and Gibson Energy, which was sold in 2008.
Gibson Energy and Field Aviation continue to generate accounting entries due to sale related transactions and are required for reconciliation purposes.
The Well Construction segment provides products and services used by customers for the drilling phase of oil and gas wells, along with associated equipment used by the underground construction industry for telecommunication infrastructure build-out and precision machining services for the energy, aviation and power generation sectors.
The Well Completion segment provides products and services used by customers for the completion phase of oil and gas wells.
The Well Intervention segment provides products and services used by customers for the production, maintenance and restoration of existing oil and gas wells.
The Exploration and Production segment includes the Groups oil and gas exploration and production activities in the Southern US and offshore Gulf of Mexico.
The Board of Hunting will not be making any new capital investment, beyond where the division has contractual commitments and so the division will in future focus on producing out its remaining reserves, with a view to winding down the operation.
Gibson Shipbrokers is a global energy shipping broker headquartered in London.
Crude oil, fuel oil and bio fuels are shipped along with dry bulk such as coal, iron ore and grain.
Gibson Shipbrokers is also involved in the shipping of liquefied petroleum gas LPG, petrochemicals and liquefied natural gas LNG.
The following tables present the results of the operating segments on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The Group measures the performance of its operating segments based on revenue and profit from operations, before exceptional items and the amortisation of intangible assets.
Accounting policies used for segment reporting reflect those used for the Group.
Inter-segment sales are priced on an arms length basis.
Costs and overheads incurred centrally are apportioned to the continuing operating segments on the basis of time attributed to those operations by senior executives.
There has been no change in the basis of measurement of segment profit or loss since the year ended 31 December 2012.
The information for the year ended 31 December 2012 has been represented to take into account the change in accounting policy following the adoption of IAS 19 revised on 1 January 2013.

This uplift is charged to the income statement as the inventory is sold, thereby reducing reported operating profits.
In 2013, the charge was $4.3m 2012 $12.0m relating to the four acquisitions completed in the second half of 2011.
Hunting PLC 2013 Annual Report and Accounts 101 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued 7.
Amortisation and Exceptional Items continued The recoverable amount of oil and gas development expenditure is based on value in use.
These calculations use discounted cash flow projections based on estimated oil and gas reserves, future production and the income and costs in generating this production.
Cash flows are based on productive lives between one and fifteen years and are discounted using a nominal pre-tax rate of 13% 2012 12%.
An impairment charge of $7.9m 2012 $8.2m was incurred in the year.
This resulted from a number of factors, including reductions in reserve estimates, higher retirement obligation cost estimates and a higher discount rate.
Dry hole costs of $2.6m 2012 $3.2m have been incurred and paid during the year from our Exploration and Production activities.
The $1.8m charge for bonuses for key employee retention in 2012 relates to the 2011 acquisitions.
During 2012, bonuses of $4.4m were paid to relevant employees and the liability was discharged.
During 2013, the Group settled a pre-acquisition litigation case brought against one of its subsidiaries.
The settlement cost and associated legal expenses amounted to $2.9m.
A credit of $1.8m was recognised in the income statement in 2012 for the Doffing contingent consideration arrangement, as the future payments were not likely to be required.

A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the March 2013 Budget Statement.
From 1 April 2013 the main rate of corporation tax was reduced to 23% and the impact of this change has been recognised in calculating the effective rate of tax for the year ended 31 December 2013.
Legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 23% to 21% from 1 April 2014 and from 21% to 20% from 1 April 2015 was included in the Finance Act 2013, which received Royal Assent on 17 July 2013 and, accordingly, have been used in the calculation of deferred tax balances.
The changes have not had a material impact on the Groups deferred tax balances.

Gibson Energy The sale of Gibson Energy Inc. Huntings midstream services operation, was completed on 12 December 2008.
Following the sale of Gibson Energy, Hunting established provisions for tax indemnities given in respect of two tax disputes with the Canadian Revenue Agency CRA.
The CRA ended their enquiry into the larger of the two tax disputes and dropped their challenge in 2012.
The enquiry into the second tax dispute has now partially ended, resulting in a release of provisions and refund of cash from the tax authorities.
The resulting gain to the income statement of $15.7m comprises $11.5m release of provisions, $4.0m refund of tax payments previously made and other movements of $0.2m.

Earnings per Share Group Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of Ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of outstanding Ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary shares.
The dilution in respect of share options applies where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys Ordinary shares during the year and the possible issue of shares under the Groups long-term incentive plans.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of Ordinary shares used in the calculations are set out below: 2013 2012 $m $m Basic and diluted earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders: From continuing operations 102.5 94.3 From discontinued operations 15.4 108.0 Total 117.9 202.3 Basic and diluted earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders before amortisation and exceptional items: From continuing operations 102.5 94.3 Add: amortisation and exceptional items after taxation note 7 37.8 41.4 Total 140.3 135.7 From discontinued operations 15.4 108.0 Add: exceptional items after taxation 15.4 108.0 Total millions millions Basic weighted average number of Ordinary shares 146.5 145.9 Dilutive outstanding share options 1.1 1.2 Long-term incentive plans 2.4 2.4 Adjusted weighted average number of Ordinary shares 150.0 149.5 cents cents Basic EPS: From continuing operations 70.0 64.6 From discontinued operations 10.5 74.1 80.5 138.7 Diluted EPS: From continuing operations 68.3 63.1 From discontinued operations 10.3 72.2 78.6 135.3 Earnings per share before amortisation and exceptional items Basic EPS: From continuing operations 95.8 93.0 From discontinued operations 95.8 93.0 Diluted EPS: From continuing operations 93.5 90.8 From discontinued operations 93.5 90.8 108 Hunting PLC 2013 Annual Report and Accounts Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Other Information Financial Statements 15.

Goodwill continued Impairment Tests for Goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash-generating units CGUs, the individual business operations, as follows: 2013 2012 $m $m Innova 68.7 68.7 Dearborn 25.5 25.5 Titan 288.4 287.1 Welltonic 19.1 18.7 Hunting Stafford formerly National Coupling Company 32.7 32.7 Other cash generating units 60.8 62.3 At 31 December 495.2 495.0 The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are long-term growth rates and pre-tax discount rates.
The calculations use discounted pre-tax cash flow projections based on the most recent financial budgets approved by management covering a two year period and are based on past experience and order books.
Cash flows beyond the two year period are extrapolated using estimated nominal long-term growth rates of approximately 5.0% and 6.8% and terminal growth rates of approximately 3.0% and 2.7% for 2013 and 2012 respectively.
The growth rate reflects the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU operates and will incorporate, where relevant, projected rig counts and the expected profile of drilling.
Cash flows are discounted using nominal pre-tax rates between 9% and 15% 2012 10% and 15%.
The cash flows for the Titan CGU have been discounted using a nominal pre-tax rate of 11% 2012 11%.
The discount rate best reflects current market assessments of the time value of money, the risks associated with the cash flows and the likely external rate of borrowing of the CGU.
Consideration has also been given to other factors such as currency risk, operational risk and country risk.
Sensitivities Having performed a sensitivity analysis on the value in use calculations, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of any CGU to be materially below its carrying value.

At the year end there are no trade receivables 2012 none whose terms have been renegotiated and would otherwise be past due or impaired.
At 31 December 2013, trade receivables of $94.3m 2012 $100.1m were overdue but not impaired.

Impaired receivables mainly relate to debtors in financial difficulty where defaults in payments have occurred or concerns have been raised about the customers liquidity.
Trade receivables are impaired when there is evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of sale.
During the year, a provision of $1.5m 2012 $2.2m for the impairment of receivables was recognised, $0.4m 2012 $0.9m receivables were written off and $1.0m 2012 $1.0m unused provisions were released.
After recognising foreign exchange movements of $0.1m 2012 $nil, the provision for the impairment of trade receivables at the year end was $3.9m 2012 $3.7m.
The other classes of financial assets within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Groups wide and unrelated customer base.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is the fair value of each class of receivable, as shown in note 28.

The provision for onerous contracts reflects the uncertainty of future conditions in the sub-letting market.
It is expected that $3.5m of the provision will be utilised in 2014, $3.2m in 2015 and the remaining balance of $15.8m utilised from 2016 to 2023.
Provision is made on a discounted basis, at a risk-free rate of between 0.29% and 2.86% p. a. for the net rental deficit on these properties to the end of the lease term.
Asset decommissioning and remediation obligations of $6.1m 2012 $5.6m relate to the Groups obligation to dismantle, remove and restore items of property, plant and equipment and have been included in other provisions.
The provision reflects uncertainty in the timing and amounts of the costs expected to arise in meeting this obligation.
Provision is made on a discounted basis and is expected to be utilised over a period of one to fourteen years.
Following the sale of Gibson Energy in 2008, Hunting established provisions for tax indemnities given in respect of two tax disputes with the Canadian Tax Authorities CRA.
The CRA have now ended their enquiry into the disputes and have dropped their challenge.
Derivatives and Hedging Group a Currency Derivatives The Group has used spot and forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to exchange rate movements during the year.
At 31 December 2013, the total notional amount of the Groups outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts is $22.5m 2012 $5.9m.
Gains and losses on contracts that are not designated in a hedge relationship are taken directly to the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of currency derivatives not designated in a hedge relationship amounting to a $0.3m loss 2012 $0.2m loss have been recognised in the income statement during the year for continuing operations.
Certain highly probable forecast transactions have been designated in a cash flow hedge relationship and hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.
These forecast transactions are expected to occur at various dates during the next twelve months.
Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve on forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2013 will be recognised in the income statement in the period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement.
Gains of $1.8m 2012 $0.8m gains were recognised in the hedging reserve note 33 during the year.

Derivatives and Hedging continued b Hedge of Net Investments in Foreign Operations During 2012, the Group had US dollar denominated borrowings, which it designated as a hedge of the net investment in its US subsidiaries.
At 31 December 2012, the carrying amount of net US dollar borrowings was $350.6m.
During 2012, foreign exchange gains of $16.0m on translation of borrowings into Sterling was recognised in the cumulative translation reserve.
From 1 January 2013, the hedge of the net investment in US subsidiaries ceased and no further foreign exchange gains or losses have been recognised in the cumulative translation reserve for this hedge.

The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by the deviation in future expected cash flows calculated by reference to the movement in market quoted exchange rates.
The available for sale unlisted investments are carried at cost, which is the Directors best estimate of fair value as there is no active market in which these are traded.
The Directors do not intend to dispose of these unlisted investments.
The fair value of listed equities and mutual funds is based on their current bid prices, which is considered to be the most representative of fair value, in an active market at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of the environmental escrow and the promissory note, included in non-current investments, are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows.
The fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements was estimated by applying the income approach and appropriate discount rates.
The fair values of non-US dollar denominated financial instruments are translated into US dollars using the year-end exchange rate.
The carrying value of net trade receivables, accrued revenue, other receivables, deposits maturing after three months, cash and cash equivalents, trade payables, accruals, other payables, provisions, bank overdrafts, unsecured bank loans and other unsecured loans approximates their fair value.

The fair value of listed equity investments and mutual funds is based on quoted market prices and so the fair value measurement can be categorised in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

During 2013, $2.0m 2012 $nil was paid to the sellers of Specialty in respect of the contingent consideration arrangement.
The remaining contingent consideration liability relates to the Specialty contingent consideration arrangement.

The fair value of the environmental escrow is based on cash flows discounted using a rate of 3% 2012 3%.
Having performed a sensitivity analysis on the contingent consideration and environmental escrow fair value calculations, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would cause the fair value to change materially.

Financial Risk Management The Groups activities expose it to certain financial risks, namely market risk including currency risk, fair value interest risk and cash flow interest risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups risk management strategy seeks to mitigate potential adverse effects on its financial performance.
As part of its strategy, both primary and derivative financial instruments are used to hedge certain risk exposures.
There are clearly defined objectives and principles for managing financial risk established by the Board of Directors, with policies, parameters and procedures covering the specific areas of funding, banking relationships, foreign currency and interest rate exposures and cash management.
The Groups treasury function is responsible for implementing the policies and providing a centralised service to the Group for funding, foreign exchange, interest rate management and counterparty risk management.
It is also responsible for identifying, evaluating and hedging financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups operating companies.

Financial Risk Management continued a Foreign Exchange Risk The Groups international base is exposed to foreign exchange risk from its investing, financing and operating activities, particularly in respect of Sterling.
Foreign exchange risks arise from future transactions and cash flows and from recognised monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the Groups local operations.
The Groups material foreign exchange rates are: Sterling Canadian dollar 2013 2012 2013 2012 Average exchange rate to US dollars 0.64 0.63 1.03 1.00 Year-end exchange rate to US dollars 0.60 0.62 1.06 1.00 i Transactional Risk The exposure to exchange rate movements in significant future transactions and cash flows is hedged by using forward foreign exchange contracts and currency options.
Certain forward foreign exchange contracts have been designated as hedging instruments of highly probable forecast transactions.
Operating companies prepare quarterly rolling twelve month cash flow forecasts to enable working capital currency exposures to be identified.
Currency exposures arise where the cash flows are not in the functional currency of the entity.
Exposures arising from committed long-term projects beyond a twelve month period are also identified.
The currency flows to be hedged are committed foreign currency transactions greater than 250,000 equivalent per month and or currency flows that in aggregate exceed 500,000 equivalent per annum.
No speculative positions are entered into by the Group.
The table below shows the carrying values of the Groups financial instruments at 31 December, including derivative financial instruments, on which exchange differences would potentially be recognised in the income statement in the following year.
The table excludes available for sale financial assets, derivatives designated in a cash flow hedge and loans to subsidiaries that are considered to be part of the net investment in a foreign operation, as exchange differences arising on these are recognised in other comprehensive income.

The Canadian dollar denominated financial instruments consist mainly of intra-group loans, warranty provisions, the refund due from the Canadian tax authority and the Field Aviation promissary note and environmental escrow.
ii Translational Risk Foreign exchange risk also arises from the Groups investments in foreign operations.
Average rate options are periodically used to reduce translation risk on the Groups consolidated profit before tax if the Group considers there to be a significant exposure.
The foreign exposure to net investments in foreign operations is managed using borrowings denominated in the same functional currency as that of the hedged assets.
The borrowings are designated as a hedge of the net investment in foreign operations.
The foreign exchange exposure primarily arises from Sterling denominated net investments.
b Interest Rate Risk Variable interest rates on cash at bank, deposits, overdrafts and borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest risk and fixed interest rates on loans and deposits expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The treasury function manages the Groups exposure to interest rate risk and uses interest rate swaps and caps, when considered appropriate.
c Credit Risk The Groups credit risk arises from its available for sale financial assets, pension assets, cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivative financial instruments and outstanding receivables.
At the year end, the Group had credit risk exposures to a wide range of counterparties.
Credit risk exposure is continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered to be significant in the context of the ordinary course of the Groups activities.
Exposure limits are set for each approved counterparty, as well as the types of transactions that may be entered into.
Approved institutions that the treasury function can invest surplus cash with all must have a minimum of an A1, P1 or F1 short-term rating from Standard and Poors, Moodys or Fitch rating agencies and AAA rating for Money Market Funds.
The majority of cash and cash equivalents, which total $167.4m 2012 $165.3m at the year end, and current investments of $2.0m 2012 $5.1m have been deposited with banks with Fitch short-term ratings of F1 to F1.
All cash and cash equivalents and current investments are expected to be fully recovered.
The credit risk of foreign exchange contracts is calculated before the contract is acquired and compared to the credit risk limit set for each counterparty.
Credit risk is calculated as a fixed percentage of the nominal value of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables are continuously monitored.
Credit account limits are primarily based on the credit quality of the customer and past experience through trading relationships.
To reduce credit risk exposure from outstanding receivables, the Group has taken out credit insurance with an external insurer, subject to certain conditions.
The Company operates a pension scheme in the UK, which includes a funded defined benefit section with pension plan net assets of $29.6m 2012 $22.8m.
The majority of the Schemes defined benefits are now covered by insurance company annuity policies, meaning the pensions-related risks have largely been eliminated.
The pension buy-in has been effected by using two insurers, so as to spread its credit risk.
The credit rating of these insurers is monitored.
126 Hunting PLC 2013 Annual Report and Accounts Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Other Information Financial Statements 29.
Financial Risk Management continued The Company also operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the US, which is unfunded.
Contributions are paid into a separate investment vehicle and invested in a wide portfolio of US mutual funds that are recognised by the Company as non-current investments.
Investments at the year end amounted to $8.0m 2012 $5.7m and are expected to be fully recovered.
d Liquidity Risk The Group needs to ensure that it has sufficient liquid funds available to support its working capital and capital expenditure requirements.
All subsidiaries submit weekly and bi-monthly cash forecasts to the treasury function to enable them to monitor the Groups requirements.
The Group has sufficient credit facilities to meet both its long and short-term requirements.
The Groups credit facilities are provided by a variety of funding sources and total $688.8m 2012 $676.5m at the year end.
The facilities comprise $621.1m 2012 $609.6m of committed facilities and $67.7m 2012 $66.9m of uncommitted facilities.
Of the uncommitted facilities, $nil 2012 $0.3m is secured on the machinery that the loan was used to purchase and $67.7m 2012 $66.6m is unsecured.
The committed facilities comprise the Sterling denominated 375.0m $621.1m multi-currency loan facility from a syndicate of ten banks 2012 375.0m: $609.6m.
This facility expires on 5 August 2016 and is unsecured.
A commitment fee is payable on the undrawn amount.
The Groups treasury function maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed credit facilities.
The Group has the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at the year end: 2013 2012 $m $m Floating rate: Expiring between two and five years 378.0 305.3 Surplus funds are placed in short-term deposits with approved banks and with AAA rated Money Market Funds.

Financial Instruments: Sensitivity Analysis The following sensitivity analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables on the Groups and Companys financial instruments and show the impact on profit or loss and shareholders equity.
Financial instruments affected by market risk include cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis relates to the position as at 31 December 2013.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the cash and derivatives and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged from the hedge designations in place at 31 December 2013.
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-retirement obligations, provisions and on the non-financial assets and liabilities of foreign operations.
The following assumptions have been made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: Foreign exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have an asymmetric impact on the Groups results, that is, an increase in rates does not result in the same amount of movement as a decrease in rates.
For floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is assumed to be outstanding for the whole year.
Fixed rate financial instruments that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk for the purpose of this analysis.
The carrying values of financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost do not change as interest rates change.
Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity.
i Interest Rate Sensitivity The sensitivity rate of 0.25% 2012 0.25% for US interest rates represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change, based on historical volatility and a review of analysts research and banks expectations of future interest rates.
Group The post-tax impact on the income statement, with all other variables held constant, at 31 December, for an increase of 0.25% 2012 0.25% in US interest rates, is to reduce profits by $0.5m 2012 $0.6m.
If US interest rates were to decrease by 0.25% 2012 0.25%, then the post-tax impact on the income statement would be to increase profits by $0.5m 2012 $0.6m.
The movements arise on US dollar denominated borrowings.
There is no impact on other comprehensive income OCI for a change in interest rates.
Company The post-tax impact on the income statement, with all other variables held constant, at 31 December, for an increase of 0.25% 2012 0.25% in the UK interest rate, is to reduce profits by $0.1m 2012 $0.1m.
If the UK interest rate were to decrease by 0.25% 2012 0.25%, then the post-tax impact would be to increase profits by $0.1m 2012 $0.1m.
The movements arise on Sterling loans from subsidiaries.
There is no impact on OCI for a change in interest rates.
ii Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity The sensitivity rate of 10% 2012 10% for Sterling and Canadian dollar exchange rates represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change, based on historical volatility and a review of analysts research and banks expectations of future foreign exchange rates.

Post-Employment Benefits Group Pensions Within the UK, the Group operates a funded pension scheme, which includes a defined benefit section with benefits linked to final salary and a defined contribution section with benefits dependent on future investment returns.
The defined benefit section is closed to new UK employees who are offered membership of the defined contribution section.
The majority of UK employees are members of one of these arrangements.
The UK scheme is registered with HMRC for tax purposes, and is operated separately from the Group and managed by a set of trustees.
The trustees are responsible for the payment of benefits and the management of the schemes assets.
The UK scheme is subject to UK regulations, which require the Group and the trustees to agree a funding strategy and contributions schedule for the defined benefit section of the UK scheme.
Contributions to the defined contribution section of the UK scheme and other Group defined contribution arrangements are payable in addition and are charged directly to profit and loss.
Risk Exposures and Investment Strategy The weighted average duration to payment of the projected future cash flows from the defined benefit section of the UK scheme is about 16 years.
The scheme is managed so that it is well funded and represents a low risk to the Group.
In particular, the schemes assets are invested in a range of deferred annuity and immediate annuity policies with two insurers, which largely match the benefits to be paid to members of the scheme.
This strategy significantly reduces the Groups investment, inflation and demographic risks in relation to the schemes liabilities.
This is demonstrated by the relative stability of the Groups pension asset from year to year.
The position would change materially if one of the insurers were no longer able to meet its obligations as the pension obligation ultimately rests with the Group.
Funding Strategy The trustees and the Group together agree a funding strategy for the scheme every three years.
Under this agreement, the Group expects to contribute $5.5m to the defined benefit section of the UK scheme in the next reporting period.
The net assets for the UK post-employment benefit scheme are: Restated 2013 2012 $m $m Present value of funded obligations 428.2 391.4 Fair value of plan assets 457.8 414.2 Net asset 29.6 22.8 Changes in the net asset recognised in the balance sheet Restated 2013 2012 $m $m Opening balance sheet asset 22.8 19.9 Exchange adjustments 0.8 1.0 Expense charged to income statement 4.1 3.8 Amount recognised in other comprehensive income 4.2 0.6 Employer contributions paid 5.9 6.3 Closing balance sheet asset 29.6 22.8 The Group has concluded that it can recognise the full amount of this surplus on the grounds that it could gain sufficient economic benefit from a future reduction of its contributions to the scheme.

The gain due to these factors offsets the corresponding loss on the re-measurement of the defined benefit obligation, demonstrating that the pensions-related risks have been mitigated by the schemes investment strategy.
In particular, the gain on the assets is greater than the loss on the defined benefit obligation because the value of the insurance annuity policies exceeds the value of the defined benefit obligation.
The major asset categories for the defined benefit section of the UK scheme are: 2013 2012 $m $m Insurance annuity policies 452.7 413.5 Cash other 5.1 0.7 Fair value of plan assets 457.8 414.2 The scheme does not invest in property occupied by the Group or in financial securities issued by the Group.

Post-Employment Benefits continued The amounts recognised in the income statement are: 2013 2012 $m $m Current service cost recognised within operating expenses 5.2 4.9 Net interest on the defined benefit asset recognised within interest income 1.1 1.1 Total expense included within staff costs note 10 4.1 3.8 The current service cost includes $1.3m 2012 $1.4m of administration costs.
In addition, employer contributions of $9.4m 2012 $7.1m for various Group defined contribution arrangements including the defined contribution section of the UK scheme are recognised in the income statement.
Special Events During 2013, a further tranche of benefits was secured with one of the insurers.
The effect of this has been recognised in other comprehensive income.
The principal assumptions used for accounting purposes reflect prevailing market conditions and are: 2013 2012 Discount rate 4.4% p. a.
5.1% p. a. Mortality assumption life expectancy 2013 2012 Male aged 65 at the accounting date 24.8 24.5 Female aged 65 at the accounting date 27.0 25.9 Male aged 65 in 20 years 27.4 27.6 Female aged 65 in 20 years 29.4 27.8 The assumptions used to determine the end-of-year benefit obligations are also used to calculate the following years cost.
Sensitivity Analysis Apart from the assumption for salary increases, the change in the obligation arising as a result of changes in the above assumptions is broadly matched by a corresponding change in the value of the insurance policies, so that the impact on the net balance sheet asset is significantly dampened.
A 0.25% p. a. increase in the salary increase assumption would increase the defined benefit obligation by about $1.7m without having any impact on the value of the schemes assets.
Hunting PLC 2013 Annual Report and Accounts 133 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued 31.
Post-Employment Benefits continued Unfunded Defined Benefit Pension Scheme The Group also operates a cash balance arrangement in the US for certain executives.
Members build up benefits in this arrangement by way of notional contributions and notional investment returns.
Actual contributions are paid into an entirely separate investment vehicle held by the Company, which is used to pay benefits due from the cash balance arrangement when the member retires.
Under IAS 19, the cash balance arrangement is accounted for as an unfunded defined benefit scheme.
The amounts recognised in the income statement during the year were $0.2m 2012 $0.2m for the employers current service cost recognised in operating expenses and $0.1m 2012 $0.2m interest cost recognised in interest expense.

Capital Risk Management The Groups capital employed a non-GAAP measure consists of equity and net debt.
Restated 2013 2012 $m $m Total equity 1,414.8 1,332.7 Net debt 205.8 266.4 Capital employed 1,620.6 1,599.1 Gearing 15% 20% Capital employed is managed with the aim of maintaining an appropriate level of financing available for the Groups activities.
The balance of debt and equity, as reflected in the gearing ratio, which is net debt expressed as a percentage of total equity, is managed having due regard to the respective cost of funds and their availability.
The Groups net debt is monitored on a daily basis and is managed by the control of working capital, dividend and capital expenditure payments and the purchase and disposal of assets and businesses.
The level of net debt and related gearing ratio of 15% at 31 December 2013 is considered comfortable, with adequate headroom remaining, giving management ongoing flexibility.
For debt funding, the Group ensures that banking and other borrowing covenants are complied with, and that appropriate forecast headroom exists, to ensure that borrowing facilities remain in place.
The main financial covenants attached to the 375m committed bank facility require EBITDA to cover net finance charges by a minimum of four times and net debt to be no more than three times adjusted EBITDA.
For covenant testing purposes, the Groups EBITDA is adjusted to include the share of associates post-tax results and exclude the fair value charge for share awards.
EBITDA, for covenant test purposes, is based on the previous twelve month period, measured twice yearly at 30 June and 31 December.
The covenants are monitored on a monthly basis and all external covenant requirements have been met during the year.
Both key bank covenant metrics at year end were adequately covered.
Return on average capital employed is a KPI management uses to assess business unit performance.
The Group return on capital employed has fallen from 13% during 2012 to 12% in 2013 reflecting the ongoing capital investment programme on expansion projects, which do not provide an immediate financial return.
Rates of capital return are expected to increase as these expansion projects become operational and contribute to the Group results.
Changes in equity arise from the retention of earnings and, from time to time, issues of share capital.
The Board considers each ordinary dividend proposed based on the merits of the information available to it at the time.
Consideration is given to the financial projections of business performance and capital investment needs, together with feedback from shareholder discussions.
The Group operates a centralised treasury function with policies and procedures approved by the Board.
These cover funding, banking relationships, foreign currency, interest rate exposures, cash management and the investment of surplus cash.
Further detail on financial risks is provided within note 29.
The Group has significant foreign operations and hence results originate in a number of currencies, particularly in Sterling and Singapore dollars.
As a result, the Groups financial statements, which are reported in US dollars, are subject to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations with respect to currency conversions.
Currency options can be used to reduce currency risk movements on the Groups results.
Currency exposure on the balance sheet is, where practical, reduced by financing assets with borrowings in the same currency.
Spot and forward foreign exchange contracts are used to cover the net exposure of purchases and sales in non-domestic currencies.

Share-based Payments continued b Performance Share Plan PSP The Company continues to operate and grant share awards and options under its performance share plan.
Under the PSP, annual conditional awards of shares and options may be made to executive Directors and senior employees.
Awards and options are subject to performance conditions and continued employment during the vesting period.
The PSP are granted at nil cost.
The PSP awards made in the year will vest subject to total shareholder return TSR performance over a three year period from the date of grant, relative to comparator companies from the Dow Jones US Oil Equipment and Services sector index and the DJ STOXX TM Oil Equipment and Services sector index.
Details of the PSP awards and options movements during the year are set out below: Number Number of awards of awards 2013 2012 Outstanding at beginning of the year 712,056 635,571 Granted during the year 177,027 309,924 Vested during the year 171,910 Lapsed during the year 148,509 233,439 Outstanding at the end of the year 568,664 712,056 Details of PSP awards and options outstanding at 31 December 2013 are as follows: Number Number Normal of awards of awards vesting Date of grant 2013 2012 date 26 February 2010 248,453 26.02.13 25 February 2011 174,020 202,214 25.02.14 17 April 2012 225,564 261,389 17.04.15 20 March 2013 169,080 20.03.16 Outstanding at the end of the year 568,664 712,056 The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the awards that vested during the year was 904.6p 2012 nil.
The fair value of the PSP awards and options granted in 2013 was calculated using the Stochastic pricing model also known as the Monte Carlo model, which incorporates the effect of the TSR performance condition.
The assumptions used in the model were as follows: 2013 2012 Weighted average share price at grant 901.0p 906.0p Exercise price 0p 0p Expected volatility Hunting PLC 34.8% 35.3% Expected volatility Comparator group average 42.8% 44.2% Risk free rate 0.3% 0.5% Expected life 3 years 3 years Fair value 566.60p 604.97p The expected volatility was calculated using historic weekly volatility over three years prior to grant, equal in length to the performance period at the date of grant.
The expected volatilities of each constituent of the comparator group are calculated on the same basis and input into the model individually and the average of these figures is shown in the table above.
The expected life of the award has been calculated as three years, commensurate with the vesting period.
The risk free rate is based on the UK gilt rate commensurate with the vesting period prevailing at the date of grant.

It is accumulated over the vesting period and released subject to the achievement of the performance condition.
This is factored into the fair value calculation and as a result the dividend yield assumption is set to zero.
The initial accounting charge of the PSP incorporates an estimate of the number of shares that are expected to lapse for those participants who cease employment during the vesting period.
The estimate of the expected forfeiture rate is 2.5% per annum.
The subsequent accounting charge for 2013 includes an adjustment to the initial accounting charge to allow for actual lapses rather than estimated lapses.
The charge to the income statement attributable to the PSP is $0.8m 2012 $1.7m, which is recognised in operating expenses.
c Restricted Share Plan RSP The Company continues to operate and grant share awards and options under its restricted share plan.
Under the RSP, annual conditional awards of shares and options may be made to employees subject to continued employment during the vesting period.

Principal Accounting Policies The Groups principal accounting policies are described below.
1 Consolidation The Group accounts include the results of the Company and its subsidiaries, together with its share of associates.
Uniform accounting policies have been adopted across the Group.
2 Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies irrespective of the percentage of voting rights owned.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are fide-consolidated from the date control ceases.
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations.
Consequently the consideration is determined as the fair value of the net assets transferred to the vendor and includes an estimate of any contingent consideration.
The net assets acquired are also measured at their respective fair values for initial recognition purposes on the acquisition date.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed to the income statement as incurred.
3 Discontinued Operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Group that has either been disposed of or that is classified as held-for-sale, which represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations.
Discontinued operations are presented separately in the income statement and are shown net of tax.
4 Revenue Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of goods or services in the ordinary course of business, taking into account trade discounts and volume rebates, and is stated net of sales taxes.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, which is normally on delivery of the products.
Products include manufactured goods and OCTG supplies, including tubulars acquired by Hunting as plain-end pipe on which lathing work has been applied and which is re-sold as threaded pipe.
Revenue from the sale of services is recognised when the services are rendered.
The Groups service activities principally comprise lathing work on customer-owned plain-end pipe in order to apply a thread to each pipe end and commissions earned from shipbroking.
Revenue from the rental of plant and equipment is recognised as the income is earned.
5 Amortisation and Exceptional Items Exceptional items are items of income or expense which the Directors believe should be separately disclosed by virtue of their significant size or nature to enable a better understanding of the Groups financial performance.
The group discloses such items in the middle column of the income statement.
In applying this policy, the following items are treated as exceptional: Acquisitions can give rise to a number of exceptional items.
These would include acquisition costs written-off, and bonus arrangements which management view as a one-off arrangement.
To the extent that acquisitions include contingent consideration, adjustments subsequent to the initial recognition of fair value, which are reflected in the income statement, are treated as exceptional.
The unwinding of fair value uplifts to inventories recognised at acquisition are treated as exceptional such that gross profit can be shown based on the original cost of production or purchase as would be the case for normal trading transactions in existing companies and to avoid artificial profit increases in post-acquisition periods as the unwind diminishes.
A gain or loss on the disposal of a business and any expense or income arising from indemnities in disposal agreements would be treated as exceptional.
Property, plant and equipment held by the exploration and production division are subject to impairment or reversals of impairment based on value in use of or fair value less cost to sell calculations.
This can lead to volatility and, furthermore, given the Boards decision to curtail future investment in this division except as contractually committed, such amounts are treated as exceptional.
For this reason, dry hole costs are also treated as exceptional.
Litigation settlements and associated legal costs.
The tax effect of any transaction considered to be exceptional is also treated as exceptional.
Hunting PLC 2013 Annual Report and Accounts 145 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued 43.
Principal Accounting Policies continued Details of items treated as exceptional in the year and relevant comparative information is detailed in note 7.
Amortisation expenses for acquired intangible assets are also shown in the middle column due to the significance of these amounts and to clearly identify the effect on profits, which will arise as current balances become fully written-off, or as new acquisitions give rise to new expenses.
6 Interest Interest income and expense is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
7 Foreign Currencies a Individual Subsidiaries and Associates Accounts The financial statements for each of the Groups subsidiaries and associates are prepared using their functional currency.
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.
Transactions denoted in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities, except borrowings designated as a hedging instrument in a net investment hedge, denoted in nonfunctional currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date and exchange differences are taken to the income statement.
Borrowings designated as a hedging instrument in a net investment hedge are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date and exchange differences are taken direct to equity.
b Group Consolidated Accounts The presentation currency of the Group is US dollars.
The net assets of non-US dollar denominated subsidiaries and associates are translated into US dollars at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The income statements of subsidiaries and associates are translated into US dollars at the average rates of exchange for the year.
Exchange differences are recognised directly in equity in the currency translation reserve CTR, together with exchange differences arising on foreign currency loans used to finance foreign currency net investments.
Upon adoption of IFRS on 1 January 2004, accumulated exchange differences arising on consolidation prior to 31 December 2003 were reset to zero and the CTR recommenced under IFRS on 1 January 2004.
The balance on the CTR represents the exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-US dollar amounts into US dollars since 1 January 2004.
On the disposal of a business, the cumulative exchange differences previously recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve relating to that business are transferred to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
8 Taxation The taxation charge in the income statement comprises current tax and deferred tax arising on the current years profit before tax and adjustments to tax arising on prior years profits.
Current tax is the expected tax payable arising in the current year on the current years profit before tax, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, plus adjustments to tax payable in respect of prior years profits.
Deferred tax is the expected tax payable on the current years profit before tax arising in a future year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Full provision is made for deferred taxation, using the liability method, on all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised separately on the balance sheet and are reported as non-current assets in line with IAS 1.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that they are expected to be recoverable.
Deferred taxation on unremitted overseas earnings is provided for to the extent a tax charge is foreseeable.
When items of income and expense are recognised in other comprehensive income, the current and deferred tax relating to those items is also recognised in other comprehensive income.
9 Segmental Reporting Financial information on operating segments that corresponds with information regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker is disclosed in the accounts.
Operating segments are components of the Group that are engaged in providing related products.
Geographical information is based on the location of where the sale originated and where the non-current assets are located.

Principal Accounting Policies continued 10 Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation a General Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition and installation of the asset.
Land, pre-production oil and gas exploration costs and assets under construction are not depreciated.
With the exception of drilling tools, which are depreciated using the units of production method, and oil and gas exploration and production equipment see 10 b below, assets are depreciated using the straight-line method at the following rates: Freehold buildings 2% to 10% Leasehold buildings life of lease 1 Plant, machinery and motor vehicles 6% to 33 3% The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
b Exploration Expenditure Oil and gas exploration and appraisal costs are initially capitalised pending determination of the existence of commercial reserves and are included in the asset category oil and gas exploration and development.
Upon determination that commercially viable quantities of hydrocarbons are not found, the costs are charged immediately to the income statement.
Depreciation of oil and gas expenditure commences when production commences.
The costs are depreciated using the unit of production method.
11 Goodwill Goodwill arises when the fair value of the consideration paid for a business exceeds the fair value of the Groups share of the net assets acquired.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
The allocation is made to the cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
On the disposal of a business, goodwill relating to that business that remains on the balance sheet at the date of disposal is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
12 Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses where applicable.
These assets have a finite life and are amortised in accordance with the pattern of expected future economic benefits, or when this cannot be reliably estimated, by using the straight-line method.
Intangible assets are amortised over the following periods: Customer relationships eight to ten years Patents ten to twelve years Unpatented technology ten years Trademarks and domain names one to five years 13 Impairments The Group performs goodwill impairment reviews at least annually.
The Group also assesses at least annually whether there have been any events or changes in circumstances that indicate that property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill may be impaired.
An impairment review is carried out whenever the assessment indicates that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.
For the purposes of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
Where impairment exists, the asset is written down to the higher of a its fair value minus costs to sell: and b its value in use.
Impairments are recognised immediately in the income statement.
An impairment to goodwill is never reversed.
When applicable, an impairment of any other asset is reversed, but only to the extent that the consequent carrying value does not exceed what would have been the carrying value had the impairment not originally been made.
14 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined using the first-in-first-out method and net realisable value is the estimated selling price less costs of disposal in the ordinary course of business.
The cost of inventories includes direct costs plus production overheads.
Hunting PLC 2013 Annual Report and Accounts 147 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued 43.
Principal Accounting Policies continued 15 Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with a maturity of less than three months from the date of deposit that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash.
For cash flow statement purposes, cash and cash equivalents include bank overdrafts and short-term deposits with a maturity of less than three months from the date of deposit.
In the balance sheet, bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
16 Loans and Receivables Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value at the trade date which is normally the consideration paid plus transaction costs.
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
If collection is expected in one year or less they are classified as current assets, otherwise they are presented as non-current assets.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a loan or receivable is impaired and if necessary the carrying amount is reduced to the appropriate value.
The loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Loans and receivables cease to be recognised when the right to receive cash flows has expired or the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
17 Financial Liabilities Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value at the trade date which is normally the consideration received less, in the case of financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs.
The Group subsequently remeasures all of its non-derivative financial liabilities, including trade payables, at amortised cost.
Payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year, otherwise they are presented as non-current liabilities.
18 Provisions Provisions are liabilities for which the amount or timing of future expenditure is uncertain.
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation.
Whenever the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted to their present value.
19 Post-employment Benefits a Defined Contribution Retirement Schemes Payments to defined contribution retirement schemes are charged to the income statement when they fall due.
b Defined Benefit Retirement Schemes Payments to defined benefit retirement schemes are recognised as increments to the assets of the schemes.
The amount charged to the income statement with respect to these schemes, within profit from operations, is the increase in the retirement benefit obligation resulting from the additional service provided by the participating employees during the current year, which is measured using the Projected Unit method.
Net interest arising on the net assets of the scheme is also recognised in the income statement within net finance costs.
Remeasurement gains and losses are recognised fully and immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
The assets of the UK scheme which are invested in insurance policies have been valued using the same methodology and assumptions used to calculate the defined benefit obligation so that, where the assets match the liabilities, the value of the assets is equal to the value of the corresponding obligation.

Principal Accounting Policies continued 20 Share-based Payments The Group issues share-based payments LTIP awards, which can be settled in either cash or equity, to certain employees as consideration for services received from the employees.
A liability is recognised equal to the current fair value of the services received, determined at each balance sheet date.
The fair value of the liability is remeasured at each subsequent reporting date and at the date of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
The Group also issues equity-settled share-based payments PSP and RSP awards to certain employees as consideration for services received from the employees.
The fair value of the employees services is recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of awards that will ultimately vest.
The fair value of employees services is determined by an external valuer, using the Monte Carlo model for PSP awards and the Black-Scholes model for the RSP awards, with reference to the grant date fair value of the options granted.
The fair value includes market performance conditions in respect of the performance based awards and excludes the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions.
No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting date.
21 Share Capital The Companys share capital comprises a single class of Ordinary shares, which are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are charged to equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of tax.
22 Dividend Distributions Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised as liabilities in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders and are dealt with in the statement of changes in equity.
