DIRECTORS REPORT CONTINUED Resolution 11 is to renew the authority for a further period until the Companys Annual General Meeting in 2014.
The price paid for shares on exercise of the authority will not be less than the nominal value of 12.50 per share or more than the higher of a 5% above the average of the middle market quotations of those shares for the five business days before the shares are purchased and b the higher of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the London Stock Exchange.
The authority, which may be used to buy back shares either for cancellation or subject to statutory limits to be held in Treasury, will be used to purchase shares only if, in the opinion of the Directors, a purchase would be in the best interests of the shareholders as a whole and would result in an increase in the net asset value per share for the remaining shareholders.
There are no outstanding options warrants to subscribe for equity shares in the capital of the Company.
Treasury Shares Under UK company law investment trusts are able to acquire their own shares to hold in Treasury for re-sale.
The Directors consider that this facility gives the Company more flexibility in managing its share capital.
As at 3 June 2009 the Company had re-sold all of its Ordinary shares in Treasury and has not acquired any shares to be held in Treasury since that date.
Resolutions 10 and 11 would provide the Directors with the authority they need to manage Treasury shares.
Any buy-back of shares into Treasury and re-sale of shares from Treasury will operate within the following limits: Treasury shares will be sold only at a premium to the net asset value of the shares at the time of sale: and Treasury shares will not be sold at a discount of more than 10% to the middle market price of the shares at the time of sale.
Notice period for General Meetings The Companys Articles of Association enable the Company to call General Meetings other than an Annual General Meeting on 14 clear days notice.
In order for this to be effective, the shareholders must also approve annually the calling of meetings other than Annual General Meetings on 14 days notice.
Resolution 12 will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to seek such approval.
The approval will be effective until the Companys next Annual General Meeting, when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed.
The Company meets the requirements for electronic voting under the Companies Act 2006, offering facilities for all shareholders to vote by electronic means.
The Directors believe it is in the best interests of the shareholders for the shorter notice period to be available to the Company, although it is intended that this flexibility will be used only for early renewals of the Boards authority to issue new Shares and non-routine business and only where merited in the interests of shareholders as a whole.
RECOMMENDATION The Board considers that the resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting are in the best interests of the shareholders as a whole and recommends that they vote in favour of such resolutions, as the Directors intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings.
