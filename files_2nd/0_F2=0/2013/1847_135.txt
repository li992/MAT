Derivative financial instruments swaps continued b Foreign exchange swaps continued The Group and Company have entered into swap arrangements to swap all of this debt into xed rate Sterling debt in accordance with the Group treasury policy outlined in note 26.
Accordingly, on 2 July 2013, foreign exchange swaps of US$166.6m were cancelled.
The swap arrangements are designated as cash ow hedges against future foreign exchange rate movements.
The hedges match the contractual initial receipt, the final settlement and match 83% of the interest payments.
The fair value of the swap arrangements as at 30 June 2013, which is based on third party valuations, was an asset of 29.3m 2012: 28.6m with a gain of 0.7m 2012: 4.6m credited directly to equity in the year.
There was no ineffectiveness to be taken through the income statement during the year or the prior year.
Further disclosures relating to financial instruments are set out in note 26.
Financial risk management The Groups approach to risk management and the principal operational risks of the business are detailed on pages 34 to 39.
The Groups financial assets, financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments are detailed in notes 23, 24 and 25.
The Groups operations and nancing arrangements expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market prices, credit risks, liquidity risks and interest rates.
The most signi cant of these to the Group is liquidity risk and, accordingly, there is a regular, detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash ows from the operations to Group management to ensure that risks are promptly identi ed and appropriate mitigating actions taken by the central treasury department.
These forecasts are further stress-tested at a Group level on a regular basis to ensure that adequate headroom within facilities and banking covenants is maintained.
In addition, the Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects of the other risks on its financial performance, in particular by using financial instruments, including debt and derivatives, to hedge interest rates and currency rates.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Board approves treasury policies and certain day-to-day treasury activities have been delegated to a centralised Treasury Operating Committee, which in turn regularly reports to the Board.
The treasury department implements guidelines that are established by the Board and the Treasury Operating Committee.
a Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its liabilities as they fall due.
The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and medium-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has suf cient available funds for operations.
The Groups borrowings are typically cyclical throughout the financial year and peak in April and May and October and November of each year, due to seasonal trends in income.
Accordingly, the Group maintains suf cient facility headroom to cover these requirements.
On a normal operating basis, the Group has a policy of maintaining headroom of up to 150.0m.
The Group identi es and takes appropriate actions based upon its regular, detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash ows from its operations.
At 30 June 2013, the Group had committed bank and other facilities of 1,030.5m 2012: 1,091.0m and total facilities of 1,076.7m 2012: 1,137.2m.
The Groups drawn debt against these facilities was 342.7m 2012: 342.0m.
This represented 33.3% 2012: 31.3% of available committed facilities at 30 June 2013.
In addition, the Group had 294.4m 2012: 150.3m of cash and cash equivalents.

Financial risk management continued a Liquidity risk continued The Group was in compliance with its financial covenants at 30 June 2013.
At the date of approval of the financial statements, the Groups internal forecasts indicate that it will remain in compliance with these covenants for the foreseeable future, being at least twelve months from the date of signing these financial statements.
The Groups objective is to minimise re nancing risk.
The Group therefore has a policy that the average maturity of its committed bank facilities and private placement notes is at least two years on average with a target of three years.
At 30 June 2013, the average maturity of the Groups facilities was 3.9 years 2012: 3.7 years.
The Group maintains certain committed oating rate facilities with banks to ensure suf cient liquidity for its operations.

b Market risk price risk i UK housing market risk This section speci cally discusses UK housing market risk in the context of the financial instruments in the Group balance sheet.
The Group is subject to the prevailing conditions of the UK economy and the Groups earnings are dependent upon the level of UK house prices.
UK house prices are determined by the UK economy and economic conditions including employment levels, interest rates, consumer con dence, mortgage availability and competitor pricing.
However, the Group does seek to maintain an appropriate geographic spread of operating divisions and an appropriate product mix to mitigate any risks caused by local economic conditions.
The Group has detailed procedures to manage its market related operational risks, which include: a weekly review of key trading indicators, including reservations, sales rates, visitor levels, levels of incentives, competitor activity and cash ow projections: the provision to mortgage providers with complete transparency of house purchase prices alongside any discounts or other incentives in order that they have appropriate information upon which to base their lending decision: and collaboration with key mortgage lenders to ensure that products are appropriate wherever possible for their customers.
The UK housing market affects the valuation of the Groups nonfinancial assets and liabilities and the critical judgements applied by management in these financial statements, including the valuation of land and work in progress, goodwill and brands.

Financial risk management continued b Market risk price risk continued i UK housing market risk continued The Groups financial assets and liabilities, which are directly linked to the UK housing market, are as follows: Not linked Linked to to UK UK housing housing market market Total Group m m m 2013 Non-derivative financial assets 128.4 347.8 476.2 Non-derivative financial liabilities 1,583.5 1,583.5 Derivatives 2.2 2.2 128.4 1,233.5 1,105.1 2012 Non-derivative financial assets 189.2 177.7 366.9 Non-derivative financial liabilities 1,542.4 1,542.4 Derivatives 23.9 23.9 189.2 1,388.6 1,199.4 The value of the Groups available for sale financial assets is directly linked to the UK housing market.
At 30 June 2013, these assets were carried at a fair value of 128.4m 2012: 189.2m.
Further information is set out in note 16.
The Company has no financial assets and liabilities which are directly linked to the UK housing market.
Sensitivity analysis At 30 June 2013, if UK house prices had been 5% lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups house price linked financial assets and liabilities, which are solely available for sale financial assets, would decrease in value, excluding the effects of tax, by 8.4m 2012: 9.7m with a corresponding reduction in both the result for the year and equity.
ii Interest rate risk The Group has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities.
Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash ow interest rate risk and xed rate borrowings expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group has a policy of maintaining both long-term xed rate funding and medium-term oating rate funding so as to ensure that there is appropriate exibility for the Groups operational requirements.
The Group has entered into swap arrangements to hedge cash ow risks relating to interest rate movements on a proportion of its debt and has entered into xed rate debt in the form of Sterling and US Dollar denominated private placements.
The Group has a conservative treasury risk management strategy.
The proportion of the Groups median gross borrowings calculated on the latest three-year plan that should be at xed rates of interest is determined by the average expected interest cover for that period.
The current target is for 30-60% to be at xed rates of interest.
Due to the cyclicality of our borrowings throughout the year, as at 30 June 2013 65.3% 2012: 61.7% of the Groups gross borrowings were xed.
Group interest rates are xed using both swaps and xed rate debt instruments.

The oating rates are xed in advance for periods generally ranging from one to six months.
Short-term exibility is achieved through the use of overdraft, committed and uncommitted bank facilities.
The weighted average interest rate for oating rate borrowings in 2013 was 3.6% 2012: 3.5%.
Sterling private placement notes of 65.8m 2012: 65.8m were arranged at xed interest rates and exposed the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The weighted average interest rate for xed rate Sterling private placement notes for 2013 was 12.0% 2012: 12.0% with, at 30 June 2013, a weighted average period of zero years 2012: 6.9 years for which the rate is xed.
US Dollar denominated private placement notes of 133.5m 2012: 145.0m were arranged at xed interest rates and exposed the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The weighted average interest rate for xed rate US Dollar denominated private placement notes, after the effect of foreign exchange rate swaps, for 2013 was 10.2% 2012: 10.2% with, at 30 June 2013, a weighted average period of 1.5 years 2012: 4.9 years for which the rate is xed.
On 14 May 2013, the Group completed a comprehensive re nancing package and irrevocably committed to prepay the 65.8m Sterling private placement notes and US$166.6m private placement notes and cancel the associated foreign exchange swaps, with effect from no later than 2 July 2013.
Accordingly, on 2 July 2013 the Sterling private placement notes of 65.8m and US$166.6m private placement notes were prepaid and foreign exchange swaps of US$166.6m were cancelled.
Sensitivity analysis In the year ended 30 June 2013, if UK interest rates had been 50 basis points higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups pre-tax pro t would decrease increase by 0.6m 2012: 1.6m, the Groups post-tax pro t would decrease increase by 0.5m 2012: 1.2m and the Groups equity would decrease increase by 0.5m 2012: 1.2m.

Financial risk management continued b Market risk price risk continued iii Foreign exchange rate risk As at 30 June 2013, the Group has xed rate US Dollar denominated private placement notes of $246.6m 2012: $267.2m.
In order to mitigate risks associated with the movement in the foreign exchange rate, the Group has a policy of fully hedging the principal of its US Dollar denominated debt and a signi cant proportion of the interest payments.
The Group therefore entered into foreign exchange swap arrangements on the issue of its US Dollar denominated debt, all of which are designated as cash ow hedges.
Accordingly, the Group has no net exposure to foreign currency risk on the principal of its US Dollar debt.
The foreign exchange swaps match 83% of the interest payments and therefore the Group is subject to foreign exchange rate risk upon the remaining 17%.
On 14 May 2013, the Group completed a comprehensive re nancing package and irrevocably committed to prepay US$166.6m of private placement notes and cancel the associated foreign exchange swaps, with effect from no later than 2 July 2013.
Accordingly, on 2 July 2013 foreign exchange swaps of US$166.6m were cancelled.
Details of the Groups foreign exchange swaps are provided in note 25.
Sensitivity analysis In the year ended 30 June 2013, if the US Dollar per Pound Sterling exchange rate had been $0.20 higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups pre-tax pro t would decrease increase by 0.4m 2012: 0.3m, the Groups post-tax pro t would decrease increase by 0.3m 2012: 0.2m and the Groups equity would decrease increase by 0.3m 2012: 0.2m.
c Credit risk In the majority of cases, the Group receives cash upon legal completion for private sales and receives advance stage payments from Registered Providers for social housing.
The Group has 128.4m 2012: 189.2m of available for sale financial assets, which expose it to credit risk, although this asset is spread over a large number of properties.
In addition, the Group and Company have an investment of 25.8m in a joint venture which holds available for sale financial assets, which exposes the joint venture to credit risk, although this is spread over a large number of properties.
As such, neither the Group nor the Company have a signi cant concentration of credit risk, as their exposure is spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The Group manages credit risk in the following ways: The Group has a credit policy that is limited to financial institutions with high credit ratings, as set by international credit rating agencies, and has a policy determining the maximum permissible exposure to any single counterparty.
The Group only contracts derivative financial instruments with counterparties with which the Group has an ISDA Master Agreement in place.
These agreements permit net settlement, thereby reducing the Groups credit exposure to individual counterparties.
The maximum exposure to any counterparty at 30 June 2013 was 76.9m 2012: 42.5m of cash on deposit with a financial institution.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowance for losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
As at 30 June 2013, the Company was exposed to 969.6m 2012: 556.4m of credit risk in relation to intercompany loans, as well as financial guarantees, performance bonds and the bank borrowings of subsidiary undertakings.
The Company was also exposed to credit risk through its joint venture as explained above.
Further details are provided in notes 34 and 35. d Capital risk management cash ow risk The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and meet its liabilities as they fall due whilst maintaining an appropriate capital structure.
The Group manages as capital its equity, as set out in the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity, its bank borrowings being overdrafts, loan notes and bank loans and its private placement notes, as set out in note 24.
The management of these operational risks is set out in the principal risks and uncertainties on pages 34 to 39.
In addition, the other methods by which the Group can manage its short-term and long-term capital structure include: adjusting the level of ordinary dividends paid to shareholders assuming the Company is paying a dividend : issuing new share capital: arranging debt to meet liability payments: and selling assets to reduce debt.
