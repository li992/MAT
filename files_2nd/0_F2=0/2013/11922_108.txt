Earnings per share Basic Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders of the company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the company and held as treasury shares.
Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares to take account of all dilutive potential ordinary shares and adjusting the profit attributable, if applicable, to account for any tax consequences that might arise from conversion of those shares.

The companys definition of adjusted earnings per share may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Adjusted earnings includes the results from continuing and discontinued operations.
The following items are excluded from adjusted earnings: Other net gains and losses represent profits and losses on the acquisition and disposal of subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and other financial assets that are included within continuing or discontinued operations but which distort the performance of the Group.
Amortisation of acquired intangibles, acquisition costs and movements in contingent acquisition consideration are also excluded from adjusted earnings as these items are not considered to be fully reflective of the underlying performance of the Group.
OVERVIEW OUR PERFORMANCE RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Section 5 Financial statements 147 8.
Earnings per share continued Other net finance income costs include finance costs in respect of retirement benefits, finance costs of put options and deferred consideration and foreign exchange and other gains and losses.
Finance costs relating to retirement benefits are excluded as the Groups interpretation is that the new presentation under IAS 19 revised does not reflect the economic substance of the underlying assets and liabilities.
Finance costs of put options and deferred consideration are excluded as they relate to future earn outs and similar payments on acquisitions and do not reflect cash expended.
Foreign exchange and other gains and losses are excluded as they represent short-term fluctuations in market value and are subject to significant volatility.
Other gains and losses may not be realised in due course as it is normally the intention to hold the related instruments to maturity.
Other net finance costs of Group companies are included in finance costs or finance income as appropriate.
Other net finance costs of joint ventures and associates are included within the share of results of joint ventures and associates within operating profit.
Tax on the above items is excluded from adjusted earnings.
Where relevant the Group also excludes the benefit from recognising previously unrecognised pre-acquisition and capital losses.
The Group includes the benefit of tax amortisation of goodwill and intangibles as this benefit more accurately aligns the adjusted tax charge with the expected rate of cash tax payments.
Non-controlling interest for the above items is excluded from adjusted earnings.
The following tables reconcile statutory earnings to adjusted earnings.
