Overseas tax is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
The impact of the changes in statutory rates relates principally to the reduction of the UK corporation tax rate from 24% to 23% from 1 April 2013, 21% from 1 April 2014, and 20% from 1 April 2015.
These changes have resulted in a deferred tax charge arising from the reduction in the balance sheet carrying value of deferred tax assets to reflect the anticipated rate of tax at which those assets are expected to reverse.
