US$200m 121m of the loan notes issued in July 2008 have a fair value market gain of 21m 2012: 31m.
The fair value of the remaining notes approximates to their book value.
Borrowing at fl oating rates exposes the company to cash fl ow interest rate risk.
The management of this risk is detailed in note h. There were no fi financial liabilities upon which no interest is paid.

The group presents its consolidated fi financial statements in sterling and as a consequence is subject to foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the results and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The company together with G4S International Finance plc hedges a substantial portion of the groups exposure to fl uctuations in the translation into sterling of its overseas net assets by holding loans in foreign currencies.
Translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency loans are recognised in the profi t and loss account.
Cross currency swaps with a nominal value of 101m were arranged to hedge the foreign currency risk on US$200m of the second US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008, effectively fi xing the sterling value on this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.9750.
Assuming a 1% appreciation of sterling against the US dollar, the fair value net gain on the cross currency swaps which hedge part of the currency loan notes would be expected to fall by 1m.
Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps Borrowing at fl oating rates as described in note 28 to the consolidated fi financial statements exposes the group to cash fl ow interest rate risk, which the company manages within policy limits approved by the directors.
Interest rate swaps and, to a limited extent, forward rate agreements are utilised to fi x the interest rate on a proportion of borrowings on a reducing scale over forward periods up to a maximum of fi five years.
At 31 December 2013 the nominal value of such contracts was nil in respect of US dollar 2012: nil and 37m in respect of euro 2012: 73m, their weighted average interest rate was nil% US dollar 2012: nil% and 2.8% euro 2012: 3.2%, and their weighted average period to maturity was twelve months.
All the interest rate hedging instruments are designated and fully effective as cash fl ow hedges and movements in their fair value have been deferred in equity.
The quantity of interest rate swaps outstanding in the company is expected to continue to decline as Treasury activity is increasingly conducted by G4S International Finance plc.
The US Private Placement market is predominantly a fi xed rate market, with investors looking for a fi xed rate return over the life of the loan notes.
At the time of the fi first issue in March 2007, the company was comfortable with the proportion of fl oating rate exposure not hedged by interest rate swaps and therefore rather than take on a higher proportion of fi xed rate debt arranged fi xed to fl oating swaps effectively converting the fi xed coupon on the Private Placement to a fl oating rate.
Following the swaps the resulting average coupon on the US Private Placement is Libor 60bps.
These swaps have been documented as fair value hedges of the US Private Placement fi xed interest loan notes, with the movements in their fair value posted to profi t and loss at the same time as the movement in the fair value of the hedged item.
The interest on the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008 and on the sterling Public Bond issued in May 2009 was kept at fi xed rate.
The core company borrowings are held in US dollar, euro and sterling.
Although the impact of rising interest rates is largely shielded by fi xed rate loans and interest rate swaps which fi x a portion of the exposure, some interest rate risk remains.
A 1% increase in interest rates across the yield curve in each of these currencies with the 31 December 2013 debt position constant throughout 2014, would lead to an expectation of an additional interest charge of 3m in the 2014 fi financial year.
Commodity risk and commodity swaps The groups principal commodity risk relates to the fl uctuating level of diesel prices, particularly affecting its cash solutions businesses.
The company acts as a market intermediary, arranging commodity swaps and commodity options with its relationship banks with back to back deals on identical terms with its subsidiaries to fi x synthetically part of the exposure and reduce the associated cost volatility.
Counterparty credit risk The companys strategy for credit risk management is to set minimum credit ratings for counterparties and monitor these on a regular basis.
For treasury-related transactions, the policy limits the aggregate credit risk assigned to a counterparty.
The utilisation of a credit limit is calculated by applying a weighting to the notional value of each transaction outstanding with each counterparty based on the type and duration of the transaction.
The total mark to market value outstanding with each counterparty is closely monitored against policy limits assigned to each counterparty.
For short-term transactions under one year, at inception of the transaction, the fi financial counterparty must be investment grade rated by either the Standard & Poors or Moodys rating agencies.
For long-term transactions, at inception of the transaction, the fi financial counterparty must have a minimum rating of BBB Baa1 from Standard & Poors or Moodys.
Treasury transactions are dealt with the companys relationship banks, all of which have a strong investment grade rating.
At 31 December 2013 the largest two counterparty exposures relating to treasury transactions were 28m and 20m and both were held with institutions with long-term Standard & Poors credit ratings of Aand A respectively.
These exposures represent 42% 2012: 37% and 30% 2012: 29% of the carrying values of derivative fi financial instruments, with a fair value gain at the balance sheet date.
Both of these banks had signifi cant loan commitments outstanding to G4S plc at 31 December 2013.
The company participates in the groups multi-currency notional pooling cash management system with a wholly owned subsidiary of an Aa3 rated bank.
There is legal right of set off under the pooling agreement.

M CONTINGENT LIABILITIES To help secure cost effective fi finance facilities for its subsidiaries, the company issues guarantees to some of its fi finance providers.
At 31 December 2013 guarantees totalling 479m 2012: 493m were in place in support of such facilities.
