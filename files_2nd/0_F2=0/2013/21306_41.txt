Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 This section describes Barclays significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates that relate to the financial statements and notes as a whole.
If an accounting policy or a critical accounting estimate relates to a specific note, the applicable accounting policy and or critical accounting estimate is contained within the relevant note.
Reporting entity These financial statements are prepared for Barclays PLC and its subsidiaries the Barclays PLC Group or the Group under Section 399 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Group is a major global financial services provider engaged in retail banking, credit cards, wholesale banking, investment banking, wealth management and investment management services.
In addition, individual financial statements have been presented for the holding company.
Compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards The consolidated financial statements of the Group, and the individual financial statements of Barclays PLC, have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and interpretations IFRICs issued by the Interpretations Committee, as published by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
They are also in accordance with IFRS and IFRIC interpretations endorsed by the European Union.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated and individual financial statements are set out below, and in the relevant notes to the financial statements.
These policies have been consistently applied.
Basis of preparation The consolidated and individual financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to include the fair valuation of investment property and particular financial instruments to the extent required or permitted under IFRS as set out in the relevant accounting policies.
They are stated in millions of pounds Sterling m, the functional currency of Barclays PLC.
Accounting policies The Groups significant accounting policies relating to specific financial statement items, together with a description of the accounting estimates and judgements that were critical to preparing them, are set out under the relevant notes.
Accounting policies that affect the financial statements as a whole are set out below.
i Consolidation Barclays applies IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
The consolidated financial statements combine the financial statements of Barclays PLC and all its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are entities over which Barclays PLC has control.
The Group has control over another entity when the Group has all of the following: 1 power over the relevant activities of the investee, for example through voting or other rights: 2 exposure to, or rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee: and 3 the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The assessment of control is based on the consideration of all facts and circumstances.
The Group reassesses whether it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control.
Intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation and consistent accounting policies are used throughout the Group for the purposes of the consolidation.
Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions if they occur after control has already been obtained and they do not result in loss of control.
Details of the principal subsidiaries are given in Note 38.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Note 1: Significant accounting policies continued ii Foreign currency translation The Group applies IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.
Transactions and balances in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency balances are translated into Sterling at the period end exchange rates.
Exchange gains and losses on such balances are taken to the income statement.
The Groups foreign operations including subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and branches based mainly outside the UK may have different functional currencies.
The functional currency of an operation is the currency of the main economy to which it is exposed.
Prior to consolidation or equity accounting the assets and liabilities of non-Sterling operations are translated at the closing rate and items of income, expense and other comprehensive income are translated into Sterling at the rate on the date of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign operations are included in currency translation reserves within equity.
These are transferred to the income statement when the Group loses control, joint control or significant influence over the foreign operation or on partial disposal of the operation.
As the consolidated financial statements include partnerships where the Group member is a partner, advantage has been taken of the exemption under Regulation 7 of the Partnership Accounts Regulations 2008 with regard to preparing and filing of individual partnershp financial statements.
iii Financial assets and liabilities The Group applies IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for the recognition, classification and measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, for the impairment of financial assets, and for hedge accounting.
Recognition The Group recognises financial assets and liabilities when it becomes a party to the terms of the contract, which is the trade date or the settlement date.
Classification and measurement Financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and may be held at fair value or amortised cost depending on the Groups intention toward the assets and the nature of the assets and liabilities, mainly determined by their contractual terms.
The accounting policy for each type of financial asset or liability is included within the relevant note for the item.
The Groups policies for determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities are set out in Note 18.
Derecognition The Group derecognises a financial asset, or a portion of a financial asset, from its balance sheet where the contractual rights to cash flows from the asset have expired, or have been transferred, usually by sale, and with them either substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset or significant risks and rewards, along with the unconditional ability to sell or pledge the asset.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the liability has been settled, has expired or has been extinguished.
An exchange of an existing financial liability for a new liability with the same lender on substantially different terms generally a difference of 10% in the present value of the cash flows is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Transactions in which the Group transfers assets and liabilities, portions of them, or financial risks associated with them can be complex and it may not be obvious whether substantially all of the risks and rewards have been transferred.
It is often necessary to perform a quantitative analysis.
Such an analysis compares the Groups exposure to variability in asset cash flows before the transfer with its retained exposure after the transfer.
A cash flow analysis of this nature may require judgement.
In particular, it is necessary to estimate the assets expected future cash flows as well as potential variability around this expectation.
The method of estimating expected future cash flows depends on the nature of the asset, with market and market-implied data used to the greatest extent possible.
The potential variability around this expectation is typically determined by stressing underlying parameters to create reasonable alternative upside and downside scenarios.
Probabilities are then assigned to each scenario.
Stressed parameters may include default rates, loss severity or prepayment rates.
iv Issued debt and equity instruments The Group applies IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation, to determine whether funding is either a financial liability debt or equity.
Issued financial instruments or their components are classified as liabilities if the contractual arrangement results in the Group having a present obligation to either deliver cash or another financial asset, or a variable number of equity shares, to the holder of the instrument, if this is not the case, the instrument is generally an equity instrument and the proceeds included in equity, net of transaction costs.
Dividends and other returns to equity holders are recognised when paid or declared by the members at the AGM and treated as a deduction from equity.
Where issued financial instruments contain both liability and equity components, these are accounted for separately.
The fair value of the debt is estimated first and the balance of the proceeds is included within equity.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 285 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 continued Note 1: Significant accounting policies continued 5.
New and amended standards and interpretations The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except where new standards and amendments to IFRS effective as of 1 January 2013 have resulted in changes in accounting policy.
The new amended standards that have material impact on Barclays accounting policies are as follows: IFRS 10 IFRS 10 replaced requirements in IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements and SIC 12 Consolidation Special Purpose Entities.
This introduced new criteria to determine whether entities in which the Group has interests should be consolidated.
The implementation of IFRS 10 resulted in the Group consolidating some entities that were previously not consolidated and deconsolidating some entities that were previously consolidated, principally impacting the consolidation of entities in the Investment Bank with credit market exposures.
IAS 19 IAS 19 Revised 2011, amongst other changes, requires actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit pension schemes to be recognised in full.
Previously the Group deferred these over the remaining average service lives of the employees known as the corridor approach.
The effect of the adoption of these new or amended standards on the Groups financial position, performance and cash flows is disclosed in Note 46.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IFRS 13 provides comprehensive guidance on how to calculate the fair value of financial and non-financial assets.
The adoption of IFRS 13 did not have a material financial impact on the Group.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements IFRS 11 replaces IAS 31 Joint Ventures.
The new rules change the definition of a joint operation, requiring the group to recognise its share of income and expenses, and assets and liabilities for certain entities that were previously accounted for under the equity method.
The new standard also removed the option to proportionally consolidate joint arrangements, an option the Group did not use.
The adoption of IFRS 11 did not have a material impact on the Groups results or financial position.
IFRS 12 Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities IFRS 12 specifies the required disclosures in respect of interests in, and risks arising from, subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and structured entities whether consolidated or not.
As a disclosure only standard it will have no financial impact on the Group.
Amendment to IAS 39: Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting The amendment provides relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a hedging instrument to a central counterparty meets specified critera.
The Group applied the amendment in the current year, although it did not have a material impact on the Groups results or financial position.
Future accounting developments There have been and are expected to be a number of significant changes to the Groups financial reporting after 2013 as a result of amended or new accounting standards that have been or will be issued by the IASB.
The most significant of these are as follows: IAS 32 Amendments to Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, is effective from 1 January 2014.
The circumstances in which netting is permitted have been clarified: in particular what constitutes a currently legally enforceable right of set-off and the circumstances in which gross settlement systems may be considered equivalent to net settlement.
The amendments, based on current assumptions and applied to the 31 December 2013 balance sheet, are expected to gross up by approximately 35bn certain financial assets and financial liabilities in the balance sheet mainly derivatives, settlement balances and repurchase agreements that were previously reported net.
There will be no impact on shareholders equity, profit or loss, other comprehensive income, or cash flows, and no significant impact on the Common equity Tier 1 ratio or the CRD IV leverage ratio.
The actual impact could differ to our current estimate as certain industry-wide application issues have yet to be resolved.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments will change the classification and therefore the measurement of the Groups financial assets, the recognition of impairment and hedge accounting.
In addition to these changes, the effect of changes in the Groups own credit risk on the fair value of financial liabilities that the group designates at fair value through profit and loss will be included in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement.
A number of the significant proposals have yet to be finalised and it is therefore not yet possible to estimate the financial effects.
The effective date of IFRS 9 is still to be determined.
In addition, the IASB has indicated that it will issue a new standard on accounting for leases.
Under the proposals, lessees would be required to recognise assets and liabilities arising from both operating and finance leases on the balance sheet.
The IASB also plans to issue new standards on insurance contracts and revenue recognition.
The Group will consider the financial impacts of these new standards as they are finalised.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Note 1: Significant accounting policies continued Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of estimates.
It also requires management to exercise judgement in applying the accounting policies.
The key areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions are significant to the consolidated and individual financial statements are highlighted under the relevant note.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements are disclosed in: Page Page Credit impairment charges and other provisions 292 Goodwill and intangible assets 328 Tax 294 Provisions 332 Available for sale investments 303 Pensions and post-retirement benefits 351 Fair value of assets and liabilities 304 7.
Other disclosures To improve transparency and ease of reference, by concentrating related information in one place, and to reduce duplication, certain disclosures required under IFRS have been included within the Risk and Financial review sections as follows: Credit risk, on pages 142 to 189, including exposures to Eurozone countries: Market risk, on pages 190 to 198: Funding risk capital, on pages 199 to 207: Funding risk liquidity, on pages 208 to 224: and Segmental reporting on page 288.
These are covered by the Audit opinion included on pages 271 to 275. barclays.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 287 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 continued Performance The notes included in this section focus on the results and performance of the Group.
Information on the i ncome generated, expenditure incurred, segmental performance, tax, earnings per share and dividends are included here.
Note 2: Segmental reporting Presentation of segmental reporting The Groups segmental reporting is in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Executive Committee, which is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments and has been identified as the chief operating decision maker.
All transactions between business segments are conducted on an arms length basis, with intra-segment revenue and costs being eliminated in Head Office.
Income and expenses directly associated with each segment are included in determining business segment performance.
An analysis of the Groups performance by business segment and income by geographic segment is included on pages 249 and 250 Note 3: Net interest income Accounting for interest income and expense The Group applies IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Interest income on loans and advances at amortised cost, available for sale debt investments, and interest expense on financial liabilities held at amortised cost, are calculated using the effective interest method which allocates interest, and direct and incremental fees and costs, over the expected lives of the assets and liabilities.
The effective interest method requires the Group to estimate future cash flows, in some cases based on its experience of customers behaviour, considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, as well as the expected lives of the assets and liabilities.
Due to the large number of products and types both assets and liabilities, in the normal course of business there are no individual estimates that are material to the results or financial position.
See also Note 14 Financial assets designated at fair value and Note 17 Financial liabilities designated at fair value for relevant accounting policies.
Other interest income principally includes interest income relating to reverse repurchase agreements and hedging activity.
Similarly, other interest expense principally includes interest expense relating to repurchase agreements and hedging activity.
Included in net interest income is hedge ineffectiveness as detailed on page 302.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Note 3: Net interest income continued 2013 Net interest income remained stable at 11,600m 2012: 11,654m.
Interest income decreased by 5% to 18,315m driven by a reduction in income from loans and advances to customers which fell 835m to 15,613m.
The decrease in interest income from loans and advances to customers is attributable primarily to a reduction of 661m in Africa RBB, driven by the adverse impact of the depreciation of the ZAR, and a reduction of 382m in the Investment Bank due to reduced average balances.
These movements were partly offset by a 303m increase in UK RBB reflecting increased average loan balances due to organic growth and contribution from Barclays Direct.
Interest expense reduced 11% to 6,715m, driven by a reduction in interest on debt securities in issue of 745m to 2,176m due to lower average balances and lower yields.
The net interest margin for Retail and Business Banking, Corporate Banking and Wealth and Investment Management decreased by 8bps to 1.76% 2012: 1.84%, reflecting the reduction in contribution from customer liabilities and Group hedging activities, combined with a reduced contribution from the higher margins in Africa RBB as ZAR depreciated against GBP.
2012 Net interest income declined by 4% to 11,654m.
Interest income decreased by 7% to 19,212m, driven by a reduction in income from loans and advances to customers, which fell 823m to 16,448m, and interest income derived from available for sale investments, which fell 401m to 1,736m.
The decrease in interest income from loans and advances to customers is attributable primarily to the Investment Bank and Africa RBB reflecting lower average loan balances.
These movements were partly offset by a 110m increase in Barclaycard reflecting increased average loan balances due to the Egg acquisition.
The fall in interest from available for sale investments primarily reflects lower average balances and yield in the Investment Bank and lower yields on government bonds held in the Liquidity Risk Appetite portfolio.
Interest expense reduced by 10% to 7,557m, driven by a reduction in interest on debt securities in issue of 603m to 2,921m due to lower average balances and lower yields, and a reduction in interest on subordinated liabilities of 181m to 1,632m due to lower average balances.
The net interest margin for Retail and Business Banking, Barclaycard, Corporate Banking and Wealth and Investment Management decreased to 1.84% 2011: 2.03%, primarily reflecting the reduction in contribution from Group hedging activities.
Note 4: Net fee and commission income Accounting for net fee and commission income The Group applies IAS 18 Revenue.
Fees and commissions charged for services provided or received by the Group are recognised as the services are provided, for example on completion of the underlying transaction.
2013 2012 2011 m m m Fee and commission income Banking, investment management and credit related fees and commissions 10,284 9,945 9,958 Brokerage fees 27 92 87 Foreign exchange commission 168 176 163 Fee and commission income 10,479 10,213 10,208 Fee and commission expense 1,748 1,677 1,586 Net fee and commission income 8,731 8,536 8,622 2013 Net fee and commission income remained stable with a 195m increase to 8,731m.
Higher fees as a result of increased volumes within Barclaycard Business Payment and US portfolios and growth in equity underwriting activity and a strong equity capital market ECM deal calendar were offset by lower commissions mainly from syndicate and advisory business following concerns about potential slowing down of quantitative easing and the impact of adverse currency movements in Africa RBB.
2012 Net fee and commission income remained stable with an 86m decline to 8,536m.
Higher fees as a result of increased volumes within the Barclaycard Business Payment and US portfolios and growth in debt and equity underwriting activity were offset by lower commissions mainly from Italy mortgage sales and the impact of adverse currency movements in Africa RBB.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 289 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 continued Note 5: Net trading income Accounting for net trading income In accordance with IAS 39, trading positions are held at fair value and the resulting gains and losses are included in the income statement, together with interest and dividends arising from long and short positions and funding costs relating to trading activities.
Income arises from both the sale and purchase of trading positions, margins which are achieved through market-making and customer business and from changes in fair value caused by movements in interest and exchange rates, equity prices and other market variables.
Own credit gains losses arise from the fair valuation of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss.
See Note 17 Financial liabilities designated at fair value.
2013 2012 2011 m m m Trading income 6,773 7,926 4,952 Own credit losses gains 220 4,579 2,708 Net trading income 6,553 3,347 7,660 Included within net trading income were gains of 914m 2012: 656m gain: 2011: 16m loss on financial assets designated at fair value and losses of 684m 2012: 3,980m loss, 2011: 3,850m gain on financial liabilities designated at fair value.
2013 Net trading income increased 96% to 6,553m, primarily reflecting a 4,359m variance in own credit 2013: 220m charge: 2012: 4,579m charge as a result of improved credit spreads on Barclays issued debt.
This was offset partially by a 1,153m decrease in trading income, reflecting market uncertainty around central banks tapering of quantitative easing programmes across a number of product areas in FICC.
2012 Net trading income decreased 56% to 3,347m, primarily reflecting a 7,287m variance in own credit 2012: 4,579m charge: 2011: 2,708m gain as a result of improved credit spreads on Barclays issued debt.
This was offset partially by a 2,974m increase in underlying trading income, reflecting increased liquidity and higher client volumes across a number of product areas in FICC and an improved performance in cash equities and equity derivatives in Equities and Prime Services.
Note 6: Net investment income Accounting for net investment income Dividends are recognised when the right to receive the dividend has been established.
Other accounting policies relating to net investment income are set out in Note 16 Available for sale investments, and Note 14 Financial assets designated at fair value.
2013 2012 2011 m m m Net gain from disposal of available for sale investments 145 452 1,645 Dividend income 14 42 129 Net gain from financial instruments designated at fair value 203 233 287 Other investment income 318 117 244 Net investment income 680 844 2,305 2013 Net investment income decreased by 164m to 680m.
This was largely driven by lower gains on disposal of available for sale investments partially offset by increases in other investment income as a result of greater certainty regarding the recoverability of certain assets not yet received from the 2008 US Lehman acquisition.
2012 Net investment income decreased by 1,461m to 844m largely driven by the non-recurrence of gains on disposal of the economic structural hedge portfolio during 2011 and a reduction in dividends following the disposal of the Groups stake in BlackRock, Inc. during the first half of 2012.
290 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 barclays.
com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Note 7: Credit impairment charges and other provisions Accounting for the impairment of financial assets Loans and other assets held at amortised cost In accordance with IAS 39, the Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that loan assets or available for sale investments debt or equity will not be recovered in full and, wherever necessary, recognises an impairment loss in the income statement.
An impairment loss is recognised if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of events that have occurred and these have adversely impacted the estimated future cash flows from the assets.
These events include: Becoming aware of significant financial difficulty of the issuer or obligor: A breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments: The Group, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrowers financial difficulty, grants a concession that it would not otherwise consider: It becomes probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation: The disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties: and Observable data at a portfolio level indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, although the decrease cannot yet be ascribed to individual financial assets in the portfolio such as adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers in the portfolio or national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on the assets in the portfolio.
Impairment assessments are conducted individually for significant assets, which comprise all wholesale customer loans and larger retail business loans and collectively for smaller loans and for portfolio level risks, such as country or sectoral risks.
For the purposes of the assessment, loans with similar credit risk characteristics are grouped together, generally on the basis of their product type, industry, geographical location, collateral type, past due status and other factors relevant to the evaluation of expected future cash flows.
The impairment assessment includes estimating the expected future cash flows from the asset or the group of assets, which are then discounted using the original effective interest rate calculated for the asset.
If this is lower than the carrying value of the asset or the portfolio, an impairment allowance is raised.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed by adjusting the allowance account.
The amount of the reversal is recognised in the income statement.
Following impairment, interest income continues to be recognised at the original effective interest rate on the restated carrying amount, representing the unwind of the discount of the expected cash flows, including the principal due on non-accrual loans.
Uncollectable loans are written off against the related allowance for loan impairment on completion of the Groups internal processes and all recoverable amounts have been collected.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the income statement.
Available for sale investments Impairment of available for sale debt instruments Debt instruments are assessed for impairment in the same way as loans.
If impairment is deemed to have occurred, the cumulative decline in the fair value of the instrument that has previously been recognised in equity is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
This may be reversed if there is evidence that the circumstances of the issuer have improved.
Impairment of available for sale equity instruments Where there has been a prolonged or significant decline in the fair value of an equity instrument below its acquisition cost, it is deemed to be impaired.
The cumulative net loss that has been previously recognised directly in equity is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
Increases in the fair value of equity instruments after impairment are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Further declines in the fair value of equity instruments after impairment are recognised in the income statement.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 291 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 continued Note 7: Credit impairment charges and other provisions continued Critical accounting estimates and judgements The calculation of the impairment allowance involves the use of judgement, based on the Groups experience of managing credit risk.
Within the retail and small businesses portfolios, which comprise large numbers of small homogeneous assets with similar risk characteristics where credit scoring techniques are generally used, statistical techniques are used to calculate impairment allowances on a portfolio basis, based on historical recovery rates and assumed emergence periods.
These statistical analyses use as primary inputs the extent to which accounts in the portfolio are in arrears and historical information on the eventual losses encountered from such delinquent portfolios.
There are many such models in use, each tailored to a product, line of business or customer category.
Judgement and knowledge is needed in selecting the statistical methods to use when the models are developed or revised.
The impairment allowance reflected in the financial statements for these portfolios is therefore considered to be reasonable and supportable.
The impairment charge reflected in the income statement for these retail portfolios is 2,161m 2012: 2,075m: 2011: 2,477m and amounts to 71% 2012: 63%: 2011: 65% of the total impairment charge on loans and advances.
For individually significant assets, impairment allowances are calculated on an individual basis and all relevant considerations that have a bearing on the expected future cash flows are taken into account for example, the business prospects for the customer, the realisable value of collateral, the Groups position relative to other claimants, the reliability of customer information and the likely cost and duration of the work-out process.
The level of the impairment allowance is the difference between the value of the discounted expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate, and its carrying amount.
Subjective judgements are made in the calculation of future cash flows.
Furthermore, judgements change with time as new information becomes available or as work-out strategies evolve, resulting in frequent revisions to the impairment allowance as individual decisions are taken.
Changes in these estimates would result in a change in the allowances and have a direct impact on the impairment charge.
The impairment charge reflected in the financial statements in relation to wholesale portfolios is 901m 2012: 1,228m: 2011: 1,313m and amounts to 29% 2012: 37%: 2011: 35% of the total impairment charge on loans and advances.
Further information on impairment allowances and related credit information is set out within the Risk review.

This was driven by increased infrastructure costs due to the Transform programme, increased consultancy, legal and professional costs to meet new regulatory requirements such as the Dodd-Frank Act and CRD IV, an increase in the UK bank levy reflecting the increased rate and an increase in impairment in relation to premises restructuring in Europe.
Within other administration and general expenses, increases in provisions for litigation and regulatory penalties were offset by the non-recurrence of the 290m penalty incurred in 2012 arising from the industry wide investigation into the setting of inter-bank offered rates.
2012 Administration and general expenses have fallen 6% to 7,095m, primarily due to 597m goodwill impairment in 2011 not recurring in 2012 and a reduction in the underlying cost base reflecting the impact of the Group-wide cost reduction initiative.
This has been partly offset by the 290m penalty relating to the industry wide investigation into the setting of interbank offered rates and an increase in expenses relating to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
Note 9: Profit on disposal of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures There have been no material disposals during the year.
The profit on disposal of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures was 6m 2012: 28m, principally relating to accumulated foreign exchange gains previously recognised directly in equity recycled through the income statement within Head Office and Other Operations.
Notes a Total administration and general expenses of 7,817m 2012: 7,095m: 2011: 7,533m include depreciation of property, plant and equipment of 647m 2012: 669m: 2011: 673m, amortisation of intangible assets of 480m 2012: 435m: 2011: 419m, goodwill impairment of 79m 2012: nil: 2011: 597m and administration and other expenses of 6,611m 2012: 5,991m: 2011: 5,844m.
b The group has realigned outsourcing costs from administration and general expenses to staff costs in order to more appropriately reflect the nature and internal management of these costs.
The net effect of these movements is to reduce administration and general expenses and, to increase staff costs by 1,084m in 2013 and 997m in 2012. barclays.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 293 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 continued Note 10: Tax Accounting for income taxes Barclays applies IAS 12 Income Taxes in accounting for taxes on income.
Income tax payable on taxable profits Current Tax is recognised as an expense in the period in which the profits arise.
Withholding taxes are also treated as income taxes.
Income tax recoverable on tax allowable losses is recognised as a current tax asset only to the extent that it is regarded as recoverable by offset against taxable profits arising in the current or prior period.
Current tax is measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising from the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and legislation enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date which are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is both a legal right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis.

The table below shows the reconciliation between the actual tax charge and the tax charge that would result from applying the standard UK corporation tax rate to the Groups profit before tax.
2013 2012 2011 m m m Profit before tax from continuing operations 2,868 797 5,770 Tax charge based on the standard UK corporation tax rate of 23.25% 2012: 24.5%, 2011: 26.5% 667 195 1,529 Effect of non-UK profits losses at statutory tax rates different from the UK statutory tax rate 267 401 193 Non-creditable taxes 559 563 567 Non-taxable gains and income 234 642 494 Share based payments 13 63 147 Deferred tax assets not recognised previously not recognised 409 135 816 Change in tax rates 159 75 17 Non-deductible impairment charges, loss on disposals and UK bank levy 118 84 770 Other items including non-deductible expenses 315 168 120 Adjustments in respect of prior years 358 120 131 Tax charge 1,571 616 1,902 Effective tax rate 54.8% 77.3% 33.0% The tax charge of 1,571m 2012: 616m represented an effective tax rate of 54.8% 2012: 77.3% on profit before tax of 2,868m 2012: 797m.
The effective tax rate decreased mainly due to the non-recurrence of the factors that increased the rate in 2012, principally the combination of significant losses in the UK with relief at the UK statutory rate of 24.5% and profits outside the UK taxed at higher rates.
The effective tax rate is higher than the UK statutory tax rate of 23.25% 2012: 24.5% due to the items represented in the tax rate reconciliation above.
The tax charge for 2013 included a credit of 358m relating to adjustments in respect of prior years which comprises of 337m relating to the reassessment of items with uncertain tax treatment resulting from audit settlements with non-UK tax authorities and 21m relating to differences between the final tax charge in prior period tax returns for entities in the consolidated Group and the estimated tax charge included in the consolidated financial statements.
These adjustments in respect of prior years are not considered to be indicative of future trends.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities The deferred tax amounts on the balance sheet were as follows: 2013 2012 m m Barclays Group US Inc. tax group BGUS 1,449 1,160 US Branch of Barclays Bank PLC US Branch 1,362 953 UK Group relief group 1,171 532 Spanish tax group 353 611 Other 472 307 Deferred tax asset 4,807 3,563 Deferred tax liability 373 341 Net deferred tax 4,434 3,222 US deferred tax assets in BGUS and the US Branch The deferred tax asset in BGUS of 1,449m 2012: 1,160m and the US Branch of 1,362m 2012: 953m includes amounts relating to tax losses of 156m 2012: 135m and 408m 2012: 834m respectively, which first arose in 2007.
In accordance with US tax rules tax losses can be carried forward and offset against profits for a period of 20 years and therefore any unused tax losses may begin to expire in 2028.
The remaining balance primarily relates to temporary differences which are not time limited.
The US Branch deferred tax asset is stated net of a measurement for UK tax because Barclays Bank PLC is subject to UK tax on the profits of its non-UK branches.
BGUS returned to profitability in 2012, primarily driven by Barclays Capital Inc. its US broker dealer, with tax losses expected to be fully utilised by 2015.
A 20% reduction in forecasted profit would not extend the recovery period.
The assumptions used in the profit forecasts do not include any incremental tax planning strategies.
The tax losses in the US Branch are projected to be fully utilised by 2017, based on profit forecasts covering the period from 2014 to 2018.
A 20% reduction in forecasted profit would extend the recovery period by 1 year to 2018.
UK Group relief group deferred tax asset The deferred tax asset in the UK Group relief group of 1,171m 2012: 532m includes 499m 2012: 342m relating to tax losses.
Tax losses can be carried forward indefinitely in the UK.
The remaining balance relates to other temporary differences.
Based on profit forecasts, it is probable that there will be sufficient future taxable profits available against which the temporary differences and losses will be utilised.
Spain deferred tax asset A change in Spanish law in December 2013 resulted in the protection of certain deferred tax assets, mainly relating to pensions and impairments, whilst the remaining deferred tax assets that are not protected by the change in law continue to be reliant on future profits.
Based on the current assessment of business forecasts there is insufficient evidence that future profits will be available to recover unprotected deferred tax assets for accounting purposes.
As such only the protected deferred tax assets continue to be recognised resulting in a write down of 440m.
Other deferred tax assets The deferred tax asset of 472m 2012: 307m in other entities includes 157m 2012: 55m relating to tax losses carried forward.
Entities which have suffered a loss in either the current or prior year have a total deferred tax asset of 114m 2012: 135m relating to tax losses carried forward and temporary differences.
Recognition is based on profit forecasts which indicate that it is probable that the entities will have future taxable profits against which the losses and temporary differences can be utilised.
The amounts are different from those disclosed on the balance sheet as they are presented before offsetting asset and liability balances where there is a legal right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis.
The increase in the net deferred tax asset in respect of fixed asset timing differences was primarily due to an election for US tax purposes to capitalise costs associated with certain fixed assets.
Other movements include deferred tax amounts relating to acquisitions, disposals and exchange gains and losses.
The amount of deferred tax liability expected to be settled after more than 12 months is 916m 2012: 1,337m.
The amount of deferred tax asset expected to be recovered after more than 12 months is 4,943m 2012: 3,537m.
These amounts are before offsetting asset and liability balances where there is a legal right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis.
Unrecognised deferred tax Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of gross deductible temporary differences of 1,096m 2012: 28m, gross tax losses of 10,897m 2012: 7,295m which includes capital losses of 3,465m 2012: 3,358m, and unused tax credits of 245m 2012: 155m.
Tax losses of 245m 2012: 3m expire within 5 years, 93m 2012: 83m expire within 6 to 10 years, 1,043m 2012: 5m expire within 11 to 20 years and 9,516m 2012: 7,204m can be carried forward indefinitely.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profits and gains will be available against which the Group can utilise benefits.
Deferred tax is not recognised in respect of the Groups investments in subsidiaries and branches where remittance is not contemplated and for those associates and interests in joint ventures where it has been determined that no additional tax will arise.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 534m 2012: 836m.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Note 10: Tax continued Critical accounting estimates and judgements The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions and the calculation of the Groups tax charge and worldwide provisions for income taxes necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement.
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax treatment is uncertain and cannot be determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority.
The Group has a number of open tax returns with various tax authorities to whom we are in active dialogue.
Liabilities relating to these open and judgemental matters are based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due after taking into account external advice where appropriate.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.
These risks are managed in accordance with the Groups Tax Risk Framework.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised based on business profit forecasts.
Further detail on the recognition of deferred tax assets is provided on page 295 in the deferred tax assets and liabilities section of this tax note.

When calculating the diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares held in respect of Barclays PLC, totalling 360 million 2012: 389 million shares.
In addition, the profit attributable to equity holders of the parent is adjusted for the dilutive impact of the potential conversion of outstanding options held in respect of Barclays Africa Group Limited.
The decrease in the number of potential ordinary shares is primarily driven by the impact of the increase in the average share price to 2.73 2012: 2.14 on the 756 million 2012: 820 million outstanding options granted under employee share schemes, which have strike prices ranging from 1.30 to 4.59 with an average of 2.60 2012: 3.28.
Of the total number of employee share options and share awards at 31 December 2013, 16 million were anti-dilutive 2012: 145 million.
Note 12: Dividends on ordinary shares The Directors have approved a final dividend in respect of 2013 of 3.5p per ordinary share of 25p each which will be paid on 28 March 2014 to shareholders on the Share Register on 21 February 2014.
At this date ordinary shares in issue were 16,351m 2012: 12,624m.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 do not reflect this dividend, which will be accounted for in shareholders equity as an appropriation of retained profits in the year ending 31 December 2014.
The 2013 financial statements include the 2013 interim dividends of 418m 2012: 367m and final dividend declared in relation to 2012 of 441m 2011: 366m.
Notes a The basic weighted average number of shares excludes Treasury shares held in employee benefit trusts or held for trading.
The rights issue in October 2013 resulted in the issue of an additional 3,219m shares.
In accordance with IAS 33, a retrospective adjustment has been applied to the basic weighted average number of shares in issue for the prior periods which has resulted in a movement from a loss per share of 5.1p to a loss per share of 4.8p in 2012 and from an earnings per share of 24.4p to an earnings per share of 22.9p in 2011. b Potential ordinary shares shall be treated as dilutive when, and only when, their conversion to ordinary shares would increase loss per share.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 297 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 continued Assets and liabilities held at fair value The notes included in this section focus on assets and liabilities the Group holds and recognises at fair value.
F air value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an arms length transaction with a willing counterparty, which may be an observable market price or, where there is no quoted price for the instrument, may be an estimated price based on available market data.
Detail regarding the Groups approach to managing market risk can be found on pages 405 to 414.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Note 15: Derivative financial instruments Derivative instruments are contracts whose value is derived from one or more underlying financial instruments or indices defined in the contract.
They include swaps, forward rate agreements, futures, options and combinations of these instruments and primarily affect the Groups net interest income, net trading income, net fee and commission income and derivative assets and liabilities.
Notional amounts of the contracts are not recorded on the balance sheet.
The Groups objectives and policies on managing the risks that arise in connection with derivatives, including the policies for hedging, are discussed in the Risk management section on pages 402 and 403.
Trading derivatives are managed within the Groups Market risk management policies, which are outlined on pages 405 to 414.
The Groups exposure to credit risk arising from derivative contracts are outlined in the Credit risk section on pages 179 and 180 Accounting for derivatives The Group applies IAS 39.
All derivative instruments are held at fair value through profit or loss, except for derivatives held for risk management purposes in an effective hedge relationship see hedge accounting below.
This includes terms included in a contract or other financial asset or liability the host, which, had it been a standalone contract, would have had met the definition of a derivative.
These are separated from the host and accounted for in the same way as a derivative.
Hedge accounting The Group applies hedge accounting to represent, to the maximum possible extent permitted under accounting standards, the economic effects of its interest and currency risk management strategies.
Derivatives are used to hedge interest rate, exchange rate, commodity, and equity exposures and exposures to certain indices such as house price indices and retail price indices related to non-trading positions.
Where derivatives are held for risk management purposes, and when transactions meet the required criteria for documentation and hedge effectiveness, the Group applies fair value hedge accounting, cash flow hedge accounting, or hedging of a net investment in a foreign operation, as appropriate to the risks being hedged.
Fair value hedge accounting Changes in fair value of derivatives that qualify and are designated as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The fair value changes adjust the carrying value of the hedged asset or liability held at amortised cost.
If hedge relationships no longer meet the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued.
For fair value hedges of interest rate risk, the fair value adjustment to the hedged item is amortised to the income statement over the period to maturity of the previously designated hedge relationship using the effective interest method.
If the hedged item is sold or repaid, the unamortised fair value adjustment is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Cash flow hedge accounting For qualifying cash flow hedges, the fair value gain or loss associated with the effective portion of the cash flow hedge is recognised initially in other comprehensive income, and then recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss.
Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement immediately.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the hedged item is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Hedges of net investments The Groups net investments in foreign operations, including monetary items accounted for as part of the net investment, are hedged for foreign currency risks using both derivatives and foreign currency borrowings.
Hedges of net investments are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges: the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is being recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion being recognised immediately in the income statement.
The cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the income statement on the disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation, or other reductions in the Groups investment in the operation.
Types of derivatives held Foreign exchange derivatives The Groups principal exchange rate-related contracts are forward foreign exchange contracts, currency swaps and currency options.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are agreements to buy or sell a specified quantity of foreign currency, usually on a specified future date at an agreed rate.
A currency swap generally involves the exchange, or notional exchange, of equivalent amounts of two currencies and a commitment to exchange interest periodically until the principal amounts are re-exchanged on a future date.
Currency options provide the buyer with the right, but not the obligation, either to purchase or sell a fixed amount of a currency at a specified exchange rate on or before a future date.
As compensation for assuming the option risk, the option writer generally receives a premium at the start of the option period.
Currency derivatives are primarily designated as hedges of the foreign currency risk of net investments in foreign operations.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 299 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 continued Note 15: Derivative financial instruments continued Interest rate derivatives The Groups principal interest rate related contracts are interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements, basis swaps, caps, floors and swaptions.
Included in this product category are transactions that include combinations of these features.
An interest rate swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange fixed rate and floating rate interest by means of periodic payments based upon a notional principal amount and the interest rates defined in the contract.
Certain agreements combine interest rate and foreign currency swap transactions, which may or may not include the exchange of principal amounts.
A basis swap is a form of interest rate swap, in which both parties exchange interest payments based on floating rates, where the floating rates are based upon different underlying reference indices.
In a forward rate agreement, two parties agree a future settlement of the difference between an agreed rate and a future interest rate, applied to a notional principal amount.
The settlement, which generally occurs at the start of the contract period, is the discounted present value of the payment that would otherwise be made at the end of that period.
Interest rate derivatives, designated as cash flow hedges, primarily hedge the exposure to cash flow variability from interest rates of variable rate loans to banks and customers, variable rate debt securities held and highly probable forecast financing transactions and reinvestments.
Interest rate derivatives designated as fair value hedges primarily hedge the interest rate risk of fixed rate borrowings in issue, fixed rate loans to banks and customers and investments in fixed rate debt securities held.
Credit derivatives The Groups principal credit derivative-related contracts include credit default swaps and total return swaps.
A credit derivative is an arrangement whereby the credit risk of an asset the reference asset is transferred to the seller of protection.
A credit default swap is a contract where the protection seller receives premium or interest-related payments in return for contracting to make payments to the protection buyer upon a defined credit event.
Credit events normally include bankruptcy, payment default on a reference asset or assets, or downgrades by a rating agency.
A total return swap is an instrument whereby the seller of protection receives the full return of the asset, including both the income and change in the capital value of the asset.
The buyer of the protection in return receives a predetermined amount.
Equity derivatives The Groups principal equity-related contracts are equity and stock index swaps and options including warrants, which are equity options listed on an exchange.
An equity swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange periodic payments, based upon a notional principal amount, with one side paying fixed or floating interest and the other side paying based on the actual return of the stock or stock index.
An equity option provides the buyer with the right, but not the obligation, either to purchase or sell a specified stock, basket of stocks or stock index at a specified price or level on or before a specified date.
The Group also enters into fund-linked derivatives, being swaps and options whose underlyings include mutual funds, hedge funds, indices and multi-asset portfolios.
Commodity derivatives The Groups principal commodity-related derivative contracts are swaps, options, forwards and futures.
The main commodities transacted are base metals, precious metals, oil and oil-related products, power and natural gas.
The Groups total derivative asset and liability position as reported on the balance sheet is as follows: Total derivatives 2013 2012 Fair value Fair value Notional Notional contract contract amount Asset Liabilities amount Assets Liabilities m m m m m m Total derivative assets liabilities held for trading 41,494,363 321,590 319,361 40,193,114 465,357 459,587 Total derivative assets liabilities held for risk management 303,645 2,745 1,273 302,822 3,799 3,134 Derivative assets liabilities 41,798,008 324,335 320,634 40,495,936 469,156 462,721 The fair value of gross derivative assets decreased by 31% to 324bn reflecting increases in the major interest rate forward curves and the impact of optimisation initiatives to reduce gross derivative exposures.

The Group uses this classification for assets that are not derivatives and are not held for trading purposes or otherwise designated at fair value through profit or loss, or at amortised cost.
Dividends and interest calculated using the effective interest method are recognised in the income statement in net interest income Note 3 or, net investment income Note 6.
On disposal, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is also included in net investment income.

Approximately $2.7bn 1.6bn of this amount was recognised as part of the acquisition accounting and is included as an available for sale investment on the balance sheet.
As discussed in Note 30, Barclays entitlement to these assets is the subject of legal proceedings between the SIPA Trustee for Lehman Brothers Inc. and Barclays.
As such, there continues to be significant judgement involved in the valuation of this asset and uncertainty relating to the outcome of ongoing appeals.
The Group takes the view that the effective provision of $1.6bn 1.0bn that is reflected in its estimate of fair value is appropriate.
The valuation of this asset will be kept under review as legal proceedings progress.
Note 17: Financial liabilities designated at fair value Accounting for liabilities designated at fair value through profit and loss In accordance with IAS 39, financial liabilities may be designated at fair value, with gains and losses taken to the income statement within net trading income Note 5 and net investment income Note 6.
The Group has the ability to do this when holding the instruments at fair value reduces an accounting mismatch caused by an offsetting liability or asset being held at fair value, is managed by the Group on the basis of its fair value, or includes terms that have substantive derivative characteristics Note 15.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 303 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 continued Note 18: Fair value of assets and liabilities Accounting for financial assets and liabilities fair values The Group applies IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
All financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date of recognition and, depending on the classification of the asset, may continue to be held at fair value either through profit or loss or other comprehensive income.
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Wherever possible, fair value is determined by reference to a quoted market price for that instrument.
For many of the Groups financial assets and liabilities, especially derivatives, quoted prices are not available, and valuation models are used to estimate fair value.
The models calculate the expected cash flows under the terms of each specific contract and then discount these values back to a present value.
These models use as their basis independently sourced market parameters including, for example, interest rate yield curves, equities and commodities prices, option volatilities and currency rates.
For financial liabilities held at fair value, the carrying amount reflects the effect on fair value of changes in own credit spreads derived from observable market data, such as spreads on Barclays issued bonds or credit default swaps.
Most market parameters are either directly observable or are implied from instrument prices.
The model may perform numerical procedures in the pricing such as interpolation when input values do not directly correspond to the most actively traded market trade parameters.
On initial recognition, it is presumed that the transaction price is the fair value unless there is observable information available in an active market to the contrary.
The best evidence of an instruments fair value on initial recognition is typically the transaction price.
However, if fair value can be evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument, or is based on a valuation technique whose inputs include only data from observable markets then the instrument should be recognised at the fair value derived from such observable market data.
For valuations that have made use of unobservable inputs, the difference between the model valuation and the initial transaction price Day One profit is recognised in profit or loss either: on a straight-line basis over the term of the transaction: or over the period until all model inputs will become observable where appropriate: or released in full when previously unobservable inputs become observable.
Various factors influence the availability of observable inputs and these may vary from product to product and change over time.
Factors include the depth of activity in the relevant market, the type of product, whether the product is new and not widely traded in the marketplace, the maturity of market modelling and the nature of the transaction bespoke or generic.
To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are not observable in the market, the determination of fair value can be more subjective, dependant on the significance of the unobservable input to the overall valuation.
Unobservable inputs are determined based on the best information available, for example by reference to similar assets, similar maturities or other analytical techniques.
The sensitivity of valuations used in the financial statements to reasonably possible changes in significant unobservable inputs is shown on page 315.
Valuation IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement requires an entity to classify its assets and liabilities according to a hierarchy that reflects the observability of significant market inputs.
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined below.
Quoted market prices Level 1 Assets and liabilities are classified as Level 1 if their value is observable in an active market.
Such instruments are valued by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring market transactions.
An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
Valuation technique using observable inputs Level 2 Assets and liabilities classified as Level 2 have been valued using models whose inputs are observable in an active market.
Valuations based on observable inputs include assets and liabilities such as swaps and forwards which are valued using market standard pricing techniques, and options that are commonly traded in markets where all the inputs to the market standard pricing models are observable.
Valuation technique using significant unobservable inputs Level 3 Assets and liabilities are classified as Level 3 if their valuation incorporates significant inputs that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
A valuation input is considered observable if it can be directly observed from transactions in an active market, or if there is compelling external evidence demonstrating an executable exit price.
Unobservable input levels are generally determined via reference to observable inputs, historical observations or using other analytical techniques.

Included in financial assets designated at fair value is the Education, Social Housing and Local Authority ESHLA loan portfolio of 15.6bn 2012: 17.6bn.
This was transferred from Level 2 to Level 3 following reassessment of the significance of unobservable loan spreads on valuation.
The valuation of the ESHLA portfolio continues to be based on internally modelled spreads.
Valuation uncertainty arises mainly from the long dated nature of the portfolio, the lack of active secondary market in the loans and the lack of observable loan spreads.

When there is a new issuance of those G7 government bonds, any previous issuances held on the balance sheet as Level 1 will be transferred into Level 2 to reflect a decrease in trading activity.
As a result of new issuances during the year, 19.6m of government and government-sponsored debt were transferred from Level 1 into Level 2.
Remaining transfers from level 1 to level 2 relate to the transfer of 14.1m of corporate debt as a result of a reassessment of available pricing information causing the classification to be reconsidered as level 2.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Note 18: Fair value of assets and liabilities continued Assets and liabilities move between Level 2 and Level 3 primarily due to i an increase or decrease in observable market activity related to an input or ii a change in the significance of the unobservable input, with assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 if an unobservable input is deemed significant.
During 2013, transfers into Level 3 totalled 15.1bn primarily due to the remainder of the ESHLA loan portfolio amounting to 15.3bn, which was transferred from Level 2 to Level 3 following reassessment of the significance of unobservable loan spreads on valuation.
Liabilities of 205m were also transferred from Level 2 to Level 3 mainly representing issued debt classified as financial liabilities designated at fair value.
A further 146 m of commodity derivatives were also transferred into level 3 in line with observable market activity.
Transfers out of Level 3 totalled 606m.
This was primarily due to 141m of government and government sponsored debt held as trading portfolio assets and 119m of asset backed loans held as financial assets designated at fair value through profit and loss.
Liabilities transferred out included 153m of issued debt and 47m of certificates of deposit, commercial paper and other money market instruments both designated as held at fair value through profit and loss.
There were also transfers of 406 m in interest rate derivatives offset by 206m in credit derivatives as a result of more observable valuation inputs.

Trading income on net derivative financial instruments increased by 1,336m over the year mainly driven by more favourable returns on derivatives.
Credit and monoline derivatives within the Structured Capital Portfolio Markets business resulted in an increase in trading income of 461m compared to prior year.
Additionally, within rates trading, interest rate derivates drove a 247m increase in trading income: whilst equity derivatives also had a positive variance of 235m over prior year.
Valuation techniques and sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis is performed on products with significant unobservable inputs Level 3 to generate a range of reasonably possible alternative valuations.
The sensitivity methodologies applied take account of the nature of valuation techniques used, as well as the availability and reliability of observable proxy and historical data and the impact of using alternative models.
Sensitivities are dynamically calculated on a monthly basis.
The calculation is based on range or spread data of a reliable reference source or a scenario based on relevant market analysis alongside the impact of using alternative models.
Sensitivities are calculated without reflecting the impact of any diversification in the portfolio.
The valuation techniques used for the main products that are not determined by reference to unadjusted quoted prices Level 1, observability and sensitivity analysis for Level 3 are described below.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 309 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 continued Note 18: Fair value of assets and liabilities continued Interest rate derivatives Description: These are derivatives linked to interest rates or inflation indices.
This category includes futures, interest rate and inflation swaps, swaptions, caps, floors, inflation options, balance guaranteed swaps and other exotic interest rate derivatives.
Valuation: Interest rate derivative cash flows are valued using interest rate yield curves whereby observable market data is used to construct the term structure of forward rates.
This is then used to project and discount future cash flows based on the parameters of the trade.
Assets and liabilities with optionality are valued using volatilities implied from market observable inputs.
Exotic interest rate derivatives are valued using industry standard and bespoke models based on observable and unobservable market parameter inputs.
Input parameters include interest rates, volatilities, correlations and others as appropriate.
Where unobservable, a parameter will be set with reference to an observable proxy.
Inflation forward curves and interest rate yield curves are extrapolated beyond observable tenors.
Balance guaranteed swaps are valued using cash flow models that calculate fair value based on loss projections, prepayment, recovery and discount rates.
These parameters are determined by reference to underlying asset performance, independent research, ABX indices, broker quotes, observable trades on similar securities and third party pricing sources.
Prepayment is projected based on observing historic prepayment rates.
Observability: In general, input parameters are deemed observable up to liquid maturities which are determined separately for each parameter and underlying.
Certain correlation, convexity, long dated forwards and volatilities exposures are unobservable beyond liquid maturities.
Unobservable model inputs are set by referencing liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques to match the appropriate risk profile.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity relating to unobservable valuation inputs is based on the dispersion of consensus data services where available, otherwise stress scenarios or historic data are used.
Foreign exchange derivatives Description: These are derivatives linked to the foreign exchange FX market.
This category includes FX forward contracts, FX swaps and FX options.
The vast majority are traded as OTC derivatives.
Valuation: Derivatives are valued using industry standard and bespoke models.
Input parameters include FX rates, interest rates, FX volatilities, interest rate volatilities, FX interest rate correlations and others as appropriate.
Observability: Certain correlations, long dated forwards and volatilities are unobservable beyond liquid maturities.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity relating to unobservable valuation inputs is primarily based on the dispersion of consensus data services.
Credit derivatives Description: These are derivatives linked to the credit spread of a referenced entity, index or basket of referenced entities or a pool of referenced assets via securitisation.
This category includes single name and index Credit Default Swaps CDS, asset backed CDS, synthetic Collateralised Debt Obligations CDOs, and Nth-to-default basket swaps.
Valuation: CDS are valued using a market standard model that incorporates the credit curve as its principal input.
Credit spreads are observed directly from broker data, third party vendors or priced to proxies.
Where credit spreads are unobservable, they are determined with reference to recent transactions or proxied from bond spreads on observable trades of the same issuer or other similar entities.
Synthetic CDOs are valued using a model that calculates fair value based on credit spreads, recovery rates, correlations and interest rates and is calibrated to the index tranche market.
Observability: CDS contracts referencing entities that are not actively traded are considered unobservable.
The correlation input to synthetic CDO valuation is considered unobservable as it is proxied from the observable index tranche market.
Where an asset-backed credit derivative does not have an observable market price and the valuation is determined using a model, an instrument is considered unobservable.
Level 3 sensitivity: The sensitivity of valuations of the illiquid CDS portfolio is determined by applying a shift to each spread curve.
The shift is based on the average range of pricing observed in the market for similar CDS.
Synthetic CDO sensitivity is calculated using correlation levels derived from the range of contributors to a consensus bespoke service.
Commodity derivatives Description: These products are exchange traded and OTC derivatives based on underlying commodities such as metals, crude oil and refined products, agricultural products, power and natural gas.
Valuation: The valuations of commodity swaps and options are determined using models incorporating discounting of cash flows and other industry standard modelling techniques.
Valuation inputs include forward curves, volatilities implied from market observable inputs and correlations.
Unobservable inputs are set with reference to similar observable products or by applying extrapolation techniques from the observable market.
Observability: Certain correlations, forward curves and volatilities for longer dated exposures are unobservable.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity is determined primarily by measuring historical variability over two years.
Where historical data is unavailable or uncertainty is due to volumetric risk, sensitivity is measured by applying appropriate stress scenarios or using proxy bid-offer spread levels.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Note 18: Fair value of assets and liabilities continued Equity derivatives Description: These are derivatives linked to equity indices and single names.
This category includes exchange traded and OTC equity derivatives including vanilla and exotic options.
Valuation: The valuations of OTC equity derivatives are determined using industry standard models.
Input parameters include stock prices, dividends, volatilities, interest rates, equity repo curves and, for multi-asset products, correlations.
Unobservable model inputs are determined by reference to liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques to match the appropriate risk profile.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity is estimated based on the dispersion of consensus data services either directly or through proxies.
Derivative exposure to monoline insurers Description: These products are derivatives through which credit protection has been purchased on structured debt instruments primarily CLOs from monoline insurers.
Valuation: Given the bespoke nature of the CDS, the primary valuation input is the price of the cash instrument it protects.
Observability: Whilst the market value of the cash instrument underlying the CDS contract may be observable, its use in the valuation of CDS is considered unobservable due to the bespoke nature of the monoline CDS contracts.
Level 3 sensitivity: Due to the high degree of uncertainty, the sensitivity reflects the impact of writing down the credit protection element of fair value to zero.
Government and Government sponsored debt Description: These are government bonds, supra sovereign bonds and agency bonds.
Valuation: Liquid government bonds actively traded through an exchange or clearing house are marked to the closing levels observed in these markets.
Less liquid bonds are valued using observable market prices which are sourced from broker quotes, inter-dealer prices or other reliable pricing services.
Where there are no observable market prices, fair value is determined by reference to either issuances or CDS spreads of the same issuer as proxy inputs to obtain discounted cash flow amounts.
Observability: Where an observable market price is not available, the bond is considered Level 3.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity is calculated by using the range of observable proxy prices.
Corporate debt Description: This primarily contains corporate bonds.
Valuation: Corporate bonds are valued using observable market prices which are sourced from broker quotes, inter-dealer prices or other reliable pricing services.
In the absence of observable bond or CDS spreads for the respective issuer, similar reference assets or sector averages are applied as a proxy the appropriateness of proxies being assessed based on issuer, coupon, maturity and industry.
Observability: Where an observable market price is not available, the security is considered Level 3.
Level 3 sensitivity: The sensitivity for the corporate bonds portfolio is determined by applying a shift to each underlying position driven by average ranges of external levels observed in the market for similar bonds.
Certificates of Deposit, Commercial Paper and other money market instruments Description: These are certificates of deposit, commercial paper and other money market instruments.
Valuation: Certificates of deposit and commercial paper are valued using observable market prices which are sourced from broker quotes, inter-dealer prices or other reliable pricing services.
Observability: Where an observable market price is not available, the instrument is considered Level 3.
Repurchase agreements Description: This product type is primarily made up of repurchase agreements that are held at fair value.
Valuation: Repurchase agreements are generally valued using industry standard modelling techniques including discounting of cash flows.
The key valuation inputs are forward curves.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 311 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 continued Note 18: Fair value of assets and liabilities continued Observability: Repurchase agreement pricing is generally observable.
Level 3 sensitivity: There is no Level 3 sensitivity associated with repurchase agreements as inputs to valuation are observable.
Non asset backed loans Description: This category is largely made up of fixed rate loans, such as the ESHLA portfolio, which are valued using models that discount expected future cash flows.
Valuation: Fixed rate loans are valued using models that calculate fair value based on observable interest rates and unobservable loan spreads.
Unobservable loan spreads are modelled according to issuer credit quality.
Observability: Within this population, the unobservable input is the loan spread.
Level 3 sensitivity: The sensitivity for fixed rate loans is calculated by applying a shift to loan spreads.
Asset backed securities Description: These are securities that are linked to the cash flows of a pool of referenced assets via securitisation.
This category includes residential mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities, CDOs and CLOs.
Valuation: Where available, valuations are based on observable market prices which are sourced from broker quotes and inter-dealer prices.
Otherwise, valuations are determined using industry standard discounted cash flow analysis that calculates the fair value based on valuation inputs such as constant default rate, conditional prepayment rate, loss given default and yield.
These inputs are determined by reference to a number of sources including proxying to observed transactions, market indices or market research, and by assessing underlying collateral performance.
Proxying to observed transactions, indices or research requires an assessment and comparison of the relevant securities underlying attributes including collateral, tranche, vintage, underlying asset composition historical losses, borrower characteristics, and loan attributes such as loan-to-value ratio and geographic concentration and credit ratings original and current.
Observability: Where an asset backed product does not have an observable market price and the valuation is determined using a model, an instrument is considered unobservable.
Level 3 sensitivity: The sensitivity analysis for asset backed products is based on externally sourced pricing dispersion, defined at the position level.
Asset backed loans Description: These are loans made to individual borrowers or originators in return for the expectation of repayment of both principal and interest in the future.
This category includes loans backed by residential whole loans and residential real estate property.
Valuation: Valuations are determined using industry standard discounted cash flow analysis that calculates the fair value based on inputs such constant default rate, conditional prepayment rate, loss given default and yield.
Valuations inputs are determined by reference to a number of sources including proxying to observed transactions, market indices or market research, and by assessing underlying collateral performance.
Observability: Where an asset backed loan does not have an observable market price and the valuation is determined using a model, an instrument is considered unobservable.
Level 3 sensitivity: The sensitivity analysis for asset backed loans is based on stressing the inputs to the discounted cash flow analysis.
Commercial Real Estate loans Description: This portfolio includes loans that are secured by a range of commercial property types including retail, hotel, office, multi-family and industrial properties.
Valuation: Performing loans are valued using discounted cash flow analysis which considers the characteristics of the loan such as property type, geographic location, credit quality and property performance reviews in order to determine an appropriate credit spread.
Where there is significant uncertainty regarding loan performance, valuation is based on independent third party appraisals or bids for the underlying properties.
Independent third party appraisals are determined by discounted cash flow analysis.
The key valuation inputs are yield and loss given default.
Observability: Since each commercial real estate loan is unique in nature and the secondary market for them is relatively illiquid, valuation inputs are generally considered unobservable.
Level 3 sensitivity: For performing loans, sensitivity is determined by stressing the credit spread for each loan.
For loans which have significant uncertainty regarding loan performance, sensitivity is determined by either a range of bids or by stressing the inputs to independent third party appraisals.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Note 18: Fair value of assets and liabilities continued Issued debt Description: This category contains Barclays issued notes.
Valuation: Fair valued Barclays issued notes are valued using discounted cash flow techniques and industry standard models incorporating various observable input parameters depending on the terms of the instrument.
Observability: Barclays issued notes are generally observable.
Structured notes are debt instruments containing embedded derivatives.
Where either an input to the embedded derivative or the debt instrument is deemed unobservable and significant to the overall valuation of the note, the structured note is classified as Level 3.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity to the unobservable input in the embedded derivative is calculated in line with the method used for the derivative instrument concerned and incorporated within the derivative lines.
Equity cash products Description: This category includes listed equities, Exchange Traded Funds ETF and preference shares.
Valuation: Valuation of equity cash products is primarily determined through market observable prices.
Observability: Prices are generally observed in the market.
Where a price for an equity security is not available, the instrument is considered unobservable.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity relating to unobservable market prices is based on the dispersion of observable proxy prices.
Funds and fund linked products Description: This category includes holdings in hedge funds, and funds of funds.
Valuation: In general, fund holdings are valued based on the latest available valuation received from the fund administrator.
In the case of illiquid fund holdings the valuation will take account of all available information in relation to the underlying fund or collection of funds and may be adjusted relative to the performance of relevant index benchmarks.
Observability: Funds are deemed unobservable where the fund is either suspended, in wind-down, has a redemption restriction that severely affects liquidity, or where the latest net asset value from the fund administrators is older than the frequency dictated by the fund offering documents.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity is calculated on an individual fund basis using a loss based scenario approach which factors in the underlying assets of the specific fund and assumed recovery rates.
Private equity investments Description: This category includes private equity investments.
Valuation: Private equity investments are valued in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines.
This requires the use of a number of individual pricing benchmarks such as the prices of recent transactions in the same or similar entities, discounted cash flow analysis, and comparison with the earnings multiples of listed comparative companies.
Full valuations are generally performed at least bi-annually, with the positions reviewed periodically for material events that might impact upon fair value.
The valuation of unquoted equity instruments is subjective by nature.
However, the relevant methodologies are commonly applied by other market participants and have been consistently applied over time.
Observability: Unobservable inputs include earnings estimates, multiples of comparative companies, marketability discounts and discount rates.
Level 3 sensitivity: The relevant valuation models are each sensitive to a number of key assumptions, such as projected future earnings, comparator multiples, marketability discounts and discount rates.
Valuation sensitivity is estimated by flexing such assumptions to reasonable alternative levels and determining the impact on the resulting valuation.
Physical commodities Description: This category includes physical commodities such as metals and crude oil.
Valuation: The fair values of physical commodities are primarily determined through market observable prices.
Observability: Physical commodities are generally observable.
Level 3 sensitivity: There is no Level 3 sensitivity associated with physical commodities as inputs to valuation are observable.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 313 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 continued Note 18: Fair value of assets and liabilities continued Investment Property Description: Investment property consists of commercial real estate property including most of the major property types retail, office, industrial and multi-family properties.
Valuation: Investment property is valued using competitive asset specific market bids.
When bids are unavailable, valuations are determined by independent third party appraiser through a discounted cash flow analysis.
The key inputs to the discounted cash flow valuation are capitalisation rates, yields, growth rate, and loss given default.
Observability: Since each investment property is unique in nature and the commercial real estate market is illiquid, valuation inputs are largely unobservable.
Level 3 sensitivity: For investment property, sensitivity is determined by a range of asset specific market bids or by stressing the inputs to the discounted cash flow analysis.
Other Description: The receivables resulting from the acquisition of the North American businesses of Lehman Brothers is also included within Other.
For more details, refer to Note 30 Legal, competition and regulatory matters.
Level 3 sensitivity: No stress has been applied to the receivables relating to the Lehman acquisition Note 16.
The sensitivity inherent in the measurement of the receivables is akin to a litigation provision.
Due to this, an upside and downside stress on a basis comparable with the other assets cannot be applied.
Complex Derivative Instruments Valuation estimates made by counterparties with respect to complex derivative instruments, for the purpose of determining the amount of collateral to be posted, often differ, sometimes significantly, from Barclays own estimates.
In almost all cases, Barclays has been able to successfully resolve such differences or otherwise reach an accommodation with respect to collateral posting levels, including in certain cases by entering into compromise collateral arrangements.
Due to the ongoing nature of collateral calls, Barclays will often be engaged in discussion with one or more counterparties in respect of such differences at any given time.
Valuation estimates made by counterparties for collateral purposes are, like any other third-party valuation, considered when determining Barclays fair value estimates.

The ESHLA transfer contributed 1.0bn to the decrease with substantially all the potential effect impacting profit and loss rather than other comprehensive income.
The effect of stressing unobservable inputs has become less symmetric for 2013 following reassessment of the significance of unobservable loan spreads on the valuation of the ESHLA portfolio included in non asset backed loans.
The stress related to this portfolio is considered to be asymmetric as it is felt that alternative choices of loan spreads could lead to a lower valuation.
Note a The sensitivity analysis for 2012 has been revised to reflect the inclusion of investment property.

A weighted average has not been provided for derivatives as weighting by fair value would not give a comparable metric.
b The units used to disclose ranges for significant unobservable inputs are percentages, points and basis points.
Points are a percentage of par: for example, 100 points equals 100% of par.
A basis point equals 1 100th of 1%: for example, 150 basis points equals 1.5%.
c Certain derivative instruments are classified as L3 due to a significant unobservable credit spread input into the calculation of the Credit Valuation Adjustment CVA for the instruments.
The range of unobservable credit spreads is between 29-1,065bps.
d A range has not been provided for Net Asset Value as there would be a wide range reflecting the diverse nature of the positions.

316 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 barclays.
com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Note 18: Fair value of assets and liabilities continued The following section describes the significant unobservable inputs identified in the table above, and the sensitivity of fair value measurement of the instruments categorised as Level 3 assets or liabilities to increases in significant unobservable inputs.
Where sensitivities are described the inverse relationship will also generally apply.
Where reliable interrelationships can be identified between significant unobservable inputs used in fair value measurement a description of those interrelationships is included below.
Comparable Price Comparable instrument prices are used in valuation by calculating an implied yield or spread over a liquid benchmark from the price of a comparable observable bond, then adjusting that yield or spread to derive a value for the unobservable bond.
The adjustment to yield or spread should account for relevant differences in the bonds such as maturity or credit quality.
Alternatively, a price-to-price basis can be assumed between the comparable instrument and bond being valued in order to establish the value of the bond.
In general a significant increase in comparable price in isolation will result in a movement in fair value that is favourable for the holder of a cash instrument.
For a derivative instrument, a significant increase in an input derived from a comparable price in isolation can result in a movement in fair value that is favourable or unfavourable depending on the specific terms of the instrument.
Conditional Prepayment Rate Conditional prepayment rate is the proportion of voluntary, unscheduled repayments of loan principal by a borrower.
Prepayment rates affect the weighted average life of securities by altering the timing of future projected cashflows.
A significant increase in a conditional prepayment rate in isolation can result in a movement in fair value that is favourable or unfavourable depending on the specific terms of the instrument.
Conditional prepayment rates are typically inversely correlated to credit spread.
i. e. Securities with high borrower credit spread typically experience lower prepayment rates, and also tend to experience higher default rates.
Constant Default Rate The Constant Default Rate represents an annualised rate of default of the loan principal by the borrower.
A significant increase in a constant default rate in isolation can result in a movement in fair value that is favourable or unfavourable depending on the specific terms of the instrument.
Constant Default Rate and Conditional Prepayment Rates are typically inversely correlated, less defaults on loans typically will mean higher credit quality and therefore more prepayments.
Correlation Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables i. e. how the change in one variable influences a change in the other variable.
Correlation is a key input into valuation of derivative contracts with more than one underlying instrument.
For example, where an option contract is written on a basket of underlying names the volatility of the basket, and hence the fair value of the option, will depend on the correlation between the basket components.
Credit correlation generally refers to the correlation between default processes for the separate names that make up the reference pool of a collateralised debt obligation structure.
A significant increase in correlation in isolation can result in a movement in fair value that is favourable or unfavourable depending on the specific terms of the instrument.
Credit Spread Loan Spread Credit spreads typically represent the difference in yield between an instrument and a benchmark security or reference rate.
Credit spreads reflect the additional yield that a market participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument.
The credit spread for an instrument forms part of the yield used in a discounted cashflow calculation.
In general a significant increase in credit spread or Loan Spread in isolation will result in a movement in fair value that is unfavourable for the holder of a cash asset.
For a derivative instrument, a significant increase in credit spread in isolation can result in a movement in fair value that is favourable or unfavourable depending on the specific terms of the instrument.
Forwards A price or rate that is applicable to a financial transaction that will take place in the future.
A forward is generally based on the spot price or rate, adjusted for the cost of carry, and defines the price or rate that will be used to deliver a currency, bond, commodity or some other underlying instrument at a point in the future.
A forward may also refer to the rate fixed for a future financial obligation, such as the interest rate on a loan payment.
In general a significant increase in a forward in isolation will result in a movement in fair value that is favourable for the contracted receiver of the underlying currency, bond, commodity etc.
but the sensitivity is dependent on the specific terms of the instrument.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 317 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 continued Note 18: Fair value of assets and liabilities continued Loss Given Default LGD Loss Given Default represents the expected loss upon liquidation of the collateral as a percentage of the balance outstanding.
In general a significant increase in the LGD in isolation will translate to lower recovery and lower projected cashflows to pay to the securitisation, resulting in a movement in fair value that is unfavourable for the holder of the securitised product.
Net Asset Value Net asset value represents the total value of a funds assets and liabilities.
In general a significant increase in net asset value in isolation will result in a movement in fair value that is favourable for a fund.
Volatility Volatility is a key input in the valuation of derivative products containing optionality.
Volatility is a measure of the variability or uncertainty in returns for a given derivative underlying.
It represents an estimate of how much a particular underlying instrument, parameter or index will change in value over time.
In general, volatilities will be implied from observed option prices.
For unobservable options the implied volatility may reflect additional assumptions about the nature of the underlying risk, as well as reflecting the given strike maturity profile of a specific option contract.
In general a significant increase in volatility in isolation will result in a movement in fair value that is favourable for the holder of a simple option, but the sensitivity is dependent on the specific terms of the instrument.
There may be interrelationships between unobservable volatilities and other unobservable inputs that can be implied from observation e. g. when equity prices fall, implied equity volatilities generally rise but these are specific to individual markets and may vary over time.
Yield The rate used to discount projected cashflows in a discounted future cashflow analysis.
In general a significant increase in yield in isolation will result in a movement in fair value that is unfavourable for the holder of a cash instrument.
Fair value adjustments Key balance sheet valuation adjustments that may be of interest from a financial statement user perspective are quantified below: 2013 2012 m m Bid-offer valuation adjustments 406 452 Other exit adjustments 208 294 Uncollateralised derivative funding 67 101 Derivative credit valuation adjustments: Monolines 62 235 Other derivative credit valuation adjustments 322 693 Derivative debit valuation adjustments 310 442 Bid-offer valuation adjustments The Group uses mid-market pricing where it is a market-maker and has the ability to transact at, or better than, mid price which is the case for certain equity, bond and vanilla derivative markets.
For other financial assets and liabilities, bid-offer adjustments are recorded to reflect the price for the expected close out strategy.
The methodology for determining the bid-offer adjustment for a derivative portfolio involves calculating the net risk exposure by offsetting long and short positions by strike and term in accordance with the risk management and hedging strategy.
Bid-offer levels are derived from market sources, such as broker data.
The bid offer adjustments have reduced by 46m to 406m during 2013 as a result of movements in market bid offer spreads.
Other exit adjustments Market data input for exotic derivatives may not have a directly observable bid offer spread.
In such instances, an exit adjustment is applied as a proxy for the bid-offer adjustment.
An example of this is correlation risk where an adjustment is required to reflect the possible range of values that market participants apply.
The uncertainty adjustment may be determined by calibrating to derivative prices, or by scenario analysis or historical analysis.
The other exit adjustments have reduced by 86m to 208m respectively as a result of movements in market bid offer spreads.
Discounting approaches for derivative instruments Collateralised In line with market practice, the methodology for discounting collateralised derivatives takes into account the nature and currency of the collateral that can be posted within the relevant Credit Support Annex CSA.
The CSA-aware discounting approach recognises the cheapest to deliver option that reflects the ability of the party posting collateral to change the currency of the collateral.
Uncollateralised A fair value adjustment of 67m is applied to account for the impact of incorporating the cost of funding into the valuation of uncollateralised derivatives accounted for at fair value across all asset classes and businesses within Barclays Corporate Banking and Investment Bank.
This is called the funding fair value adjustment FFVA.
318 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 barclays.
com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Note 18: Fair value of assets and liabilities continued FFVA is calculated as the valuation impact of changing from LIBOR-based discounting to using a discount rate that reflects the market cost of funding.
Barclays internal Treasury lending rates are used as an estimate of this rate, although Barclays continues to assess viable alternatives and evolving market practice.
Expected trade cash flows are consolidated at portfolio and currency level.
The FFVA impact is applied symmetrically per currency to positive and negative cash flows.
The discounting period applied takes into account the probability of default of each counterparty, as well as any mandatory break clauses.
Cash flows from partially funded trades where this could be due to a contractual or non contractual collateral gap are taken into account.
The FFVA incorporates a scaling factor which is an estimate of the extent to which the cost of funding is incorporated into observed traded levels.
On calibrating the scaling factor, it is with the assumption that Credit Valuation Adjustments CVAs and Debit Valuation Adjustments DVAs are retained as valuation components incorporated into such levels.
The effect of this scaling factor at 31 December 2013 was 200m 2012:303m.
Uncollateralised interest rate derivatives traded by the Fixed Income Rates desk are used to determine this scaling factor, as the impact from this portfolio contributes the majority of the FFVA, where the trading history analysed includes new trades, terminations and novations.
The FFVA balance and movement is driven by the Barclays own cost of funding spread over LIBOR, counterparty default probabilities and recovery rates, as well as the market value of those derivatives in scope.
Movements in the market value of the portfolio in scope for FFVA are driven by interest rates.
Barclays continues to monitor market practices and activity to ensure the approach to discounting in derivative valuation remains appropriate.
The above approach has been in use since 2012 with no significant changes.
Uncollateralised derivative funding adjustments have reduced by 34m to 67m as a result of reductions in Barclays funding costs and a reduction in exposure.
Derivative credit and debit valuation adjustments Credit valuation adjustments CVAs and debit valuation adjustments DVAs are incorporated into derivative valuations to reflect the impact on fair value of counterparty credit risk and Barclays own credit quality respectively.
These adjustments are modelled for OTC derivatives across all asset classes.
Calculations are derived from estimates of exposure at default, probability of default and recovery rates, on a counterparty basis.
Counterparties include but are not limited to corporates, monolines, sovereigns and sovereign agencies, supranationals, and special-purpose vehicles.
Exposure at default for CVA and DVA is generally based on expected exposure, estimated through the simulation of underlying risk factors.
For some complex products, where this approach is not feasible, simplifying assumptions are made, either through proxying with a more vanilla structure, or using current or scenario-based mark-to-market as an estimate of future exposure.
Where strong collateralisation agreement exists as a mitigant to counterparty risk, the exposure is set to zero.
Probability of default and recovery rate information is generally sourced from the CDS markets.
For counterparties where this information is not available, or considered unreliable due to the nature of the exposure, alternative approaches are taken based on mapping internal counterparty ratings onto historical or market-based default and recovery information.
In particular, this applies to sovereign related names where the effect of using the recovery assumptions implied in CDS levels would imply a 105m 2012: 200m increase in CVA.
Correlation between counterparty credit and underlying derivative risk factors may lead to a systematic bias in the valuation of counterparty credit risk, termed wrong-way or right-way risk.
This is not incorporated into the CVA calculation, but risk of wrong-way exposure is controlled at the trade origination stage.
Derivative credit valuation adjustments reduced by 544m to 384m primarily as a result of a reduction in monoline exposure and improvements in counterparty credit.
Derivative debit valuation adjustments have reduced by 132m to 310m primarily as a result of improvements in Barclays credit.
Portfolio exemptions The Group uses the portfolio exemption in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement to measure the fair value of the group financial assets and financial liabilities.
Assets and liabilities are measured using the price that would be received to sell a net long position i. e. an asset for a particular risk exposure or to transfer a net short position i. e. a liability for a particular risk exposure in an orderly transaction between market participants at the balance sheet date under current market conditions.
Unrecognised gains as a result of the use of valuation models using unobservable inputs The amount that has yet to be recognised in income that relates to the difference between the transaction price the fair value at initial recognition and the amount that would have arisen had valuation models using unobservable inputs been used on initial recognition, less amounts subsequently recognised, is as follows: 2013 2012 m m As at 1 January 148 117 Additions 53 78 Amortisation and releases 64 47 As at 31 December 137 148 The reserve held for unrecognised gains is predominantly related to derivative financial instruments.

The FDIC is funded by premiums that Barclays and other banks pay for deposit insurance coverage.
The carrying value of these issued certificates of deposit that are designated under the IAS 39 fair value option includes this third party credit enhancement.
The on-balance sheet value of these brokered certificates of deposit amounted to 3.1bn at 31 December 2013.
Valuation control framework The Finance-Product Control-Valuations function is responsible for independent price verification, oversight of fair value adjustments and escalation of valuation issues.
This process covers all fair value positions and is a key control in ensuring the material accuracy of valuations.
Governance over the valuation process is the responsibility of the Valuation Committee.
This Committee meets monthly and is responsible for overseeing valuation and fair value adjustment policy within Corporate Banking and Investment Banking and this is the forum to which valuation issues are escalated.
Price verification uses independently sourced data that is deemed most representative of the market.
The characteristics against which the data source is assessed are independence, reliability, consistency with other sources and evidence that the data represents an executable price.
The most current data available at balance sheet date is used.
Where significant variances are noted in the independent price verification process, an adjustment is taken to the fair value position.
Additional fair value adjustments may be taken to reflect such factors as bid-offer spreads, market data uncertainty, model limitations and counterparty risk further detail on these fair value adjustments is disclosed on pages 318 and 319.
Comparison of carrying amounts and fair values for assets and liabilities not held at fair value The following table summarises the fair value of financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost on the Groups balance sheet where the carrying amount is not a reasonable approximation of fair value: 2013 2012 Carrying Carrying amount Fair value amount Fair value m m m m Financial assets Loans and advances to banks 37,853 37,839 40,462 40,462 Loans and advances to customers: Home loans 179,527 170,793 174,988 164,608 Credit cards, unsecured and other retail lending 64,551 63,944 59,577 58,494 Finance lease receivables 5,827 5,759 6,837 6,863 Corporate loans 180,506 176,673 182,504 176,727 Reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending 186,779 186,756 176,522 176,461 Financial liabilities Deposits from banks 54,834 54,865 77,012 77,025 Customer accounts: Current and demand accounts 134,849 134,849 127,786 127,786 Savings accounts 123,824 123,886 99,875 99,875 Other time deposits 169,229 168,959 157,750 157,752 Debt securities in issue 86,693 87,022 119,525 119,669 Repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing 196,748 196,748 217,178 217,178 Subordinated liabilities 21,695 22,193 24,018 23,467 The fair value is an estimate of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
As a wide range of valuation techniques are available, it may not be appropriate to directly compare the Barclays fair value information to independent market or other financial institutions.
Different valuation methodologies and assumptions can have a significant impact on fair values which are based on unobservable inputs.
Financial assets The carrying value of financial assets held at amortised cost including loans and advances to banks and customers, and other lending such as reverse repurchase agreements and cash collateral on securities borrowed is determined in accordance with the relevant accounting policy noted on pages 324 and 325.
Loans and advances to banks The fair value of loans and advances, for the purpose of this disclosure, is derived from discounting expected cashflows in a way that reflects the current market price for lending to issuers of similar credit quality.
Where market data or credit information on the underlying borrowers is unavailable, a number of proxy extrapolation techniques are employed to determine the appropriate discount rates.
There is minimal difference between the fair value and carrying amount due to the short term nature of the lending i. e. predominantly overnight deposits and the high credit quality of counterparties.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Note 18: Fair value of assets and liabilities continued Loans and advances to customers The fair value of loans and advances to customers, for the purpose of this disclosure, is derived from discounting expected cash flows in a way that reflects the current market price for lending to issuers of similar credit quality.
For retail lending i. e. Home loans and Credit cards tailored discounted cash flow models are used to estimate the fair value of different product types.
For example for home loans different models are used to estimate fair values of tracker, offset and fixed rate mortgage products.
Key inputs to these models are the differentials between historic and current product margins and estimated prepayment rates.
The discount of fair value to carrying amount for home loans has reduced to 5% 2012:6% due to changes in product mix across the loan portfolio and movements in product margins.
The fair value of Corporate loans calculated by the use of discounted cash flow techniques where the gross loan values are discounted at a rate of difference between contractual margins and hurdle rates or spreads where Barclays charges a margin over LIBOR depending on credit quality and loss given default and years to maturity.
The discount between the carrying and fair value has marginally decreased to 2.1% 2012: 3.2%.
Reverse repurchase agreements The fair value of reverse repurchase agreements approximates carrying amount as these balances are generally short dated.
Financial liabilities The carrying value of financial liabilities held at amortised cost including customer accounts and other deposits such as repurchase agreements and cash collateral on securities lent, debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities is determined in accordance with the accounting policy noted on pages 325 and 341.
Deposits from banks and customer accounts In many cases, the fair value disclosed approximates carrying value because the instruments are short term in nature or have interest rates that re-price frequently such as customer accounts and other deposits and short term debt securities.
The fair value for deposits with longer term maturities such as time deposits, are estimated using discounted cash flows applying either market rates or current rates for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
Consequently the fair value discount is minimal.
Debt securities in issue Fair values of other debt securities in issue are either based on quoted prices or where the instruments are short dated, carrying amount approximates fair value.
The fair value difference remained relatively flat at 0.4% 2012: 0.1%.
Repurchase agreements The fair value of repurchase agreements approximates carrying amounts as these balances are generally short dated.
Subordinated liabilities Fair values for dated and undated convertible and non-convertible loan capital are based on quoted market rates for the issue concerned or issues with similar terms and conditions.

Settlement balances and cash collateral are also classified as level 2: and Where unobservable inputs, such as Barclays historic and current product margins, are deemed significant, the related balances are classified as level 3 Loans and advances to banks are mainly classified as level 2.
Home loans, Credit cards, unsecured and other retail lending are generally classified as level 3 as significant inputs used in the valuation models are unobservable.
Corporate loans are mainly classified as level 2 or 3 depending on the observability of inputs into the fair value models.
Reverse repurchase agreements The fair value for repurchase agreements is obtained using fair value models with observable inputs.
These balances are therefore classified as level 2.
Financial liabilities Deposits from banks The majority of the deposits from banks balance is classified as level 2 where they represent cash collateral, settlements and other deposits.
Readily accessible cash is classified as level 1.
Customer accounts The majority of customer account balances are classified as level 1 where the balances represent readily accessible cash, and level 2 where they represent settlements and other deposits.
The level 3 balances are largely comprised of other deposits where models with significant unobservable inputs, such as internal margins, are being used.
Debt securities in issue These are mainly classified as level 2 as the inputs into the fair value models used for these balances are observable.
Repurchase agreements The fair value for repurchase agreements is obtained using fair value models with observable inputs.
Subordinated liabilities The majority of these balances are classified as level 2 as the inputs used to determine fair value are largely observable in an active market.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Quoted market prices are not available for many of the financial assets and liabilities that are held at fair value and the Group uses a variety of techniques to estimate the fair value.
The above note describes the more judgemental aspects of valuation in the period, including: credit valuation adjustments on monoline exposures, commercial real estate loans, private equity investments, and fair value loans to government and business and other services.
Note 19: Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities In accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, the group reports financial assets and financial liabilities on a net basis on the balance sheet only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Financial collateral refers to cash and non-cash collateral obtained, typically daily or weekly, to cover the net exposure between counterparties by enabling the collateral to be realised in an event of default or if other predetermined events occur.
Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending and borrowing The Financial instruments column identifies financial assets and liabilities that are subject to set off under netting agreements, such as global master repurchase agreements and global master securities lending agreements, whereby all outstanding transactions with the same counterparty can be offset and close-out netting applied across all outstanding transaction covered by the agreements if an event of default or other predetermined events occur.
Financial collateral typically comprises highly liquid securities wh ich are legally transferred and can be liquidated in the event of counterparty default.
These offsetting and collateral arrangements and other credit risk mitigation strategies used by the Group are further explained in the Credit risk mitigation section on pages 398 to 400.
Notes a Amounts offset for derivative financial assets includes cash collateral netted of 1,965m 2012: 6,506m.
Amounts offset for derivative liabilities includes cash collateral netted of 2,445m 2012: 4,957m.
Settlements assets and liabilities have been offset amounting to 6,967m 2012: 9,879m.

Note 20: Loans and advances to banks and customers Accounting for financial instruments held at amortised cost Loans and advances to customers and banks, customer accounts, debt securities and most financial liabilities, are held at amortised cost.
That is, the initial fair value which is normally the amount advanced or borrowed is adjusted for repayments and the amortisation of coupon, fees and expenses to represent the effective interest rate of the asset or liability.

Note 21: Finance leases Accounting for finance leases The Group applies IAS 17 Leases in accounting for finance leases, both where it is the lessor or the lessee.
A finance lease is a lease which confers substantially all the risks and rewards of the leased assets on the lessee.
Where the Group is the lessor, the leased asset is not held on the balance sheet: instead a finance lease receivable is recognised representing the minimum lease payments receivable under the terms of the lease, discounted at the rate of interest implicit in the lease.
Where the Group is the lessee, the leased asset is recognised in property, plant and equipment and a finance lease liability is recognised, representing the minimum lease payments payable under the lease, discounted at the rate of interest implicit in the lease.
Interest income or expense is recognised in interest receivable or payable, allocated to accounting periods to reflect a constant periodic rate of return.
Finance lease receivables Finance lease receivables are included within loans and advances to customers.
The Group specialises in asset-based lending and works with a broad range of international technology, industrial equipment and commercial companies to provide customised finance programmes to assist manufacturers, dealers and distributors of assets.

Note 22: Reclassification of financial assets held for trading Accounting for the reclassification of financial assets held for trading In accordance with IAS 39, where the Group no longer intends to trade in financial assets it may transfer them out of the held for trading classification and measure them at amortised cost if they meet the definition of a loan.
The initial value used for the purposes of establishing amortised cost is fair value on the date of the transfer.
Prior to 2010, the Group reclassified certain financial assets, originally classified as held for trading that were deemed to be not held for trading purposes to loans and receivables.
The carrying value of the securities reclassified into loans and receivables has decreased from 5,188m to 2,812m primarily as a result of sales and paydowns of the underlying securities during the period.
Sales of securities from the 16 December 2008 reclassification totalled 18m 2012: 151m and sales of securities from the 25 November 2009 reclassification totalled 1,573m 2012: 1,316m.

Note 23: Reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements including other similar lending and borrowing Reverse repurchase agreements and stock borrowing or similar transaction are a form of secured lending whereby the Group provides a loan or cash collateral in exchange for the transfer of collateral, generally in the form of marketable securities subject to an agreement to transfer the securities back at a fixed price in the future.
Repurchase agreements are where the Group obtains such loans or cash collateral, in exchange for the transfer of collateral.
Accounting for reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements including other similar lending and borrowing The Group purchases a reverse repurchase agreement or borrows securities subject to a commitment to resell or return them.
The securities are not included in the balance sheet as the Group does not acquire the risks and rewards of ownership.
Consideration paid or cash collateral provided is accounted for as a loan asset at amortised cost.
The Group may also sell a repurchase agreement or lend securities subject to a commitment to repurchase or redeem them.
The securities are retained on the balance sheet as the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
Consideration received or cash collateral provided is accounted for as a financial liability at amortised cost.

Note 24: Property, plant and equipment Accounting for property, plant and equipment The Group applies IAS 16 Property Plant and Equipment and IAS 40 Investment Properties.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, which includes direct and incremental acquisition costs less accumulated depreciation and provisions for impairment, if required.
Subsequent costs are capitalised if these result in an enhancement to the asset.
Depreciation is provided on the depreciable amount of items of property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives.
Depreciation rates, methods and the residual values underlying the calculation of depreciation of items of property, plant and equipment are kept under review to take account of any change in circumstances.
The Group uses the following annual rates in calculating depreciation: Annual rates in calculating depreciation Depreciation rate Freehold land Not depreciated Freehold buildings and long-leasehold property more than 50 years to run 2-3.3% Leasehold property over the remaining life of the lease less than 50 years to run Over the remaining life of the lease Costs of adaptation of freehold and leasehold property 6-10% Equipment installed in freehold and leasehold property 6-10% Computers and similar equipment 17-33% Fixtures and fittings and other equipment 9-20% Where a leasehold property has a remaining useful life of less than 15 years, costs of adaptation and installed equipment are depreciated over the remaining life of the lease.
Investment property The Group initially recognises investment property at cost, and subsequently at fair value at each balance sheet date reflecting market conditions at the reporting date.
Gains and losses on re-measurement are included in the income statement.

Investment property disposals of 1bn relate to real estate investments within Crescent Real Estate Holdings LLC, an investment company controlled by Barclays until December 2013.
The fair value of investment property is determined by reference to current market prices for similar properties, adjusted as necessary for condition and location, or by reference to recent transactions updated to reflect current economic conditions.
Discounted cash flow techniques may be employed to calculate fair value where there have been no recent transactions, using current external market inputs such as market rents and interest rates.
Valuations are carried out by management with the support of appropriately qualified independent valuers.
Refer to Note 18 Fair value of assets and liabilities for further detail.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 327 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 continued Note 25: Goodwill and intangible assets Accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill The carrying value of goodwill is determined in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations and IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, and represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the Groups share of the assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed on the date of the acquisition.
Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently when there are indications that impairment may have occurred.
The test involves comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the present value of the pre tax cash flows, discounted at a rate of interest that reflects the inherent risks, of the cash generating unit CGU to which the goodwill relates, or the CGUs fair value if this is higher.
Intangible assets The accounting standard that the Group applies in accounting for intangible assets other than goodwill is IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
Intangible assets include brands, customer lists, internally generated software, other software, licences and other contracts and core deposit intangibles.
They are initially recognised when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights, the cost can be measured reliably and, in the case of intangible assets not acquired in a business combination, where it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the assets will flow from their use.
Intangible assets are stated at cost which is, in the case of assets acquired in a business combination, the acquisition date fair value less amortisation and provisions for impairment, if any, and are amortised over their useful lives in a manner that reflects the pattern to which they contribute to future cash flows, generally over 4-25 years.
Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when there are indications that impairment may have occurred.

This includes the identification of independent cash generating units and the allocation of goodwill to these units based on which units are expected to benefit from the acquisition.
The allocation is reviewed following business reorganisation.
Cash flow projections necessarily take into account changes in the market in which a business operates including the level of growth, competitive activity and, the impacts of regulatory change.
Determining both the expected pre-tax cash flows and the risk adjusted interest rate appropriate to the operating unit requires the exercise of judgement.
The estimation of pre-tax cash flows is sensitive to the periods for which detailed forecasts are available and to assumptions regarding the long-term sustainable cash flows.
Other intangible assets Determining the estimated useful lives of intangible assets such as those arising from contractual relationships requires an analysis of circumstances and judgement.
The assessment of whether an asset is exhibiting indicators of impairment as well as the calculation of impairment, which requires the estimate of future cash flows and fair values less costs to sell, also requires the preparation of cash flow forecasts and fair values for assets that may not be regularly bought and sold.
Impairment testing of goodwill During 2013, the Group recognised an impairment charge of 79m 2012: nil in respect of goodwill attributable to businesses acquired in a previous period by Wealth and Investment Management.
Following a streamlining of operations within Wealth and Investment Management, the forecast future cashflows from these businesses have been revised and no longer support the carrying value of the goodwill.
As a result the attributable goodwill balances have been fully impaired.
Key assumptions The key assumptions used for impairment testing are set out below for each significant goodwill balance.
Other goodwill of 1,091m 2012: 1,247m was allocated to multiple cash-generating units which are not considered individually significant.
UK RBB At 31 December 2013, goodwill relating to Woolwich was 3,130m 2012: 3,130m of the total UK RBB balance.
The carrying value of the cash generating unit CGU is determined using an allocation of total group shareholder funds excluding goodwill based on the CGUs share of risk weighted assets before goodwill balances are added back.
The recoverable amount of the CGU has been determined using cash flow predictions based on financial budgets approved by management and covering a five-year period, with a terminal growth rate of 2.1% 2012: 2.4% applied thereafter.
The forecast cash flows have been discounted at a pre-tax rate of 11.8% 2012: 12.4%.
Based on these assumptions, the recoverable amount exceeded the carrying amount including goodwill by 8,628m 2012: 9,334m.
A one percentage point change in the discount rate or the terminal growth rate would increase or decrease the recoverable amount by 1,757m 2012: 1,637m and 1,210m 2012: 1,115m respectively.
A reduction in the forecast cash flows of 10% per annum would reduce the recoverable amount by 1,795m 2012: 1,767m.
Africa RBB At 31 December 2013, goodwill relating to the Absa RBB CGU was 657m 2012: 829m of the total Africa RBB balance.
The carrying value of the CGU has been determined by using net asset value.
The recoverable amount of Absa RBB has been determined using cash flow predictions based on financial budgets approved by management and covering a five year period, with a terminal growth rate of 6% 2012: 6% applied thereafter.
The forecast cash flows have been discounted at a pre-tax rate of 13.5% 2012: 13%.
The recoverable amount calculated based on value in use exceeded the carrying amount including goodwill by 4,217m 2012: 3,133m.
A one percentage point change in the discount rate or the terminal growth rate would increase or decrease the recoverable amount by 800m 2012: 813m and 603m 2012: 623m respectively.
A reduction in the forecast cash flows of 10% p. a. would reduce the recoverable amount by 664m 2012: 643m.

An operating lease is a lease where substantially all of the risks and rewards of the leased assets remain with the lessor.
Where the Group is the lessor, lease income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease unless another systematic basis is more appropriate.
The Group holds the leased assets on balance sheet within property, plant and equipment.
Where the Group is the lessee, rentals payable are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another systematic basis is more appropriate.
Operating lease receivables The Group acts as lessor, whereby items of plant and equipment are purchased and then leased to third parties under arrangements qualifying as operating leases.
The future minimum lease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable operating leases as at 31 December 2013 was 3m 2012: 4m.
Operating lease commitments The Group leases various offices, branches and other premises under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements.
With such operating lease arrangements, the asset is kept on the lessors balance sheet and the Group reports the future minimum lease payments as an expense over the lease term.
The leases have various terms, escalation and renewal rights.
There are no contingent rents payable.
Operating lease rentals of 645m 2012: 622m have been included in administration and general expenses.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Accruals, provisions, contingent liabilities and legal proceedings The notes included in this section focus on the Groups accruals, provisions and contingent liabilities.
Provisions are recognised for present obligations arising as consequences of past events where it is probable that a transfer of economic benefit will be necessary to settle the obligation, and it can be reliably estimated.
Contingent liabilities reflect potential liabilities that are not recognised on the balance sheet.
Note 27: Accruals, deferred income and other liabilities Accounting for insurance contracts The Group applies IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts to its insurance contracts.
An insurance contract is a contract that compensates a third party against a loss from non-financial risk.
Some wealth management and other products, such as life assurance contracts, combine investment and insurance features: these are treated as insurance contracts when they pay benefits that are at least 5% more than they would pay if the insured event does not occur.
Insurance liabilities include current best estimates of future contractual cash flows, claims handling, and administration costs in respect of claims.
Liability adequacy tests are performed at each balance sheet date to ensure the adequacy of contract liabilities.
Where a deficiency is highlighted by the tests, insurance liabilities are increased, any deficiency being recognised in the income statement.
Insurance premium revenue is recognised in the income statement in the period earned, net of reinsurance premiums payable, in net premiums from insurance contracts.
Increases and decreases in insurance liabilities are recognised in the income statement in net claims and benefits on insurance contracts.

Insurance contract liabilities associated with the Groups short term non-life business are 108m 2012: 126m.
The maximum amounts payable under all of the Groups insurance products, ignoring the probability of insured events occurring and the contribution from investments backing the insurance policies, were 78bn 2012: 102bn or 75bn 2012: a 98bn after reinsurance.
Of this insured risk, 65bn 2012: 87bn or 63bn 2012: 86bn after reinsurances was concentrated in short-term insurance contracts in Africa.
The impact to the income statement and equity under a reasonably possible change in the assumptions used to calculate the insurance liabilities would be 7m 2012: 7m.

Provisions are recognised for present obligations arising as consequences of past events where it is more likely than not that a transfer of economic benefit will be necessary to settle the obligation, which can be reliably estimated.
Provision is made for the anticipated cost of restructuring, including redundancy costs when an obligation exists: for example, when the Group has a detailed formal plan for restructuring a business and has raised valid expectations in those affected by the restructuring by announcing its main features or starting to implement the plan.
Provision is made for undrawn loan commitments if it is probable that the facility will be drawn and result in the recognition of an asset at an amount less than the amount advanced.

Conduct remediation Conduct provisions comprise the estimated cost of making redress payments to customers, clients and counterparties for losses or damages associated with inappropriate judgement in the execution of our business activities.
Conduct remediation largely relates to payment protection insurance and interest rate hedging products but also includes other smaller provisions across the retail and corporate businesses which are likely to be utilised within the next 18 months.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Payment Protection Insurance Redress Following the conclusion of the 2011 Judicial Review, Barclays has raised provisions totalling 3.95bn against the cost of PPI redress and complaint handling costs.
As at 31 December 2013, 2.98bn of the provision had been utilised, leaving a residual provision of 0.97bn.
a Through to 31 December 2013, 1.0m 2012: 0.6m customer initiated claims had been received and processed.
The monthly volume of claims received has declined by 59% since the peak in May 2012, although the rate of decline has been less than previously expected.
As a result an additional provision of 1.35bn was recognised in June 2013 to reflect this increased expectation of claims, a corresponding increase in cases referred to the Financial Ombudsman Service FOS and associated operational costs.
In August 2012, in accordance with regulatory standards, Barclays commenced a proactive mailing of the holders of approximately 750,000 policies.
Of this population approximately 660,000 2012: 100,000 had been contacted by 31 December 2013 and it is anticipated that the remainder will be contacted by 31 March 2014. b To date Barclays has upheld 74% 2012: 70% of all claims received, excluding payment of gestures of goodwill and claims for which no PPI c policy exists.
The average redress per valid policy to date is 1,763 2012: 1,705, comprising, where applicable, the refund of premium, compound interest charged and compensatory interest of 8%.
The current provision is calculated using a number of key assumptions which continue to involve significant management judgement: Customer initiated claim volumes claims received but not yet processed as at 31 December 2013 and an estimate of future claims initiated by customers where the volume is anticipated to decline over time Proactive response rate volume of claims in response to proactive mailing Uphold rate the percentage of claims that are upheld as being valid upon review Average claim redress the expected average payment to customers for upheld claims based on the type and age of the policy policies Notes a Total claims received to date excluding those for which no PPI policy exists and excluding responses to proactive mailing.

b Average uphold rate per claim excluding those for which no PPI policy exists.
The average uphold rate for 31 December 2012 has been restated to exclude cases where there was no PPI policy: previously 39%.
c Average redress stated on a per policy basis.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Note 28: Provisions continued These assumptions remain subjective: in particular due to the uncertainty associated with future claims levels.
The resulting provision represents Barclays best estimate of all future expected costs of PPI redress.
However, it is possible the eventual outcome may differ from the current estimate and if this were to be material and adverse a further provision will be made, otherwise it is expected that any residual costs will be handled as part of normal operations.
The provision also includes an estimate of our claims handling costs and those costs associated with claims that are subsequently referred to the FOS.

Interest Rate Hedging Product Redress On 29 June 2012, the FSA announced that a number of UK banks, including Barclays, would conduct a review and redress exercise in respect of interest rate hedging products sold on or after 1 December 2001 to retail clients or private customers categorised as being non-sophisticated under the terms of the agreement.
Barclays sold interest rate hedging products to approximately 4,000 retail clients or private customers within the relevant timeframe, of which approximately 2,900 have been categorised as non-sophisticated.
As at 31 December 2012, a provision of 850m had been recognised, reflecting managements best estimate of future redress to customers categorised as non-sophisticated and related costs.
The estimate was based on an extrapolation of the results of an initial pilot exercise across the population.
The provision recognised in the balance sheet as at 31 December 2012 was 814m, after utilisation of 36m, primarily related to administrative costs.
During 2013, additional cases have been reviewed and further guidance has been provided by the FCA providing additional information upon which to estimate the provision.
As a result, an additional provision of 650m was recognised in June 2013, bringing the cumulative expense to 1,500m.
The provision recognised as at 31 December 2013 was 1,169m, after cumulative utilisation of 331m, primarily relating to administrative costs and 87m of redress costs incurred.
An initial redress outcome had been communicated to nearly 30% of customers categorised as non-sophisticated that are being covered by the review.
It is intended that redress outcomes will have been communicated to all customers that have opted into the review by June 2014.
The timing of resulting payments will depend on customer acceptances and response times.
The form of redress for each non-sophisticated customer is uncertain.
It may result in a full refund, as though the product had never been purchased, or an alternative product such as a cap.
In addition, not all customers will be entitled to redress because some sales will have complied with relevant regulatory requirements at the time of sale.
The ultimate redress cost is also dependent on: The fair value of the underlying product and is therefore variable if interest rates move significantly: The administrative costs of completing the review and redress exercise: The length of time taken to complete the exercise, since an 8% p. a. interest charge is payable on product refund amounts.
No provision has been recognised in relation to claims from customers categorised as sophisticated, which are not covered by the redress exercise, or incremental consequential loss claims above the 8% p. a. interest charge from customers categorised as non-sophisticated.
As at 31 December 2013, no significant incremental consequential loss claims from customers categorised as non-sophisticated had been agreed.
These items will be monitored and future provisions will be recognised to the extent an obligation resulting in a probable outflow is identified.
While the Group expects that the provision as at 31 December 2013 will be sufficient to cover the full cost of completing the redress, the appropriate provision level will be kept under review and it is possible that the eventual costs could materially differ to the extent experience is not in line with current estimates.
Litigation The Group is engaged in various legal proceedings, both in the UK and a number of other overseas jurisdictions, including the US.
For further information in relation to legal proceedings and discussion of the associated uncertainties, please see Note 30 Legal, competition and regulatory matters.
Redundancy and Restructuring The provision relates to major restructuring initiatives across the Group.
The increase in the provision during 2013 is largely due to the Transform Programme and will likely be utilised within the next 12 months.

Contingent liabilities are not recognised on the balance sheet but are disclosed unless the outflow of economic resources is remote.
The following table summarises the nominal principal amount of contingent liabilities and commitments which are not recorded on balance sheet: 2013 2012 m m Guarantees and letters of credit pledged as collateral security 15,226 15,855 Performance guarantees, acceptances and endorsements 5,958 6,406 Contingent liabilities 21,184 22,261 Documentary credits and other short-term trade related transactions 780 1,027 a Forward starting reverse repurchase agreements 19,936 23,549 Standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments 254,855 247,816 The Financial Services Compensation Scheme The Financial Services Compensation Scheme the FSCS is the UKs Government backed compensation scheme for customers of authorised institutions that are unable to pay claims.
It provides compensation to depositors in the event that UK licensed deposit taking institutions are unable to meet their claims.
The FSCS raises levies on UK licensed deposit taking institutions to meet such claims based on their share of UK deposits on 31 December of the year preceding the scheme year which runs from 1 April to 31 March.
Compensation has previously been paid out by the FSCS funded by loan facilities totalling approximately 18bn provided by HM Treasury to FSCS in support of FSCSs obligations to the depositors of banks declared in default.
The interest rate chargeable on the loan and levied to the industry is subject to a floor equal to the HM Treasurys own cost of borrowing, based on the relevant gilt rate FSCS advises financial institutions to apply the 2024 UK Gilt rate published by the Debt Management Office to the Bradford & Bingley portion of the loan.
The majority of the facility is expected to be recovered, with the exception of an estimated shortfall of 1bn which the FSCS intends to recover by levying the industry in three instalments across 2013, 2014 and 2015.
In November 2013, HM Treasury communicated via the FSCS an additional expected shortfall in recoveries from Dunfermline Building Society, to be collected starting with an interim levy of 100m in 2014.
Barclays has included an accrual of 148m in other liabilities 2012: 156m in respect of the Barclays portion of the total levies raised by the FSCS.

Lehman Brothers Background Information In September 2009, motions were filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York Bankruptcy Court by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. LBHI, the SIPA Trustee for Lehman Brothers Inc.
Trustee and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Committee.
All three motions challenged certain aspects of the transaction pursuant to which Barclays Capital Inc. BCI and other companies in the Group acquired most of the assets of Lehman Brothers Inc. LBI in September 2008, as well as the court order approving the sale Sale.
The claimants sought an order voiding the transfer of certain assets to BCI, requiring BCI to return to the LBI estate any excess value BCI allegedly received, and declaring that BCI is not entitled to certain assets that it claims pursuant to the Sale documents and order approving the Sale Rule 60 Claims.
In January 2010, BCI filed its response to the motions and also filed a motion seeking delivery of certain assets that LBHI and LBI had failed to deliver as required by the Sale documents and the court order approving the Sale together with the Trustees competing claims to those assets, Contract Claims.
Status In February 2011, the Bankruptcy Court issued an Opinion rejecting the Rule 60 Claims and deciding some of the Contract Claims in the Trustees favour and some in favour of the Group.
In July 2011, the Bankruptcy Court entered final Orders implementing its Opinion.
The Group and the Trustee each appealed the Bankruptcy Courts adverse rulings on the Contract Claims to the US District Court for the Southern District of New York SDNY.
LBHI and the Committee did not appeal the Bankruptcy Courts ruling on the Rule 60 Claims.
After briefing and argument, the SDNY issued an Opinion in June 2012, reversing one of the Bankruptcy Courts rulings on the Contract Claims that had been adverse to the Group and affirming the Bankruptcy Courts other rulings on the Contract Claims.
In July 2012, the SDNY issued an amended Opinion, correcting certain errors but not otherwise modifying the rulings, along with an agreed judgement implementing the rulings in the Opinion Judgement.
Under the Judgement, the Group is entitled to receive: i $1.1bn 0.7bn from the Trustee in respect of clearance box assets Clearance Box Assets : and ii property held at various institutions in respect of the exchange traded derivatives accounts transferred to BCI in the Sale ETD Margin.
The Trustee has appealed the SDNYs adverse rulings to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit Second Circuit.
The current Judgement is stayed pending resolution of the Trustees appeal.
Note a Loan commitments have been revised to incorporate forward starting reverse repurchase agreements.
334 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 barclays.
com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Note 30: Legal, competition and regulatory matters continued Approximately $4.3bn 2.6bn of the assets to which the Group is entitled as part of the acquisition had not been received by 31 December 2013, approximately $2.7bn 1.6bn of which have been recognised as a receivable on the balance sheet as at that date.
The unrecognised amount, approximately $1.6bn 1.0bn as of 31 December 2013 effectively represents a provision against the uncertainty inherent in the litigation and potential post-appeal proceedings and issues relating to the recovery of certain assets held by an institution outside the US.
To the extent the Group ultimately receives in the future assets with a value in excess of the approximately $2.7bn 1.6bn recognised on the balance sheet as of 31 December 2013, it would result in a gain in income equal to such excess.
It appears that the Trustee may dispute the Groups entitlement to certain of the ETD Margin even in the event the Group prevails in the pending Second Circuit appeal proceedings.
Moreover, there is uncertainty regarding recoverability of a portion of the ETD Margin not yet delivered to the Group that is held by an institution outside the US.
Thus, the Group cannot reliably estimate how much of the ETD Margin the Group is ultimately likely to receive.
Nonetheless, if the SDNYs rulings are unaffected by future proceedings, but conservatively assuming the Group does not receive any ETD Margin that the Group believes may be subject to a post-appeal challenge by the Trustee or to uncertainty regarding recoverability, the Group will receive assets in excess of the $2.7bn 1.6bn recognised as a receivable on the Groups balance sheet as at 31 December 2013.
In a worst case scenario in which the Second Circuit reverses the SDNYs rulings and determines that the Group is not entitled to any of the Clearance Box Assets or ETD Margin, the Group estimates that, after taking into account its effective provision, its total losses would be approximately $6bn 3.6bn.
Approximately $3.3bn 2bn of that loss would relate to Clearance Box Assets and ETD Margin previously received by the Group and prejudgement and post-judgement interest on such Clearance Box Assets and ETD Margin that would have to be returned or paid to the Trustee.
In this context, the Group is satisfied with the valuation of the asset recognised on its balance sheet and the resulting level of effective provision.
Other In May 2013 Citibank N. A. Citi filed an action against BBPLC in the SDNY alleging breach of an indemnity contract.
In November 2008, BBPLC provided an indemnity to Citi in respect of losses incurred by Citi between 17 and 19 September 2008 in performing foreign exchange settlement services for LBI as LBIs designated settlement member with CLS Bank International.
Citi did not make a demand for payment under this indemnity until 1 February 2013 when it submitted a demand that included amounts which Barclays concluded it was not obligated to pay.
Citi proceeded to file the action in May 2013, in which it claimed that Barclays was responsible for a principal loss of $90.7m, but also claimed that BBPLC was obligated to pay Citi for certain alleged funding losses from September 2008 to December 2012.
In a June 2013 filing with the Court, Citi claimed that, in addition to the $90.7m principal loss claim, it was also claiming funding losses in an amount of at least $93.5m, consisting of alleged interest losses of over $55m and alleged capital charges of $38.5m.
Both parties filed motions for partial summary judgement, and in November 2013 the SDNY ruled that: i Citi may only claim statutory prejudgment interest from 1 February 2013, the date upon which it made its indemnification demand on BBPLC: ii to the extent that Citi can prove it incurred actual funding losses in the form of interest and capital charges between September 2008 and December 2012, it is entitled to recover these losses under the indemnity provided by BBPLC: and iii BBPLC is entitled under the contract to demonstrate, as a defence to the funding loss claim, that Citi had no funding losses between September 2008 and December 2012 due to the fact that it held LBI deposits during that period in an amount greater than the principal amount Citi claims it lost in performing CLS services for LBI between 17 and 19 September 2008.
Citi and BBPLC have reached an agreement in principle to settle this action subject to negotiation and execution of definitive documentation.
American Depositary Shares Background Information BPLC, BBPLC and various current and former members of BPLCs Board of Directors have been named as defendants in five proposed securities class actions consolidated in the SDNY.
The consolidated amended complaint, filed in February 2010, asserted claims under Sections 11, 12 a 2 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, alleging that registration statements relating to American Depositary Shares representing preferred stock, series 2, 3, 4 and 5 Preferred Stock ADS offered by BBPLC at various times between 2006 and 2008 contained misstatements and omissions concerning amongst other things BBPLCs portfolio of mortgage-related including US subprime-related securities, BBPLCs exposure to mortgage and credit market risk, and BBPLCs financial condition.
Status In January 2011, the SDNY granted the defendants motion to dismiss the complaint in its entirety, closing the case.
In February 2011, the plaintiffs filed a motion asking the SDNY to reconsider in part its dismissal order, and, in May 2011, the SDNY denied in full the plaintiffs motion for reconsideration.
The plaintiffs appealed both the dismissal and the denial of the motion for reconsideration to the Second Circuit.
In August 2013, the Second Circuit upheld the dismissal of the plaintiffs claims related to the series 2, 3 and 4 offerings, finding that they were time barred.
However, the Second Circuit ruled that the plaintiffs should have been permitted to file a second amended complaint in relation to the series 5 offering claims, and remanded the action to the SDNY for further proceedings consistent with the Second Circuits decision.
In September 2013, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint, which purports to assert claims concerning the series 5 offering as well as dismissed claims concerning the series 2, 3 and 4 offerings, and the defendants have moved to dismiss.
BBPLC considers that these Preferred Stock ADS-related claims against it are without merit and is defending them vigorously.
Mortgage-Related Activity and Litigation The Groups activities within the US residential mortgage sector during the period of 2005 through 2008 included sponsoring and underwriting approximately $39bn of private-label securitisations: economic underwriting exposure of approximately $34bn for other private-label securitisations: sales of approximately $0.2bn of loans to government sponsored enterprises GSEs : and sales of approximately $3bn of loans to others.
In addition, during this time period, approximately $19.4bn of loans net of approximately $500m of loans sold during this period and subsequently repurchased were also originated and sold to third parties by mortgage originator affiliates of an entity that the Group acquired in 2007 Acquired Subsidiary.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 335 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 continued Note 30: Legal, competition and regulatory matters continued In connection with the Groups loan sales and sponsored private-label securitisations, the Group provided certain loan level representations and warranties R&Ws generally relating to the underlying mortgages, the property, mortgage documentation and or compliance with law.
The Group was the sole provider of R&Ws with respect to approximately $5bn of Group sponsored securitizations, approximately $0.2bn of sales of loans to GSEs, and approximately $3bn of loans sold to others.
In addition, the Acquired Subsidiary was the sole provider of R&Ws on all of the loans it sold to third parties.
Other than approximately $1bn of loans sold to others for which R&Ws expired prior to 2012, there are no stated expiration provisions applicable to the R&Ws made by the Group or the Acquired Subsidiary.
The Groups R&Ws with respect to the $3bn of loans sold to others are related to loans that were generally sold at significant discounts and contained more limited R&Ws than loans sold to GSEs, the loans sold by the Acquired Subsidiary or those provided by the Group on approximately $5bn of the Groups sponsored securitisations discussed above.
R&Ws on the remaining approximately $34bn of the Groups sponsored securitisations were primarily provided by third party originators directly to the securitisation trusts with a Group subsidiary, as depositor to the securitisation trusts, providing more limited R&Ws.
Under certain circumstances, the Group and or the Acquired Subsidiary may be required to repurchase the related loans or make other payments related to such loans if the R&Ws are breached.
The unresolved repurchase requests received on or before 31 December 2013 associated with all R&Ws made by the Group or the Acquired Subsidiary on loans sold to GSEs and others and private-label activities had an original unpaid principal balance of approximately $1.7bn at the time of such sale.
Repurchase Claims Substantially all of the unresolved repurchase requests discussed above relate to civil actions that have been commenced by the trustees for certain residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS securitisations, in which the trustees allege that the Group and or the Acquired Subsidiary must repurchase loans that violated the operative R&Ws.
The trustees in these actions have alleged that the operative R&Ws may have been violated with respect to a greater but unspecified amount of loans than the amount of loans previously stated in specific repurchase requests made by such trustees.
Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Claims The US Federal Housing Finance Agency FHFA, acting for two US government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, filed lawsuits against 17 financial institutions in connection with Fannie Maes and Freddie Macs purchases of RMBS.
The lawsuits allege, amongst other things, that the RMBS offering materials contained materially false and misleading statements and or omissions.
BBPLC and or certain of its affiliates or former employees are named in two of these lawsuits, relating to sales between 2005 and 2007 of RMBS in which a Group subsidiary was lead or co-lead underwriter.
Both complaints demand, amongst other things: rescission and recovery of the consideration paid for the RMBS: and recovery for Fannie Maes and Freddie Macs alleged monetary losses arising out of their ownership of the RMBS.
The complaints are similar to a number of other civil actions filed against BBPLC and or certain of its affiliates by a number of other plaintiffs relating to purchases of RMBS.
The Group considers that the claims against it are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously.
The original face amount of RMBS related to the claims against the Group in the FHFA actions and the other civil actions referred to above against the Group totalled approximately $9bn, of which approximately $2.6bn was outstanding as at 31 December 2013.
Cumulative losses reported on these RMBS as at 31 December 2013 were approximately $0.5bn.
If the Group were to lose these actions the Group believes it could incur a loss of up to the outstanding amount of the RMBS at the time of judgement taking into account further principal payments after 31 December 2013, plus any cumulative losses on the RMBS at such time and any interest, fees and costs, less the market value of the RMBS at such time and less any reserves taken to date.
The Group has estimated the total market value of these RMBS as at 31 December 2013 to be approximately $1.6bn.
The Group may be entitled to indemnification for a portion of such losses.
Regulatory Inquiries The Group has received inquiries, including subpoenas, from various regulatory and governmental authorities regarding its mortgage-related activities, and is cooperating with such inquiries.
Devonshire Trust Background Information In January 2009, BBPLC commenced an action in the Ontario Superior Court seeking an order that its early terminations of two credit default swaps under an ISDA Master Agreement with the Devonshire Trust Devonshire, an asset-backed commercial paper conduit trust, were valid.
On the same day that Barclays terminated the swaps, Devonshire purported to terminate the swaps on the ground that BBPLC had failed to provide liquidity support to Devonshires commercial paper when required to do so.
Status In September 2011, the Ontario Superior Court ruled that BBPLCs early terminations were invalid, Devonshires early terminations were valid and, consequently, Devonshire was entitled to receive back from BBPLC cash collateral of approximately C$533m together with accrued interest.
BBPLC appealed the Ontario Superior Courts decision to the Court of Appeal for Ontario.
In July 2013, the Court of Appeal delivered its decision dismissing BBPLCs appeal.
In September 2013, BBPLC sought leave to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada.
In January 2014, the Supreme Court of Canada denied BBPLCs application for leave to appeal the decision of the Court of Appeal.
BBPLC is considering its continuing options with respect to this matter.
If the Court of Appeals decision is unaffected by any future proceedings, BBPLC estimates that its loss would be approximately C$500m, less any impairment provisions recognised to date.
These provisions take full account of the Court of Appeals decision.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Note 30: Legal, competition and regulatory matters continued LIBOR and other Benchmarks Civil Actions Following the settlements of the investigations referred to below in Investigations into LIBOR, ISDAfix, other benchmarks and foreign exchange rates, a number of individuals and corporates in a range of jurisdictions have threatened or brought civil actions against the Group in relation to LIBOR and or other benchmarks.
The majority of the USD LIBOR cases, which have been filed in various US jurisdictions, have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York MDL Court.
The complaints are substantially similar and allege, amongst other things, that BBPLC and the other banks individually and collectively violated provisions of the US Sherman Act, the US Commodity Exchange Act CEA, the US Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act RICO and various state laws by manipulating USD LIBOR rates.
The lawsuits seek unspecified damages with the exception of three lawsuits, in which the plaintiffs are seeking a combined total of approximately $910m in actual damages against all defendants, including BBPLC, plus punitive damages.
Some of the lawsuits seek trebling of damages under the US Sherman Act and RICO.
Certain of the civil actions are proposed class actions that purport to be brought on behalf of amongst others plaintiffs that i engaged in USD LIBOR-linked over-the-counter transactions OTC Class : ii purchased USD LIBOR-linked financial instruments on an exchange Exchange-Based Class : iii purchased USD LIBOR-linked debt securities Debt Securities Class : iv purchased adjustable-rate mortgages linked to USD LIBOR: or v issued loans linked to USD LIBOR.
In March 2013, the MDL Court issued a decision dismissing the majority of claims against BBPLC and the other banks in three lead proposed class actions Lead Class Actions and three lead individual actions Lead Individual Actions.
Following the decision, plaintiffs in the Lead Class Actions sought permission to either file an amended complaint or appeal an aspect of the March 2013 decision.
In August 2013, the MDL Court denied the majority of the motions presented in the Lead Class Actions.
As a result, the Debt Securities Class has been dismissed entirely: the claims of the Exchange-Based Class have been limited to claims under the CEA: and the claims of the OTC Class have been limited to claims for unjust enrichment and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
Subsequent to the MDL Courts March 2013 decision, the plaintiffs in the Lead Individual Actions filed a new action in California state court since moved to the MDL Court based on the same allegations as those initially alleged in the proposed class action cases discussed above.
Various plaintiffs may attempt to bring appeals of some or all of the MDL Courts decisions in the future.
Additionally, a number of other actions before the MDL Court remain stayed, pending further proceedings in the Lead Class Actions.
Until there are further decisions, the ultimate impact of the MDL Courts decisions will be unclear, although it is possible that the decisions will be interpreted by courts to affect other litigation, including the actions described below, some of which concern different benchmark interest rates.
BBPLC and other banks also have been named as defendants in other individual and proposed class actions filed in other US District Courts in which plaintiffs allege, similar to the plaintiffs in the USD LIBOR cases referenced above, that in various periods defendants either individually or collectively manipulated the USD LIBOR, Yen LIBOR, Euroyen TIBOR and or EURIBOR rates.
Plaintiffs generally allege that they transacted in loans, derivatives and or other financial instruments whose values are affected by changes in USD LIBOR, Yen LIBOR, Euroyen TIBOR and or EURIBOR, and assert claims under federal and state law.
In October 2012, the US District Court for the Central District of California dismissed a proposed class action on behalf of holders of adjustable rate mortgages linked to USD LIBOR.
Plaintiffs have appealed, and briefing of the appeal is complete.
In addition, BPLC has been granted conditional leniency from the Antitrust Division of the US Department of Justice DOJ-AD in connection with potential US antitrust law violations with respect to financial instruments that reference EURIBOR.
As a result of that grant of conditional leniency, BPLC is eligible for i a limit on liability to actual rather than treble damages if damages were to be awarded in any civil antitrust action under US antitrust law based on conduct covered by the conditional leniency and ii relief from potential joint-and-several liability in connection with such civil antitrust action, subject to BPLC satisfying the DOJ-AD and the court presiding over the civil litigation of its satisfaction of its cooperation obligations.
BPLC, BBPLC and BCI have also been named as defendants along with four former officers and directors of BBPLC in a proposed securities class action pending in the SDNY in connection with BBPLCs role as a contributor panel bank to LIBOR.
The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10 b and 20 a of the US Securities Exchange Act 1934, principally alleging that BBPLCs Annual Reports for the years 2006 to 2011 contained misstatements and omissions concerning amongst other things BBPLCs compliance with its operational risk management processes and certain laws and regulations.
The complaint also alleges that BBPLCs daily USD LIBOR submissions constituted false statements in violation of US securities law.
The complaint was brought on behalf of a proposed class consisting of all persons or entities that purchased BPLC-sponsored American Depositary Receipts on a US securities exchange between 10 July 2007 and 27 June 2012.
In May 2013, the court granted BBPLCs motion to dismiss the complaint in its entirety.
In addition to US actions, legal proceedings have been brought or threatened against the Group in connection with alleged manipulation of LIBOR and EURIBOR, in a number of jurisdictions.
The first of which in England and Wales, brought by Graiseley Properties Limited, is set down for trial in the High Court of Justice in April 2014.
The number of such proceedings, the benchmarks to which they relate, and the jurisdictions in which they may be brought are anticipated to increase over time.
Civil Actions in Respect of Foreign Exchange Trading Since November 2013, a number of civil actions have been filed in the SDNY on behalf of proposed classes of plaintiffs alleging manipulation of foreign exchange markets under the US Sherman Antitrust Act and New York state law and naming several international banks as defendants, including BBPLC.
Please see below Investigations into LIBOR, ISDAfix, other benchmarks and foreign exchange rates for a discussion of competition and regulatory matters connected to LIBOR and other Benchmark Civil Actions.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 337 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 continued Note 30: Legal, competition and regulatory matters continued Investigations into LIBOR, ISDAfix, other Benchmarks and Foreign Exchange Rates The Financial Conduct Authority FCA, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC, the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC, the US Department of Justice DOJ Fraud Section DOJ-FS and Antitrust Division DOJ-AD, the European Commission Commission, the United Kingdom UK Serious Fraud Office SFO, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Japan Financial Services Agency, the prosecutors office in Trani, Italy and various US state attorneys general are amongst various authorities conducting investigations Investigations into submissions made by BBPLC and other financial institutions to the bodies that set or compile various financial benchmarks, such as LIBOR and EURIBOR.
On 27 June 2012, BBPLC announced that it had reached settlements with the Financial Services Authority FSA as predecessor to the FCA, the CFTC and the DOJ-FS in relation to their Investigations and BBPLC agreed to pay total penalties of 290m, which were reflected in operating expenses for 2012.
The settlements were made by entry into a Settlement Agreement with the FSA, a Non-Prosecution Agreement NPA with the DOJ-FS and a Settlement Order Agreement with the CFTC CFTC Order.
In addition, BBPLC was granted conditional leniency from the DOJ-AD in connection with potential US antitrust law violations with respect to financial instruments that reference EURIBOR.
The terms of the Settlement Agreement with the FSA are confidential.
However, the Final Notice of the FSA, which imposed a financial penalty of 59.5m, is publicly available on the website of the FCA.
This sets out the FSAs reasoning for the penalty, references the settlement principles and sets out the factual context and justification for the terms imposed.
Summaries of the NPA and the CFTC Order are set out below.
The full text of the NPA and the CFTC Order are publicly available on the websites of the DOJ and the CFTC, respectively.
In addition to a $200m civil monetary penalty, the CFTC Order requires BBPLC to cease and desist from further violations of specified provisions of the US Commodity Exchange Act and take specified steps to ensure the integrity and reliability of its benchmark interest rate submissions, including LIBOR and EURIBOR, and improve related internal controls.
Amongst other things, the CFTC Order requires BBPLC to: make its submissions based on certain specified factors, with BBPLCs transactions being given the greatest weight, subject to certain specified adjustments and considerations: implement firewalls to prevent improper communications including between traders and submitters: prepare and retain certain documents concerning submissions and retain relevant communications: implement auditing, monitoring and training measures concerning its submissions and related processes: make regular reports to the CFTC concerning compliance with the terms of the CFTC Order: use best efforts to encourage the development of rigorous standards for benchmark interest rates: and continue to cooperate with the CFTCs ongoing investigation of benchmark interest rates.
As part of the NPA, BBPLC agreed to pay a $160m penalty.
In addition, the DOJ agreed not to prosecute BBPLC for any crimes except for criminal tax violations, as to which the DOJ cannot and does not make any agreement related to BBPLCs submissions of benchmark interest rates, including LIBOR and EURIBOR, contingent upon BBPLCs satisfaction of specified obligations under the NPA.
In particular, under the NPA, BBPLC agreed for a period of two years from 26 June 2012, amongst other things, to: commit no US crime whatsoever: truthfully and completely disclose non-privileged information with respect to the activities of BBPLC, its officers and employees, and others concerning all matters about which the DOJ inquires of it, which information can be used for any purpose, except as otherwise limited in the NPA: bring to the DOJs attention all potentially criminal conduct by BBPLC or any of its employees that relates to fraud or violations of the laws governing securities and commodities markets: and bring to the DOJs attention all criminal or regulatory investigations, administrative proceedings or civil actions brought by any governmental authority in the US by or against BBPLC or its employees that alleges fraud or violations of the laws governing securities and commodities markets.
BBPLC also agreed to cooperate with the DOJ and other government authorities in the US in connection with any investigation or prosecution arising out of the conduct described in the NPA, which commitment shall remain in force until all such investigations and prosecutions are concluded.
BBPLC also continues to cooperate with the other ongoing investigations.
Following the settlements announced in June 2012, 31 US state attorneys general commenced their own investigations into LIBOR, EURIBOR and the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate.
The New York Attorney General, on behalf of this coalition of attorneys general, issued a subpoena in July 2012 to BBPLC and subpoenas to a number of other banks to produce wide-ranging information and has since issued additional information requests to BBPLC for both documents and transactional data.
BBPLC is responding to these requests on a rolling basis.
In addition, following the settlements the SFO announced in July 2012 that it had decided to investigate the LIBOR matter, in respect of which BBPLC has received and continues to respond to requests for information.
The Commission has also been conducting investigations into the manipulation of, among other things, EURIBOR.
On 4 December 2013, the Commission announced that it has reached a settlement with the Group and a number of other banks in relation to anti-competitive conduct concerning EURIBOR.
The Group had voluntarily reported the EURIBOR conduct to the Commission and cooperated fully with the Commissions investigation.
In recognition of this cooperation, the Group was granted full immunity from the financial penalties that would otherwise have applied.
The CFTC and the FCA are also conducting separate investigations into historical practices with respect to ISDAfix, amongst other benchmarks.
BBPLC has received and continues to respond to subpoenas and requests for information.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Note 30: Legal, competition and regulatory matters continued Various regulatory and enforcement authorities, including the FCA in the UK, the CFTC, the DOJ, the SEC and the New York State Department of Financial Services in the US, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority are investigating foreign exchange trading, including possible attempts to manipulate certain benchmark currency exchange rates or engage in other activities that would benefit their trading positions.
Certain of these investigations involve multiple market participants in various countries.
BBPLC has received enquiries from certain of these authorities related to their particular investigations, and from other regulators interested in foreign exchange issues.
The Group is reviewing its foreign exchange trading covering a several year period through October 2013 and is cooperating with the relevant authorities in their investigations.
For a discussion of litigation arising in connection with these investigations see LIBOR and other Benchmarks Civil Actions and Civil Actions in Respect of Foreign Exchange Trading above.
FERC Background Information The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC Office of Enforcement investigated the Groups power trading in the western US with respect to the period from late 2006 through 2008.
In October 2012, FERC issued an Order to Show Cause and Notice of Proposed Penalties Order and Notice against BBPLC and four of its former traders in relation to this matter.
In the Order and Notice, FERC asserted that BBPLC and its former traders violated FERCs Anti-Manipulation Rule by manipulating the electricity markets in and around California from November 2006 to December 2008, and proposed civil penalties and profit disgorgement to be paid by BBPLC.
In July 2013, FERC issued an Order Assessing Civil Penalties in which it assessed a $435m civil penalty against BBPLC and ordered BBPLC to disgorge an additional $34.9m of profits plus interest both of which are consistent with the amounts proposed in the Order and Notice.
Status In October 2013, FERC filed a civil action against BBPLC and its former traders in the US District Court in California seeking to collect the penalty and disgorgement amount.
FERCs complaint in the civil action reiterates the allegations previously made by FERC in its October 2012 Order and Notice and its July 2013 Order Assessing Civil Penalties.
BBPLC is vigorously defending this action.
BBPLC and its former traders have filed a motion to dismiss the action for improper venue or, in the alternative, to transfer it to the SDNY, and a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.
In September 2013, BBPLC was contacted by the criminal division of the US Attorneys Office in the Southern District of New York and advised that such office is looking at the same conduct at issue in the FERC matter.
BDC Finance L. L. C. Background Information In October 2008, BDC Finance L. L. C. BDC filed a complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York NY Supreme Court alleging that BBPLC breached an ISDA Master Agreement and a Total Return Loan Swap Master Confirmation Agreement governing a total return swap transaction when it failed to transfer approximately $40m of alleged excess collateral in response to BDCs October 2008 demand Demand.
BDC asserts that under the Agreement BBPLC was not entitled to dispute the Demand before transferring the alleged excess collateral and that even if BBPLC was entitled to do so, it failed to dispute the Demand.
BDC demands damages totalling $297m plus attorneys fees, expenses, and prejudgement interest.
Status In August 2012, the NY Supreme Court granted partial summary judgement for BBPLC, ruling that BBPLC was entitled to dispute the Demand, before transferring the alleged excess collateral, but determining that a trial was required to determine whether BBPLC actually did so.
The parties cross-appealed to the Appellate Division of the NY Supreme Court Appellate Division.
In October 2013, the Appellate Division reversed the NY Supreme Courts grant of partial summary judgement to BBPLC, and instead granted BDCs motion for partial summary judgement, holding that BBPLC breached the Agreement.
The Appellate Division did not rule on the amount of BDCs damages, which has not yet been determined by the NY Supreme Court.
On 25 November 2013, BBPLC filed a motion with the Appellate Division for reargument or, in the alternative, for leave to appeal to the New York Court of Appeals.
In January 2014, the Appellate Division issued an order denying the motion for reargument and granting the motion for leave to appeal to the New York Court of Appeals.
In September 2011, BDCs investment advisor, BDCM Fund Adviser, L. L. C. and its parent company, Black Diamond Capital Holdings, L. L. C. also sued BBPLC and BCI in Connecticut state court for unspecified damages allegedly resulting from BBPLCs conduct relating to the Agreement, asserting claims for violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act and tortious interference with business and prospective business relations.
The parties have agreed to a stay of that case.
Interchange Investigations The Office of Fair Trading, as well as other competition authorities elsewhere in Europe, continues to investigate Visa and MasterCard credit and debit interchange rates.
BPLC receives interchange fees, as a card issuer, from providers of card acquiring services to merchants.
The key risks arising from the investigations comprise the potential for fines imposed by competition authorities, litigation and proposals for new legislation.
BPLC may be required to pay fines or damages and could be affected by legislation amending interchange rules.
Interest Rate Hedging Products See Note 28 Provisions.
Credit Default Swap CDS Antitrust Investigations Both the Commission and the DOJ-AD have commenced investigations in the CDS market in 2011 and 2009, respectively.
In July 2013 the Commission addressed a Statement of Objections to BBPLC and 12 other banks, Markit and ISDA.
The case relates to concerns that certain banks took collective action to delay and prevent the emergence of exchange traded credit derivative products.
If the Commission does reach a decision in this matter it has indicated that it intends to impose sanctions.
The Commissions sanctions can include fines.
The DOJ-ADs investigation is a civil investigation and relates to similar issues.
Proposed class actions alleging similar issues have also been filed in the US.
The timing of these cases is uncertain.

This agreement is the consequence of a long-running dispute between the US and Switzerland regarding tax obligations of US Related Accounts held in Swiss banks.
Barclays Bank Suisse SA and Barclays Bank PLC Geneva Branch are participating in the Programme, which requires a structured review of US accounts.
This review is ongoing and the outcome of the review will determine whether any agreement will be entered into or sanction applied to Barclays Bank Suisse SA and Barclays Bank PLC Geneva Branch.
The deadline for completion of the review is 30 April 2014.
Investigations into Certain Agreements The FCA has investigated certain agreements, including two advisory services agreements entered into by BBPLC with Qatar Holding LLC Qatar Holding in June and October 2008 respectively, and whether these may have related to BPLCs capital raisings in June and November 2008.
The FCA issued warning notices Warning Notices against BPLC and BBPLC in September 2013.
The existence of the advisory services agreement entered into in June 2008 was disclosed but the entry into the advisory services agreement in October 2008 and the fees payable under both agreements, which amount to a total of 322m payable over a period of five years, were not disclosed in the announcements or public documents relating to the capital raisings in June and November 2008.
While the Warning Notices consider that BPLC and BBPLC believed at the time that there should be at least some unspecified and undetermined value to be derived from the agreements, they state that the primary purpose of the agreements was not to obtain advisory services but to make additional payments, which would not be disclosed, for the Qatari participation in the capital raisings.
The Warning Notices conclude that BPLC and BBPLC were in breach of certain disclosure-related listing rules and BPLC was also in breach of Listing Principle 3 the requirement to act with integrity towards holders and potential holders of the companys shares.
In this regard, the FCA considers that BPLC and BBPLC acted recklessly.
The financial penalty in the Warning Notices against the group is 50m.
BPLC and BBPLC continue to contest the findings.
The FCA proceedings are now subject to a stay pending progress in an investigation by the SFOs Fraud Office into the same agreements.
The SFOs investigation is at an earlier stage and the Group has received and has continued to respond to requests for further information.
The DOJ and the SEC are undertaking an investigation into whether the Groups relationships with third parties who assist BPLC to win or retain business are compliant with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
They are also investigating the agreements referred to above including the two advisory services agreements.
The US Federal Reserve has requested to be kept informed.
General The outcomes of the matters disclosed in this note are difficult to predict.
The Group has not disclosed an estimate of the potential financial effect on the Group of contingent liabilities arising from these matters where it is not practicable to do so or, in cases where it is practicable, where disclosure could prejudice conduct of the matters.
Provisions have been recognised for those cases where the Group is able reliably to estimate probable losses.
The Group may incur significant expense in connection with these matters, regardless of the ultimate outcome: furthermore these matters could expose the Group to any of the following: substantial monetary damages and fines: other penalties and injunctive relief: potential for additional civil or private litigation: potential for criminal prosecution in certain circumstances: potential regulatory restrictions on the Groups business: and or a negative effect on the Groups reputation.
There is also a risk that such investigations or proceedings may give rise to changes in law or regulation as part of a wider response by relevant law makers and regulators.
Any of these risks, should they materialise, could have an adverse impact on the Groups operations, financial results and condition and prospects.
As mentioned above, the Group is subject to a NPA entered into with the DOJ in connection with the LIBOR investigations.
Under the NPA, the Group has agreed that, for a period of two years from 26 June 2012, it will, amongst other things, commit no US crime whatsoever and will comply with certain obligations to provide information to and co-operate with US authorities.
A breach of any of the NPA provisions could lead to prosecutions in relation to the Groups benchmark interest rate submissions and could have significant consequences for the Groups current and future business operations in the US.
The Group is engaged in various other legal, competition and regulatory matters both in the UK and a number of overseas jurisdictions.
It is subject to legal proceedings by and against the Group which arise in the ordinary course of business from time to time, including but not limited to disputes in relation to contracts, securities, debt collection, consumer credit, fraud, trusts, client assets, competition, data protection, money laundering, employment, environmental and other statutory and common law issues.
The Group is also subject to enquiries and examinations, requests for information, audits, investigations and legal and other proceedings by regulators, governmental and other public bodies in connection with but not limited to consumer protection measures, compliance with legislation and regulation, wholesale trading activity and other areas of banking and business activities in which the Group is or has been engaged.
At the present time, the Group does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these other matters not disclosed in this note to which it is a party to have a material adverse effect on its financial position.
The Group has not disclosed an estimate of the potential financial effect on the Group of contingent liabilities where it is not practicable to do so or, in cases where it is practicable, where disclosure could prejudice conduct of matters.
However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters, there can be no assurance that the outcome of a particular matter or matters will not be material to the Groups results of operations or cash flow for a particular period, depending on, among other things, the amount of the loss resulting from the matter s and the amount of income otherwise reported for the reporting period.

The decrease of 1,826m 2012: 657m increase principally reflected a 1,881m decrease in the fair value of interest rate swaps held for hedging purposes as interest rate forward curves increased, and 509m gains transferred to net profit, partly offset by a deferred tax credit of 553m.
Other reserves and treasury shares Other reserves represent the excess of the repurchase price over the nominal of redeemed ordinary and preference shares issues by the Group.
Treasury shares are deducted from shareholders equity within other reserves.
A transfer is made to retained earnings in line with the vesting of treasury shares held for the purposes of share based payments.

Performance costs recognised to the extent that the Group has a present obligation to its employees that can be measured reliably and are recognised over the period of service that employees are required to work to qualify for the services.
Deferred cash bonus awards and deferred share bonus awards are made to employees to incentivise performance over the vesting period.
To receive payment under an award, employees must provide service over the vesting period, typically three years from the grant date.
The period over which the expense for deferred cash and share bonus awards is recognised is based upon the common understanding between the employee and the Group and the terms and conditions of the award.
The Group considers that it is appropriate to recognise the awards over the period from the date of grant to the date that the awards vest as this is the period over which the employees understand that they must provide service in order to receive awards.
The table on page 99 details the relevant award dates, payment dates and the period in which the income statement charge arises for bonuses.
No expense has been recognised in 2013 for the deferred bonuses granted in March 2014, as they are dependent upon future performance rather than performance during 2013.
The accounting policies for share based payments and pensions and other post retirement benefits are under Note 36 and Note 37 respectively.

Redundancy and restructuring charges increased 619m to 687m, due to a number of Transform initiatives.
Performance costs increased 5% to 2,554m, reflecting a 10% increase to 957m in charges for current year cash and share bonuses and a 34% increase in commissions, commitments and other incentives to 450m.
This was offset by a 6% decrease in the charge for deferred bonuses to 1,147m.

Salaries reduced by 4% to 5,254m reflecting a moderately declining average headcount.
The post-retirement benefits charge decreased 27% to 612m, primarily reflecting scheme closures and benefit changes in the US and Spain, and lower interest cost for the UK Retirement Fund.
The post-retirement benefits charge includes 311m 2011: 318m: 2010: 297m in respect of defined contribution schemes and 301m 2011: 518m: 2010: 297m in respect of defined benefit schemes.
Performance costs reduced 4% to 2,425m, reflecting a 22% reduction in charges for current year cash and share bonuses and sales commissions, commitments and other incentives of 1,202m, partially offset by a 23% increase in the charge for deferred bonuses from prior years to 1,223m.
The Group incentive awards granted which exclude charges relating to prior year deferrals but include current year awards vesting in future years were down 16% to 2.2bn.
Investment Bank incentive awards were down 20% to 1.4bn.
Redundancy and restructuring cost decreased 77% to 68m due to significant restructuring in 2011.
The UK Government applied a bank payroll tax of 50% to all discretionary bonuses over 25,000 awarded to UK bank employees between 9 December 2009 and 5 April 2010.
The total bank payroll tax paid was 437m, of which 397m was recognised between 2009 and 2011.
For 2012, a charge of 34m has been recognised in relation to prior year deferrals, with the remaining 6m recognised in 2013.
The average total number of persons employed by the Group was 143,700 2011: 149,700.
Note 36: Share based payments Accounting for share based payments The Group applies IFRS 2 Share Based Payments in accounting for employee remuneration in the form of shares.
Employee incentives include awards in the form of shares and share options, as well as offering employees the opportunity to purchase shares on favourable terms.
The cost of the employee services received in respect of the shares or share options granted is recognised in the income statement over the period that employees provide services, generally the period in which the award is granted or notified and the vesting date of the shares or options.
The overall cost of the award is calculated using the number of shares and options expected to vest and the fair value of the shares or options at the date of grant.
The number of shares and options expected to vest takes into account the likelihood that performance and service conditions included in the terms of the awards will be met.
Failure to meet the non-vesting condition is treated as a cancellation, resulting in an acceleration of recognition of the cost of the employee services.
The fair value of shares is the market price ruling on the grant date, in some cases adjusted to reflect restrictions on transferability.
The fair value of options granted is determined using option pricing models to estimate the numbers of shares likely to vest.
These take into account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the share price over the life of the option and other relevant factors.
Market conditions that must be met in order for the award to vest are also reflected in the fair value of the award, as are any other non-vesting conditions such as continuing to make payments into a share based savings scheme.
The charge for the year arising from share based payment schemes was as follows: Charge for the year 2013 2012 2011 m m m Share Value Plan 576 610 634 Executive Share Award Scheme 72 115 101 Others 54 58 137 Total equity settled 702 783 872 Cash settled 25 35 34 Total share based payments 727 818 906 The terms of the main current plans are as follows: Share Value Plan SVP The SVP was introduced in March 2010 and approved by shareholders for Executive Director participation and use of new issue shares at the AGM in April 2011.
SVP awards are granted to participants in the form of a conditional right to receive Barclays PLC shares or provisional allocations of Barclays PLC shares which vest or are considered for release over a period of three years in equal annual tranches.
Participants do not pay to receive an award or to receive a release of shares.
The grantor may also make a dividend equivalent payment to participants on release of a SVP award.
SVP awards are also made to eligible employees for recruitment purposes under schedule 1 to the SVP.
All awards are subject to potential forfeiture in certain leaver scenarios.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 349 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 continued Note 36: Share based payments continued Executive Share Award Scheme ESAS ESAS awards were granted to participants in the form of a provisional allocation of Barclays PLC shares.
The total value of the ESAS award made to the employee was dependent upon the business unit, Group and individual employee performance.
The ESAS award must normally be held for at least three years.
Additional bonus shares are subsequently awarded to recipients of the provisional allocation and are considered for release upon achieving continued service for three and five years from the date of award.
ESAS awards were also made to eligible employees for recruitment purposes under JSAP Joiners Share Award Plan.
All awards are subject to potential forfeiture if the individual resigns and commences work with a competitor business.
Other schemes In addition to the above schemes, the Group operates a number of other schemes including schemes operated by and settled in the shares of subsidiary undertakings, none of which are individually or in aggregate material in relation to the charge for the year or the dilutive effect of outstanding share options.
Included within other schemes are Sharesave both UK and overseas, and the Barclays Long Term Incentive Plan: the latter was introduced and approved at the AGM in April 2011.

Note 37: Pensions and post retirement benefits Accounting for pensions and post retirement benefits The Group operates a number of pension schemes including defined contribution, defined benefit and post-employment benefit schemes.
Defined contribution schemes the Group recognises contributions due in respect of the accounting period in the income statement.
Any contributions unpaid at the balance sheet date are included as a liability.
Defined benefit schemes the Group recognises its obligation to members of the scheme at the period end, less the fair value of the scheme assets after applying the asset ceiling test.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income in the reporting period in which they occur.
Each schemes obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method on the assumptions set out in the note below.
Scheme assets are stated at fair value as at the period end.
IAS 19 revised has been adopted by the Group from the mandatory effective date of 1 January 2013 and application is retrospective.
The main change is that the Group recognises the liabilities or assets arising from its defined benefit pension schemes in full.
The deferral of actuarial gains and losses, which was an option applied by Barclays under the previous standard, is no longer permitted.
The expected return on assets assumption has also been replaced by an assumed return on assets in line with the discount rate.
Changes in pension scheme liabilities or assets remeasurements that do not arise from regular pension cost, interest on net defined benefit liabilities or assets, past service costs, settlements or contributions to the plan, are recognised in other comprehensive income.
For further details on the impacts of IAS 19 Revised restatements please refer to Note 46.
Remeasurements comprise experience adjustments differences between previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred and the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions.
Post-employment benefits the cost of providing health care benefits to retired employees is accrued as a liability in the financial statements over the period that the employees provide services to the Group, using a methodology similar to that for defined benefit pension schemes.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 351 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 continued Note 37: Pensions and post retirement benefits continued Pension schemes UK Retirement Fund UKRF The UKRF is the Groups main scheme, representing 91% of the Groups total retirement benefit obligations.
The UKRF was closed to new entrants on 1 October 2012, and comprises ten sections, the most significant of which are: Afterwork, which comprises a contributory cash balance defined benefit element, and a voluntary defined contribution element.
The cash balance element is accrued each year and revalued until Normal Retirement Age in line with the increase in Retail Price Index RPI up to a maximum of 5% pa. An investment related increase of up to 2% a year may also be added at Barclays discretion.
Between 1 October 2003 and 1 October 2012 the majority of new employees outside of Investment Bank were eligible to join this section.
The costs of ill-health retirements and death in service benefits for Afterwork members are borne by the UKRF.
The main risks that Barclays runs in relation to Afterwork are more limited than in traditional final salary pension plans, being the risk of needing to make additional contributions if pre-retirement investment returns are not sufficient to provide for the benefits.
The discretionary element of the benefit provides a partial buffer against this risk.
The Pension Investment Plan PIP : a defined contribution section providing benefits for Investment Bank employees from 1 July 2001 to 1 October 2012.
The 1964 Pension Scheme: most employees recruited before July 1997 built up benefits in this non-contributory defined benefit scheme in respect of service up to 31 March 2010.
Pensions were calculated by reference to service and pensionable salary.
From 1 April 2010 members became eligible to accrue future service benefits in either Afterwork or PIP.
The risks that Barclays runs in relation to the 1964 pension section are typical of final salary pension plans.
Principally that investment returns fall short of expectations, that inflation exceeds expectations, and that retirees live longer than expected.
Barclays Pension Savings Plan BPSP From 1 October 2012 a new UK pension scheme, the BPSP was established to satisfy Auto Enrolment legislation.
The BPSP is a defined contribution scheme Group Personal Pension providing benefits for all new Barclays UK hires from 1 October 2012, Investment Bank UK employees who were in PIP as at 1 October 2012, and also all UK employees who were not members of a pension scheme as at that date.
As a defined contribution plan, BPSP is not subject to the same investment return, inflation or longevity risks that defined benefit plans face.
Members benefits reflect contributions paid and the level of investment returns achieved.
Apart from the UKRF and the BPSP, Barclays operates a number of smaller pension and long-term employee benefits and post-retirement healthcare plans globally, the largest of which are the US and South African defined benefit schemes.
Many of the plans are funded, with assets backing the obligations held in separate legal vehicles such as trusts.
Others are operated on an unfunded basis.
The benefits provided the approach to funding and the legal basis of the plans reflect their local environments.
Governance The UKRF operates under trust law and is managed and administered on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed and Rules and all relevant legislation.
The Corporate Trustee is Barclays Pension Funds Trustees Limited, a private limited company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Barclays Bank PLC.
The Trustee is the legal owner of the assets of the UKRF which are held separately from the assets of the Group.
The Trustee Board comprises six Management Directors selected by Barclays, of whom three are independent Directors with no relationship with Barclays or the UKRF, plus three Member Nominated Directors selected from eligible active staff and pensioner members who apply for the role.
The BPSP is a Group Personal Pension arrangement which operates as a collection of personal pension plans.
Each personal pension plan is a direct contract between the employee and the BPSP provider Legal & General Assurance Society Limited, and is regulated by the FCA.
Similar principles of pension governance apply to the Groups other pension schemes, although different legislation covers overseas schemes where, in most cases, the Group has the power to determine the funding rate.
Amounts recognised The following tables include: amounts recognised in the income statement and an analysis of benefit obligations and scheme assets for all Group schemes.
The net position is reconciled to the assets and liabilities recognised on the balance sheet.
The tables include funded and unfunded post-retirement benefits.

Of the total benefit obligation of 27,568m 2012: 26,304m, 298m 2012: 326m was wholly unfunded.
As at 31 December 2013, the UKRFs IAS 19R scheme assets were in deficit versus obligations by 1,432m 2012: deficit of 798m.
The most significant driver for this change was an increase in long term RPI inflation which was partially offset by higher corporate bond yields and asset out performance.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Actuarial valuation of the schemes obligation is dependent upon a series of assumptions, below is a summary of the main financial and demographic assumptions adopted for UKRF.
Discount rate 4.46 4.31 Inflation rate 3.42 2.93 Rate of increase in salaries 2.92 3.43 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.32 2.88 Rate of increase for pensions in deferment 3.32 2.88 Afterwork revaluation rate 3.70 3.40 The UKRF discount rate assumption for 2013 is taken based on the single equivalent discount rate implied by the Towers Watson RATE Link model.
In 2012, an average rate derived from a Barclays AA corporate bond yield curve and the Towers Watson RATE link model was used.
The impact of this change on the UKRF Defined Benefit Obligation was a 0.4bn decrease with no impact on current year profit.
The change will affect future years profits and on an IAS 19 Revised basis will result in a 19m reduced charge to the 2014 income statement.
It is not possible to estimate the effects on profits after 2014.
Note a The scheme assets and benefit obligation for 31 December 2012 have been restated to bring the DC assets and obligations for active members of the South Africa pension plan within defined benefit accounting.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 353 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 continued Note 37: Pensions and post retirement benefits continued The UKRFs post-retirement mortality assumptions are based on a best estimate assumption derived from an analysis in 2011 of Barclays own post-retirement mortality experience which was carried out at the time of the latest completed triennial funding valuation, and taking account of the recent evidence from published mortality surveys.
An allowance has been made for future mortality improvements based on the 2010 core projection model published by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau subject to a long term trend of 1% pa on future improvements.
The table below shows how the assumed life expectancy at 60, for members of the UKRF, has varied over the last three years: Assumed life expectancy 2013 2012 2011 Life expectancy at 60 for current pensioners years Males 27.9 27.8 27.7 Females 29.0 28.9 28.8 Life expectancy at 60 for future pensioners currently aged 40 years Males 29.3 29.2 29.1 Females 30.6 30.5 30.4 Sensitivity analysis on actuarial assumptions The sensitivity analysis has been calculated by valuing the UKRF liabilities using the amended assumptions shown in the table below and keeping the remaining assumptions the same as disclosed in the UKRF assumptions table above, except in the case of the inflation sensitivity where other assumptions that depend on assumed inflation have also been amended correspondingly.
The difference between the recalculated liability figure and that stated in the balance sheet reconciliation table above is the figure shown.
Change in key assumptions Impact on UKRF defined benefit obligation Decrease Decrease increase increase % bn 0.5% increase in discount rate 9.2 2.3 0.5% increase in assumed price inflation 7.8 2.0 1 year increase to life expectancy at 60 3.0 0.8 The weighted average duration of the benefit payments reflected in the defined benefit obligation for the UKRF is 20 years.
Assets A long term investment strategy has been set for the UKRF, with its asset allocation comprising a mixture of equities, bonds, property and other appropriate assets.
This recognises that different asset classes are likely to produce different long term returns and some asset classes may be more volatile than others.
The long term investment strategy ensures, amongst other aims, that investments are adequately diversified.
Asset managers are permitted some flexibility to vary the asset allocation from the long term investment strategy within control ranges agreed with the Trustee from time to time.
The UKRF also employs derivative instruments, where appropriate, to achieve a desired exposure or return, or to match assets more closely to liabilities.
The value of assets shown reflects the actual physical assets held by the scheme, with any derivative holdings reflected on a mark to market basis.

The UKRF also invests in investment vehicles which may hold shares or debt issued by the Barclays Group.
Approximately a third of the UKRF assets are invested in liability driven investment strategies: primarily UK gilts as well as interest rate and inflation swaps.
These are used to better match the assets to its liabilities.
The swaps are used to reduce the schemes inflation and duration risks against its liabilities.
Funding The triennial funding valuation of the UKRF is currently underway with an effective date of 30 September 2013.
Contribution requirements, including any deficit recovery plans, will be agreed between the Bank and Trustee by the end of 2014.
The previous triennial funding valuation at 30 September 2010 showed a deficit of 5.0bn.
Under the agreed recovery plan, deficit contributions of 1.8bn were paid to the fund in December 2011 and a further 0.5bn paid in April 2012.
Further deficit contributions are payable from 2017 to 2021 starting at 0.7bn in 2017 and increasing by approximately 3.5% per annum until 2021.
These deficit contributions are in addition to the regular contributions to meet the Groups share of the cost of benefits accruing over each year.
In non-valuation years the Scheme Actuary prepares an annual update of the funding position.
The latest annual update was carried out as at 30 September 2012 and showed a deficit of 3.6bn.
The contributions paid to the UKRF are agreed between Barclays and the Trustee every three years.
Contributions paid with respect to the UKRF were as follows: Contributions paid m 2013 238 2012 742 2011 2,128 The Groups expected contribution to the UKRF in 2014 is 218m.
In addition the expected contributions to UK defined contribution schemes is 46m to the UKRF and 103m to the BPSP.
For non-UK schemes the expected contributions in 2014 are 107m.

Detail is also given on securitisation transactions the Group has entered into and arrangements that are held off-balance sheet.
Note 38: Principal Subsidiaries Barclays applies IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
The consolidated financial statements combine the financial statements of Barclays PLC and all of its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control.
Under IFRS 10, this is when the Group is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement in the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The Group reassesses whether it controls an entity if facts and circumstances indicate that there have been changes to its power, its rights to variable returns or its ability to use its power to affect the amount of its returns.
Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions if they occur after control has been obtained and they do not result in loss of control.
Barclays adopted IFRS 10 from 1 January 2013.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Note 38: Principal Subsidiaries continued Significant judgements and assumptions used to determine the scope of the consolidation Determining whether the Group has control of an entity is generally straightforward based on ownership of the majority of the voting capital.
However, in certain instances this determination will involve significant judgment, particularly in the case of structured entities where voting rights are often not the determining factor in decisions over the relevant activities.
This judgment may involve assessing the purpose and design of the entity.
It will also often be necessary to consider whether the Group, or another involved party with power over the relevant activities, is acting as a principal in its own right or as an agent on behalf of others.
There is also often considerable judgment involved in the ongoing assessment of control over structured entities.
In this regard, where market conditions have deteriorated such that the other investors exposures to the structures variable returns have been substantively eliminated, the Group may conclude that the managers of the structured entity are acting as its agent and therefore will consolidate the structured entity.
An interest in equity voting rights exceeding 50% would typically indicate that the Group has control of an entity.
However certain entities are excluded from consolidation because the Group does not have exposure to their variable returns.
These entities are managed by external counterparties and consequently are not controlled by the Group.
Where appropriate, interests relating to these entities are included in Note 39 Structured Entities.
Percentage of voting Equity shareholders Retained profit for the Country of registration or incorporation Company Name rights held % funds m year m UK Fitzroy Finance Limited 100 Cayman Islands Palomino Limited 100 1 Significant restrictions As is typical for a Group of its size and international scope, there are restrictions on the ability of Barclays PLC to obtain distributions of capital, access the assets or repay the liabilities of members of its group due to the statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements of its subsidiaries and due to the protective rights of non-controlling interests.
Regulatory requirements Subsidiary companies with assets and liabilities before intercompany eliminations of 1,797bn 2012: 1,963bn and 1,727bn 2012: 1,900bn respectively are subject to prudential regulation and regulatory capital requirements in the countries in which they are regulated.
These require entities to maintain minimum capital, leverage and exposure ratios restricting the ability of these entities to make distributions of cash or other assets to the parent company, Barclays PLC.
In order to meet capital requirements, subsidiaries may hold certain equity accounted and debt accounted issued financial instruments and non-equity instruments such as Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments and other forms of subordinated liabilities.
See the non-controlling interests Note 34 and the subordinated liabilities Note 31 for particulars of these instruments.
These instruments may be subject to cancellation clauses or preference share restrictions that would limit the ability of the entity to repatriate the capital on a timely basis.
Liquidity requirements Regulated subsidiaries of the Group are required to maintain liquidity pools to meet PRA and local regulatory requirements.
The main subsidiaries affected are Barclays Bank PLC, Absa Bank Limited and Barclays Capital Inc. which must maintain daily compliance with the regulatory minimum.
See pages 208 to 224 for further details of liquidity requirements, including those of our significant subsidiaries.
Statutory requirements The Groups subsidiaries are subject to statutory requirements not to make distributions of capital and unrealised profits and generally to maintain solvency.
These requirements restrict the ability of subsidiaries to make remittances of dividends to Barclays PLC, the ultimate parent, except in the event of a legal capital reduction or liquidation.
In most cases the regulatory restrictions referred to above exceed the statutory restrictions.
As at 31 December 2013, the non-distributable reserves of Barclays Bank PLC, including share capital and other equity instruments were 23,571m 2012: 18,608m.
Contractual requirements Asset encumbrance The Group uses its financial assets to raise finance in the form of securitisations and through the liquidity schemes of central banks.
Once encumbered, the assets are not available for transfer around the Group.
The assets typically affected are disclosed in Note 42 Assets Pledged.
Assets held by consolidated structured entities 690m of assets included in the Groups balance sheet relate to consolidated investment funds and are held to pay return and principal to the holders of units in the funds.
The assets held in these funds cannot be transferred to other members of the Group.
Other restrictions The Group is required to maintain balances with central banks and other regulatory authorities and these amounted to 4,722m as at 31 December 2013 2012: 5,169m.
Barclays Africa Group Limited assets are subject to exchange control regulation determined by the South African Reserve Bank SARB.
Special dividends and loans in lieu of dividends cannot be transferred without SARB approval.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 357 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 continued Note 39: Structured Entities A structured entity is an entity in which voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding control.
Structured entities are generally created to achieve a narrow and well defined objective with restrictions around their ongoing activities.
Depending on the Groups power over the activities of the entity and its exposure to and ability to influence its own returns, it may consolidate the entity.
In other cases it may sponsor or have exposure to such an entity but not consolidate it.
Consolidated Structured Entities The Group has contractual arrangements which may require it to provide financial support to the following types of consolidated structured entities: Securitisation vehicles The Group uses securitisation as a source of financing and a means of risk transfer.
Refer to Note 41 for further detail.
The Group provides liquidity facilities to entities and provides interest rate and foreign currency swaps to enable the entities to make certain payments when due.
At 31 December 2013, there were outstanding loan commitments to these entities totalling 195m.
Commercial paper CP and medium term note conduits The Group provided 8.1bn in undrawn contractual backstop liquidity facilities to its own sponsored CP conduits.
Fund management entities Barclays has contractually guaranteed the performance of certain cash investments in a number of managed investment funds which have resulted in their consolidation.
As at 31 December 2013, the notional value of the guarantee was 991m.
Covered bonds During the reporting period, the Group provided non-contractual capital contributions totalling 1.3bn to Barclays Covered Bonds Limited Liability Partnership as a result of regulatory requirements to pre fund upcoming contractual covered bond redemptions.
It will continue to provide such support in 2014.
Employee benefit trusts The Group provides capital contributions to employee share trusts to enable them to meet their obligations to employees under share-based payment plans.
Unconsolidated Structured Entities in which the Group has an interest The business activities within the Group where structured entities are used principally include multi-seller conduit programmes, asset securitisations, and asset management.
The later sections provide quantitative information on the Groups involvements.
For a description of these activities see the Glossary.
An interest in a structured entity is any form of contractual or non-contractual involvement which creates variability in returns arising from the performance of the entity for the Group.
Such interests include holdings of debt or equity securities, derivatives that transfer financial risks from the entity to the Group, lending, loan commitments, financial guarantees and investment management agreements.
Interest rate swaps, foreign exchange derivatives that are not complex and which expose the Group to insignificant credit risk by being senior in the payment waterfall of a securitisation and derivatives that are determined to introduce risk or variability to a structured entity are not considered to be an interest in an entity and have been excluded from the disclosures below.
The nature and extent of the Groups interests in structured entities is summarised below: Summary of interests in unconsolidated structured entities Short term Secured traded Traded Other financing interests derivatives interests Total Assets m m m m m Trading portfolio assets 11,272 5,111 16,383 Financial assets designated at fair value 1,035 1,035 Derivative financial instruments 3,758 1,464 5,222 Available for sale investments 2,073 2,073 Loans and advances to banks 4,143 4,143 Loans and advances to customers 24,971 24,971 Reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending 51,112 51,112 Other assets 35 35 Total assets 51,112 11,272 3,758 38,832 104,974 Liabilities Derivative financial instruments 4,895 1,457 6,352 Secured financing arrangements, short term traded interests and traded derivatives are typically managed under market risk described in page 190 which includes an indication on the change of risk measures compared to last year.
For this reason, the total assets of these entities are not considered meaningful for the purposes of understanding the related risks and so have not been presented.
Other interest materially includes a portfolio under exit quadrant which is being managed down and conduits and corporate lending where the interest is driven by normal customer demand.
358 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 barclays.
com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Note 39: Structured Entities continued Secured financing The Group routinely enters into reverse repurchase contracts, stock borrowing and similar arrangements on normal commercial terms where the counterparty to the arrangement is a structured entity.
Due to the nature of these arrangements, especially the transfer of collateral and on-going margining, the Group is minimally exposed to the performance of the structured entity counterparty.
A description of these transactions is included in Note 23.
Short term traded interests The Group buys and sells interests in structured entities as part of its trading activities, for example, retail mortgage backed securities, collateralised debt obligations and similar interests.
Such interests are typically held individually or as part of a larger portfolio for no more than 90 days.
In such cases, the Group typically has no other involvement with the structured entity other than the securities it holds as part of trading activities and its maximum exposure to loss is restricted to the carrying value of the asset.
Description of these transactions is included in Note 13.
As at 31 December 2013, the fair value of the Groups interests in structured entities in the trading portfolio, included in trading portfolio assets in the Group balance sheet, were as follows: Type of security and nature of entity Asset securitisations Other Total m m m Debt securities 10,177 345 10,522 Equity securities 5 87 92 Traded loans 538 538 Other assets 120 120 Total 10,182 1,090 11,272 Traded derivatives The Group enters into a variety of derivative contracts with structured entities which reference market risk variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and credit indices amongst other things.
Description of the type of derivatives and the risk management practices are detailed in Note 15.
The risk of loss may be mitigated through on-going margining requirements as well as a right to cash flows from entity which are senior in the payment waterfall.
Such margining requirements are consistent with market practice for many derivative arrangements and in line with the Groups normal credit policies.
The main derivative types which are considered interests in structured entities are as follows.
Notional amounts of the derivative arrangements have been provided as a better indication of the risks associated with these instruments rather than the size of the structured entities to which the Group has exposure: Fair value and notional amount Asset management Asset securitisations Others Total Notional Notional Notional Notional contract contract contract contract Type of derivative amount Assets Liabilities amount Assets Liabilities amount Assets Liabilities amount Assets Liabilities and nature of entity m m m m m m m m m m m m Credit default swaps Index based 54,519 1,075 1,353 1,286 160 328 55,805 1,235 1,681 Entity specific 18,448 408 203 11 18 28 18,459 426 231 Total 72,967 1,483 1,556 1,297 178 356 74,264 1,661 1,912 Balance guaranteed swaps 38,349 231 493 38,349 231 493 Total return swaps 8,044 241 470 2 8,046 241 470 Commodity 10,341 518 892 3,698 47 335 14,039 565 1,227 Equity swaps 28,523 962 792 98 28,523 1,060 792 Other derivative products 606 1 606 1 Total 119,875 3,204 3,710 40,252 409 850 3,700 145 335 163,827 3,758 4,895 Derivative transactions require the counterparty to provide cash or other collateral under margining agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk.
Included above are, 752m derivative assets and 1,271 m derivative liability with a notional value of 41,716m which are cleared derivative type arrangements.
These are transactions where the Group enters into a contract with an exchange on behalf of a structured entity client and holds an opposite position with it.
The Group is exposed to settlement risk only on these derivatives which is mitigated through daily margining.
Except for credit default swaps where the maximum exposure to loss is the swap notional amount, it is not possible to estimate the maximum exposure to loss in respect of derivative positions as the fair value of derivatives is subject to changes in market rates of interest, exchange rates and credit indices which by their nature are uncertain.
In addition, the Groups losses would be subject to mitigating action under its traded market risk and credit risk policies that require the counterparty provide collateral in cash or other assets on a daily basis in most cases.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 359 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 continued Note 39: Structured Entities continued The contracts that most expose the Group to the risk of loss arising from the performance of the structured entity are as follows: Credit default swaps entity specific In addition to index based credit default swaps, the Group provides tailored credit risk protection to structured entities where its loss exposure is based on the actual performance of the structured entity counterparty and the assets that it holds.
The underlying for these exposures are mainly related to corporate and commercial loans, corporate bonds and retail mortgages.
Balance guaranteed swaps These are single or cross-currency swaps where the notional amount of the arrangement is not defined at trade inception and instead tracks the balance of a reference pool of collateral or securities.
The swap exchanges the cash flows of the referenced collateral into those of the issued debt securities which pay a different coupon and in a different currency.
Swaps may be super-senior in the capital structure or pari-passu with the issued notes.
The Group holds debt securities issued by the entities as a hedge against the credit risk of the balance guaranteed swaps.
At 31 December 2013 1,457m of such bonds were held within the trading portfolio asset.
Other interests in unconsolidated structured entities The Groups interests in structured entities not held for the purposes of short term trading activities are set out below, summarised by the purpose of the entities and limited to significant categories, based on maximum exposure to loss.

Exposure to loss is mitigated through collateral, financial guarantees, the availability of netting and credit protection held.
Structured Credit Portfolio The portfolio forms a subset of the exit quadrant disclosed on page 181 which are being managed down.
It comprises interests in debt securities issued by securitisation vehicles, mainly Collateralised Loan Obligations CLOs, Collateralised Debt Obligations CDOs, Retail and Commercial Mortgage Backed Securitisation structures RMBSs and CMBSs, and drawn and undrawn loan facilities to these entities.
In some cases, the securities are wrapped with credit protection from a monoline insurer, which transfers the credit risk to the monoline.
The entities are wholly debt financed through the issuance of tranches of debt securities or through direct funding, such as the loan facilities provided by the Group.
As the underlying assets of the entities amortise and pay down, the debt securities issued by the entities are repaid in order of seniority.
Where the entities experience significant credit deterioration, debt securities may be written off or cancelled in reverse order of seniority.
The creditworthiness of the Groups funded exposures within structured credit portfolio is presented below along with the Groups unfunded commitments.
Funded exposures are classified as either debt securities or loans and advances.
Refer to Note 20 for an additional description of the loans and advances.

The Groups exposure to loss depends on the level of subordination of the interest which indicates the extent to which other parties are obliged to absorb credit losses before the Group.
This is summarised in the table below.

The Groups income from these entities comprises trading income largely gains and losses on changes in the fair value and interest earned on bonds on items classified as held for trading and interest income on interests classified as loans and receivables.
During the period, the Group recorded an overall fair value gain of 639m on debt securities.
Impairment losses recorded on loans and advances were immaterial during the period.
The fair value of the Groups interests in monoline wrapped CLOs and CDOs is influenced by the protection directly provided to the structured entities by monoline insurers in addition to the value of the collateral held by the entities.
The protection provided to the entities by the monoline insurers is in the form of a CDS, however the ability of the monolines to make payments is uncertain, which is reflected in the valuation of the Groups interests in the monoline wrapped CLOs and CDOs.
Multi-seller conduit programmes The conduits engage in providing financing to various clients and hold whole or partial interests in pools of receivables or similar obligations.
These instruments are protected from loss through , seller guarantees, or other credit enhancements provided to the conduits.
The Groups off-balance sheet exposure included in the table above represents liquidity facilities that are provided to the conduits for the benefit of the holders of the commercial paper issued by the conduits and will only be drawn where the conduits are unable to access the commercial paper market.
If these facilities are drawn, the Group is protected from loss through , seller guarantees, or other credit enhancements provided to the conduits.
The Group earns income from fees received on the liquidity facility and the letter of credit provided to the conduits.
There were no impairment losses on this lending in the year.
Lending The portfolio includes lending provided by the Group to unconsolidated structured entities in the normal course of its lending business to earn income in the form of interest and lending fees.
All loans are subject to the Groups credit sanctioning process.
Collateral arrangements are specific to the circumstances of each loan.
During the period the Group incurred an impairment of 20m against such facilities.
The main types of lending are as follows.
Property loans The Group has provided 4bn of funding loans to bankruptcy remote structured entities to either invest or develop properties.
The loans are typically secured against the properties.
Depending upon the circumstances the Group may require the sponsors of the entities to provide additional funding which is subordinate to the Groups.
Additional guarantees and collateral may be sought from the sponsor on a case-by-case basis.
Facilities to financial institutions The Group has provided loans to structured entities owned by third party financial institutions to facilitate their funding requirements.
There is credit mitigation in place which significantly reduces the credit exposure faced by the Group against these entities.
Structured lending to individuals The Group has provided 2bn of loans to structured entities which have been created by an individual to hold one or more assets.
The Group is the sole lender to these entities and has full recourse to the assets of the structured entity, and is usually further collateralised by guarantees from the sponsor or equity holders of the structured entity.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 361 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 continued Note 39: Structured Entities continued Project finance transactions The Group has provided 2bn to entities whose operations are limited to financing or funding the acquisition of specific assets such as schools, hospitals, roads and renewable energy projects under the Private Finance Initiative PFI.
Equity contributions are typically required from the sponsor or parent at inception of the arrangement which are required to absorb losses before the Group.
The Group may also require the sponsor to provide liquid collateral where there is no recourse or reliance upon the parent or sponsor beyond its initial equity contribution.
The Group typically obtains fixed and floating charges over assets, charges over shares in the structured entity, assignment rights over key contracts, step-in rights, and performance guarantees.
Capital equipment loans The Group has provided 1bn of funding loans to bankruptcy remote structured entities to enable them to purchase capital equipment for parent companies and are supported by government export guarantees.
The loans are also fully collateralised by the underlying assets and repayments of principal and interest are met through lease contracts with the operating company parent of the entity for its use of the purchased assets.
Due to these guarantees and the availability of collateral, the loans are considered low risk.
During the period, Barclays incurred no credit losses on such facilities.
Mortgage backed securities This represents a portfolio of floating rate notes mainly mortgage backed security positions used as an economic hedge of interest rate risk under the Groups structural hedging programme.
All notes are investment grade.
Investment funds and trusts In the course of its fund management activities, the Group establishes pooled investment funds that comprise portfolio of investments of various kinds, tailored to meet certain investors requirements.
The Groups interest in funds is generally restricted to a fund management fee, the value of which is generally based on the performance of the fund.
The Group acts as trustee to a number of trusts established by or on behalf of its clients.
The purpose of the trusts, which meet the definition of structured entities, is to hold assets on behalf of beneficiaries.
The Groups interest in trusts is generally restricted to unpaid fees which, depending on the trust, may be fixed or based on the value of the trust assets.
During the year ended 31 December 2013, fees earned were 206m and unpaid fees were 21m.
Barclays has no other risk exposure to the trusts.
Other This includes 1,457m of derivative transactions with structured entities where the market risk is materially hedged with corresponding derivative contracts.
Financial support provided or to be provided to unconsolidated structured entities The Group has not provided any non-contractual financial support during the period and does not anticipate providing non-contractual support to unconsolidated structured entities in the future.
Sponsored unconsolidated structured entities In addition to the unconsolidated structured entities in which the Group has an interest, it also sponsors structured entities in which it has no interest.
For the purposes of these disclosures, the Group sponsors an entity when: It is the majority user of the entity: Its name appears in the name of the entity or on the products issued by the entity: It provides implicit or explicit guarantees of the entitys performances: or It led the formation of the entity.
Income from sponsored unconsolidated structured entities comprised of a 4m interest earned from bonds recognised within trading income.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Note 40: Investments in associates and joint ventures Accounting for associates and joint ventures Barclays applies IAS 28 Investments in Associates and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements.
Associates are entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies.
Generally the Group holds more than 20%, but less than 50%, of their voting shares.
Joint ventures are joint arrangements which have joint control and have rights to the net assets of the entity.
The Groups investments in associates and joint ventures are initially recorded at cost and increased or decreased each year by the Groups share of the post acquisition profit or loss.
The Group ceases to recognise its share of the losses of equity accounted associates when its share of the net assets and amounts due from the entity have been written off in full, unless it has a contractual or constructive obligation to make good its share of the losses.
In some cases, investments in these entities may be held at fair value through profit or loss, for example, those held by private equity businesses.
There are no individually significant investments in joint ventures or associates held by Barclays.
There are certain entities that are considered strategic to the banking operations of the Group supporting payment services.

In addition, the Group has made commitments to finance or otherwise provide resources to its joint ventures and associates of 74m 2012: 87m.
Note 41: Securitisations Accounting for securitisations The Group uses securitisations as a source of finance and a means of risk transfer.
Such transactions generally result in the transfer of contractual cash flows from portfolios of financial assets to holders of issued debt securities.
Securitisations may, depending on the individual arrangement, result in continued recognition of the securitised assets and the recognition of the debt securities issued in the transaction: lead to partial continued recognition of the assets to the extent of the Groups continuing involvement in those assets or to derecognition of the assets and the separate recognition, as assets or liabilities, of any rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer.
Full derecognition only occurs when the Group transfers both its contractual right to receive cash flows from the financial assets, or retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to another party without material delay or reinvestment, and also transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, including credit risk, prepayment risk and interest rate risk.
In the course of its normal banking activities, the Group makes transfers of financial assets, either legally where legal rights to the cash flows from the asset are passed to the counterparty or beneficial where the Group retains the rights to the cash flows but assumes a responsibility to transfer them to the counterparty.
Depending on the nature of the transaction, this may result in derecognition of the assets in their entirety, partial derecognition or no derecognition of the assets subject to the transfer.
Full derecognition only occurs when the Group transfers both its contractual right to receive cash flows from the financial assets or retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to another party without material delay or reinvestment and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, including credit risk, prepayment risk and interest rate risk.
When an asset is transferred, in some circumstances, the Group may retain an interest in it continuing involvement requiring the Group to repurchase it in certain circumstances for other than its fair value on that date.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 363 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 continued Note 41: Securitisations continued A summary of the main transactions, and the assets and liabilities and the financial risks arising from these transactions, is set out below: Transfers of financial assets that do not result in derecognition Securitisations The Group was party to securitisation transactions involving its residential mortgage loans, business loans and credit card balances.
In addition, the Group acts as a conduit for commercial paper, whereby it acquires static pools of residential mortgage loans from other lending institutions for securitisation transactions.
In these transactions, the assets, interests in the assets, or beneficial interests in the cash flows arising from the assets, are transferred to a special purpose entity, which then issues interest bearing debt securities to third-party investors.
Securitisations may, depending on the individual arrangement, result in continued recognition of the securitised assets and the recognition of the debt securities issued in the transaction.
Partial continued recognition of the assets to the extent of the Groups continuing involvement in those assets can also occur or derecognition of the assets and the separate recognition, as assets or liabilities, of any rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer.
The following table shows the carrying amount of securitised assets that have not resulted in full derecognition, together with the associated liabilities, for each category of asset on the balance sheet: 2013 2012 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Carrying Fair Carrying Fair Carrying Carrying amount Value amount Value amount amount m m m m m m Loans and advances to customers Residential mortgage loans 3,930 3,658 3,545 3,335 5,545 5,066 Credit cards, unsecured and other retail lending 6,563 6,639 5,017 5,038 6,944 5,519 Corporate loans 331 285 294 286 944 809 Total 10,824 10,582 8,856 8,659 13,433 11,394 Assets designated at fair value through profit or loss Retained interest in residential mortgage loans 68 n a n a 12 Balances included within loans and advances to customers represent securitisations where substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset have been retained by the Group.
The relationship between the transferred assets and the associated liabilities is that holders of notes may only look to cash flows from the securitised assets for payments of principal and interest due to them under the terms of their notes, although the contractual terms of their notes may be different to the maturity and interest of the transferred assets.
Retained interests in residential mortgage loans are securities which represent a continuing exposure to the prepayment and credit risk in the underlying securitised assets.
The carrying amount of the loans before transfer was 124m 2012: 16m.
The retained interest is initially recorded as an allocation of the original carrying amount based on the relative fair values of the portion derecognised and the portion retained.
For transfers of assets in relation to repurchase agreements, see Notes 23 and 42.
Continuing involvement in financial assets that have been derecognised In some cases, the Group may have transferred a financial asset in its entirety but may have continuing involvement in it.
This arises in asset securitisations where loans and asset backed securities were derecognised as a result of the Groups involvement with CLOs, CDOs, RMBS and CMBS.
Continuing involvement largely arises from providing financing into these structures in the form of retained notes, which do not bear first losses.
The table below shows the potential financial implications of such continuing involvement: Continuing involvement as at Gain loss from 31 December 2013 continuing involvement For the Cumulative Maximum year ended to Carrying exposure to 31 December 31 December amount Fair value loss 2013 2013 Type of transfer m m m m m CLO and other assets 1,911 1,883 1,911 46 712 ABS CDO Super Senior US sub-prime and Alt-A 398 377 398 3 1,221 Commercial mortgage backed securities 241 241 241 3 33 Total 2,550 2,501 2,550 52 1,966 364 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 barclays.

Note 46: Transition Notes Changes in accounting policies, comparability and other adjustments IAS 19 revised Employee Benefits In June 2011, the IASB issued revisions to IAS 19 Employee Benefits IAS 19R or the revised standard.
During 2013, Barclays adopted IAS 19R retrospectively in accordance with the transitional provisions set out in the standard.
The revised standard introduces changes to the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of post-employment benefits.
IAS 19R eliminates the corridor method, under which the recognition of actuarial gains and losses was deferred.
Instead, the full defined benefit obligation net of plan assets is now recorded on the balance sheet, with changes resulting from remeasurements recognised immediately in other comprehensive income.
The measurement of the defined benefit obligation takes into account risk sharing features, such as those within our Swiss pension plan.
In addition, IAS 19R requires net interest expense income to be calculated as the product of the net defined benefit liability asset and the discount rate as determined at the beginning of the year.
The effect of this is to remove the previous concept of recognising an expected return on plan assets.
IFRS 10 Consolidation of Financial Statements In May 2011, the IASB issued IFRS 10 Consolidation of Financial Statements.
IFRS 10 establishes principles for the presentation and preparation of consolidated financial statements when an entity controls one or more other entities.
IFRS 10 replaces the consolidation requirements in SIC-12 ConsolidationSpecial Purpose Entities and IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements.
IFRS 10 builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated financial statements of the parent company.
142 entities were impacted by IFRS10 and were largely within Investment Bank and Wealth divisions.
79 entities were consolidated while 63 entities were deconsolidated.
Movement between the published and restated income statements for 31 December 2011 In the income statement for the year ending 2011, the adoption of the IAS 19 revised standard resulted in staff costs increasing by 109m, tax decreasing by 26m and the profit before tax reducing by 83m.
The movement in the staff cost relates to the replacement of expected return on assets with net interest income expense using the scheme discount rate resulting in further expense of 164m.
This is partially offset by amortisation of unrecognised losses 55m no longer being recognised due to the removal of the corridor approach, with all actuarial losses recognised immediately on the balance sheet.
In addition, the adoption of the IAS 19 revised standard resulted in the basic earnings per share decreasing 0.6p from 23.5p to 22.9p and the diluted earnings per share decreasing 0.7p from 22.6p to 21.9p.

The movement in the staff cost relates to the replacement of expected return on assets with net interest income expense using the scheme discount rate resulting in further expense of 53m.
This is partially offset by amortisation of unrecognised losses 31m no longer being recognised due to the removal of the corridor approach, with all actuarial losses recognised immediately on the balance sheet.
In addition, the adoption of the IAS 19 revised and IFRS 10 standards resulted in the basic loss per share decreasing by 3.2p from 8.0 p to 4.8 p and the diluted loss per share also decreasing by 3.2p from 8.0 p to 4.8 p. Note a The Group has also realigned outsourcing costs from administration and general expenses to staff costs in order to more appropriately reflect the nature and internal management of these costs.
The net effect of these movements is to reduce administration and general expenses and increase staff costs by 837m.

The movement in the staff cost relates to the replacement of expected return on assets with net interest income expense using the scheme discount rate resulting in a further expense of 113m.
This is partially offset by amortisation of unrecognised losses 91m no longer being recognised due to the removal of the corridor approach, with all actuarial losses recognised immediately on the balance sheet.
In addition, the adoption of the IAS 19 revised standard resulted in the basic earnings per share decreasing 0.1p to 3.8p from 3.9p and the diluted earnings per share decreasing 0.1p to 3.7p from 3.8p.
Movement between the published and restated statement of comprehensive income for 31 December 2011 In the statement of comprehensive income for the year ending 2012, the adoption of the IAS 19 revised standard resulted in the other comprehensive income increasing by 748m.
This is mainly attributable to the movement which relates to actuarial losses on scheme assets and liabilities no longer being deferred.
Movement between the published and restated statement of comprehensive income for 31 December 2012 In the statement of comprehensive income for the year ending 2012, the adoption of the IAS 19 revised and IFRS 10 standards resulted in the other comprehensive loss increasing by 787m.
A major part of the reduction of 1,235m can be attributed to the IAS 19 revised standard which impacted the retirement benefit remeasurements.
The movement is as a result of actuarial losses on scheme assets and liabilities no longer being deferred.
Note a The Group has also realigned outsourcing costs from administration and general expenses to staff costs in order to more appropriately reflect the nature and internal management of these costs.
The net effect of these movements is to reduce administration and general expenses and increase staff costs by 997m.
