NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2013 Devro plc the company is a public limited company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in Scotland.
The address of its registered office is Moodiesburn, Chryston, Glasgow G69 0JE.
Accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with European Union endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, IFRS IC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial instruments and pension scheme assets.
The groups reporting currency is sterling and unless otherwise stated the financial statements are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million.
Going concern The groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 37, along with the financial position of the group, its debt levels and borrowing facilities.
In addition, Note 23 includes the groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the company and the group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Key factors to support the going concern basis of accounting include: As at 31 December 2013 the group was operating comfortably within the 61m revolving bank facilities negotiated in June 2013 and due to expire in September 2016.
In order to fund the planned investment in China, additional debt funding will be sought in the first half of 2014.
Critical estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting year.
Although these estimates are based on managements best assessments of amounts, events or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The key uncertainties that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are the carrying value of inventory, accounting for the groups development programme, measurement of pension obligations and tax.
Carrying value of inventory Determining the carrying value of inventory involves a degree of judgement as to whether the group will be able to sell the stock it has on hand for more than the value recorded in the balance sheet, which is typically the cost of production.
The group adopts a policy of providing for inventory when it reaches a certain age, and also for any inventory where there are specific concerns.
These estimated provisions are based on managements best assessments of future sales volumes and the likely selling prices, and actual results may differ from these estimates.
Development programme The two year development programme announced in 2013, to construct new manufacturing plants in the USA and China, requires judgement including whether related costs should be expensed as incurred or capitalised, and whether any existing assets should be impaired or their useful lives amended.
Where amounts are expensed, judgement is also required to determine whether these amounts should be disclosed as exceptional items, taking account of their nature and size, and in particular whether they are incremental to normal operations.
An analysis of exceptional items recognised is included in Notes 4 and 5.
Pension obligations The cost of defined benefit pension schemes is determined using actuarial valuations.
The actuarial valuation involves certain key assumptions and complex calculations.
The key assumptions include discount rates, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases.
Due to the long-term nature of these schemes, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty.
An analysis of the sensitivity of the pension obligation to changes in key assumptions is provided based on movements in key variables that could reasonably occur.
Further details are provided in Note 25.
Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 75 I 2 3 4 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2013 continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Tax The groups tax charge is based on the profit for the year and tax rates effective at the balance sheet date.
In addition to corporation tax, the group is subject to indirect taxes such as sales and employment taxes across the tax jurisdictions in the countries in which it operates.
The varying nature and complexity of these tax laws requires the group to review its tax positions and make appropriate adjustments at the balance sheet date.
In addition the recognition of deferred tax assets is dependent upon an estimation of future taxable profits that will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
In the event that actual taxable profits are different, such differences may impact the carrying value of such deferred tax assets in future years.
Further details are provided in Notes 10 and 24.
Changes in accounting policies and disclosures a New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations effective in 2013 The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations became mandatory for the first time during the financial year beginning 1 January 2013.
With the exception of IAS 19 revised and IAS 1 amendment they either were not relevant for the group or had no material impact on the financial statements of the group: Effective date IFRS 11 Joint arrangements 1 January 2013 IFRS 13 Fair value measurement 1 January 2013 IAS 1 amendment Financial statement presentation regarding other comprehensive income 1 January 2013 IAS 12 amendment Income taxes regarding deferred tax 1 January 2013 IAS 19 revised 2011 Employee benefits 1 January 2013 IAS 27 revised 2011 Separate financial statements 1 January 2013 IAS 28 revised 2011 Associates and joint ventures 1 January 2013 IAS 19 revised Employee benefits has been adopted in the year and the comparatives for the year ended 31 December 2012 have been restated accordingly.
Further details are provided in Note 2.
IAS 1 amendment has been adopted and the presentation of the consolidated statement of comprehensive income updated accordingly.
The introduction of IFRS 13 has not resulted in any change to the basis of valuation for assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
b New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations not applied At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following amendments to standards and interpretations were in issue but have not been applied in these financial statements: Effective date IFRS 9 Financial instruments 1 January 2015 IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements 1 January 2014 IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in other entities 1 January 2014 It is expected that the group will adopt these amendments to standards on their effective dates.
The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these amendments to standards will have a material impact on the financial statements of the group.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the company and all its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 December 2013.
Intra-group sales and profits are eliminated fully on consolidation.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings by the group.
The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of are consolidated for the period from or to the date on which control passed.
Uniform accounting policies are applied across the group.
The subsidiaries are entities over which the group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies.
The cost of acquisition is measured as the fair value of assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred.
Any identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest.
Any unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Intangible assets Intangible assets within the group principally comprise computer software and certain types of development costs.
Computer software costs are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, normally 4-5 years.
Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.
76 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 1.
Accounting policies continued Costs incurred on development projects are recognised as intangible assets when it is probable that the project will be a success, considering its commercial and technological feasibility, and costs can be measured reliably.
Development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset, normally 15 years.
External and internal costs are capitalised to the extent that they enhance the future economic benefit of the asset.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Intangible assets are valued at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Research and development In general, research and development expenditure is charged to the income statement in the year in which it occurred.
However, as set out above, under certain conditions development expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The cost of property, plant and equipment is its purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition and directly attributable costs.
Provision for depreciation is made so as to write off the costs of the assets on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic lives.
Principal useful economic lives Freehold buildings 50 years Plant and machinery 8-15 years Computer equipment 4-5 years Motor vehicles 4 years Fixtures and fittings 10 years No depreciation is provided on freehold land or on assets under construction.
Assets under construction are transferred to the appropriate asset category when they come into use.
Depreciation on assets so transferred is provided with effect from the month following the date of transfer.
Asset residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance sheet date, or more frequently if there have been indications of significant change in either.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with carrying amounts and are recognised within other operating income expense in the income statement.
Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the year in which they are incurred.
Impairment of non-financial assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation but are tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Assets that are subject to depreciation or amortisation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Grants Grants relating to property, plant and equipment are included in current and non-current liabilities as appropriate and credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the related assets.
Grants relating to costs are deferred and recognised in the income statement over the period necessary to match them with the costs they are intended to compensate.
Fixed asset investments The companys investments in subsidiary undertakings are shown at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Leases Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined on a first in, first out basis and includes transport and handling costs.
In the case of manufactured products, cost includes all direct expenditure and production overheads based on the normal level of activity.
Net realisable value is the price at which inventories can be sold in the normal course of business after allowing for the costs of realisation and, where appropriate, the cost of conversion from their existing state to a finished condition.
Provision is made, where appropriate, for obsolete, slow-moving and defective inventories.
Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 77 I 2 3 4 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2013 continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Trade receivables Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Estimated irrecoverable amounts are based on historical experience, together with specific amounts that are not expected to be collectible.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
Individual trade receivables are written off when management deems them not to be collectible.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term deposits with maturity dates of less than three months which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, net cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and cash equivalents net of bank overdrafts.
Foreign currencies Items included in the financial statements of each of the groups subsidiary undertakings are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the companys functional and presentation currency.
Foreign currency transactions in each entity are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges.
Other gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions are included in the income statement.
The trading results of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries are translated into sterling, the presentation currency of the group and functional currency of the parent, using average rates of exchange for the year.
The balance sheets of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end and exchange differences arising are taken directly to the translation reserve in equity.
On disposal of a foreign denominated subsidiary, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in the translation reserve since 1 January 2004 under the transitional rules of IFRS 1 relating to that entity is recognised in the income statement.
All other translation differences are taken to the income statement, with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings and forward foreign currency contracts which are used to provide a hedge against the groups net investments in foreign enterprises.
These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in the income statement.
Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods in the ordinary course of the groups activities.
Sales revenue, which is net of returns, rebates and discounts, and which excludes value added tax and sales between group companies, represents the net invoiced value of goods supplied and is recognised when the goods have either been delivered to or collected by the customer and the risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to them.
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised by the company when payment is made by subsidiary undertakings.
Taxation The charge for current tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowable.
It is calculated using taxation rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or the liability is settled.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with within equity.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except for deferred tax liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
78 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 1.
Accounting policies continued Pension The group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans.
All defined benefit pension plans are now closed to new entrants.
Payments to defined contribution pension plans are charged as an expense as they fall due.
The groups obligations in respect of defined benefit pension plans are valued by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
All group plans are funded externally, with the exception of Germany, where, in line with local practice, obligations are supported by insurance policies.
Plan assets are valued at fair market value and are held completely separate from the groups assets.
Full formal actuarial valuations of obligations are carried out at frequencies of not more than three years and are updated regularly for reporting purposes.
Amounts recorded in the balance sheet represent the fair value of external plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligations.
Amounts recorded in the income statement represent the current service cost over the reporting year, which is included in operating profit, and net finance income or cost, i. e. interest income on assets less interest cost on liabilities calculated using the discount rate, which is included as a separate component of finance income and cost.
Other income statement credits or charges can arise for special events, such as a past service benefit improvement or settlement and curtailment of plan liabilities.
Actuarial gains and losses are immediately recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Actuarial gains and losses on liabilities occur due to changes in actuarial assumptions at the balance sheet date and also due to any differences between assumptions and actual outcomes.
Gains and losses on plan assets represent the difference between interest income over the year and the actual return achieved.
Share schemes The group operates a number of equity-settled share-based incentive plans as consideration for services received from employees.
The fair value of services received in exchange for the grant of share awards is recognised as an expense with the total amount to be expensed being determined by reference to the fair value of the awards granted.
The fair value of the awards includes any market performance conditions, but excludes the impact of any service or non-market performance vesting conditions and is reduced by any consideration received from employees.
Any non-market performance or service conditions are included in assumptions over the number of awards expected to vest, and the total expense is recognised over the full vesting period in the income statement with a corresponding credit made to equity.
At the end of each year the group revises its estimates of the number of awards expected to vest based on non-market vesting conditions and recognises the impact of any revision in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The social security contributions payable on share awards granted is recognised in the income statement over the vesting period and is treated as a cash-settled transaction.
Dividends payable The liability for final dividends is recorded when the dividends are approved by the companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recorded when paid.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the year in which they are incurred, except where they are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, in which case they are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.
Trade payables Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 79 I 2 3 4 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2013 continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments used to hedge risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations are initially and subsequently re-measured at fair value.
The fair values of forward exchange contracts are calculated by reference to market forward rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of interest rate swap contracts are calculated on a discounted cash flow basis using market forward rates.
Gains or losses arising from the movement to fair value are taken to the income statement except where the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument, and demonstrate that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis.
This effectiveness testing is re-performed at each reporting date to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Cash flow hedges The group has designated forward foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges.
For cash flow hedges, the effective part of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Gains or losses relating to any ineffective part of changes in fair value are taken immediately to the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period as the hedged transaction occurs, for example, when the forecast sale or purchase transaction takes place.
Any movements in fair value occurring after the time when hedging contracts cease to be cash flow hedges are taken directly to the income statement.
Net investment hedges Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges.
Gains or losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Gains or losses relating to any ineffective portion are taken immediately to the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are transferred to the income statement when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.
Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decisionmaker.
The chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the Board, which is responsible for allocating resources and assessing the performance of the operating segments.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are those significant items which are incremental to normal operations and are separately disclosed by virtue of their nature or size to enable a better understanding of the groups underlying financial performance.
Restatement The group has implemented IAS19 revised Employee benefits during the year ended 31 December 2013.
This has impacted the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income as outlined below: Administration costs of the defined benefit pension schemes of 0.8m for the year ended 31 December 2012 have been reclassified from interest cost to operating profit: Net interest income on plan assets is now calculated using the same rate used to calculate the interest cost on the pension liability, being the discount rate.
Previously income on plan assets was calculated using a rate based on the expected return on the various asset types held within the investment portfolio.
This has resulted in an increase in net finance cost on pensions of 1.5m for the year ended 31 December 2012.
There is no change to the net pension liability or net assets as a result of the adoption of IAS 19 revised, and therefore no restatement of the balance sheet is required.
The effect of adopting IAS 19 revised on the groups results for the year ended 31 December 2012 is to reduce profit after tax by 1.1m, and to increase other comprehensive income by the same amount.

Segment information The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Board.
The Board reviews the groups financial results on a geographical segment basis with three identifiable operating segments: Americas: which includes North America and Latin America.
Asia Pacific: which includes Australia, New Zealand, Japan, China and the rest of South East Asia.
Europe: which includes Continental Europe, UK, Ireland and Africa.
The Board assesses the performance of the operating segments based on operating profit.
This measurement basis excludes the effects of exceptional income and expenditure from the operating segments.
Sales between segments are carried out at arms length.
Finance income and cost, and net finance cost on pensions, are not included in the segment results that are reviewed by the Board.
Segment assets exclude tax assets, which are managed on a central basis.
Segment liabilities exclude tax liabilities and non-current borrowings, which are managed on a central basis.
Information provided to the Board is consistent with that in the financial statements.

Financial risk management and financial instruments Financial risk management The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of the risks associated with interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, liquidity and capital.
It is the groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
These policies have remained unchanged throughout the year, are consistent with the previous year, and are summarised below: Market risk a Interest rate risk The groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings, cash and short-term deposits, together with currency swaps used to hedge inter-company loans.
The group borrows in the desired currencies at floating rates of interest and may use forward rate agreements or interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest rate profile and manage the groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Although group policy permits the hedging of up to 50% of interest rate exposures on borrowings for a period not exceeding five years, no interest rate hedging was in place at 31 December 2013 or 31 December 2012.
Cash is held in interest-bearing current accounts where practicable with any excess cash placed on deposit.
Any deposits made are for periods of less than three months.
A variation of, for example, 100 basis points in interest rates, applied to the groups borrowings, cash and short-term deposits at 31 December 2013, would result in a movement in finance costs of 0.4m 2012: 0.3m and finance income of 0.1m 2012: 0.1m.
This would result in a post-tax impact on the groups income statement of 0.3m 2012: 0.2m and a post-tax impact on the groups equity of 0.3m 2012: 0.2m.
b Foreign exchange risk The group has several significant overseas subsidiary undertakings whose revenues and expenses are denominated in a variety of currencies.
Group policy dictates that foreign currency exposures arising from future commercial transactions are reviewed by Group Treasury and hedging activities are undertaken as appropriate in order to manage the net foreign exchange risks arising.
Group policy permits the hedging of up to a maximum of 80% of the net external currency transaction exposures for periods of up to a maximum of fifteen months forward.
It is not group policy to routinely hedge translation exposures apart from those created by inter-company loans or where foreign currency denominated assets are planned to be returned to the UK in the form of a dividend.
Specific Board approval is required for any other translation exposure hedging.
100 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 23.
Financial risk management and financial instruments continued The table below details the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on the groups post-tax profit for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 and equity at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 due to the translation of receivables, payables, cash and derecognised currency hedges which are denominated in currencies other than each group companys reporting currency.
The movements in equity arise from the translation of cash flow currency hedges.
In each case, it is assumed that the named currency is strengthening or weakening against all other currencies, while all the other currencies remain constant.
The percentage foreign currency movement is based on the maximum annual percentage movement against sterling during the previous four years.
In the case of sterling it is based on the maximum percentage movement against the US dollar during the previous four years.
Results are shown for all currencies where the impact on group post-tax profits would be more than 25,000.

Financial risk management and financial instruments continued Credit risk Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures with customers.
The group monitors its credit exposure using credit ratings, where applicable, and through its policy of requiring appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence.
These procedures limit the groups exposure to any one party to approved levels.
Exposure to banking counterparties is only permitted with approved banks which have one minimum short term rating of A1 P1 F1 with rating agencies S&P, Moodys or Fitch.
At the reporting date no single banking exposure was greater than 1.1m 2012: 2.5m.
Liquidity risk The group has medium-term loan facilities which are regularly reviewed to ensure that they provide adequate liquidity for the group.
The facilities are managed on a centralised basis with appropriate local availability.
Details of the undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 are shown below: 2013 2012 m m Expiring in more than two years 21.6 21.2 At 31 December 2013, the group had in place unsecured floating rate committed loan facilities totalling 61.0m 2012: 51.0m.
These facilities are co-ordinated bilateral facilities which were renegotiated with four banks in September 2011.
In June 2013, the committed facilities were increased by 10.0m.
No other significant amendments were made to the committed facilities and they remain due to expire on 30 September 2016.
The covenants related to the groups loan facilities determine a minimum interest cover ratio, and a maximum gearing ratio.
The group had significant headroom within both covenants throughout the years ending 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012.
In addition to the committed facilities, local uncommitted working capital facilities of 7.5m 2012: 7.5m, US dollars 2.0m 2012: US dollars 2.0m, Czech koruna 120.0m 2012: Czech koruna 120.0m and Australian dollars 0.5m 2012: Australian dollars 0.5m were also in place at 31 December 2013.
These facilities are renewable within one year.
Capital risk When managing capital, the groups objectives are to safeguard the business as a going concern, provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and maintain an optimal capital structure.
In order to maintain the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The principal measure used to monitor the strength of the groups balance sheet is the gearing ratio, which expresses the groups net debt as a percentage of its net assets.
Net debt is total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
Net assets are as shown in the consolidated balance sheet.
The gearing ratios at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 were as follows: 2013 2012 m m Total borrowings Note 22 41.8 31.7 Less: cash and cash equivalents Note 19 6.0 5.6 Net debt Note 32 35.8 26.1 Net assets 158.0 146.9 Gearing ratio 22.7% 17.8% 102 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 23.

The major schemes are of the defined benefit type and, with the exception of Germany where book reserves are supported by insurance policies, the assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
The defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants.
The total net pension cost for the group was 7.7m 2012: 6.1m, of which 3.5m 2012: 3.4m related to the overseas schemes.
On the advice of the actuaries, cash contributions to the groups defined benefit schemes are expected to be 6.0m for the year ending 31 December 2014 2013: 6.3m.
The most significant defined benefit scheme within the group is the Devro Limited UK Pension Plan, which operates in the United Kingdom.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 March 2011.
The other major defined benefit schemes operate in Australia and the United States.
Actuarial assumptions appropriate for each country have been used.
The last formal actuarial valuations of the groups material defined benefit schemes have been updated to 31 December 2013 by qualified independent actuaries.
The major assumptions used by the actuaries in the following principal countries were: Australia United Kingdom United States 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 % % % % % % Discount rate 4.30 3.40 4.50 4.30 4.60 3.65 Rate of increase in salaries 3.50 3.50 1.00 1.00 General inflation 2.50 2.50 3.30 2.90 As part of the changes to the United Kingdom plan agreed in 2010, future pensionable salary increases are capped at 1% per annum.
No rate of increase in salaries has been assumed in respect of the United States plan as the plan is now frozen.

Pension obligations continued Demographic assumptions, such as mortality rates, are set having regard to the latest trends in life expectancy plan experience.
These assumptions are under continual review.
The mortality assumptions at 31 December 2013 are based on the following tables: Years of life expectancy for current pensioners aged 65: 2013 2012 Male Female Male Female SAPS Normal YOB United Kingdom PA92 mc YOB 1% underpin 2 22.4 24.6 22.3 24.5 IRS Reg.

The Australian defined benefit scheme provides only for a lump sum payment on retirement.
In addition to the above schemes, the group operates a defined benefit pension plan in Germany which, in common with typical practice in that country, is supported by insurance policies.
At 31 December 2013, the value of the insurance asset was 2.4m 2012: 2.4m and the value of the liability was 3.0m 2012: 3.0m.
A proportion of the assets and liabilities of the German plan, relating to the period when the business operated as a branch of Devro Inc or Devro Scotland Limited, was retained by the group after the sale of Devro GmbH in September 2011.
In addition, the group has benefit arrangements in respect of two former executives in the United States for which the group has made adequate provisions on the advice of the actuaries.
There is also an individual pension arrangement in Japan in respect of which appropriate contributions are made annually.
The plan in Germany and these additional arrangements in the United States and Japan are included under the other heading in this note.
Strategy is split between liability matching and return generating assets determined depending on the duration of the scheme, the funding position and the relevant countrys pension rules.
For the UK scheme the investment managers are mandated to invest 60% of the portfolio in growth assets with the remainder in UK government bonds matched to scheme liabilities.
For the US scheme a defensive approach is taken given the shorter maturity of the scheme liabilities with around 60% of the portfolio to be invested in fixed income assets and the remainder in growth assets, principally equities.
For the Australian scheme the strategy is for 70% of the portfolio to be invested in growth assets, with the remainder invested in defensive, primarily fixed income assets.
In all three schemes, the investment approach will be fide-risked over time as the funding position improves and market conditions allow.

The value of the scheme assets was relatively stable in the year.
However, the present value of the pension liabilities decreased predominantly as a result of the rise in discount rates.
The UK scheme is the largest of the schemes and the discount rate increased from 4.3% to 4.5% in 2013, reducing net liabilities by 6.5m.
Additional contributions will be made to the schemes in 2014 to reduce the deficit as part of a contribution profile agreed with Trustees following the results of the last triennial valuation of the UK scheme as at 31 March 2011.
The group continues to pay contributions to pension schemes in accordance with local regulatory requirements and on the advice of qualified independent actuaries.
The actuaries continually review the funding position of the schemes.

The cumulative re-measurements in other comprehensive income are 61.0m loss 2012: 72.3m loss.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 15 years, with benefit payments over the next ten years expected to be as follows: m In the next year 11.2 In years 2-5 45.1 In years 6-10 63.0 119.3 The schemes funds have been invested in a range of assets which are due to be realised in line with the associated liabilities.
The trustees review the schemes assets and adjust the weighting between short-term and long-term assets to combine security and growth with the liquidity required to meet the obligations as they fall due.
Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure defined benefit scheme obligations: Indicative impact on defined benefit Assumption Change in assumption obligation before deferred tax Discount rate Increase by 0.25% Decrease by 9.2m Decrease by 0.25% Increase by 9.8m Rate of salary increase Increase by 0.25% Increase by 0.2m Decrease by 0.25% Decrease by 0.1m General inflation Increase by 0.25% Increase by 2.1m Decrease by 0.25% Decrease by 1.8m Life expectancy Increase by 1 year Increase by 6.8m The above sensitivity analyses are based on the same change in assumption in each of the groups schemes except where changes are limited through the individual scheme rules, while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the projected unit credit method is applied in the same way as for the calculation of the pension liability recognised in the financial statements.
112 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 25.
Pension obligations continued Risks Through its defined benefit pension obligations, the group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: Market volatility The accounting estimate of net pension obligations is sensitive to changes in market conditions.
The discount rate used to estimate the defined benefit obligation is linked to yields on AA-rated corporate bonds, or similar, whilst scheme assets are invested in a range of other assets, which are themselves subject to fluctuations in value.
Changing market conditions and movements in the discount rate will lead to volatility in the net pension obligation on the groups balance sheet, in other comprehensive income and in the income statement.
Choice of accounting assumptions The value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by actuarial valuations over long-term cash flows.
The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about discount rates, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension schemes.
Due to the long-term nature of these schemes these estimates are subject to significant uncertainty, and the final outcome could be significantly different to the assumptions used.
However, the risk is limited in certain respects.
The Australian scheme allows for a lump sum payment on retirement, so is not sensitive to changes in mortality assumptions, whilst the US scheme is frozen so that it is not sensitive to inflation or salary rises.
Similarly the rate of increase in UK salaries is limited to 1% per annum.

Share-based payments Under the Devro 2003 Performance Share Plan the plan, the Executive Directors Remuneration Committee can make provisional allocations of ordinary shares in the company to employees of the group, including Executive Directors.
No payment for an allocation is made by a participant.
Allocations normally vest over a three-year period, are conditional on the continued employment of the participant and are subject to certain performance conditions.
These performance conditions relate to growth in operating profit of the subsidiary undertaking in which the participant is employed, growth in earnings per share of the group, the companys Total Shareholder Return in comparison to its peer group, or a combination of these.
For awards where vesting is subject to the growth in earnings per share the fair value of an allocation represents the market value of the ordinary shares in the company on the date of the provisional allocation, less the discounted value of estimated dividends expected to be paid during the vesting period.
A participant is not entitled to receive dividends during this period.
The fair value of awards subject to the companys Total Shareholder Return performance is determined using a Monte Carlo option valuation methodology.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year using this method was 2.07 2012: 2.87 with the significant inputs to the model being the share price at the grant date, an expected volatility in the share price of 23.9% based on historic trends, the term of three years, risk free interest rate of 0.77% and expected dividend yield.
Amounts provided in the accounts are based on an estimate of the probability of the targets in respect of allocations being achieved.
