Deferred tax balances for which there is a right of offset within the same jurisdiction are presented net on the face of the group balance sheet as permitted by IAS 12, with the exception of deferred tax related to BTs pension schemes which are disclosed within deferred tax assets.
At 31 March 2013, all of the deferred tax asset of 1,438m 2011 12: 626m and all of the deferred tax liability of 1,209m 2011 12: 1,100m are expected to be recovered or settled after more than one year.
Factors affecting future tax charges The rate of UK corporation tax changed from 24% to 23% on 1 April 2013.
As deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the rates that are expected to apply in the periods of the reversal, deferred tax balances at 31 March 2013 have been calculated using a rate of 23%.
This reduction has been recognised as a deferred tax credit of 105m and as a specic item in the income statement note 9 and a deferred tax expense of 94m in other comprehensive income.
The Government has also indicated that it intends to enact a future reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 21% by 1 April 2014 and to 20% by 1 April 2015.
The future annual corporation tax rate reductions are expected to affect the groups financial statements.
The actual impact will depend on the groups deferred tax position at that time.
