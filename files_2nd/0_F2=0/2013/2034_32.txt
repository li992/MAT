Share-based payments The Groups share option plans and restricted shares scheme allows employees to acquire shares in the Betfair Group.
The fair value of these schemes is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity, with the exception of cash settled transactions which result in a corresponding increase in other creditors.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to participate in the scheme and is calculated using an option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest.
Restricted shares are valued with reference to the market value of the shares on the date of grant.
They have a vesting period of three years from the first day of the financial year to which they relate and one third of the shares will vest each year for three years.
All cash settled share-based payments are recorded as a liability and revalued at the market value at the balance sheet date with the difference taken to the profit and loss account, except where the cash component is fixed.
