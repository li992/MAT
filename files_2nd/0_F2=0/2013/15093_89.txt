78 SuperGroup Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Notes to the Group and Company Financial Statements 4 Segment information The Groups operating segments under IFRS 8 have been determined based on the reports reviewed by the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker executive board members: the board.
The board assesses the performance of the operating segments based on profit before income tax, before inter-segment royalties.
The board considers the business from a customer perspective only, being Retail and Wholesale.
The board reviews the balance sheet at a Group level.
No separate balance sheet measures are provided between the Retail and Wholesale segments.
As per the announcement of 6 June 2013 the Group has changed the methodology of its segmental reporting in the period.
The board believes that the revised segmental reporting provides a clearer understanding of the divisional performance of the Group and reflects the changes made in the period to the internal reporting of the divisions to the board.
Primarily, these changes apply to the treatment of European retail sales which are now included in the Retail segment, trade sales which are now included in the Wholesale segment, and Central costs which have been stripped out of the Retail and Wholesale segment.
The segmental analysis below has been reported on the new basis in addition to the historical basis for 2012.
The board receives information, reviews the performance of the business, allocates resources and approves budgets for two operating segments, and therefore information is disclosed in respect of the following two segments: Retail principal activities comprise the operation of UK, Republic of Ireland and European stores, concessions and all internet sites.
Revenue is derived from the sale to individual consumers of own brand and third party clothing, footwear and accessories.
Wholesale principal activities comprise the ownership of brands, wholesale distribution of own brand products clothing, footwear and accessories worldwide and trade sales.
Segment results and assets include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
The Group reports and manages central functions separately to the Retail and Wholesale operations, which includes design, finance, HR, IT, legal, marketing, merchandising, property, sourcing and the goodwill and intangibles arising on consolidation.
The revenue from external parties reported to the board is measured in a manner consistent with that of the IFRS financial statements.
Inter-segment royalties, transfers or transactions entered into under a cost plus pricing structure are not reflected in the performance of each business segment.
