sTEP 5 sTEP 1 CALCULATING THE PROFIT OR LOss OPENING THE POsITION 1 A plc is trading in the market at 144.5p 144.7p and our quote for A plc on a Daily Funded Bet is 144.3p 144.9p.
You decide Client IG Index to buy 100 per point at 144.9p, our offer price.
In this example one point represents a 1p movement in the underlying share Buying spread Step 1 20.00 20.00 price, so your 100 per point bet is equivalent to buying 10,000 shares in A plc.
Selling spread Step 4 20.00 20.00 Gross profit Step 4 390.00 390.00 Bet details You buy 100 per point of A plc at 144.9p the offer price 1 IG Index hedging gain N A 390.00 1 Your initial deposit requirement 723 calculated as 100 bet size x 144.6p the mid-price x 5% the deposit factor Net gain 350.00 40.00 2 Spread 20 calculated as the difference between the market price and our quote 144.9p 1 This simple example assumes IG Index is 100% hedged on the client trade and makes an equal and opposite gain on our broker position to the amount paid 144.7p x 100 per point to the client.
The cost of our hedging with the broker has been ignored for simplicity.
Therefore our net profit is 40.00, which is recorded in trading revenue and is equivalent to the spread included in our quoted prices 1 The deposit factor and therefore deposit requirement depends on your account type and other factors such as the volatility and liquidity of the underlying share For many markets for example index futures we build funding charges into the quote price.
For share Daily Funded Bets 2 Our dealing spread varies depending on the market and asset class traded and can be variable, especially in volatile market conditions.
For examples please see our website, IG.
com we make funding adjustments each day at 10pm.
We apply funding at the rate of one-month LIBOR - a spread generally 2.5%.
In the example above, if the bet had remained open at 10pm, and assuming one-month LIBOR of 0.68%, a funding sTEP 2 charge of 1.31 would have been applied against the client account and recorded as revenue for IG Index calculated as When you open the position, you are required to have the initial 723 deposit requirement in your account.
The available 100 x 150.0p assumed closing price x 3.18% 365 1.31. funds in your account will therefore fall from 1,000 to 277 ie 1,000 723.
The available funds remaining in your account need to be enough to cover any running losses you may incur, or you run the risk of being closed out of the bet.
It is important to note that the 723 is held as a deposit against the risk of the open position and will be released on the closing of the position: it is still your money but is not available for withdrawal from the account while the position is open.
sTEP 3 We will also reflect the impact of any corporate action on the underlying share, such as a dividend or a rights issue.
In this example we have kept things simple and assumed no corporate actions occur: however for more details please see our website, IG.
