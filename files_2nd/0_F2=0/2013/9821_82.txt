The Group obtains such valuations from counterparties who use a variety of assumptions based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED The fair values of all financial instruments are equal to their book values, with the exception of borrowings note 17.
The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables, other receivables and trade loans, and the carrying value of trade payables and other payables, are assumed to approximate their fair values.
Fair value hierarchy IFRS 7 requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in the measurements, according to the following levels: Level 1 unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The table below shows the level in the fair value hierarchy into which fair value measurements have been categorised: 2013 2012 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets as per the balance sheet m m m m m m m m Derivative financial instruments 6.8 6.8 13.7 13.7 2013 2012 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Liabilities as per the balance sheet m m m m m m m m Derivative financial instruments 141.4 141.4 201.4 201.4 There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3 fair value measurements during the current or prior period.
Over the life of the Groups derivative financial instruments, the cumulative fair value gain loss on those instruments will be nil as it is the Groups intention to hold them to maturity.
Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk, counterparty risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board.
Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks.
The Board provides principles for overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas, such as interest rate risk, credit risk, investment of excess liquidity and use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments.
Interest rate risk: The Groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates, and as such the Groups interest rate risk arises from its long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a dynamic basis.
Various scenarios are simulated taking into consideration refinancing, renewal of existing positions, alternative financing and hedging.
Based on these scenarios, the Group calculates the impact on the income statement of a defined interest rate shift.
The scenarios are run only for liabilities that represent the major interest-bearing positions.
The Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps.
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates.
Generally, the Group raises long-term borrowings at floating rates and swaps them into fixed rates that are lower than those available if the Group borrowed at fixed rates directly.
Under the interest rate swaps, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed contract rates and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts.
If interest rates had been 0.5% higher lower during the period ended 5 October 2013, with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit loss for the period would have been 0.3 million 2012: 0.3 million lower higher as a result of higher lower interest expense.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Interest rate swaps designated as part of a hedging arrangement The Group uses interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate payable on the floating rate tranches of its securitised debt note 19.
The notional principal amounts of these interest rate swap contracts at 5 October 2013 totalled 426.6 million 2012: 449.3 million.
These interest rate swaps, including borrowing margins, fix interest at 6.2% and 7.3%.
The movement in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income in the period was a gain of 44.0 million 2012: loss of 28.5 million.
On 22 March 2012 the Group entered into two forward starting interest rate swaps of 60.0 million each to fix the interest rate payable on the Groups unsecured bank borrowings.
The interest rate swaps commenced on 27 April 2012, fix interest at 4.1% and terminate on 30 April 2020.
In total, the fair value of these two new swaps at inception was 18.9 million note 4.
The movement in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income in the period was a gain of 5.6 million 2012: loss of 5.6 million.
The movement in fair value recognised in the income statement in the period was a gain of 3.1 million 2012: nil.
Interest rate swaps not designated as part of a hedging arrangement On 1 October 2007 the Group entered into two interest rate swaps of 70.0 million each to fix the interest rate payable on the Groups unsecured bank borrowings.
These interest rate swaps fix interest at 5.5% and 5.6% and terminate on 1 October 2014.
The movement in fair value recognised in the income statement in the period was a gain of 6.9 million 2012: 3.9 million.
On 22 March 2012 the Group entered into four new fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps of 35.0 million each.
In total, these swaps are equal and opposite to the above two floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps of 70.0 million each.
The total fair value of the four new swaps at inception was 15.1 million note 4.
The movement in fair value recognised in the income statement in the period was a loss of 6.9 million 2012: 1.4 million.
On 20 May 2009 the Group entered into a forward starting interest rate swap of 20.0 million.
This interest rate swap commenced on 9 August 2010, fixed interest at 3.3% and terminated on 8 August 2013.
This swap had been designated as a cash flow hedge of the forecast floating rate interest payments arising on the first 20.0 million of borrowings under the Groups previous bank facility.
During the prior period the Group entered into a new bank facility and as such these forecast transactions were no longer expected to occur.
Therefore the cumulative hedging loss of 0.8 million that had been reported in equity was transferred to the income statement in the prior period.
The movement in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income in the period was a gain of nil 2012: 0.1 million.
The movement in fair value recognised in the income statement in the period was a gain of 0.4 million 2012: 0.4 million.
The interest rate risk profile, after taking account of derivative financial instruments, is as follows: 2013 2012 Floating Fixed Floating Fixed rate rate rate rate financial financial financial financial liabilities liabilities Total liabilities liabilities Total m m m m m m Borrowings 186.5 1,115.7 1,302.2 35.0 1,158.4 1,193.4 The weighted average interest rate of the fixed rate financial borrowings was 5.8% 2012: 5.4% and the weighted average period for which the rate is fixed was 16 years 2012: 16 years.
Foreign currency risk: The Group buys and sells goods denominated in non-sterling currencies, principally US dollars and euros.
As a result, movements in exchange rates can affect the value of the Groups income and expenditure.
The Groups exposure in this area is not considered to be significant.
Counterparty risk: The Groups counterparty risk in respect of its cash and cash equivalents is mitigated by the use of various banking institutions for its deposits.
There is no significant concentration of counterparty risk in respect of the Groups pension assets, as these are held with a range of institutions.
Credit risk: Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk arises from credit exposure to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
If customers are independently rated, these ratings are used.
Otherwise, if there is no independent rating, an assessment is made of the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors.
Individual credit limits are set based on internal or external ratings in accordance with limits set by the Board.
The utilisation of and adherence to credit limits is regularly monitored.
