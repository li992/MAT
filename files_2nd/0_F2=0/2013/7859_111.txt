81 Current tax liability At 30 April 2013, there is a current tax liability of 56,279,000 2012: nil.
Of the 2013 liability, 55,918,000 relates to MIPS Technologies, Inc MIPS.
This tax liability is the result of MIPS completing a sale of patents for 240,000,000 prior to its acquisition by the Group.
Deferred tax The movement on the deferred tax account is as follows: As at On acquisition Recognized in Recognized As at 1 May 12 of subsidiaries income statement in equity 30 April 2013 000 000 000 000 000 Tax losses 10,201 8,372 1,829 Share based payments note 21 10,804 2,030 5,025 7,809 Other timing differences 131 2,369 1,857 643 Capital allowances 1,847 14 2,226 393 Gain on investments 460 316 144 Gain on foreign exchange contract 228 228 Acquisition of intangible assets 3,426 17,167 1,352 19,241 15,403 14,784 4,533 4,881 8,795 2013 2012 000 000 Deferred taxation has been presented on the balance sheet as follows: Deferred tax asset 10,446 18,829 Deferred tax liability 19,241 3,426 At end of the period 8,795 15,403 An additional nil 2012: 495,000 of previously unrecognized tax assets were recognized in the year.
Management consider the utilisation of the 10,446,000 2012: 18,829,000 deferred tax asset to be probable based on assessment of forecasts of future taxable profits.
During the year the deferred tax liability increased by 17,167,000 as a result of a liability arising on intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of MIPS.
This deferred tax liability will reduce as the intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives with the balance remaining at year end set out above.
Further details on the acquisition are set out in note 24.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset and there is an intention to settle the balance net.
Unrecognized deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets of 15,102,000 2012: 11,633,000 reported at the applicable tax rate, have not been recognized in respect of tax losses in the US totalling 43,149,000 2012: 33,237,000.
Tax losses are increasing in the US as a result of continued R&D investment by the Group into its US subsidiaries.
The losses are available for utilization against profit arising in the US in future periods.
None of the losses in the current year balance relate to the UK 2012: nil.
In March 2012 the Chancellor revised the previously announced reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 24% with effect from 1 April 2012 and a further reduction to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013.
These changes became substantively enacted on 26 March 2012 and 3 July 2012 respectively and therefore the effect of these rate reductions has been included in the figures above.
The Chancellor proposed a further change to reduce the main rate of corporation tax to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014, but this change has not been substantively enacted and therefore is not included in the figures above.
The overall effect would be to decrease the deferred tax asset.
