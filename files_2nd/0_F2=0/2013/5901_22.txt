Significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The Company financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom and under the historical cost convention.
In accordance with the exemptions allowed by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemptions in FRS 8 Related Party Transactions not to disclose related party transactions with other members of Fenner PLC Group.
The principal accounting policies adopted for the year ended 31 August 2013, which have been consistently applied, are set out below.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items measured at historical cost are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement and retranslation of monetary items are recognised in the profit and loss account in the period.
Share-based payments The Company operates equity-settled share schemes for certain employees across the Fenner PLC Group.
The cost of share-based payments is measured at fair value at the date of grant, excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
The cost is recognised in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with the corresponding amount credited to reserves, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
The estimate of the level of vesting is reviewed annually and the charge is adjusted accordingly in respect of non market-based vesting conditions.
The fair values are measured using the Binomial option-pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation approach.
Where the Company awards its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries, it recognises an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in its subsidiaries financial statements, with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in reserves.
Taxation Taxation expense represents the sum of the current tax payable and deferred tax.
Current tax is the tax expected to be payable on taxable profit for the period using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, together with any adjustments in respect of previous years.
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the profit and loss account because it excludes items of income or expense that are not taxable or deductible or are taxable or deductible in other years.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
It is determined using the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse.
Timing differences are differences between taxable profits and results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only when it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are revalued unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding agreement to sell the revalued asset.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Dividends Dividends proposed by the Board are recognised in the financial statements when they have been approved by shareholders at the AGM.
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
In prior years, certain freehold properties have been revalued by independent qualified professional valuers on the basis of open market value for their existing use.
As permitted by the transitional phase of FRS 15 Tangible Fixed Assets, these valuations have been frozen.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation on other assets is recognised in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.
Estimated useful lives most widely applied are as follows: Freehold property 40 years Investments Investments are stated at cost or valuation less accumulated impairment losses.

Share-based payments The Company operates two equity-settled share-based payment schemes across the Fenner PLC Group.
a Fenner PLC 1996 Executive Share Option Scheme Share options were granted to certain employees within the Group.
The exercise price of options granted is set at the market price of the shares on the date of the grant.
The vesting period is generally 3 years.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of the grant the options expire.
Options can only be exercised upon satisfaction of performance criteria.
This requires that the overall growth of the Groups earnings per share before amortisation of intangible assets acquired and exceptional items over a consecutive three year period exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Price Index over the same period by at least 9%.
The last grant of shares under the Executive Share Option Scheme was made in November 2004.
Details of movements in outstanding share options are as follows: Weighted average Options exercise price number pence At 1 September 2012 and at 31 August 2013 20,406 123.5 At 31 August 2013, 20,406 2012: 20,406 options were exercisable.

b Performance Share Plan Conditional awards of shares are made to certain employees within the Group.
The conditional award is made to each employee at the start of a three year performance period and is based on a percentage of the basic annual salary of each employee.
The awards are subject to the satisfaction of performance criteria.
The proportion of the conditional share awards that vest is based on a combination of the Groups Total Shareholder Return TSR measure and an earnings per share EPS measure.
The EPS measure accounts for 33% of the final allocation on vesting and the TSR measure for 67%.
The EPS performance target is set against underlying EPS growth in the Company measured over the three years from the end of the financial year preceding the year in which the award was made.
Details of movements in conditional awards under the Performance Share Plan, in respect of employees of the Company, are as follows: Shares number At 1 September 2012 662,039 Conditional awards during the year 177,658 Dividend roll up awards applied 15,700 Final awards during the year 300,229 At 31 August 2013 555,168 Dividend roll ups have been applied since 2008 in line with the PSP Rules.
They accrue over the Plan Cycle and are added to the original conditional award before the final award and allotment of shares is made.
