Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements On 30 November 2012, the Mexican government enacted a new federal labour law.
Management is currently evaluating the new labour law for any potential impacts on the operations and financial position of the Group, however management does not expect any significant effect on the Groups financial statements as at 31 December 2013 and going forward.
In 2009 five members of the El Bajio agrarian community in the state of Sonora, who claimed rights over certain surface land in the proximity of the operations of Minera Penmont Penmont, submitted a legal claim with the Unitarian Agrarian Court Tribunal Unitario Agrario of Hermosillo Sonora, to have Penmont vacate an area of this surface land.
The land in dispute encompassed a portion of surface area where part of the operations of Soledad-Dipolos is located.
Minera Penmonts mining concessions are held by way of separate title to that relating to the surface land.
The litigation resulted in a definitive court order pursuant to which the Magistrate of the Unitarian Agrarian Court of Hermosillo, Sonora, ordered Penmont to vacate 1,824 hectares of land in July 2013, resulting in the suspension of operations at Soledad-Dipolos.
To date the disputed land has been returned by Penmont, with remediation activities pending in approximately 300 hectares.
The Magistrate has noted that remediation activities are necessary to comply with relevant regulatory requirements and requested the guidance of the Federal Environmental Agency SEMARNAT regarding the same.
The execution of the court ruling also resulted in the temporary suspension by the Mexican Ministry of Defense Secretara fide la Defensa Nacional or MOD of the single explosives permit which covered the Dipolos pit as well as its adjacent Soledad pit and Herradura.
The Soledad pit and Herradura are outside of the area affected by the court ruling, which was confirmed by a court-appointed topographer.
The Company filed a request to lift the explosives suspension at the Soledad pit and Herradura.
In connection with the foregoing matter, the El Bajio agrarian community entered cease and desist proceedings before a Federal district court in Sonora, requesting relief against the potential lifting of the suspension on the use of explosives and originally obtained a temporary stay order, which was subsequently not upheld by the district court.
Following a hearing on 24 January, the district court denied the request by the Ejido El Bajo to prevent the lifting of the explosives permit covering Herradura and Soledad.
The Company received no indication that the Ejido has filed an ultimate appeal regarding the foregoing and the time frame for filing such an appeal has expired.
On 24 February 2014 the MOD granted a new explosives permit for the Herradura mining unit, thereby allowing the use of explosives at this mine.
In connection with the foregoing matters, members of the El Bajo agrarian community have also presented additional claims, including a separate legal suit before the Unitarian Agrarian Court of Hermosillo, Sonora, claiming US$65 million for damages alleging that the Group improperly used the land affected by the court ruling, as well as cancellation of Penmonts mining concessions and environmental permits within the El Bajo lands.
Such concessions and permits are held by way of separate title to that relating to the surface land.
The members have not yet presented substantial evidence to support their claim and the Group believes that these claims are without merit.
Any initial ruling in this case would be subject to the appeals process in Mexico before judicial authorities other than the Unitarian Agrarian Court of Hermosillo, Sonora.
Given the lack of evidence in support of the damages claim, the Company believes that an adverse and definitive ruling for the Group in respect of this law suit is not probable.
Various claims and counterclaims have been made between the relevant parties.
There is significant uncertainty relating to the finalisation and ultimate result relating to these legal proceedings.
