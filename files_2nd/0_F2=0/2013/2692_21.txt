Annual report 2012 13 129 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2013 1 Statement of accounting policies 1.1 Basis of preparation The Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards applicable under generally accepted accounting principles in the United Kingdom and the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
They have been prepared on the historical cost basis where appropriate.
These financial statements set out the position of the Company and not the Cable & Wireless Communications Group the Group which it heads.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements.
The Company is exempt under FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures from the requirement to provide its own financial instruments disclosures on the grounds that they are included in publicly available consolidated financial statements which include disclosures that comply with the IFRS equivalent standard.
The financial statements are presented in US dollars US$, as this is the functional currency of the Company at 31 March 2013, and rounded to the nearest million.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from these estimates.
FRS 18 Accounting Policies requires that a description of the impact of any change in estimation techniques should be provided where the change has a material impact on the reported results for the year.
1.2 Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are included in the balance sheet at historical cost less any impairments recognised.
Impairment reviews are carried out whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be fully recoverable.
Impairments are determined by comparing the carrying value of the investment in the subsidiary to its recoverable amount, being the higher of the subsidiarys fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Fair value represents market value in an active market.
Value in use is determined by discounting future cash flows arising from the subsidiary with reference to the Groups own projections using pre-tax discount rates which represent the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the Company.
Impairments are recognised in profit or loss.
1.3 Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities The Company classifies its financial assets into the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments and available-for-sale financial assets.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the assets are held.
The Company currently does not hold or classify any financial assets under these categories.
The basis of determining fair values is set out in note 1.4.
Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition in accordance with FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date for financial assets other than those held at fair value through profit or loss.
Recognition and measurement Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or have been transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
1.4 Fair value estimation The nominal value less estimated impairments of receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values.
The fair value of financial liabilities is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Company for similar financial instruments.
Discounted cash flows are used to determine the fair value for the majority of remaining financial instruments.
130 Cable & Wireless Communications 1.5 Tax The charge for tax is based on the result for the year and takes into account tax deferred due to timing differences between the treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable.
Deferred tax assets are regarded as recoverable to the extent that on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Except where otherwise required by accounting standards, full provision without discounting is made for all timing differences that have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
1.6 Dividends Dividends are recognised through equity on the earlier of their approval by the Companys shareholders or their payment.
1.7 Share-based compensation The Group operates various equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense in the subsidiary companies over the vesting period.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, which excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions for example, service, profitability and sales growth targets.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in estimates about the number of options that are expected to vest.
At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original non-market estimates, if any, in the profit and loss, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital and share premium when the options are exercised.
The Company recognises an additional investment in subsidiaries equivalent to the equity instruments granted, being a capital contribution to those subsidiaries.
2 Companys profit and loss account The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in section 408 3 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not presented its own profit and loss account.

14 Guarantees and contingent liabilities Under the Separation Agreement, Cable & Wireless Communications Plc and Cable & Wireless Worldwide plc agree to provide each other with certain customary indemnities on a reciprocal basis in respect of liabilities which Cable & Wireless Communications may incur but which relate exclusively to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and vice versa and in respect of an agreed proportion of liabilities which do not relate exclusively to one group or the other.
Whilst Pender, the Groups former insurance operation, ceased to underwrite new business from April 2003, it has in the past written policies in favour of the Group and third parties.
Potentially significant insurance claims have been made against Pender under certain of these third party policies, which have also given rise to uncertainties and potential disputes with reinsurers.
Significant progress has been made in resolving these claims.
Details of these insurance claims and potential claims are not disclosed as such disclosure may be prejudicial to the outcome of such claims.
In addition, the Company, as is considered standard practice in such agreements, has given guarantees and indemnities in relation to a number of disposals of subsidiary undertakings in prior years.
Generally, liability has been capped at no more than the value of the sales proceeds, although some uncapped indemnities have been given.
The Company also gives warranties and indemnities in relation to certain agreements including facility sharing agreements.
Some of these agreements do not contain liability caps.
