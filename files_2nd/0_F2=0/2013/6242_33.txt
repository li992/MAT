Our Mines in Operation 1 Operate: Maximise the Potential ofExisting Operations 1 Fresnillo 2 3 4 Fresnillo is the largest primary silver mine in the world Average silver ore grades have continued their natural and one of the worlds oldest continuously operating mines: and expected declines.
This puts pressure on cash costs it produced 53.3% of the Groups total attributable silver as we seek to optimise production of the remaining and generated 33.4% of adjusted revenue.
resource and operate at full capacity, which requires more extensive mine development.
We also conduct intensive and on-going localand regional exploration to replace and expand the resource base, and plan to increase recovery rates by processing tailings.
