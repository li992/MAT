Management considers that the Group has adequate current assets and forecast cash from operations to manage liquidity risks arising from current liabilities and non-current liabilities.
Capital management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios that support its business and maximise shareholder value.
Management considers capital to consist of equity and certain interest-bearing loans, including loans from related parties, as disclosed in the balance sheet, excluding net unrealised gains or losses on revaluation of cash flow hedges and availablefor-sale financial assets.
In order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholders capital invested in the Group management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable.
The Groups dividend policy is based on the profitability of the business and underlying growth in earnings of the Group, as well as its capital requirements and cash flows, including cash flows from the Silverstream.
Effect of changes in accounting policies a Amendments to IAS 19R In the case of the Group, the transition to IAS 19R had an impact on the recognition of the actuarial gains and losses that are now recognised in OCI and permanently excluded from profit and loss.
Such a change did not have an impact on the pension liability balance.
Upon adoption of this amendment the Group reclassified actuarial gains and losses from cost of sales to OCI and net interest cost related to the pension liability of from cost of sales to finance cost, for the year ended 31 December 2012.
The amendment did not have an impact on retained earnings.
See details in table below.
b IFRIC 20 Stripping cost in the production phase of a surface mine The IFRS Interpretations Committee issued IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine IFRIC 20, effective 1 January 2013.
Prior to the issuance of IFRIC 20, the accounting for production stripping costs had been based on general IFRS principles and the Framework, as IFRS had no specific guidance.
Previously, the Group deferred production stripping costs for those operations where this was considered to be the most appropriate basis for matching the cost against the related economic benefits and the effect was material.
This was generally the case where there were fluctuations in stripping ratios over the life of the mine.
The amount of stripping costs deferred was based on the life of mine average strip ratio that was obtained by dividing the total tonnage of waste expected to be mined over the life of the mine by the quantity e. g. tonnes of economically recoverable reserves expected to be mined across the life of the mine expected to be contained in the economically recoverable reserves.
Production stripping costs incurred in the period were deferred to the extent that the current period actual strip ratio exceeded the life of the mine average strip ratio.
The amount capitalised was subsequently depreciated over the expected useful life of the identified component of the ore body related to the stripping activity, by using the units of production method.
The life of mine ratio was based on economically recoverable reserves of the mine.
IFRIC 20 now provides specific guidance on how to account for production stripping costs.
It requires such costs to be capitalised where the recognition criteria set out in IFRIC 20 are met.
IFRIC 20 differs from the life of mine average strip ratio approach in a number of ways these include: The level at which production stripping costs are to be assessed i. e. at a component level rather than a life of mine level: and The way in which any stripping activity assets are to be depreciated.
In addition, specific transitional rules are provided to deal with any opening deferred stripping balances an entity may have recognised under its previous accounting policy.
Identification of stripping activity assets The first difference in the new guidance is the requirement to identify the components of each ore body.
This will determine whether any stripping activity assets should be recognised and if so, the level at which such assets is initially recognised.
IFRIC 20 defines a component as a specific volume of the ore body that is made more accessible by the stripping activity.
An identified component of the ore body is considered to typically be a subset phases of production of the total ore body of the mine.
This suggests a lower unit of account than the entire life of mine, which is used in the current life of mine average strip ratio approach.
It is considered that a mine may have several components, which are to be identified based on the mine plan.
As well as providing a basis for measuring the costs reliably at recognition stage, the identification of components is necessary for the subsequent depreciation or amortisation of the stripping activity asset s, which will take place as each identified component is mined.

com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements Depreciation of the stripping activity asset s The second difference in the new guidance relates to the way in which the stripping activity asset s are depreciated.
Under the life of mine average strip ratio approach, the deferred stripping balance was released to profit or loss or effectively depreciated when the actual ratio fell below the average expected ratio.
Under IFRIC 20, any stripping activity asset s will be depreciated or amortised over the expected useful life of the identified component of the ore body that is made more accessible by the activity, on a basis that best reflects the consumption of economic benefits.
IFRIC 20 requires the units of production method to be applied unless another method is more appropriate.
Refer to note 2 e for further information on the depreciation method applied by the Group.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRIC 20, this new policy has been applied prospectively from the start of the comparative period, being 1 January 2012.
