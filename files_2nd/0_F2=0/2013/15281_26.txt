98 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013 Company financial statements Derivative financial instruments The Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk, including cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date.
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the profit and loss account depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
The Company designates certain derivatives as fair value hedges.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Fair value hedge accounting Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the profit and loss account, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The Company only applies fair value hedge accounting for foreign currency exposure associated with the underlying hedged item.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is also recognised in the profit and loss account.
Net borrowings Net borrowings represents cash and cash equivalents together with short and long-term borrowings, as adjusted for the effect of related derivative instruments irrespective of whether they qualify for hedge accounting.
Pension funding In accordance with FRS17, the Company accounts for its contributions to the dened benets scheme as if it were a dened contribution scheme because it is not possible to identify the Companys share of the assets and liabilities in the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis.
The UK dened benefit scheme is funded, with the assets of the scheme held separately from those of the Group, in separate trustee-administered funds.
Payments to dened contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
