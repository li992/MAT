Maturity analysis All of the Companys financial liabilities have a maturity of less than one year 2012: less than one year.
7.6 Investments in Subsidiaries Accounting policy The Companys investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less provisions resulting from impairment.
In testing for impairment the carrying value of the investment is compared to its recoverable amount, being its fair value less costs of disposal.
The fair value is based on the discounted future net cash flows of oil and gas assets held by the subsidiary, using estimated cash flow projections over the licence period.
For exploration assets, the discounted cash flows are risk-weighted for future exploration success.
Discounted future net cash flows for IAS 36 purposes are calculated using an estimated short and long-term oil price of US$90 per boe 2012: short and long-term oil price of US$90 per boe, or the appropriate gas price as dictated by the relevant gas sales contract, escalation for prices and costs of 2.5%, and a discount rate of 10% 2012: 2.5% and 10% respectively.

Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 139 Appendices to the Group and Company Financial Statements Appendix 1 Prior Year Corporate Acquisitions Agora Oil & Gas AS On 9 May 2012, Cairn Energy PLC completed the acquisition of 100 per cent of the issued share capital of Agora Oil & Gas AS.
Agora Oil & Gas AS was a private Norwegian company with non-operated exploration assets in both the Norwegian North Sea and, through its wholly owned subsidiary Agora Oil and Gas UK Limited, in the United Kingdom North Sea.
The acquisition included Agoras 15% stake in the Catcher asset and its 20% interest in the Skarfjell discovery.
Nautical Petroleum plc On 8 August 2012, Capricorn Energy completed the acquisition of 100 per cent of the issued share capital of Nautical Petroleum plc.
Nautical was an independent oil and gas exploration and production company, incorporated in England and Wales and headquartered in London.
Nauticals assets include exploration assets nearing development in the United Kingdom North Sea including interests in the Catcher, Kraken and Mariner fields and further exploration licences in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and Morocco.

Similarly, the goodwill of US$259.6m recognised on the acquisition of Nautical also arises largely from deferred tax provided of US$269.4m on the temporary taxable difference between the fair value of intangible exploration appraisal assets acquired and their respective tax base costs.
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Consideration and costs of acquisition The fair value of the 47,662,603 ordinary shares issued as part of the consideration paid for Agora Oil and Gas AS US$256.9m was determined on the basis of Cairn Energy PLCs closing share price on 9 May 2012 of 3.39 US$5.39.
All other consideration was settled in cash.
Acquisition costs of US$11.2m are included within other expenses.
US$4.3m relates to the acquisition of Agora with the remaining US$6.9m relating to Nautical.
Impact on profit for the year The Groups profit has been reduced by the Agora Group loss of US$53.7m and reduced by the Nautical Group loss of US$4.4m for the period between the respective dates of acquisition and 31 December 2012.
Had the results of both Nautical Petroleum plc and Agora Oil and Gas AS and their subsidiaries been included in the full years results to 31 December 2012, Cairns profit for the year would have been US$60.6m.

The Board of Cairn Energy PLC reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these are summarised below.
The Groups treasury function and Executive Team as appropriate are responsible for managing these risks, in accordance with the policies set by the Board.
Management of these risks is carried out by monitoring of cash flows, investment and funding requirements using a variety of techniques.
These potential exposures are managed whilst ensuring that the Company and the Group have adequate liquidity at all times in order to meet their immediate cash requirements.
There are no significant concentrations of risks unless otherwise stated.
The primary financial instruments comprise bank loans, cash, short and medium-term deposits, certificates of deposit, money market liquidity, listed equity shares, intra-group loans and other receivables and financial liabilities held at amortised cost.
The Groups strategy has been to finance its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
Other alternatives such as equity and other forms of non-investment-grade debt finance are reviewed by the Board, whenappropriate.
Liquidity risk The Group currently has surplus cash which it has placed in a combination of money market liquidity funds and term deposits with a number of international and UKfinancial institutions, ensuring sufficient liquidity to enable the Group to meet its short medium-term expenditure requirements.
The Group is conscious of the current environment and constantly monitors counterparty risk.
Policies are in place to limit counterparty exposure and maturity.
The Group monitors counterparties using published ratings and other measures.
Repayment of principal is the overriding priority and this is achieved by diversification and shorter maturities to provideflexibility.
At the year end the Group has a NOK 500m Exploration Finance Facility with SEB Stockholms Enskilda Bank based on floating NIBOR Norwegian InterBank Offered Rate rates.
Cairn entered into this facility through the acquisition of Agora Oil and Gas AS, now Capricorn Norge AS.
Under the facility Capricorn Norge AS can draw 95% of the tax refund due on Norwegian exploration expenditure in the year.
At the year end US$55.3m NOK 335m was drawn under this facility.
The facility was repaid in full and cancelled on 20 January 2014.
At 31 December 2012 Cairn Energy PLC Group had a total of US$55.0m of facilities in place to cover the issue of performance guarantees.
During the year these facilities were increased to US$60.0m.
Fixed rates of bank commission and chargesapplied to these facilities.
US$33.8m was utilised as at 31 December 2013.
On 21February 2014 the facilities were further increased to US$100.0m.
Cairn Energy PLC also issued a US$100.0m letter of credit on 22 July 2013 as required under the membership of the Oil Spill Response Schemes Cap and Contain arrangement.
This guarantee is cash backed with US$100.0m being placed with BNP Paribas to support the letter of credit.
Interest rate risk Surplus funds are placed on short medium-term deposits at floating rates.
It is Cairns policy to invest with banks or other financial institutions that first of all offer what is perceived as the greatest security and, second, the most competitive interest rate.
Managing counterparty risk is considered the priority.
Short medium-term borrowing arrangements are generally entered into at floating rates.
From time to time the Group may opt to manage a proportion of the interest costs by using derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps.
At this time, however, there are no such instruments 2012: none.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Groups loss before tax to a change in interest rates through the impact on floating rate borrowings andinvestments.
2013 2012 Effect on Effect on equity and equity and loss before loss before tax tax US$m US$m 50 point increase in interest rates 8.9 12.8 50 point decrease in interest rates 2.1 3.8 Foreign currency risk Cairn manages exposures that arise from non-functional currency receipts and payments by matching receipts and payments in the same currency and actively managing the residual net position.
Generally the exposure has been limited given that receipts and payments have mostly been in US dollars and the functional currency of most companies in the Group is US dollars.
The Group also aims where possible to hold surplus cash, debt and working capital balances in functional currency which in most cases is US dollars, thereby matchingthe reporting currency and functional currency of most companies in the Group.
This minimises the impact of foreign exchange movements on the Groups Balance Sheet.
Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 143 Appendices to the Group and Company Financial Statements Continued Appendix 3 Financial Risk Management: Objectives and Policies Continued Where residual net exposures do exist and they are considered significant the Company and Group may from time to time, opt to use derivative financial instruments to minimise its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to movements in the US$:GBP exchange rates, with all other variables held constant, on the Groups and the Companys monetary assets and liabilities.
The Groups and the Companys exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material.

Joint venture partners are subject to a risk assessment using publicly available information and credit reference agencies, with follow up due diligence and monitoring if required.
Investment credit risk for investments with banks and other financial institutions is managed by the Group Treasury function in accordance with the Board approved policies of Cairn Energy PLC.
Investments of surplus funds are only made with approved counterparties who meet the appropriate rating and or other criteria, and are only made within approved limits.
The Board continually re-assesses the Groups policy and updates as required.
The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through counterparty failure.
At the year end the Group does not have any significant concentrations of bad debt risk.
As at 31 December 2013 the Group had investments with 33 counterparties 2012: 32 to ensure no concentration of counterparty investment risk.
The maturity of these investments ranged from instant access to three months.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by the carrying value as at the Balance Sheet date.
Market risk: equity price risk The Group is exposed to equity price risks arising from the listed equity investments it holds in Cairn India Limited.
Equity investments are held for strategic rather than trading purposes and the Group does not actively trade these investments, which are classified as available-for-sale.
Movements in the fair value during the year are recognised directly in equity and are disclosed in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The cumulative gain or loss that arises on disposal of available-for-sale financial assets is recycled through the Income Statement.
Further details on the impact of equity price movements on the fair value of the available-for-sale financial assets are included in section 3.1.
144 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Strategic Review Leadership and Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Appendices to the Group and Company Financial Statements Continued Appendix 4 Share-based Payments Cairn Energy PLC Group and Company The schemes below apply for both Group and Company.
Cairn Energy PLC share options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the year, subject to the normal employee dealing bans imposed at certain times by the Company.
The weighted average share price during the year was 2.753 2012: 2.987.
The Cairn Energy PLC share awards during 2013 were valued using a Monte Carlo model with the exception of the SIP awards which were valued using a BlackScholes model.
Awards in prior years were valued using a binomial model.
The main inputs to the models include the number of options, share price, leaver rate, trigger points, discount rate and volatility.
Leaver rate assumptions are based on past history of employees leaving the Company prior to options vesting and are revised to equal the number of options that ultimately vest.
Trigger points are based on the length of time after the vesting periods for awards in 2013.
Awards in prior years have trigger points based on the profit points at which the relevant percentage of employees are assumed to exercise their options.
The risk-free rate is based on the yield on a zero coupon Government bond with a term equal to the expected term on the option being valued.
Volatility was determined as the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the shares of a peer group of similar companies selected from the FTSE, as disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 96, over a 10 year period to the date of award.
The following assumptions and inputs apply to the share plans detailed in section 5.4: Lapse due to Risk-free rate withdrawals Scheme name Volatility per annum per annum 2010 Share Incentive Plan 34% 52% 0% 0.69% 5% 2009 Approved and Unapproved Plans 34% 52% 0.29% 4.4% 5% 2009 LTIP 34% 52% 0% 0.29% 0% 5% 2012 Share awards 34% 52% 5% Employee exercise trigger point assumptions For 2013 awards, the assumption used for all schemes other than the SIP is that employees will exercise half of the awards on the vesting date and the remaining half will be exercised equally each year over the following seven years.
The assumption used for the valuation of the SIP is that employees will withdraw shares five years after the award date.
The following assumptions on employee exercise trigger points are applicable to all awards made before 31 December 2012: 25% 50% 75% 100% 125% profit profit profit profit profit No trigger Percentage of employees exercising options 15% 25% 25% 15% 10% 10% For details on the vesting conditions attached to the LTIPs refer to the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 94 to 96.
