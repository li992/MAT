Fair values The fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values.
The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments: Derivatives The fair value of interest rate and cross-currency swaps is calculated based on expected future principal and interest cash flows discounted using market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
In 2013 and in 2012, the valuation methods of all of the Groups derivative financial instruments carried at fair value are categorised as Level 2.
Level 2 is defined as inputs, other than quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on expected future principal and interest cash flows discounted using market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Contingent consideration Fair value is calculated based on the amounts expected to be paid, determined by reference to forecasts of future performance of the acquired businesses discounted using market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date and the probability of contingent events and targets being achieved.
In 2013 and in 2012, the valuation methods of all of the Groups contingent consideration carried at fair value are categorised as Level 3.
Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Groups contingent consideration are forecast revenue growth rates 2013: 5%11%, forecast EBITDA margins 2013: 9%13% and pre-tax discount rates 2013: 12%22%.
Contingent consideration The following table shows a reconciliation from the opening to closing balances for Level 3 fair values: m At 1 January 2013 0.7 Charge for the year note 7 4.8 Assumed within business combinations note 4 9.0 Payments 5.5 Unwind of contingent consideration note 7 0.4 1 Exchange differences 0.9 At 31 December 2013 8.5 1 Included in other comprehensive income.
The fair value measurement of the contingent consideration could be affected if the forecast revenue growth rates or forecast EBITDA margins are different to those stated above.
A higher forecast revenue growth rate or higher EBITDA margin may increase the value of the contingent consideration payable.
Trade and other payables and receivables and construction work in progress For payables and receivables with a remaining life of one year or less, the carrying amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
All other payables and receivables are discounted using market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.

Details of the terms and conditions of the Performance Share Plan are set out in the Directors remuneration report on pages 40 to 56.
Under the 2001 Plans, the option price is the average of the share price for the three days preceding the date of grant.
Under the Performance Share Plan, all awards have an exercise price of 1 per exercise.

Under IFRS 2, the fair value of services received in return for share options granted is measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
The estimate of the fair value of share options granted is measured based on a stochastic model.
The contractual life of the option is used as an input into this model, with expectations of early exercise being incorporated into the model.
The inputs into the stochastic model are as follows: 2013 2012 944.0p Weighted average share price 425.0p 0.0p Weighted average exercise price 0.0p 39.0% Expected volatility 41.3% 3 years Expected life 3 years 0.62% Risk free rate 0.58% 2.40% Expected dividend yield 5.36% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three years, adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.
The recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have not been applied to options granted before 7 November 2002 in accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 and IFRS 2.
The Group recognised total expenses included in operating costs of 1.9m 2012: 1.3m related to equity-settled, share-based payment transactions.

Under the Scheme, employees are normally entitled to retirement benefits on attainment of a retirement age of 65.
The Scheme is subject to UK pensions legislation which, inter alia, provides for the regulation of work-based pension schemes by the Pensions Regulator.
The Trustees are aware of and adhere to the Codes of Practice issued by the Pensions Regulator.
The Scheme Trustees currently comprise one member-nominated Trustee and one employer-nominated Trustee.
The employer-nominated Trustee is also the Chair of the Trustees.
The Scheme exposes the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk, which are managed through the investment strategy to acceptable levels.
The Scheme can invest in a wide range of asset classes including equities, bonds, cash, property, alternatives including private equity, commodities, hedge funds, infrastructure, currency, high yield debt and derivatives and annuity policies.
Any investment in derivative instruments is only made to contribute to a reduction in the overall level of risk in the portfolio or for the purposes of efficient portfolio management.
With effect from the most recent actuarial valuation date 5 April 2011, the Group has agreed to continue to pay annual contributions of 1.5m.

Benefits under these schemes are no longer granted to new employees and only apply to employees who joined the Group prior to 1991.
These defined benefit retirement obligations are funded on the Groups balance sheet and obligations are met as and when required by the Group.
