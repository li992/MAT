Financial statements Notes to the Company financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments and on a going concern basis as described in the going concern statement in the Directors report on page 74.
The following accounting policies have been used consistently throughout the year and the preceding year in accordance with UK GAAP.
Cash flow statement The Company has taken the advantage of the exemption under FRS 1 revised not to disclose a cash flow statement.
Investments Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries and associates are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
For investments in subsidiaries acquired for consideration, including the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief, cost is measured by reference to the nominal value only of the shares issued.
Foreign currencies Transactions in currencies other than Sterling are recorded at the rate of exchange on the date of the transaction.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the relevant balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of non-monetary items at each balance sheet date are included in the profit or loss for the accounting period.
Tax The charge for tax is based on the profit or loss for the year and takes into account tax deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes.
Provision is made for deferred tax on all timing differences except those arising from the revaluation of fixed assets for which there is no binding agreement to sell on property gains if it is anticipated that rollover relief will be available and on the undistributed profits of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates at which it is estimated the tax will arise.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
The deferred tax provision is not discounted to net present value.
Financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value and then for reporting purposes are remeasured to fair value at each subsequent balance sheet date.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risks, foreign currency risks and fuel price risks.
Use of such financial instruments is governed by policies and delegated authorities approved by the Board.
The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
In relation to fuel price risks, the Companys profit and loss account is affected by transactions with affiliated companies that give rise to cash flow volatility associated with fuel price risk.
The main derivative financial instruments used by the Company are interest rate swaps and collars, fuel swaps and collars, and cross currency interest rate swaps.
Such instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at the reported balance sheet date.
The fair values are calculated by reference to market exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices at the period end, and supported by counterparty confirmations.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges or foreign currency hedges of a foreign net investment are recognised in the profit and loss account as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the profit and loss account for the period.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Related party transactions As permitted under FRS 8, Related party transactions, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption not to disclose transactions between Group companies.
Debt Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after the deduction of issue costs.
The carrying amount is increased by the amortisation of debt issuance fees in respect of the accounting period and reduced by repayments made in the period.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Companys financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
