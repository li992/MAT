NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST NCI The non-controlling interest relates to the 29% share in Online owned by Playtech Limited Playtech during the prior and part of the current period.
On 15 April 2013, the Group purchased Playtechs stake in the Online business for a cash consideration of 423.8m.
As this was a transaction with minority equity owners of the business without a change of control, it has been recognised as an equity transaction in the Groups reserves and not as a business combination or investment.
Directly attributable costs of 2.8m have been recorded in equity along with a receipt of 3.5m representing a subsequent working capital adjustment.
A liability of 9.7m, representing fixed annual fees due to Playtech, was also reversed through equity following the end of the underlying obligation.
As a result of the purchase of this minority stake, the financial statements show a nil non-controlling interest in the Statement of Financial Position and present a non-controlling share of profits only up to 14 April 2013, being 15.3m.
A reconciliation of the movements in non-controlling interests is provided in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
