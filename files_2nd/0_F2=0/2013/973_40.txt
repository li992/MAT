ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES COAL estimates as at 31 December 2013 METALLURGICAL COAL The Coal Reserve and Coal Resource estimates were compiled in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves The JORC Code, 2012 as a minimum standard.
The figures reported represent 100% of the Coal Reserves and Coal Resources, the percentage attributable to Anglo American plc is stated separately.
Rounding of figures may cause computational discrepancies.
Anglo American Metallurgical Coal comprises export metallurgical and thermal coal operations located in Australia and Canada.
Mine Life The extraction period in years for scheduled Ore Reserves comprising Proved and Probable Reserves only.
For the multi-product operations, the ROM tonnes apply to each product.
The Saleable tonnes cannot be calculated directly from the ROM reserve tonnes using the air dried yields as presented since the difference in moisture content is not taken into account.
Attributable percentages for country totals are weighted by Saleable tonnes and should not be directly applied to the ROM tonnes.
Footnotes appear at the end of the section.
