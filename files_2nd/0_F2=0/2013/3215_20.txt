EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS AND CERTAIN RE-MEASUREMENTS Exceptional items are those items which are of a non-recurring nature, and in the judgement of the Directors, need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their nature, size or incidence.
Items which may be considered exceptional in nature include disposals of businesses, business restructurings, significant onerous contract charges and asset write-downs.

These contracts are economically related to our upstream assets, capacity off-take contracts or downstream demand, which are typically not fair valued, and are therefore separately identified in the current period and reflected in business performance in future periods when the underlying transaction or asset impacts the Group Income Statement.

ii Following reserve and resources downgrades, and increases in expected costs on the Seven Seas, York and Ensign fields in the Southern North Sea, the Group recognised pre-tax impairment charges of 166 million post-tax charge 63 million on the Seven Seas field, 221 million post-tax charge 97 million on the York field, and 225 million post-tax charge 92 million on the Ensign field in the Centrica Energy Gas segment.
As a result of the weaker outlook for North American natural gas prices, and an increase in the discount rate applicable to these assets, the Group recognised a pre-tax Income Statement impairment charge of 87 million post-tax charge 66 million in relation to the Canadian Upstream assets held prior to the Suncor Upstream acquisition, in the Centrica Energy Gas segment.
A further 20 million charge 15 million net of taxation was recognised in other comprehensive income to reverse previous upwards revaluations of the impaired assets, giving a total impairment of the Canadian Upstream assets held prior to the Suncor Upstream acquisition, of 107 million.
Further details on how the recoverable amounts of fields are calculated, on a FVLCS basis, are provided in note S2.
iii In light of weak economics for storage projects, and following announcements regarding future government support for gas storage in the UK, the Group announced its decision not to proceed with the Baird offshore gas storage project and to put the onshore project at Caythorpe on hold indefinitely.
As a result, the Group has recorded pre-tax impairments and provision charges totalling 240 million post-tax charge 224 million in the Centrica Storage segment.
Goodwill 33 million, property, plant and equipment 105 million and investments in joint ventures and associates 55 million have been written off during the year, and an onerous capacity contract provision of 47 million was recognised.

TAXATION Tax on items taken directly to equity is disclosed in note S4.
The Group earns the majority of its profits in the UK.
Most activities in the UK are subject to the standard rate for UK corporation tax, which from 1 April 2013 was 23% 2012: 24%.
Upstream oil and gas production activities are taxed at a UK corporation tax rate of 30% 2012: 30% plus a supplementary charge of 32% 2012: 32% to give an overall rate of 62% 2012: 62%.
In addition, certain upstream assets in the UK bear petroleum revenue tax PRT at 50% 2012: 50% which is deductible against corporation tax, giving an overall effective rate of 81% 2012: 81%.
Norwegian upstream profits are taxed at the standard rate of 28% 2012: 28% plus a special tax of 50% 2012: 50% resulting in an aggregate tax rate of 78%.
Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in those respective jurisdictions.
On 2 July 2013, the UK Government substantively enacted Finance Act 2013 which included reductions in the main UK corporation tax rate to 20% by 1 April 2015.
At 31 December 2013, the relevant UK deferred tax assets and liabilities included in these Financial Statements have been based on the reduced rates.
The deferred tax revaluation benefit recognised from the adoption of the reduced rates is not expected to recur in future periods.
b Factors affecting the tax charge The differences between the total tax shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax to the profit before tax are as follows: 2013 2012 Exceptional items Business Exceptional items Results for Business and certain Results for performance and certain the year performance re-measurements the year restated i re-measurements restated i Year ended 31 December m m m m m m i Profit before tax 2,275 626 1,649 2,353 63 2,416 Less: share of profits in joint ventures and associates, 146 25 171 net of interest and taxation 140 6 134 Group profit before tax 2,129 651 1,478 2,213 69 2,282 Tax on profit at standard UK corporation tax rate of i 23.25% 2012: 24.5% 495 151 344 543 17 560 Effects of: Net expenses not deductible for tax purposes 7 61 68 77 56 133 Additional charges applicable to upstream profits 357 241 116 235 11 246 UK petroleum revenue tax rates 131 131 149 149 ii Non-UK tax rates 41 53 94 39 6 45 Movement in unrecognised deferred tax assets 22 30 52 20 20 i Changes to tax rates 64 5 59 32 50 18 47 47 Adjustments in respect of prior years Taxation on profit for the year 942 243 699 1,031 140 1,171 i See note 1 a. ii Excludes additional Non-UK tax applicable to upstream profits.
c Factors that may affect future tax charges The Groups effective tax rates are impacted by changes to the mix of activities and production across the territories in which it operates.
The Groups UK profits earned away from gas and oil production will benefit from reduced rates of corporation tax in 2014 and beyond 21% from 1 April 2014 and 20% from 1 April 2015.
Profits from oil and gas production in the UK continue to be taxed at rates above the UK statutory rate and PRT will continue to be applied to certain upstream profits.
The PRT borne is expected to decrease as production activity in the relevant fields declines over time.
Income earned in territories outside the UK, notably in the US and Norway, is generally subject to higher effective rates of tax than the current UK statutory rate.
In the medium term, the Groups effective tax rate is expected to remain above the UK statutory rate.

TAXATION Differences between current tax charged and taxes paid arose principally due to the following factors: corporation tax payments are generally based on estimated profits, partly during the year and partly in the following year and cash tax balancing on agreement with tax authorities will also occur in future periods.
Fluctuations in profits from year to year may therefore give rise to divergence between the charge for the current year and taxes paid: and petroleum revenue tax payments are based on income realised in the preceding period, with subsequent adjustments to reflect actual profits.
Variations in production from period to period may therefore lead to temporary differences between the tax charged and the tax paid.
EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE Earnings per share EPS is the amount of profit attributable to each share.
Basic EPS is the amount of profit for the year divided by the number of shares in issue during the year.
Diluted EPS includes the impact of outstanding share options as if they were exercised at the year end.
Basic earnings per ordinary share has been calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company for the year of 950 million 2012: 1,245 million by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 5,150 million 2012: 5,183 million.
The number of shares excludes 50 million ordinary shares 2012: 6 million, being the weighted average number of the Companys own shares held in the employee share trust and treasury shares purchased by the Group as part of the share repurchase programme.
The Directors believe that the presentation of adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share, being the basic earnings per ordinary share adjusted for certain re-measurements, exceptional items and the impact of the Strategic Investments acquired in 2009, assists with understanding the underlying performance of the Group, as explained in note 2.
14 During the year, the Group purchased 137.3 million ordinary shares of 6 81 pence each, representing 2.7% of the called up share capital as at 31 December 2013 at an average price of 3.64 per share for a total consideration including expenses of 502 million.
The shares were purchased as part of the 500 million share repurchase programme announced on 4 February 2013.
These shares are held as treasury shares once purchased and are deducted from equity see note S4.
In addition to basic and adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share, information is presented for diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per ordinary share.
Under this presentation, no adjustments are made to the reported earnings for either 2013 or 2012, however the weighted average number of shares used as the denominator is adjusted for potentially dilutive ordinary shares.

EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE Strategic Investments During 2009, the Group acquired a 20% interest in British Energy and the entire share capital of Venture.
As explained in note 2, the depreciation relating to fair value uplifts of the acquired Venture PP&E and associated taxation is excluded in arriving at adjusted earnings for the year, which amounted to 48 million 2012: 67 million depreciation and a taxation credit of 29 million 2012: 40 million in the period.
Additionally, the impact of depreciation arising on fair value uplifts attributed to the British Energy nuclear power stations and related taxation included within the Groups share of the post-taxation results of the associate is excluded in arriving at adjusted earnings for the period, which amounted to 18 million 2012: 29 million net of taxation.
DIVIDENDS Dividends represent the cash return of profits to shareholders and are paid twice a year, in June and November.
Dividends are paid as an amount per ordinary share held.
We retain part of the profits generated in the year to meet future investment plans or to fund share repurchase programmes.

ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS Business combinations The Group has acquired a number of businesses during the year, including Hess Energy Marketing LLC HEM in the US and a package of gas and oil assets from Suncor Energy in Canada in partnership with Qatar Petroleum International QPI.
The business combinations section details the consideration paid, net assets acquired and the goodwill arising on these acquisitions.
The fair values are provisional unless stated otherwise.
Note 3 a sets out the assumptions used to derive the fair values.
Goodwill recognised on the following acquisitions is attributable to enhanced geographical presence, cost savings, synergies, growth opportunities and technical goodwill from items such as deferred tax.
Suncor Upstream The Group formed a 60:40 partnership CQ Energy Canada Partnership, CQECP with QPI and, on 26 September 2013, jointly acquired a package of producing conventional natural gas and crude oil assets and associated infrastructure located in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin from Suncor Energy for consideration of C$987 million 601 million.
The Group and QPI funded this acquisition using a mixture of equity and debt in CQECP.
As described in note 3 a, the Group has judged that it has power over the relevant activities of CQECP and hence it will fully consolidate this entity.
Accordingly, the Suncor acquisition is treated as a business combination of the Group and a purchase price allocation was performed.
The 40% equity interest owned by QPI is shown as a non-controlling interest and is recognised at the acquisition date fair value calculated using the income approach which equals the equity cash injected by QPI into CQECP.
The 40% financial liability due to QPI is included within other payables.
Goodwill arising on the transaction is not deductible for tax purposes.
This business forms part of the Centrica Energy Gas segment.
Hess Energy Marketing The Group acquired 100% of the New Jersey-based energy marketing business, HEM, from Hess Corporation on 1 November 2013, for consideration of $1,194 million 736 million.
This included a payment for the working capital of the business of approximately $416 million 257 million.
A purchase price allocation was performed and goodwill arising is deductible for tax purposes.
Included in the opening balance sheet is $586 million 361 million related to the fair value of the trade receivables, with a gross contractual amount of $613 million 378 million.
This business forms part of the Direct Energy Business energy supply segment.
Bounce Energy On 13 August 2013 the Group acquired a 100% equity interest in the privately-owned Texas-based electricity retailer Bounce Energy Bounce for $42 million 27 million in cash.
Goodwill of $47 million 30 million was recognised and is not tax deductible.
This business forms part of the Direct Energy Residential energy supply segment.
Americas Water Heater Rentals On 11 October 2013 the Group acquired a 100% equity interest in the privately owned Americas Water Heater Rentals AWHR for consideration of $30 million 18 million.
The business rents water heaters to approximately 89,000 residential customers.
A tax deductible goodwill of $7 million 4 million arose on acquisition.
This business forms part of the Direct Energy Residential and business services segment.

i QPI injected 237 million of cash into CQECP, of which 81 million was equity, upon acquisition of Suncor Upstream.
This equated to 40% of the initial purchase consideration of 592 million.
At the same time, Centrica injected 355 million of cash into CQECP, of which 121 million was equity.
The deferred consideration of 9 million will be funded directly by the operations of CQECP rather than further contributions from its owners.

ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS Pro forma information The pro forma consolidated results of the Group, as if the acquisitions had been made at the beginning of the year, would show revenue of 30,584 million compared to reported revenue of 26,571 million and profit after taxation of 1,019 million compared to reported profit after taxation of 950 million.
This pro forma information includes the revenue and profits losses made by the acquired businesses between the beginning of the financial year and the date of acquisition, not restated for accounting policy alignments and or the impact of the fair value uplifts resulting from purchase accounting considerations.
This pro forma aggregated information is not necessarily indicative of the results of the combined Group that would have occurred had the acquisitions actually been made at the beginning of the year presented, or indicative of the future results of the combined Group.
Note that despite the fact that the Group controls the relevant activities of CQECP, dividends are subject to unanimous consent of the partnership owners.
This means that dividends are restricted as they require QPI approval.
At the balance sheet date, cash and cash equivalents held by CQECP amounted to 66 million.
If these funds were to be distributed as a dividend to owners, on a 60:40 basis, the non-controlling interests would be entitled to 26 million of the cash paid from the partnership.
2012 Business Combinations fair value updates There have been no significant updates in 2013 to the fair values recognised for businesses acquired in 2012.
Asset purchases UK shale gas On 13 June 2013, the Group acquired a 25% interest in the Bowland exploration licence in Lancashire from Cuadrilla Resources Ltd and AJ Lucas Group Ltd for 44 million in cash.
The Group is committed to pay exploration and appraisal costs of up to 6 million included in Other intangible assets in note 23 and may pay up to 45 million additional costs under a carry arrangement which is contingent on consents being received.
Following the exploration and appraisal phase, if the Group elects to continue into the development phase, a further contingent consideration of 60 million will become payable.
Disposals The Group has disposed of a number of businesses and assets during the year.

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL The Group Balance Sheet contains significant intangible assets.
Goodwill, customer relationships and brands arise when we acquire a business.
Goodwill is attributable to enhanced geographical presence, cost savings, synergies and growth opportunities.
Goodwill is not amortised but is assessed for recoverability each year.
The Group uses European Union Allowances EUAs and Renewable Obligation Certificates ROCs to satisfy its related obligations.
Upstream exploration and evaluation expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset until development of the asset commences, at which point it is transferred to property, plant and equipment or is deemed to not be commercially viable and is written down.

Some 144 million 2012: 157 million of these losses will expire within one to five years.
All other temporary differences have no expiry date.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these temporary differences, due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.

TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES The provision for credit losses is based on an incurred loss model and is determined by application of expected default and loss factors, determined by historical loss experience and current sampling to the various balances receivable from residential and business customers on a portfolio basis, in addition to provisions taken against individual accounts.
Balances are written off when recoverability is assessed as being remote.
The impairment charge in trade receivables is stated net of credits for the release of specific provisions made in previous years, which are no longer required.
These relate primarily to residential customers in the UK.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage the risk arising from fluctuations in the value of certain assets or liabilities, associated with treasury management, energy sales and procurement.
These derivatives are held at fair value, and are predominantly unrealised positions, expected to unwind in future periods.
The Group also uses derivatives for proprietary energy trading purposes.
Purpose Accounting treatment Proprietary energy trading Carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the Groups results for the year before exceptional i and treasury management items and certain re-measurements ii Energy procurement Carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reflected in certain re-measurements i With the exception of certain energy derivatives related to cross-border transportation and capacity contracts.
ii Energy contracts designated at fair value through profit or loss include certain energy contracts that the Group has, at its option, designated at fair value through profit or loss under IAS 39 because the energy contract contains one or more embedded derivatives that significantly modify the cash flows under the contract note S2.
In cases where a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting, derivatives are classified as fair value hedges, or cash flow hedges.
Notes S2 and S5 provide further detail on the Groups hedge accounting.

The estimate has been based on 2P reserves, price levels and technology at the balance sheet date.
The timing of decommissioning payments is dependent on the lives of the facilities but is expected to occur by 2067, with the majority of the provision being utilised between 2020 and 2030. iii The purchase contract loss provision relates to a number of European gas transportation contracts, the Rijnmond tolling contract and Direct Energy wind farm power purchase agreements.
The majority of the provision is expected to be utilised by 2020. iv Includes transfers to from other Balance Sheet accounts including retirement benefit obligations and liabilities of disposal groups classified as held for sale.
POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS The Group manages a number of final salary and career average defined benefit pension schemes.
It also has defined contribution schemes.
The majority of these schemes are in the UK.

The Centrica Engineers Pension Scheme CEPS, Centrica Pension Plan CPP and Centrica Pension Scheme CPS form the significant majority of the Groups defined benefit obligation and are referred to below as the Registered Pension Schemes.
The other schemes are individually, and in aggregate, immaterial.
Independent valuations The Registered Pensions Schemes are subject to independent valuations at least every three years, on the basis of which the qualified actuary certifies the rate of employer contributions which, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees and proceeds from the schemes assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the schemes.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out at the following dates: the Registered Pensions Schemes at 31 March 2012 and the Direct Energy Marketing Limited Pension Plan at 31 December 2012.
These have been updated to 31 December 2013 for the purposes of meeting the requirements of IAS 19.
Investments have been valued for this purpose at market value.
Governance The Registered Pension Schemes are managed by trustee companies whose boards consist of both company-nominated and member-nominated Directors.
Each scheme holds units in the Centrica Combined Common Investment Fund CCCIF, which holds the majority of the combined assets of the participating schemes.
The board of the CCCIF is currently comprised of nine Directors: three independent Directors, three Directors appointed by Centrica plc including the Chairman and one Director appointed by each of the three participating schemes.
Under the terms of the Pensions Act 2004, Centrica plc and each trustee board must agree the funding rate for its defined benefit pension scheme and a recovery plan to fund any deficit against the scheme-specific statutory funding objective.
This approach was first adopted for the triennial valuations completed at 31 March 2006, and has been reflected in subsequent valuations, including the 31 March 2012 valuations.
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 | 123 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Operating Assets and Liabilities 22.
POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS b Risks The Registered Pension Schemes expose the Group to the following risks: Asset volatility The pension liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to AA corporate bond yields: if the growth in plan assets is lower than this, this will create an actuarial loss within other equity.
The CCCIF is responsible for managing the assets of each scheme in line with the liability related investment objectives that have been set by the trustees of the schemes, and invests in a diversified portfolio of assets.
The schemes are relatively young in nature the schemes opened in 1997 on the formation of Centrica plc on demerger from BG plc formerly British Gas plc, and only took on liabilities in respect of active employees.
Therefore, the CCCIF holds a significant proportion of return seeking assets: such assets are generally expected to provide a higher return than corporate bonds, but result in greater exposure to volatility and risk in the short-term.
The investment objectives are to achieve a target return above a return based on a portfolio of gilts, subject to a maximum volatility ceiling.
If there have been advantageous asset movements relative to liabilities above a set threshold, then fide-risking is undertaken, and as a consequence the return target and maximum volatility ceiling are reduced.
Whilst there is no explicit target for the level or rate of fide-risking, the pace of fide-risking is regularly monitored and is typically restricted to once a quarter.
Interest rate A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the net present value of the pension liabilities.
The relative immaturity of the schemes means that the duration of the liabilities is longer than average for typical UK pension schemes, resulting in a relatively higher exposure to interest rate risk.
Inflation Pensions in deferment, pensions in payment and pensions accrued under the career average schemes increase in line with the Retail Price Index and the Consumer Price Index.
Therefore scheme liabilities will increase if inflation is higher than assumed, although in some cases caps are in place to limit the impact of significant movements in inflation.
Longevity The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of scheme members and their surviving spouses: therefore increases in expected life expectancy will result in an increase in the pension liabilities.
The relative immaturity of the schemes means that there is comparatively little observable mortality data to assess the rates of mortality experienced by the schemes, and means that the schemes liabilities will be paid over a long period of time, making it particularly difficult to predict the life expectancy of the current membership.
Furthermore, pension payments are subject to inflationary increases, resulting in a higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.
Salary For final salary schemes, the pension liabilities are calculated by reference to the future salaries of active members, and hence salary rises in excess of assumed increases will increase scheme liabilities.
During 2011 changes were introduced to the final salary sections of CEPS and CPP such that annual increases in pensionable pay are capped to 2%, resulting in a reduction in salary risk.
Foreign exchange Certain of the assets held by the CCCIF are denominated in foreign currencies, and hence their values are subject to exchange rate risk.
The CCCIF has long-term hedging programmes in place to manage interest rate, inflation and foreign exchange risks.
The table below analyses the total liabilities of the Registered Pension Schemes, calculated in accordance with accounting principles, by type of liability, as at 31 December 2013.

POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS c Accounting assumptions The accounting assumptions for the Registered Pension Schemes have been given below: Major assumptions used for the actuarial valuation 2013 2012 31 December % % Rate of increase in employee earnings: Subject to cap 1.7 1.7 3.3 Other 3.2 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.3 3.2 Rate of increase in deferred pensions: In line with CPI capped at 2.5% 2.3 2.5 In line with RPI 3.3 3.2 Discount rate 4.6 4.8 The assumptions relating to longevity underlying the pension liabilities at the balance sheet date have been based on a combination of standard actuarial mortality tables, scheme experience and other relevant data, and include an allowance for future improvements in mortality.
The longevity assumptions for members in normal health are as follows: 2013 2012 Male Female Male Female Life expectancy at age 65 for a member Years Years Years Years Currently aged 65 22.9 25.3 22.8 25.2 Currently aged 45 24.7 27.3 24.6 27.2 The other demographic assumptions have been set having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data.
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuations of the pension schemes.
Reasonably possible changes as at 31 December to one of the actuarial assumptions would have affected the scheme liabilities as set out below: 2013 2012 Indicative effect Indicative effect Increase on scheme Increase on scheme decrease in liabilities decrease in liabilities Impact of changing material assumptions assumption % assumption % Rate of increase in employee earnings subject to cap 0.25% 1 0.25% 1 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 0.25% 5 0.25% 4 Discount rate 0.25% 6 0.25% 5 Inflation assumption 0.25% 5 0.25% 4 Longevity assumption 1 year 3 1 year 2 The indicative effects on scheme liabilities have been calculated by changing each assumption in isolation and assessing the impact on the liabilities.
For the reasonably possible change in the inflation assumption, it has been assumed that a change to the inflation assumption would lead to corresponding changes in the assumed rates of increase in uncapped pensionable pay, pensions in payment and deferred pensions.
The remaining disclosures in this note cover all of the Groups defined benefit schemes.

Included within corporate bonds are 4 million 2012: 3 million of bonds issued by Centrica plc held within pooled funds over which the CCCIF has no ability to direct investment decisions.
Apart from the investment in the Scottish Limited Partnerships described in note 22 g, no direct investments are made in securities issued by Centrica plc or any of its subsidiaries or property leased to or owned by Centrica plc or any of its subsidiaries.
Included within the Group Balance Sheet within non-current securities are 67 million 2012: 61 million of investments, held in trust on behalf of the Group, as security in respect of the Centrica Unfunded Pension Scheme.
Of the pension scheme liabilities above, 42 million 2012: 37 million relate to this scheme.
More information on the Centrica Unfunded Pension Scheme is included in the Remuneration Report on pages 65 to 82. g Pension scheme contributions Based on the latest triennial valuations at 31 March 2012, the Group and the trustees of the Registered Pension Schemes agreed to fund the scheduled deficit payments using asset-backed contribution arrangements.
Under the arrangements, certain loans to UK Group companies were transferred to Scottish Limited Partnerships established by the Group.
During the year the Group made special contributions to the Registered Pension Schemes of 360 million 31 December 2012: 84 million : the schemes immediately used these contributions to acquire interests in the partnerships for their fair value of 360 million 31 December 2012: 84 million.
The schemes total partnership interests now entitle them to distributions from the income of the partnerships over a period of between 4 and 15 years.
77 million was distributed in the year to 31 December 2013, 77 million per annum will be distributed from 2014 to 2016, and further reduced distributions will be made thereafter.
The partnerships are controlled by and consolidated by the Group.
As the trustees interests in the partnerships do not meet the definition of a plan asset under IAS 19, they are not reflected in the Group Balance Sheet.
Distributions from the partnerships to the schemes will be recognised as scheme assets in the future as they occur.
A continuing 590 million charge over the Humber power station provides additional security for the trustees.
Deficit payments are also being made in respect of the Direct Energy Marketing Limited Pension Plan in Canada.
7 million was paid in the year to 31 December 2013 and 7 million per annum is to be paid until 2018.
The Group estimates that it will pay 100 million of ordinary employer contributions during 2014 at an average rate of 21% of pensionable pay, together with 25 million of contributions paid via the salary sacrifice arrangement.
At 31 March 2012 the date of the latest full actuarial valuations the weighted average duration of the liabilities of the Registered Pensions Schemes was 24 years.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES a Commitments Commitments are not held on the Groups Balance Sheet as these are executory arrangements, and relate to amounts that we are contractually required to pay in the future as long as the other party meets its contractual obligations.
The Group procures commodities through a mixture of production from gas fields, power stations, wind farms and procurement contracts.
Procurement contracts include short-term forward market purchases of gas and electricity at fixed and floating prices.
They also include gas and electricity contracts indexed to market prices and long-term gas contracts with non-gas indexation.
The commitments in relation to commodity purchase contracts disclosed below are stated net of amounts receivable under commodity sales contracts, where there is a right of offset with the counterparty.
The total volume of gas to be taken under certain long-term structured contracts depends on a number of factors, including the actual reserves of gas that are eventually determined to be extractable on an economic basis.
The commitments disclosed below are based on the minimum quantities of gas that the Group is contracted to buy at estimated future prices.
The commitments in this note differ in scope and in basis from the maturity analysis of energy derivatives disclosed in note S3.
Whilst the commitments in relation to commodity purchase contracts include all purchase contracts, only certain procurement and sales contracts are within the scope of IAS 39 and included in note S3.
In addition, the volumes used in calculating the maturity analysis in note S3 are estimated using valuation techniques, rather than being based on minimum contractual quantities.
On 25 March 2013, the Group and Company announced that it had entered into a 20 year agreement with Cheniere to purchase 89bcf per annum of LNG volumes for export from the Sabine Pass liquefaction plant in the US, subject to a number of project milestones and regulatory approvals being achieved.
Under the terms of the agreement the Group is committed to make capacity payments of up to 3.7 billion included in LNG capacity below between 2018 and 2038.
The Group may also make up to 6 billion of commodity purchases based on market gas prices and foreign exchange rates as at the balance sheet date.
The target date for first commercial delivery is September 2018.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES At 31 December the maturity analyses for commodity purchase contract commitments and the total minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases were: Total minimum lease Commodity payments under purchase contracts non-cancellable commitments operating leases 2013 2013 2012 2012 31 December billion billion m m 1 year 11.1 9.2 217 222 12 years 8.1 7.2 138 98 23 years 5.8 5.9 89 82 3.8 64 34 years 5.1 64 45 years 3.7 3.0 54 54 5 years 17.3 21.5 413 454 49.8 51.9 975 974 Operating lease payments recognised as an expense in the year were as follows: 2013 2012 m m Year ended 31 December Minimum lease payments net of sub-lease receipts 112 125 i Contingent rents renewables 109 130 i The Group has entered into long-term arrangements with renewable providers to purchase physical power, renewable obligation certificates and levy exemption certificates from renewable sources.
Payments made under these contracts are contingent upon actual production and so there is no commitment to a minimum lease payment 2012: nil.
Payments made for physical power are charged to the Income Statement as incurred and disclosed as contingent rents.
b Guarantees and indemnities This section discloses any guarantees and indemnities that the Group has given, where we may have to provide security in the future against existing and future obligations that will remain for a specific period.
In connection with the Groups energy trading, transportation and upstream activities, certain Group companies have entered into contracts under which they may be required to prepay, provide credit support or provide other collateral in the event of a significant deterioration in creditworthiness.
The extent of credit support is contingent upon the balance owing to the third party at the point of deterioration.
The Group has provided a number of guarantees and indemnities in respect of decommissioning costs: the two most significant indemnities relate to the decommissioning costs associated with the Morecambe and Statfjord fields.
These indemnities are to the previous owners of these fields.
Under the licence conditions of the fields, the previous owners will have exposure to the decommissioning costs should these liabilities not be fully discharged by the Group.
Security is to be provided when the estimated future net revenue stream from the associated gas field falls below a predetermined proportion of the estimated decommissioning cost.
The nature of the security may take a number of different forms and will remain in force until the costs of such decommissioning have been irrevocably discharged and the relevant legal decommissioning notices in respect of the relevant fields have been revoked.

SOURCES OF FINANCE a Capital structure The Group seeks to maintain an efficient capital structure with a balance of debt and equity as shown in the below table: 2013 2012 31 December m m Net debt 5,049 4,047 Equity 5,192 5,927 Capital 10,241 9,974 Debt levels are restricted to limit the risk of financial distress and, in particular, to maintain strong credit ratings.
The Groups credit ratings are important for several reasons, to maintain a low cost of debt: limit collateral requirements in energy trading, hedging and decommissioning security arrangements: and ensure the Group is an attractive counterparty to energy producers and long-term customers.
At 31 December 2013, the Groups long-term credit rating was A3 stable outlook for Moodys Investors Service Limited and Astable outlook for Standard & Poors Credit Market Services Europe Limited.
These ratings did not change during 2013.
The Group monitors its current and projected capital position on a regular basis, considering a medium-term view of three to five years, and different stress case scenarios, including the impact of changes in the Groups credit ratings and significant movements in commodity prices.
A number of financial ratios are monitored, including those used by the credit rating agencies, such as debt to cash flow ratios and adjusted EBITDA to gross interest expense.
At 31 December 2013, the ratio of the Groups net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.3 2012: 1.1.
Adjusted EBITDA to gross interest expense for the year ended 31 December 2013 was 12.8 2012: 13.5.
The Group now has a new financial covenant in some of its debt facilities, which restricts adjusted net borrowings to less than 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.
At 31 December 2013 the ratio was 1.4 times.
British Gas Insurance Limited BGIL is required under PRA regulations to hold a minimum capital amount and has complied with this requirement in 2013 and 2012.
For the remainder of the Group, the level of debt that can be raised is restricted by the Companys Articles of Association.
Net debt is limited to the greater of 5.0 billion and a gearing ratio of three times adjusted capital and reserves.
Based on adjusted capital and reserves as at 31 December 2013 of 5.2 billion, the limit for net debt was 15.6 billion.
The Group funds its debt principally through issuing bonds, supplemented by some bank debt.
In addition the Group also maintains substantial committed facilities from banks but generally uses these to provide backup liquidity and does not typically draw on them.

SOURCES OF FINANCE d Liquidity risk management and going concern The Group has a number of treasury and risk policies to monitor and manage liquidity risk.
Cash forecasts identifying the Groups liquidity requirements are produced regularly and are stress-tested for different scenarios, including, but not limited to, reasonably possible increases or decreases in commodity prices and the potential cash implications of a credit rating downgrade.
The Group seeks to ensure that sufficient financial headroom exists for at least a 12-month period to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
It is the Group's policy to maintain committed facilities and or available surplus cash resources of at least 1,200 million, raise at least 75% of its net debt excluding non-recourse debt in the long-term debt market and to maintain an average term to maturity in the recourse long-term debt portfolio greater than five years.
At 31 December 2013, the Group had undrawn committed credit facilities of 3,780 million 2012: 3,029 million and 484 million 2012: 690 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.
113% 2012: 130% of the Groups net debt has been raised in the long-term debt market and the average term to maturity of the long-term debt portfolio was 13.8 years 2012: 12.6 years.
The Groups liquidity is impacted by the cash pledged or received under margin and collateral agreements.
The terms and conditions of these depend on the counterparty and the specific details of the transaction.
Cash is generally returned to the Group or by the Group within two days of trade settlement.
The table below summarises the movements in margin cash: 2013 2012 m m 102 Net cash pledged as collateral at 1 January 219 Net cash inflow 82 114 Acquisition of businesses 93 4 Foreign exchange 6 7 i Net cash pledged as collateral at 31 December 107 102 i Of the net cash collateral pledged, 53 million 2012: 23 million is included within trade payables and 160 million 2012: 125 million within trade receivables.
The relatively high level of undrawn committed bank borrowing facilities and available cash resources has enabled the Directors to conclude that the Group has sufficient headroom to continue as a going concern.
The statement of going concern is included in the Directors Report Governance, on page 64.

GENERAL INFORMATION Centrica plc is a Company domiciled and incorporated in the UK.
The address of the registered office is Millstream, Maidenhead Road, Windsor, Berkshire, SL4 5GD.
The nature of the Groups operations and principal activities are set out in note 4 a and on pages 6 to 48.
The consolidated Financial Statements of Centrica plc are presented in pounds sterling.
Operations and transactions conducted in currencies other than pounds sterling are included in the consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the foreign currencies accounting policy set out in note S2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES This section sets out the Groups significant accounting policies in addition to the critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated Financial Statements.
These accounting policies have been consistently applied to the years presented.
Income Statement presentation The Groups Income Statement and segmental note separately identify the effects of re-measurement of certain financial instruments, and items which are exceptional, in order to provide readers with a clear and consistent presentation of the Groups underlying performance, as described below.
Basis of consolidation The Group Financial Statements consolidate the Financial Statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company.
Subsidiaries are all entities including structured entities over which the Group has control.
Control is exercised over an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
Transactions with non-controlling interests which relate to their ownership interests and do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition at which point the Group gains control over a business as defined by IFRS 3 Revised 2008 and applies the acquisition method to account for the transaction as a business combination or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the Financial Statements of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures to align the accounting policies with those used by the Group.
When the Group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss.
This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as a joint venture, associate or financial asset.
Segmental reporting The Groups operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to and regularly reviewed by the Groups Executive Committee for the purposes of evaluating segment performance and allocating resources.
Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be measured reliably.
Revenue includes amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Energy supply: revenue is recognised on the basis of energy supplied during the year.
Revenue for energy supply activities includes an assessment of energy supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end unread.
Unread gas and electricity is estimated using historical consumption patterns, taking into account the industry reconciliation process for total gas and total electricity usage by supplier, and is included in accrued energy income within trade and other receivables.
Proprietary energy trading: revenue comprises both realised settled and unrealised fair value changes net gains and losses from trading in physical and financial energy contracts.
Fixed-fee service and insurance contracts: revenue from these contracts is recognised in the Group Income Statement with regard to the incidence of risk over the life of the contract, reflecting the seasonal propensity of claims to be made under the contracts and the benefits receivable by the customer, which span the life of the contract as a result of emergency maintenance being available throughout the contract term.
Amounts paid in advance are treated as deferred income, with any amount in arrears recognised as accrued income.
For one-off services, such as installations, revenue is recognised at the date of service provision.
Storage services: storage capacity revenues are recognised evenly over the contract period, whilst commodity revenues for the injection and withdrawal of gas are recognised at the point of gas flowing into or out of the storage facilities.
Gas purchases and gas sales transactions entered into to optimise the performance of the gas storage facilities are presented net within revenue.
Upstream production: revenue associated with exploration and production sales of natural gas, crude oil and condensates is recognised when title passes to the customer.
Revenue from the production of natural gas, oil and condensates in which the Group has an interest with other producers is recognised based on the Groups working interest and the terms of the relevant production sharing arrangements the entitlement method.
Where differences arise between production sold and the Groups share of production, this is accounted for as an overlift or underlift see separate accounting policy.
Purchases and sales entered into to optimise the performance of production facilities are presented net within revenue.
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 | 135 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Supplementary Information S2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Power generation: revenue is recognised on the basis of power supplied during the period.
Power purchases and sales entered into to optimise the performance of power generation facilities are presented net within revenue.
Interest income: interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying value.
Cost of sales Energy supply includes the cost of gas and electricity produced and purchased during the year taking into account the industry reconciliation process for total gas and total electricity usage by supplier, and related transportation, distribution, royalty costs and bought-in materials and services.
Cost of sales relating to fixed-fee service and insurance contracts includes direct labour and related overheads on installation work, repairs and service contracts in the year.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs that arise in connection with the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised and subsequently amortised in line with the depreciation of the related asset.
Borrowing costs are capitalised from the time of acquisition or from the beginning of construction or production until the point at which the qualifying asset is ready for use.
Where a specific financing arrangement is in place, the specific borrowing rate for that arrangement is applied.
For non-specific financing arrangements, a Group financing rate representative of the weighted average borrowing rate of the Group is used.
Borrowing costs not arising in connection with the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are expensed.
Employee share schemes The Group operates a number of employee share schemes, detailed in the Remuneration Report on pages 65 to 82, under which it makes equitysettled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis together with a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the number of awards that will vest, and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
The majority of the share-based payment charge arises from three schemes.
More information is included in the Remuneration Report on pages 65 to 82.
Deferred Matching Share Scheme DMSS : Applicable employees: Senior Executive Group.
Vesting period of four years, comprising bonus year and three-year performance period.
Participants must defer between 20% and 40% of annual pre-tax bonus into scheme deferred shares and can elect to invest additional amounts of annual bonus up to a maximum of 50% of total potential bonus investment shares.
Deferred and investment shares will be matched with conditional shares.
On achievement of performance targets over three-year period, matching shares are either released immediately or delivered as nil cost options exercisable for seven years.
Performance measured through Group and segment Economic Profit EP targets.
Leaving prior to vesting date will normally mean forfeiting rights to deferred shares.
Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS : Applicable employees: senior management.
Vesting period of three years following grant date.
Grants after 2012: number of shares calculated according to EPS, Group EP, TSR and non-financial KPIs.
Grants before 2012: number of shares calculated according to EPS growth and TSR.
Following the end of the assessed performance period, and subject to continued employment at that date, shares are either released immediately or delivered as nil cost options exercisable for seven years.
Share Award Scheme SAS : Applicable employees: middle management.
Shares vest subject to continued employment within the Group in two stages: half after two years, the other half after three years.
Fair value is measured using methods appropriate to each of the different schemes as follows: LTIS: EPS, EP and KPI awards Market value on the date of grant LTIS: TSR awards A Monte Carlo simulation to predict the total shareholder return performance SAS and DMSS Market value on the date of grant 136 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Performance Measures Shareholder Information Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Supplementary Information S2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Foreign currencies The consolidated Financial Statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and the Groups presentation currency.
Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the Financial Statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are, on initial recognition, recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the Balance Sheet date.
All differences are included in the Group Income Statement for the period.
In previous periods, the Group utilised net investment hedging.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings that provided a hedge against a net investment in a foreign entity were taken directly to equity.
Upon the disposal or partial disposal of the net investment, any related amounts are recognised in the Group Income Statement.
The Group no longer uses net investment hedging but the historic exchange differences remain in equity until the disposal of the specific investment.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity concerned are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated Financial Statements, the assets and liabilities of the Groups non-sterling functional currency subsidiary undertakings, jointly controlled entities and associates are translated into pounds sterling at exchange rates prevailing on the Balance Sheet date.
The results of these generally foreign subsidiary undertakings, jointly controlled entities and associates are translated into pounds sterling at average rates of exchange for the relevant period.
The relevant exchange rates are shown below: Average rate for the year ended Exchange rate per pound sterling Closing rate at 31 December 31 December 2013 2012 2013 2012 US dollars 1.66 1.62 1.57 1.59 Canadian dollars 1.76 1.62 1.62 1.59 Euro 1.20 1.23 1.18 1.23 Norwegian kroner 10.04 9.03 9.22 9.22 Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net assets and results of non-sterling functional currency operations are transferred to the Groups foreign currency translation reserve, a separate component of equity, and are reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
In the event of the disposal of an undertaking with assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency, the cumulative translation difference arising in the foreign currency translation reserve is charged or credited to the Group Income Statement on disposal.
Business combinations and goodwill The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method at the point the Group gains control over a business as defined by IFRS 3 Revised 2008 : business combinations.
The cost of the acquisition is measured as the cash paid and the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of other assets transferred, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement at the acquisition date.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Revised 2008 : business combinations, are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal Groups that are classified as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5: Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an  basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquirees identifiable net assets.
Goodwill arising on a business combination represents the excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of the non-controlling interest and the acquisition date fair value of any previously held interest in the acquiree over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a stake in a joint venture or an associate represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
The goodwill arising on an investment in a joint venture or in an associate is shown under interests in joint ventures and associate in the Group Balance Sheet.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture entity, any amount of goodwill attributed to that entity is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost.
Intangible assets include contractual customer relationships, brands, application software, emissions trading schemes, renewable obligation certificates, and certain exploration and evaluation expenditures, the accounting policies for which are dealt with separately below.
For purchased application software, for example investments in customer relationship management and billing systems, cost includes contractors charges, materials,  labour and  overheads.
Capitalisation begins when expenditure for the asset is being incurred and activities necessary to prepare the asset for use are in progress.
Capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for use are complete.
Amortisation commences at the point of commercial deployment.
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 | 137 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Supplementary Information S2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over their useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset could be impaired.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset are reviewed at least at each financial year end.
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for on a prospective basis by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and treated as changes in accounting estimates.
Intangible assets are derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from their use.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset could be impaired, either individually or at the CGU level.
Such intangibles are not amortised.
The useful life of an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life assessment continues to be supportable.
If not, the change in the useful life assessment from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.
The amortisation periods for the principal categories of intangible assets are as follows: Contractual customer relationships up to 20 years Strategic identifiable acquired brand indefinite Application software up to 15 years Licences up to 20 years EU Emissions Trading Scheme and renewable obligation certificates Granted carbon dioxide emissions allowances received in a period are recognised initially at nominal value nil value.
Purchased carbon dioxide emissions allowances are recognised initially at cost purchase price within intangible assets.
A liability is recognised when the level of emissions exceeds the level of allowances granted.
The liability is measured at the cost of purchased allowances up to the level of purchased allowances held, and then at the market price of allowances ruling at the Balance Sheet date, with movements in the liability recognised in operating profit.
Forward contracts for the purchase or sale of carbon dioxide emissions allowances are measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognised in the Group Income Statement.
The intangible asset is surrendered and the liability is utilised at the end of the compliance period to reflect the consumption of economic benefits.
Purchased renewable obligation certificates are recognised initially at cost within intangible assets.
A liability for the renewables obligation is recognised based on the level of electricity supplied to customers, and is calculated in accordance with percentages set by the UK Government and the renewable obligation certificate buyout price for that period.
Any recycling benefit related to the submission of renewable obligation certificates is recognised in the Group Income Statement when received.
Exploration, evaluation, development and production assets The Group uses the successful efforts method of accounting for exploration and evaluation expenditure.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure associated with an exploration well, including acquisition costs related to exploration and evaluation activities, are capitalised initially as intangible assets.
Certain expenditures such as geological and geophysical exploration costs are expensed.
If the prospects are subsequently determined to be successful on completion of evaluation, the relevant expenditure including licence acquisition costs is transferred to PP&E and is subsequently depreciated on a unit of production basis.
If the prospects are subsequently determined to be unsuccessful on completion of evaluation, the associated costs are expensed in the period in which that determination is made.
All field development costs are capitalised as PP&E.
Such costs relate to the acquisition and installation of production facilities and include development drilling costs, project-related engineering and other technical services costs.
PP&E, including rights and concessions related to production activities, are depreciated from the commencement of production in the fields concerned, using the unit of production method, based on all of the 2P reserves of those fields.
Changes in these estimates are dealt with prospectively.
The net carrying value of fields in production and development is compared on a field-by-field basis with the likely discounted future net revenues to be derived from the remaining commercial reserves.
An impairment loss is recognised where it is considered that recorded amounts are unlikely to be fully recovered from the net present value of future net revenues.
Exploration assets are reviewed annually for indicators of impairment and production and development assets are tested annually for impairment.
Interests in joint arrangements and associates Under IFRS 11, joint arrangements are those that convey joint control which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
Investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor.
Associates are investments over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control, and generally holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
The Groups joint ventures and associates as defined in note 6 are accounted for using the equity method.
Under the equity method, investments are carried at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets, less any impairment in value in individual investments.
The Group Income Statement reflects the Groups share of the results of operations after tax and interest.
Accounting policies of the joint ventures and associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Upon initial acquisition goodwill may arise and is recognised within interests in joint ventures and associates in the Group Balance Sheet.
138 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Performance Measures Shareholder Information Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Supplementary Information S2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Groups interests in joint operations e. g. exploration and production arrangements are accounted for by recognising its assets including its share of assets held jointly, its liabilities including its share of liabilities incurred jointly, its revenue from the sale of its share of the output arising from the joint operation, its share of the revenue from the sale of the output by the joint operation and its expenses including its share of any expenses incurred jointly.
Where the Group has an equity stake or a participating interest in operations governed by a joint arrangement for which it is acting as operator, an assessment is carried out to confirm whether the Group is acting as agent or principal.
As the terms and conditions negotiated between business partners usually provide joint control to the parties over the relevant activities of the oil and gas fields and or wind farms that are governed by joint arrangements, the Group is usually deemed to be an agent when it is appointed as operator and not a principal as the contracts entered into do not convey control to the parties.
Accordingly, the Group recognises its equity share of these arrangements in accordance with the above accounting policy.
Property, plant and equipment PP&E is included in the Group Balance Sheet at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment.
The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation.
The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.
Subsequent expenditure in respect of items of PP&E such as the replacement of major parts, major inspections or overhauls, are capitalised as part of the cost of the related asset where it is probable that future economic benefits will arise as a result of the expenditure and the cost can be reliably measured.
All other subsequent expenditure, including the costs of day-to-day servicing, repairs and maintenance, is expensed as incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other PP&E, with the exception of upstream production assets see above, are depreciated on a straight-line basis at rates sufficient to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of individual assets over their estimated useful lives.
The depreciation periods for the principal categories of assets are as follows: Freehold and leasehold buildings up to 50 years Plant 5 to 20 years Equipment and vehicles 3 to 10 years Power stations and wind farms up to 30 years Gas storage up to 40 years Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful economic lives on the same basis as for owned assets, or where shorter, the lease term.
The carrying values of PP&E are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Residual values and useful lives are reassessed annually and if necessary changes are accounted for prospectively.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, investments in joint ventures and associates and goodwill The Group reviews the carrying amounts of PP&E, intangible assets, interests in joint ventures and associates and goodwill annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recoverable amounts may be lower than their carrying amounts.
Where an asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use VIU and fair value less costs to sell FVLCS.
At inception, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups CGUs or groups of CGUs that expect to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Any impairment is expensed immediately in the Group Income Statement.
Any CGU impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimate used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised, with the exception of goodwill impairment which is never reversed.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or CGU in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the Group Income Statement immediately.
After such a reversal the depreciation or amortisation charge, where relevant, is adjusted in future periods to allocate the assets revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
Value in use calculations have been used to determine recoverable amounts for all of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset balances with the exception of the impairment tests for the Centrica Energy Upstream gas and oil CGUs, where fair value less costs to sell has been used as the basis for determining recoverable amount.
This methodology is deemed to be more appropriate as it is based on the post-tax cash flows arising from the underlying assets and is consistent with the approach taken by management to evaluate the economic value of the underlying assets.
Further details of the VIU and FVLCS calculation assumptions are provided below.
The FVLCS section is also relevant to how the Upstream gas and oil property, plant and equipment impairments, as detailed in note 7, were calculated.
a VIU Key assumptions used The VIU calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on the Groups Board-approved three-year business plans.
The Groups business plans are based on past experience, and adjusted to reflect market trends, economic conditions, key risks, the implementation of strategic objectives and changes in commodity prices, as appropriate.
Commodity prices used in the planning process are based in part on observable market data and in Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 | 139 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Supplementary Information S2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES part on internal estimates.
The extent to which the commodity prices used in the business plans are based on observable market data is determined by the extent to which the market for the underlying commodity is judged to be active.
Note S6 provides additional detail on the active period of each of the commodity markets in which the Group operates.
i VIU Growth rates and discount rates Cash flows beyond the three-year plan period have been extrapolated using long-term growth rates in the market where the CGU operates.
Longterm growth rates are determined using a blend of publicly available historical data and long-term growth rate forecasts published by external analysts.
Cash flows are discounted using a discount rate specific to each CGU.
Discount rates reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and are based on the estimated cost of capital of each CGU.
Additionally, risks specific to the cash flows of the CGUs are reflected within cash flow forecasts.
Each CGUs weighted average cost of capital is then adjusted to reflect the impact of tax in order to calculate an equivalent pre-tax discount rate.
Long-term growth rates and pre-tax discount rates used in the VIU calculations for each of the Groups CGUs are provided in the table below: British Gas Direct Energy Direct Energy Direct Energy Business energy British Gas Residential Business Residential and 2013 supply and services Residential services energy supply i energy supply i business services i Growth rate to perpetuity 2.1% 2.1% 2.2% 2.2% 2.2% Pre-tax discount rate 7.4% 7.4% 8.4% 8.0% 8.4% 8.0% 8.4% 8.0% i US Canada respectively.

Inflation rates used for the value in use calculations were as follows: UK: 2.2% 2012: 1.9%, Canada: 2.0% 2012: 2.0% and the US: 2.2% 2012: 2.3%.

b FVLCS discount rate and cash-flow assumptions, Centrica Energy Upstream gas and oil production FVLCS is determined by discounting the post-tax cash flows expected to be generated by the gas and oil production and development assets, net of associated selling costs, taking into account those assumptions that market participants would use in estimating fair value.
Post-tax cash flows are derived from projected production profiles of each field, taking into account forward prices for gas and liquids over the relevant period.
Where forward market prices are not available, prices are determined based on internal model inputs.
The date of cessation of production depends on the interaction of a number of variables, such as the recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons, production costs, the contractual duration of the licence area and the selling price of the gas and liquids produced.
As each field has specific reservoir characteristics and economic circumstances, the post-tax cash flows for each field are computed using individual economic models.
Post-tax cash flows used in the FVLCS calculation for the first three years are based on the Groups Board-approved three-year business plans and, thereafter, are based on long-term production and cash flow forecasts.
The future post-tax cash flows are discounted using a post-tax nominal discount rate of 9% 2012: 7.5% to 8.5% to determine the FVLCS.
The discount rate and inflation rate used in the FVLCS calculation are determined in the same manner as the rates used in the VIU calculations described above, with the exception of the adjustment required to determine an equivalent pre-tax discount rate.
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 | 141 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Supplementary Information S2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES For goodwill, if the FVLCS of the relevant CGU, derived using the above assumptions, shows limited or negative impairment headroom, the FVLCS is then recalculated with reference to external analyst valuation reports.
The FVLCS is taken as the higher of these figures.
Overlift and underlift Off-take arrangements for oil and gas produced from jointly owned operations are often such that it is not practical for each participant to receive or sell its precise share of the overall production during the period.
This results in short-term imbalances between cumulative production entitlement and cumulative sales, referred to as overlift and underlift.
An overlift payable, or underlift receivable, is recognised at the Balance Sheet date within trade and other payables, or trade and other receivables, respectively and measured at market value, with movements in the period recognised within cost of sales.
Leases The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement and requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset or assets.
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and included in PP&E at their fair value, or if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance charges in respect of future periods, are included within bank loans and other borrowings, with the amount payable within 12 months included in bank overdrafts and loans within current liabilities.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the finance lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Payments under operating leases are charged to the Group Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Inventories Inventories are valued on a weighted-average cost basis and at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value after allowance for redundant and slow-moving items.
Decommissioning costs Provision is made for the net present value of the estimated cost of decommissioning gas and oil production facilities at the end of the producing lives of fields, and storage facilities and power stations at the end of their useful lives, based on price levels and technology at the Balance Sheet date.
When this provision relates to an asset with sufficient future economic benefits, a decommissioning asset is recognised and included as part of the associated PP&E and depreciated accordingly.
Changes in these estimates and changes to the discount rates are dealt with prospectively and reflected as an adjustment to the provision and corresponding decommissioning asset included within PP&E.
The unwinding of the discount on the provision is included in the Group Income Statement within interest expense.
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
No depreciation is charged in respect of non-current assets classified as held for sale.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management are committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
The profits or losses and cash flows that relate to a major component of the Group that has been sold or is classified as held for sale are presented separately from continuing operations as discontinued operations within the Group Income Statement and Group Cash Flow Statement.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit schemes is determined separately for each scheme using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the period in which they occur in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The cost of providing retirement pensions and other benefits is charged to the Group Income Statement over the periods benefiting from employees service.
Past service cost is recognised immediately.
Costs of administering the schemes are charged to the Group Income Statement.
Net interest, being the change in the net defined benefit liability or asset due to the passage of time is recognised in the Group Income Statement net finance cost.
The net defined benefit liability or asset recognised in the Group Balance Sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation of the schemes, and the fair value of the schemes assets.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits are paid, and that have terms of maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are recognised in the Group Income Statement as they fall due.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, that can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the Balance Sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised in the Group Income Statement within interest expense.
Onerous contract provisions are recognised where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.
Contracts to purchase or sell energy are reviewed on a portfolio basis given the fungible nature of energy, whereby it is assumed that the highest priced purchase contract supplies the highest priced sales contract and the lowest priced sales contract is supplied by the lowest priced purchase contract.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax, UK petroleum revenue tax and foreign tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences identified at the Balance Sheet date, except to the extent that the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill if amortisation of goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit and loss.
Temporary differences are differences between the carrying amount of the Groups assets and liabilities and their tax base.
Deferred tax liabilities may be offset against deferred tax assets within the same taxable entity or qualifying local tax group.
Any remaining deferred tax asset is recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as probable that there will be suitable taxable profits, within the same jurisdiction, in the foreseeable future, against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised or liability settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences expected from the manner in which the asset or liability is recovered or settled.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are fide-recognised when the Group no longer has the rights to cash flows, the risks and rewards of ownership or control of the asset.
Financial liabilities are fide-recognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
a Trade receivables Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value, which is usually original invoice amount and are subsequently held at amortised cost less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts.
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group may not be able to collect the trade receivable.
If collection is due in one year or less receivables are classified as current assets.
If not they are presented as non-current assets.
b Trade payables Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value, which is usually original invoice amount and are subsequently held at amortised cost.
If payment is due within one year or less payables are classified as current liabilities.
If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
c Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds received.
Own equity instruments that are re-acquired treasury or own shares are deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the Group Income Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
d Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and current balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the Group Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
e Interest-bearing loans and other borrowings All interest-bearing loans and other borrowings with banks and similar institutions are initially recognised at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and other borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, except when they are the hedged item in an effective fair value hedge relationship where the carrying value is also adjusted to reflect the fair value movements associated with the hedged risks.
Such fair value movements are recognised in the Group Income Statement.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs, discount or premium.
f Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale, which are recognised initially at fair value within the Group Balance Sheet.
Available-for-sale financial assets are re-measured subsequently at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognised directly in equity and presented in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, until the asset is disposed of or is Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 | 143 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Supplementary Information S2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the Group Income Statement for the period.
Accrued interest or dividends arising on available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in the Group Income Statement.
At each Balance Sheet date the Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that available-for-sale financial assets are impaired.
If any such evidence exists, cumulative losses recognised in equity are removed from equity and recognised in the Group Income Statement.
The cumulative loss removed from equity represents the difference between the acquisition cost and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the Group Income Statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the Group Income Statement for equity investments classified as available-for-sale are not subsequently reversed through the Group Income Statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the Group Income Statement for debt instruments classified as available-forsale are subsequently reversed if an increase in the fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the recognition of the impairment loss.
g Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss The Group holds investments in gilts which it designates as fair value through profit or loss.
Investments are measured at fair value on initial recognition and are re-measured to fair value in each subsequent reporting period.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in the Group Income Statement within interest income or interest expense.
h Derivative financial instruments The Group routinely enters into sale and purchase transactions for physical delivery of gas, power and oil.
A portion of these transactions take the form of contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of receipt or delivery of the physical commodity in accordance with the Groups expected sale, purchase or usage requirements own use, and are not within the scope of IAS 39.
The assessment of whether a contract is deemed to be own use is conducted on a Group basis without reference to underlying book structures, business units or legal entities.
Certain purchase and sales contracts for the physical delivery of gas, power and oil are within the scope of IAS 39 due to the fact that they net settle or contain written options.
Such contracts are accounted for as derivatives under IAS 39 and are recognised in the Group Balance Sheet at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the Group Income Statement for the year.
The Group uses a range of derivatives for both trading and to hedge exposures to financial risks, such as interest rate, foreign exchange and energy price risks, arising in the normal course of business.
The use of derivative financial instruments is governed by the Groups policies which are approved by the Board of Directors.
Further detail on the Groups risk management policies is included within the Strategic Report Principal Risks and Uncertainties on pages 42 to 48 and in note S3.
The accounting treatment for derivatives is dependent on whether they are entered into for trading or hedging purposes.
A derivative instrument is considered to be used for hedging purposes when it alters the risk profile of an underlying exposure of the Group in line with the Groups risk management policies and is in accordance with established guidelines, which require the hedging relationship to be documented at its inception, ensure that the derivative is highly effective in achieving its objective, and require that its effectiveness can be reliably measured.
The Group also holds derivatives which are not designated as hedges and are held for trading.
All derivatives are recognised at fair value on the date on which the derivative is entered into and are re-measured to fair value at each reporting date.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Derivative assets and derivative liabilities are offset and presented on a net basis only when both a legal right of set-off exists and the intention to net settle the derivative contracts is present.
The Group enters into certain energy derivative contracts covering periods for which observable market data does not exist.
The fair value of such derivatives is estimated by reference in part to published price quotations from active markets, to the extent that such observable market data exists, and in part by using valuation techniques, whose inputs include data which is not based on or derived from observable markets.
Where the fair value at initial recognition for such contracts differs from the transaction price, a fair value gain or fair value loss will arise.
This is referred to as a day-one gain or day-one loss.
Such gains and losses are deferred not recognised and amortised to the Group Income Statement based on volumes purchased or delivered over the contractual period until such time observable market data becomes available.
When observable market data becomes available, any remaining deferred day-one gains or losses are recognised within the Group Income Statement.
Recognition of the gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the purpose for issuing or holding the derivative.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the Group Income Statement and are included within gross profit or interest income and interest expense.
Gains and losses arising on derivatives entered into for speculative energy trading purposes are presented on a net basis within revenue.
Embedded derivatives: derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value, with gains or losses reported in the Group Income Statement.
The closely-related nature of embedded derivatives is reassessed when there is a change in the terms of the contract which significantly modifies the future cash flows under the contract.
Where a contract contains one or more embedded derivatives, and providing that the embedded derivative significantly modifies the cash flows under the contract, the option to fair value the entire contract may be taken and the contract will be recognised at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Group Income Statement.
i Hedge accounting For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges.
Note S5 details the Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting under IAS 39.
Nuclear activity The Groups investment in Lake Acquisitions Limited British Energy is accounted for as an associate.
The following accounting policies are specific to the accounting for the nuclear activity of this associate.
144 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Performance Measures Shareholder Information Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Supplementary Information S2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Fuel costs nuclear front end Front end fuel costs consist of the costs of procurement of uranium, conversion and enrichment services and fuel element fabrication.
All costs are capitalised into inventory and charged to the Group Income Statement in proportion to the amount of fuel burnt.
b Fuel costs nuclear back end Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors AGR Spent fuel extracted from the reactors is sent for reprocessing and or long-term storage and eventual disposal of resulting waste products.
Back end fuel costs comprise a loading related cost per tonne of uranium and a rebate surcharge to this cost dependent on the out-turn market electricity price in the year and are capitalised into inventory and charged to the Group Income Statement in proportion to the amount of fuel burnt.
Pressurised Water Reactor PWR Back end fuel costs are based on wet storage in station ponds followed by dry storage and subsequent direct disposal of fuel.
Back end fuel costs are capitalised into inventory on loading and charged to the Group Income Statement in proportion to the amount of fuel burnt.
c Nuclear property, plant and equipment and depreciation The nuclear fleet are depreciated from the date of the Group acquiring its share of British Energy on a straight-line basis, with remaining depreciable periods currently of up to 22 years.
Expenditure on major inspection and overhauls of production plant is depreciated over the period until the next outage which for AGR power stations is three years and for the PWR power station is 18 months.
d Nuclear Liabilities Fund NLF funding arrangements Under the arrangements in place with the Secretary of State, the NLF will fund, subject to certain exceptions, British Energys qualifying uncontracted nuclear liabilities and qualifying decommissioning costs.
In part consideration for the assumption of these liabilities by the Secretary of State and the NLF, British Energy agreed to pay fixed decommissioning contributions each year and 150,000 indexed to RPI for every tonne of uranium in PWR fuel loaded into the Sizewell B reactor after the date of these arrangements.
e NLF and nuclear liabilities receivables The Government indemnity is provided to indemnify any future shortfall on NLF funding of qualifying uncontracted nuclear liabilities including PWR back end fuel services and qualifying nuclear decommissioning costs such that the receivable equals the present value of the associated qualifying nuclear liabilities.
f Nuclear liabilities Nuclear liabilities represent provision for British Energys liabilities in respect of the costs of waste management of spent fuel and nuclear decommissioning.
g Unburnt fuels at shutdown Due to the nature of the nuclear fuel process there will be quantities of unburnt fuel in the reactors at station closure.
The costs relating to this unburnt fuel final core are estimated by applying a long-term inflation index to the projected costs, which are then discounted.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Groups normal operating, investing and financing activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including commodity price risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management processes are designed to identify, manage and mitigate these risks.
Further detail on the Groups overall risk management processes are included within the Strategic Report Principal Risks and Uncertainties on pages 42 to 48.
Financial risk management is overseen by the GFRMC according to objectives, targets and policies set by the Board.
Commodity price risk management is carried out in accordance with individual business unit Financial Risk Management Committees and their respective financial risk management policies, as approved by the GFRMC under delegated authority from the Board.
Treasury risk management, including management of currency risk, interest rate risk, equity price risk and liquidity risk is carried out by a central Group Treasury function in accordance with the Groups financing and treasury policy, as approved by the Board.
The wholesale credit risks associated with commodity trading and treasury positions are managed in accordance with the Groups credit risk policy and collateral risk policy.
Downstream credit risk management is carried out in accordance with individual business unit credit policies.
Market risk management Market risk is the risk of loss that results from changes in market prices commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices.
The level of market risk to which the Group is exposed at a point in time varies depending on market conditions, expectations of future price or market rate movements and the composition of the Groups physical asset and contract portfolios.
a Commodity price risk management The Group is exposed to commodity price risk in its upstream assets, energy procurement contracts, downstream and proprietary energy trading activities and uses specific limits to manage the exposure to commodity prices associated with the Groups activities to an acceptable level.
Volumetric limits are supported by Profit at Risk PaR and Value at Risk VaR metrics in the UK and in North America to measure the Groups exposure to commodity price risk.
Limits are also set on PaR and VaR measurements as a further control over exposure to market prices.
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 | 145 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Supplementary Information S3.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT i Energy procurement, upstream and downstream activities The Groups energy procurement, upstream and downstream activities consist of equity gas and liquids production, equity power generation, bilateral procurement and sales contracts, market-traded purchase and sales contracts and derivative positions taken on with the intent of securing gas and power for the Groups downstream customers in the UK and North America from a variety of sources at an optimal cost.
The Group actively manages commodity price risk by optimising its asset and contract portfolios and making use of volume flexibility.
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk in its energy procurement, upstream and downstream activities because the cost of procuring gas and electricity to serve its downstream customers varies with wholesale commodity prices.
The risk is primarily that market prices for commodities will fluctuate between the time that sales prices are fixed or tariffs are set and the time at which the corresponding procurement cost is fixed, thereby potentially reducing expected margins or making sales unprofitable.
The Group is also exposed to volumetric risk in the form of an uncertain consumption profile arising from a range of factors, including weather, energy consumption changes, customer attrition and economic climate.
There is also risk associated with ensuring there is sufficient commodity available to secure supply to customers.
In order to manage the exposure to market prices associated with the Groups energy procurement, upstream and downstream activities the Group uses a specific set of limits including position, volumetric, VaR PaR established by the Executive Committee and governed by GFRMC oversight along with business unit market risk policies.
Volumetric limits are supported by PaR and VaR metrics in the UK and in North America to measure the Groups exposure to commodity price risk.
PaR measures the estimated potential loss in a position or portfolio of positions associated with the movement of a commodity price for a given confidence level, over the remaining term of the position or contract portfolio.
VaR measures the estimated potential loss for a given confidence level over a predetermined holding period.
The standard confidence level used is 95%.
In addition, stress tests are regularly performed to evaluate the impact of substantial movements in commodity prices.
The Group measures and manages the commodity price risk associated with the Groups entire energy procurement, upstream and downstream portfolio.
Only certain of the Groups energy procurement, upstream and downstream contracts constitute financial instruments under IAS 39 note S6.
As a result, while the Group manages the commodity price risk associated with both financial and non-financial energy procurement, upstream and downstream contracts, it is the notional value of energy contracts being carried at fair value that represents the exposure of the Groups energy procurement, upstream and downstream activities to commodity price risk according to IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
This is because energy contracts that are financial instruments under IAS 39 are accounted for on a fair value basis and changes in fair value immediately impact profit or equity.
Conversely, energy contracts that are not financial instruments under IAS 39 are accounted for as executory contracts and changes in fair value do not immediately impact profit or equity, and as such, are not exposed to commodity price risk as defined by IFRS 7.
So whilst the PaR or VaR associated with energy procurement and downstream contracts outside the scope of IAS 39 is monitored for internal risk management purposes, only those energy contracts within the scope of IAS 39 are within the scope of the IFRS 7 disclosure requirements.
ii Proprietary energy trading The Groups proprietary energy trading activities consist of physical and financial commodity purchases and sales contracts taken on with the intent of benefiting in the short-term from changes in market prices or differences between buying and selling prices.
The Group conducts its trading activities in the over-the-counter market and through exchanges in the UK, North America and continental Europe.
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its proprietary energy trading activities because the value of its trading assets and liabilities will fluctuate with changes in market prices for commodities.
The Group sets volumetric and VaR limits to manage the commodity price risk exposure associated with the Groups proprietary energy trading activities.
The VaR used measures the estimated potential loss for a 95% confidence level over a one-day holding period.
The holding period used is based on market liquidity and the number of days the Group would expect it to take to close out a trading position.
The VaR limits set for proprietary trading activities are relatively small compared to the Groups overall operations and are less than 15 million.
The carrying value of energy contracts used in proprietary energy trading activities at 31 December 2013 is disclosed in note 19.
As with any modelled risk measure, there are certain limitations that arise from the assumptions used in the VaR analysis.
VaR assumes that historical trends and behaviours will continue in the future and that the Groups trading positions can be unwound or hedged within the predetermined holding period.
Furthermore, the use of a 95% confidence level, by definition, does not take into account changes in value that might occur beyond this confidence level.
b Currency risk management The Group is exposed to currency risk on foreign currency denominated forecast transactions, firm commitments, monetary assets and liabilities transactional exposure and on its net investments in foreign operations translational exposure.
IFRS 7 only requires disclosure of currency risk arising on financial instruments denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the commercial operation transacting.
As a result, for the purposes of IFRS 7, currency risk excludes the Groups net investments in North America and Europe as well as foreign currency denominated forecast transactions and firm commitments.
i Transactional currency risk The Group is exposed to transactional currency risk on transactions denominated in currencies other than the underlying functional currency of the commercial operation transacting.
The Groups primary functional currencies are pounds sterling in the UK, Canadian dollars in Canada, US dollars in the US, Norwegian kroner in Norway and euros in the Netherlands.
The risk is that the functional currency value of cash flows will vary as a result of movements in exchange rates.
Transactional exposure arises from the Groups energy procurement activities in the UK and in Canada, where a 146 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Performance Measures Shareholder Information Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Supplementary Information S3.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT proportion of transactions are denominated in euros or US dollars and on certain capital commitments denominated in foreign currencies.
In addition, in order to optimise the cost of funding, the Group has, in certain cases, issued foreign currency denominated debt, primarily in US dollars, euros, Japanese yen, Hong Kong dollars or New Zealand dollars.
It is the Groups policy to hedge material transactional exposures using forward contracts to fix the functional currency value of non-functional currency cash flows, except where there is an economic hedge inherent in the transaction.
At 31 December 2013, there were no material unhedged non-functional currency monetary assets or liabilities, firm commitments or probable forecast transactions 2012: nil, other than transactions which have an inherent economic hedge and foreign currency borrowings used to hedge translational exposures.
ii Translational currency risk The Group is exposed to translational currency risk as a result of its net investments in North America and Europe.
The risk is that the pounds sterling value of the net assets of foreign operations will decrease with changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups policy is to protect the pounds sterling book value of its net investments in foreign operations where possible, subject to certain parameters monitored by the GFRMC, by holding foreign currency debt, entering into foreign currency derivatives, or a mixture of both.
The Group manages translational currency risk taking into consideration the cash impact of any hedging activity as well as the risk to the net asset numbers in the Groups Financial Statements.
The translation hedging programme including the potential cash impact is monitored by the GFRMC.
c Interest rate risk management In the normal course of business the Group borrows to finance its operations.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk because the fair value of fixed rate borrowings and the cash flows associated with floating rate borrowings will fluctuate with changes in interest rates.
The Groups policy is to manage the interest rate risk on long-term borrowings by ensuring the exposure to floating interest rates remains within a 30% to 70% range, including the impact of interest rate derivatives.
d Equity price risk management The Group is exposed to equity price risk because certain available-for-sale financial assets, held in trust on behalf of the Group as security in respect of the Centrica Unfunded Pension Scheme, are linked to equity indices.
Investments in equity indices are inherently exposed to less risk than individual equity investments because they represent a naturally diverse portfolio.
Note 22 provides further details on the above and the Groups other retirement benefit assets and liabilities.
e Sensitivity analysis IFRS 7 requires disclosure of a sensitivity analysis that is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Groups financial position and performance to changes in market variables commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates as a result of changes in the fair value or cash flows associated with the Groups financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis provided discloses the effect on profit or loss and equity at 31 December 2013 assuming that a reasonably possible change in the relevant risk variable had occurred at 31 December 2013 and been applied to the risk exposures in existence at that date to show the effects of reasonably possible changes in price on profit or loss and equity to the next annual reporting date.
Reasonably possible changes in market variables used in the sensitivity analysis are based on implied volatilities, where available, or historical data for energy prices and foreign exchange rates.
Reasonably possible changes in interest rates are based on management judgement and historical experience.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared based on 31 December 2013 balances and on the basis that the balances, the ratio of fixed to floating rates of debt and derivatives, the proportion of energy contracts that are financial instruments, the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies and the hedge designations in place at 31 December 2013 are all constant.
Excluded from this analysis are all non-financial assets and liabilities and energy contracts that are not financial instruments under IAS 39.
The sensitivity to foreign exchange rates relates only to monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the commercial operation transacting, and excludes the translation of the net assets of foreign operations to pounds sterling, but includes the corresponding impact of financial instruments used in net investment hedges.
The sensitivity analysis provided is hypothetical only and should be used with caution as the impacts provided are not necessarily indicative of the actual impacts that would be experienced because the Groups actual exposure to market rates is changing constantly as the Groups portfolio of commodity, debt and foreign currency contracts changes.
Changes in fair values or cash flows based on a variation in a market variable cannot be extrapolated because the relationship between the change in market variable and the change in fair value or cash flows may not be linear.
In addition, the effect of a change in a particular market variable on fair values or cash flows is calculated without considering interrelationships between the various market rates or mitigating actions that would be taken by the Group.
The sensitivity analysis provided excludes the impact of proprietary energy trading assets and liabilities because the VaR associated with the Groups proprietary energy trading activities is less than 5 million.
Transactional currency risk The Group has performed an analysis of the sensitivity of the Groups financial position and performance to changes in the fair value or future cash flows of foreign currency denominated financial instruments.
The Group deems 10% movements to US dollar, Canadian dollar and euro currency rates relative to pounds sterling, to be reasonably possible.
The impact of such movements on profit and equity, both after taxation, is immaterial to the Group.
Interest rate risk The Group has performed an analysis of the sensitivity of the Groups financial position and performance to changes in interest rates.
The Group deems 1% movements to UK, US and euro interest rates, to be reasonably possible.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Commodity price risk The impacts of reasonably possible changes in commodity prices on profit and equity, both after taxation, based on the assumptions set out above are as follows: 2013 2012 Reasonably Reasonably possible possible Base price change Base price change Energy prices i in variable ii i in variable ii UK gas p therm 66 6 64 5 UK power MWh 55 4 51 4 88 7 UK coal US$ tonne 97 13 UK emissions tonne 5 1 7 2 UK oil US$ bbl 102 8 103 17 North American gas USc therm 41 3 42 6 North American power US$ MWh 50 4 39 4 2013 2012 Impact on Impact on profit ii profit ii Incremental profit loss m m UK energy prices combined increase decrease 90 97 92 83 North American energy prices combined increase decrease 71 71 93 93 i The base price represents the average forward market price over the duration of the active market curve used in the sensitivity analysis provided.
ii The reasonably possible change in variable and the impact on profit are calculated using both the active and inactive market curves for all UK energy prices.
The impact on equity of such price changes is immaterial.
Credit risk management Credit risk is the risk of loss associated with a counterpartys inability or failure to discharge its obligations under a contract.
The Group continues to be vigilant in managing counterparty risks in accordance with its financial risk management policies.
In 2013 there have been relatively few credit rating downgrades of financial institutions and European energy majors, compared with 2012.
The Group has not altered its rating thresholds for counterparty credit limits and continues to operate within its limits.
In the US and Europe, ongoing regulatory changes are resulting in increased trading over exchanges or via zero threshold margined contracts.
This helps to reduce counterparty credit risk, but carries increased liquidity requirements.
The Group is exposed to credit risk in its treasury, trading, energy procurement and downstream activities.
Credit risk from financial assets is measured by counterparty credit rating as follows: 2013 2012 Receivables from Receivables from Derivative financial treasury, trading and Derivative financial treasury, trading and instruments with energy procurement Cash and cash instruments with energy procurement Cash and cash positive fair values counterparties equivalents positive fair values counterparties equivalents m m m m m m AAA to AA 1 33 358 1 78 550 AA to A 533 576 349 392 439 354 BBB to BBB 251 405 2 85 108 2 BB to BB 5 140 1 71 42 1 B or lower 3 16 5 i Unrated 7 140 9 32 182 24 800 1,310 719 581 854 931 i The unrated counterparty receivables primarily comprise amounts due from subsidiaries of rated entities, exchanges or clearing houses.
Details of how credit risk is managed across the asset categories is provided below.
a Treasury, trading and energy procurement activities Wholesale counterparty credit exposures are monitored by individual counterparty and by category of credit rating, and are subject to approved limits.
The majority of significant exposures are with counterparties rated A A3 or better.
The Group uses master netting agreements to reduce credit risk and net settles payments with counterparties where net settlement provisions exist see S6 Financial assets and liabilities subject to offsetting, master netting arrangements and similar arrangments for details of amounts offset.
In addition, the Group employs a variety of other methods to mitigate credit risk: margining, various forms of bank and parent company guarantees and letters of credit.
See note 24 d for details of cash pledged or received under margin collateral agreements.
100% of the Groups credit risk associated with its treasury, trading and energy procurement activities is with counterparties in related energy industries or with financial institutions.
148 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Performance Measures Shareholder Information Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Supplementary Information S3.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT IFRS 7 requires disclosure of information about the exposure to credit risk arising from financial instruments only.
Only certain of the Groups energy procurement contracts constitute financial instruments under IAS 39.
As a result, whilst the Group manages the credit risk associated with both financial and non-financial energy procurement contracts, it is the carrying value of financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 note S6 that represents the maximum exposure to credit risk in accordance with IFRS 7. b Downstream activities In the case of business customers, credit risk is managed by checking a companys creditworthiness and financial strength both before commencing trade and during the business relationship.
For residential customers, creditworthiness is ascertained normally before commencing trade to determine the payment mechanism required to reduce credit risk to an acceptable level.
Certain customers will only be accepted on a prepayment basis or with a security deposit.
In some cases, an ageing of receivables is monitored and used to manage the exposure to credit risk associated with both business and residential customers.
In other cases, credit risk is monitored and managed by grouping customers according to method of payment or profile.
Liquidity risk management and going concern Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group experiences significant movements in its liquidity position due primarily to the seasonal nature of its business and margin cash arrangements associated with certain wholesale commodity contracts.
To mitigate this risk the Group maintains significant committed facilities and holds cash on deposit.
See note 24 for further information.
The Groups liquidity position has remained strong throughout 2013.

Merger reserve During February 1997, BG plc formerly British Gas plc demerged certain businesses grouped together under GB Gas Holdings Limited GBGH to form Centrica plc.
Upon demerger, the share capital of GBGH was transferred to Centrica plc and was recorded at the nominal value of shares issued to BG plc shareholders.
In accordance with the Companies Act 1985, no premium was recorded on the shares issued.
On consolidation, the difference between the nominal value of the Companys shares issued and the amount of share capital and share premium of GBGH at the date of demerger was credited to a merger reserve.
Capital redemption reserve In accordance with the Companies Act 1985, the Company transferred to the capital redemption reserve an amount equal to the nominal value of shares repurchased and subsequently cancelled 16 million.

OTHER EQUITY Revaluation reserve During 2005, the revaluation of the Groups existing interest in Centrica SHB Limited to fair value, following the acquisition by the Group of the remaining 40% stake in the company, was recorded as a revaluation reserve adjustment.
In addition to the above, further revaluation reserves arose in 2009 on the revaluation of producing gas and oil assets located in Alberta, Canada, following the acquisition by the Group of additional interests.
During the year an impairment charge was made against these gas and oil assets see note 7, of which 20 million was recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income through the revaluation reserve together with an offsetting 5 million deferred tax movement.
Own shares reserve The own shares reserve reflects the cost of shares in the Company held in the Centrica employee share ownership trusts to meet the future requirements of the Groups share-based payment plans.
Treasury shares reserve Treasury shares are reacquired equity instruments of the Company.
During 2013, the Group purchased 500 million of its own shares on the market under the share repurchase programme.
Share-based payments reserve The share-based payments reserve reflects the obligation to deliver shares to employees under the Groups share schemes in return for services provided.
Foreign currency translation reserve The foreign currency translation reserve comprises exchange translation differences on foreign currency net investments.
Historically the Group has hedged its foreign investments and so the opening balance of foreign currency translation reserve includes exchange translation differences on borrowings and derivatives classified as net investment hedges under the requirements of IAS 39.
Cash flow hedging reserve The cash flow hedging reserve comprises fair value movements on instruments designated as cash flow hedges under the requirements of IAS 39.
Amounts are transferred from the cash flow hedging reserve to the Group Income Statement or Group Balance Sheet as and when the hedged item affects the Group Income Statement or Group Balance Sheet which is, for the most part, on delivery of physical volumes for energy contracts and settlement of interest on debt instruments.
Note S5 provides further detail on cash flow hedging.
HEDGE ACCOUNTING For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified either as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or, in previous periods, hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
The fair values of derivatives and primary financial instruments in hedge accounting relationships at 31 December were immaterial, except as follows: 2013 2012 Assets Assets 31 December m m Fair value hedges 95 160 The Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting under IAS 39 are described below.
Fair value hedges A derivative is designated a hedging instrument and its relationship to a recognised asset or liability classified as a fair value hedge when it hedges the exposure to changes in the fair value of that recognised asset or liability.
The Groups fair value hedges consist of interest rate swaps used to protect against changes in the fair value of fixed-rate, long-term debt due to movements in market interest rates.
Any gain or loss from re-measuring the hedging instrument to fair value is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the Group Income Statement within net finance cost.
The Group discontinues fair value hedge accounting if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or the Group revokes the designation.
Any adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged financial instrument for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to the Group Income Statement.
Amortisation may begin as soon as an adjustment exists and shall begin no later than when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the risk being hedged.
Gains or losses arising on fair value hedges for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 were immaterial.
Cash flow hedges A derivative is classified as a cash flow hedge when it hedges exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk either associated with a recognised asset, liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
The Groups cash flow hedges consist primarily of: physical and financial gas and power purchase contracts used to protect against the variability in future cash flows associated with highly probable forecast purchases of gas and power due to movements in market commodity prices: forward foreign exchange contracts used to protect against the variability of functional currency denominated cash flows associated with non-functional currency denominated highly probable forecast transactions: interest rate swaps used to protect against the variability in cash flows associated with floating-rate borrowings due to movements in market interest rates: and cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts used to protect against the variability in cash flows associated with borrowings denominated in non-functional currencies.
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 | 151 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Supplementary Information S5.
HEDGE ACCOUNTING The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument which is effective is recognised directly in equity while any ineffectiveness is recognised in the Group Income Statement.
The gains or losses that are initially recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income are transferred to the Group Income Statement in the same period in which the highly probable forecast transaction affects income, for example when the future sale of physical gas or physical power actually occurs.
Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability on its recognition.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or the Group revokes the designation.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity remains in equity until the highly probable forecast transaction occurs.
If the transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the Group Income Statement.
Note S4 details movements in the cash flow hedging reserve.
The ineffective portion of gains and losses on cash flow hedging are immaterial and are recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Net investment hedges Historically the Group engaged in net investment hedging NIH whereby it would obtain foreign currency debt issued in the same currency as the net investment.
Such hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity: any gain or loss on the ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in the Group Income Statement.
In 2009 the Group ceased to NIH, however the opening balance of the foreign currency translation reserve includes cumulative exchange translation differences on borrowings and derivatives classified as a NIH under the requirements of IAS 39.
These balances will be recycled to the Group Income Statement on disposal of the foreign operation.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties under no compulsion to act.
The Group has documented internal policies for determining fair value, including methodologies used to establish valuation adjustments required for credit risk.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities held at amortised cost The carrying value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost are approximately equal to their fair value except as listed below: 2013 2012 Carrying value Fair value Fair value Carrying value Fair value Fair value 31 December Notes m m hierarchy m m hierarchy Bank overdrafts and loans 24 321 357 Level 2 367 388 Level 2 Bonds 5,013 5,399 Level 1 4,483 5,119 Level 1 24 269 298 Level 2 Obligations under finance leases 24 299 337 Level 2 Bank overdrafts, loans and other borrowings The fair values of bonds are based on quoted market prices.
The fair values of bank loans have been determined by discounting cash flows with reference to relevant market rates of interest.
The fair values of overdrafts and commercial paper are assumed to equal their book values due to the short-term nature of these amounts.
The fair values of obligations under finance leases have been determined by discounting contractual cash flows with reference to the Groups cost of borrowing.
Other financial instruments Due to their nature and or short-term maturity, the fair values of trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, trade and other payables and provisions are estimated to approximate their carrying values.
Derivative financial instruments and energy contracts designated at fair value through profit or loss The fair values of foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives are determined by reference to closing market rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of energy derivatives are determined using valuation techniques based in part on observable market data and in part on internal estimates not currently supported by observable market data.
The extent to which fair values of energy derivatives are based on observable market data is determined by the extent to which the market for the underlying commodity is judged to be active.
The Group has judged each of the markets in which it operates as active for the purposes of accounting as follows: Active period of markets Gas Power Coal Emissions Oil UK years 3 3 3 3 3 North America years 5 Up to 5 n a Up to 5 3 The fair values of energy contracts within the scope of IAS 39 that settle inside the active period of the market are based on quoted market prices and expected volumes, discounted at an average rate of 1% per annum 2012: 1%.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments in North America and Europe are based primarily on quoted market prices.
In the UK and US, however, certain energy contracts extend beyond the active period of the market.
The fair values of energy contracts that extend beyond the active period of the market are determined by reference in part to published price quotations in active markets and in part by using valuation techniques based on commodity prices derived using assumptions that are based on internal market expectations and expected volumes, discounted using an average discount rate of 2% per annum for 2013 2012: 2%.
152 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Performance Measures Shareholder Information Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Supplementary Information S6.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Where the fair value at initial recognition for contracts which extend beyond the active period differs from the transaction price, a day-one gain or loss will arise.
Such gains and losses are deferred and amortised to the Group Income Statement based on volumes purchased or delivered over the contractual period until such time as observable market data becomes available see note S2 for further detail.
The amount that has yet to be recognised in the Group Income Statement relating to the differences between the transaction prices and the amounts that would have arisen had valuation techniques used for subsequent measurement been applied at initial recognition, less subsequent releases, is immaterial.
Fair value hierarchy Financial assets and financial liabilities measured and held at fair value are classified into one of three categories: 2013 2012 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m m m m m 31 December Financial assets Derivative financial instruments: Energy derivatives 27 450 115 592 29 195 139 363 Interest rate derivatives 95 95 185 185 113 Foreign exchange derivatives 113 33 33 Treasury gilts designated at fair value through profit or loss 126 126 130 130 Debt instruments 52 3 55 56 2 58 Equity instruments 23 7 30 12 6 18 Total financial assets 228 658 125 1,011 227 413 147 787 Financial liabilities Derivative financial instruments: Energy derivatives 24 648 81 753 59 570 157 786 Interest rate derivatives 48 48 88 88 Foreign exchange derivatives 136 136 68 68 Total financial liabilities 24 832 81 937 59 726 157 942 There were no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during 2013 and 2012.
The reconciliation of the Level 3 fair value measurements during the year is as follows: 2013 2012 Financial assets Financial liabilities Financial assets Financial liabilities m m m m Level 3 financial instruments 1 January 147 157 52 206 Total realised and unrealised losses gains: Recognised in Group Income Statement 60 115 31 Purchases, sales, issuances and settlements net 44 53 20 i Transfers from Level 3 to Level 2 63 188 18 Foreign exchange movements 3 1 31 December 125 81 147 157 Total gains losses for the year for Level 3 financial ii instruments held at the end of the reporting year 3 50 100 34 i Transfers in 2013 primarily arise due to the extension of the active period of the UK gas and power markets.
Transfers between levels are deemed to occur at the beginning of the reporting period.
ii 3 million gains 2012: 100 million gains for the year for Level 3 financial assets held at the end of the reporting year were recognised within certain re-measurements and no gains or losses 2012: nil were recognised in other comprehensive income.
50 million losses 2012: 34 million gains for the year for Level 3 financial liabilities held at the end of the reporting year were recognised within certain re-measurements and no gains or losses 2012: nil were recognised in other comprehensive income.
The impacts of reasonably possible changes to assumed gas, power, coal, emissions and oil prices on the net fair value of the Groups fair value measurements categorised as Level 3 are immaterial and result from changing the assumptions used for fair valuing energy contracts in relation to gas, power, emissions, coal and oil prices to reasonably possible alternative assumptions at the balance sheet date.
The fair value calculations only impact those contracts entered into which are within the scope of IAS 39 and are marked-to-market based on valuation models using assumptions that are not currently observable in an active market.
The sensitivity analysis is only hypothetical.
This is because the Groups actual exposure to market rates is constantly changing as the Groups portfolio of energy contracts changes.
Changes in fair values based on a variation in a market variable cannot be extrapolated as the relationship between the change in market variable and the change in fair value will not always be linear.

FIXED-FEE SERVICE AND INSURANCE CONTRACTS This section includes fixed-fee service and insurance contract disclosures for services related to British Gas Residential services and Direct Energy Residential and business services.
Fixed-fee service FFS contracts in North America are entered into with home and business services customers.
FFS contracts in the UK are entered into with home services customers by British Gas Services Limited BGSL.
Insurance contracts in the UK are entered into with home services customers by British Gas Insurance Limited BGIL, authorised by the PRA and regulated by the FCA and the PRA.
Product offerings include central heating, boiler and controls, plumbing and drains and electrical appliance insurance cover.
FFS contracts continue until cancelled by either party: insurance contracts normally provide cover for 12 months with the option of renewal.
The contracts protect policyholders against the risk of breakdowns, resulting in the transfer of an element of risk to the contract provider.
Benefits provided to customers vary in accordance with terms and conditions of the contracts entered into: however, they generally include maintenance, repair and or replacement of the items affected.
The levels of risk exposure and service provision to customers under contract terms are dependent on the occurrence of uncertain future events, in particular the nature and frequency of faults and the cost of repair or replacement of the items affected.
Accordingly, the timing and amount of future cash outflows associated with the contracts is uncertain.
The key terms and conditions that affect future cash flows are as follows: provision of labour and parts for repairs, dependent on the agreement and associated level of service: one safety and maintenance inspection either annually or in every continuous two-year period, as set out in the agreement: no limit to the number of call-outs to carry out repair work: and limits on certain maintenance and repair costs.
Revenue is recognised over the life of contracts having regard to the incidence of risk, in particular the seasonal propensity of claims which span the life of the contract as a result of emergency maintenance being available throughout the contract term.
Costs incurred to settle claims represent principally the engineer workforce employed by Centrica within home services and the cost of parts utilised in repair or maintenance.
These costs are accounted for over a 12-month period with adjustments made to reflect the seasonality of workload over a given year.
Weather conditions and the seasonality of repairs both affect the profile of the workload and associated costs incurred across the year.
The risk exposure of these uncertain events is actively managed by undertaking the following risk mitigation activities: an initial service visit is provided to customers taking up most central heating contracts and in some instances pre-existing faults may lead to the contract being cancelled and no further cover being provided: an annual maintenance inspection is performed as part of most central heating contacts to help identify and prevent issues developing into significant maintenance or breakdown claims: and contract limits are applied to certain types of maintenance and repair work considered to be higher risk in terms of frequency and cost.
The costs of fixed-fee service claims and insurance claims incurred during the year were 97 million 2012: 92 million and 356 million 2012: 342 million respectively and are included in the table below in expenses relating to fixed-fee service and insurance contracts.
All claims are settled immediately and in full.
Due to the short average lead time between claims occurrence and settlement, no material provisions were outstanding at the balance sheet date 2012: nil.

Any deficiency is charged immediately to the Group Income Statement.
Claims frequency is sensitive to the reliability of appliances as well as the impact of weather conditions.
The contracts are not exposed to any interest rate risk or significant credit risk and do not contain any embedded derivatives.
