Share-based payments continued 109 Volatility was based on historic share prices over a period equal to the vesting period.

For executive share options the vesting period is 3 years.
If options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, these options expire.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before options vest.
SAYE options vest after 3 or 5 years and expire 3 or 5 years after the date of grant.
The risk-free interest rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds on a term consistent with the vesting period.
Dividends used are based on actual dividends where data is known and future dividends estimated using a dividend cover of three times within the Boards target range.
The expected life of options used in the model has been adjusted, based upon managements best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
