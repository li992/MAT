Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 August 2013 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified to include the revaluation of investments and in accordance with the applicable UK Accounting Standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts.
They have also been prepared on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will continue to be granted.
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Further detail is included in the Directors Report unaudited on pages 27 and 28.
The financial statements, and the net asset value per share figures, have been prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
b Investments Listed investments have been designated upon initial recognition as fair value through profit or loss.
Investments are recognised and fide-recognised on the trade date at fair value, which is generally deemed to be the cost of the investment at that point.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investments are valued at fair value, which for listed investments is deemed to be bid market prices or closing prices for SETS London Stock Exchanges electronic trading service stocks sourced from the London Stock Exchange.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included as a capital item in the Income Statement and are ultimately recognised in the capital reserve.
c Income Dividends other than special dividends, including taxes deducted at source, are included in revenue by reference to the date on which the investment is quoted ex-dividend.
Special dividends are reviewed on a case-by-case basis and may be credited to capital, if circumstances dictate.
Dividends receivable on equity shares where no exdividend date is quoted are brought into account when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
Fixed returns on non-equity shares are recognised on a time-apportioned basis so as to reflect the effective yield on shares.
Other returns on non-equity shares are recognised when the right to return is established.
The fixed return on a debt security, if material, is recognised on a time apportioned basis so as to reflect the effective yield on each security.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of the foregone cash dividend is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of cash dividend foregone is recognised in capital reserves.
Interest receivable on bank balances is dealt with on an accruals basis.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged through the revenue column of the Income Statement with the exception of expenses directly relating to the acquisition or disposal of an investment, in which case, they are added to the cost of the investment or deducted from the sale proceeds.
Such transaction costs are disclosed in accordance with the SORP.
These expenses are charged to the capital column of the Income Statement and are separately identified and disclosed in note 9. e Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences, that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more or a right to pay less tax in future have occurred at the Balance Sheet date, measured on an undiscounted basis and based on enacted tax rates.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences arising between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the accounts which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Due to the Companys status as an investment trust company, and the intention to continue to meet the conditions required to obtain approval for the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
36 Edinburgh Dragon Trust plc f Capital reserves Gains and losses on investments and changes in fair values of investments which are readily convertible to cash, without accepting adverse terms, are transferred to the capital reserve.
g Foreign currency Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling on the Balance Sheet date.
Transactions involving foreign currencies are converted at the rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Gains and losses on the realisation of foreign currencies are recognised in the Income Statement and are then transferred to the capital reserve.
h Dividends payable Final dividends are dealt with in the period in which they are paid.
i 3.5% Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock 2018 Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock CULS issued by the Company is regarded as a compound instrument, comprising of a liability component and an equity component.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component was estimated by assuming that an equivalent non-convertible obligation of the Company would have a coupon rate of 4.662%.
The fair value of the equity component, representing the option to convert liability into equity, is derived from the difference between the issue proceeds of the CULS and the fair value assigned to the liability.
The liability component is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate.
Direct expenses associated with the CULS issue are allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to the split of the proceeds of the issue.
Expenses allocated to the liability component are amortised over the life of the instrument.
The interest expense on the CULS is calculated according to the effective interest rate method by applying the assumed rate of 4.662% at initial recognition to the liability component of the instrument.
The difference between this amount and the interest paid is added to the carrying liability of the CULS.
On conversion of CULS, equity is issued and the liability component is derecognised.
The original equity component recognised at inception remains in equity.
No gain or loss is recognised on conversion.
When CULS is repurchased for cancellation, the fair value of the liability at the redemption date is compared to its carrying amount, giving rise to a gain or loss on redemption that is recognised through profit or loss.
The amount of consideration allocated to equity is recognised in equity with no gain or loss being recognised.
In the event of a winding-up of the Company the rights and claims of the Trustee and CULS holders would be subordinate to the claims of all creditors in respect of the Companys secured and unsecured borrowings, under the terms of the Trust Deed.

Dividends In order to comply with the requirements of Sections 1158 -1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 and with company law, the Company is required to make a final dividend distribution.
The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
The table below sets out the total dividends paid and proposed in respect of the financial year, which is the basis on which the requirements of Sections 1158 1159 are considered.
The revenue available for distribution by way of dividend for the year is 6,725,000 2012 6,472,000.

For the purpose of calculating total, revenue and capital returns per Ordinary share, the number of Ordinary shares used is the weighted average number used in the basic calculation plus the number of Ordinary shares deemed to be issued for no consideration on exercise of all 3.5% Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock 2018 CULS.
The calculations indicate that the exercise of CULS would result in an increase in the weighted average number of Ordinary shares of 19,293,362 2012 19,307,092 to 215,656,504 2012 215,656,512 Ordinary shares.
For the years ended 31 August 2013 and 31 August 2012 there was no dilution to the revenue return per Ordinary share.
Where dilution occurs, the net returns are adjusted for items relating to the CULS.
Total earnings for the period are tested for dilution.
Once dilution has been determined individual revenue and capital earnings are adjusted.
Accrued CULS finance costs for the period and unamortised issues expenses are reversed.

Interest is paid on the CULS on 31 January and 31 July each year, of which 42 Edinburgh Dragon Trust plc 100% is charged to revenue in line with the Boards expected long-term split of returns from the investment portfolio of the Company.
The Company has decided to make an annual transfer between the equity component of the CULS and the revenue reserve so that the revenue reserve reflects distributable reserves as defined by company law.

Capital management policies and procedures The Companys capital management objectives are: to ensure that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern: and to maximise the capital return to its equity shareholders through an appropriate balance of equity capital and debt.
The Board has imposed a maximum gearing level of 20% of net assets.
The Board monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes the nature and planned level of gearing, which takes account of the Managers views on the market, and the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
The Company has no externally imposed capital requirements.
Financial instruments Risk management The Companys financial instruments comprise securities and other investments, cash balances, Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock and debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations: for example, in respect of sales and purchases awaiting settlement, and debtors for accrued income.
The Manager has a dedicated investment management process, which aims to ensure that the investment policy explained on page 3 is followed.
Stock selection procedures are in place based on the active portfolio management and identification of stocks.
The portfolio is reviewed on a periodic basis by a Senior Investment Manager and also by the Managers Investment Committee.
The Companys Manager has an independent Investment Risk department for reviewing the investment risk parameters of the Companys portfolio on a regular basis.
The department reports to the Managers Performance Review Committee which is chaired by the Managers Chief Investment Officer.
The departments responsibility is to review and monitor exante predicted portfolio risk and style characteristics using best practice, industry standard multi-factor models.
Additionally, the Managers Compliance department continually monitors the Companys investment and borrowing powers and reports to the Managers Risk Management Committee.
The main financial risks that the Company faces from its financial instruments are market risk comprising interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks.
The Managers policies for managing these risks are summarised below and have been applied throughout the year.
The numerical disclosures exclude shortterm debtors and creditors.
Market risk The fair value of or future cash flows from a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk.
44 Edinburgh Dragon Trust plc Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment and borrowing decisions.
Interest risk profile The interest rate risk profile of the portfolio of the Companys financial assets and liabilities, excluding equity holdings which are all non-interest bearing, at the Balance Sheet date was as follows: Weighted average Weighted period for which average Fixed Floating rate is fixed interest rate rate rate At 31 August 2013 Years % 000 000 Assets Hong Kong Dollar 809 Indian Rupee 113 Singapore Dollar 19 Sterling 0.13 3,251 Taiwanese Dollar 6 Thailand Baht 20 US Dollar 6 Total assets n a n a 4,224 Liabilities 3.5% Convertible Unsecured Loan 4.42 3.50 56,990 Stock 2018 Weighted average Weighted period for which average Fixed Floating rate is fixed interest rate rate rate At 31 August 2012 Years % 000 000 Assets Indian Rupee 21 Sterling 0.23 2,617 Taiwanese Dollar 13 Total assets n a n a 2,651 Liabilities 3.5% Convertible Unsecured Loan 5.42 3.50 56,366 Stock 2018 The weighted average interest rate is based on the current yield of each asset, weighted by its market value.
The floating rate assets consist of cash deposits on call earning interest at prevailing market rates.
The Companys equity portfolio and short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the above tables.
Interest rate sensitivity Movements in interest rates would not significantly affect net assets attributable to the Companys shareholders and total profit.
Edinburgh Dragon Trust plc 45 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Foreign currency risk The majority of the Companys investment portfolio is invested in overseas securities and the Balance Sheet, therefore, can be significantly affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
It is not the Companys policy to hedge this risk on a continuing basis but the Company may, from time to time, match specific overseas investments with foreign currency borrowings.
The revenue account is subject to currency fluctuation arising on dividends paid in foreign currencies.
The Company does not hedge this currency risk.
Other price risk Other price risks ie changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate or currency risk may affect the value of the quoted investments.
It is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular country or sector.
Both the allocation of assets and the stock selection process, as detailed on page 11, act to reduce market risk.
The Manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board, which meets regularly in order to review investment strategy.
The investments held by the Company are listed on various stock exchanges worldwide.
Other price risk sensitivity If market prices at the Balance Sheet date had been 10% higher or lower while all other variables remained constant, the return attributable to Ordinary shareholders for the year ended 31 August 2013 would have increased decreased by 46 Edinburgh Dragon Trust plc 60,341,000 2012 increased decreased by 57,360,000 and equity reserves would have increased decreased by the same amount.
Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Liquidity risk is not considered to be significant, as the Companys assets mainly comprise readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
In order to monitor the concentration of Dragons investee companies with Aberdeen, the total percentage holdings of those securities owned by Aberdeen-managed funds is reviewed by the Board.
The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions, and reviews these on a regular basis.
The Board has imposed a maximum gearing level, measured on the most stringent basis of calculation after netting off cash equivalents, of 20%.
Short-term flexibility can be achieved through the use of loan and overdraft facilities.
At 31 August 2012 and 2013 the Company had no loan or overdraft facility in place.
Details of the Boards policy on gearing are shown in the interest rate risk section of this note.
Liquidity risk exposure At 31 August 2013 the Company had borrowings in the form of the 59,821,680 2012 59,847,853 nominal of 3.5% Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock 2018. Credit risk This is the risk of failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction that could result in the Company suffering a loss.
The risk is not considered to be significant, and is actively managed as follows: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, whose credit-standing is reviewed periodically by the Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker: the risk of counterparty, including the custodian, exposure due to failed trades causing a loss to the Company is mitigated by the review of failed trade reports on a daily basis.
In addition, the third party administrators carries out a stock reconciliation to the Custodians records on a daily basis to ensure discrepancies are picked up on a timely basis.
The Managers Compliance department carries out periodic reviews of the Custodians operations and reports its finding to the Managers Risk Management Committee.
This review will also include checks on the maintenance and security of investments held: cash is held only with reputable banks with high quality external credit enhancements.
None of the Companys financial assets are secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.
Credit risk exposure In summary, compared to the amounts in the Balance Sheet, the maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 August was as follows: 2013 2012 Balance Maximum Balance Maximum Sheet exposure Sheet exposure Current assets 000 000 000 000 Loans and receivables 2,438 2,438 1,598 1,598 Cash at bank and in hand 4,224 4,224 2,651 2,651 6,662 6,662 4,249 4,249 None of the Companys financial assets is past due or impaired.
Edinburgh Dragon Trust plc 47 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the Companys financial liabilities at 31 August was as follows: 2013 2012 000 000 In more than one year 56,990 56,366 At 31 August 2013 the full contractual liability for the CULS assuming no further conversions was 69,076,000 2012 71,201,000.
Fair value hierarchy FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures requires an entity to classify fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
The fair value hierarchy has the following levels: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices : and Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All of the Companys investments are in quoted equities 2012 same actively traded on recognised stock exchanges, with their fair value being determined by reference to their quoted bid prices at the reporting date.
The total value of the investments 2013 603,405,000: 2012 573,602,000 have therefore been deemed as Level 1.
