Recoverability of contingent consideration On completion of the Ugandan farm-down in 2012, Tullow recognised $341.3 million of contingent consideration due from Total and CNOOC as a non-current receivable.
The amount of contingent consideration recoverable is dependent on the timing of the receipt of certain project approvals.
Delays in receipt of the project approvals will result in a decrease on a straight-line basis of the amount recoverable.
Management have exercised judgement in determining when the project approvals will be received and currently expect the condition to be met in the first half of 2014 and therefore the receivable will be settled in full.
The judgement has been based on the progress of ongoing discussions with Government and Partners regarding the development programme for Uganda.
Recoverable security paid to the Uganda Revenue Authority URA Under the terms of Tullow and Heritages PSA, Tullow opened proceedings against Heritage in London to recover the security paid by Tullow as designated agent to the URA.
Tullow was successful in this action and received payment of $345.8 million in August 2013.
On 20 September 2013, the Court of Appeal granted Heritage permission to appeal the judgment with the appeal hearing expected to take place in May 2014.
The Directors have exercised judgement based on external legal advice in determining the most likely outcome of the appeal, being an award in the Groups favour.

Taxation on profit on ordinary activities continued Following previous reductions in the main rate of UK corporation tax, on 26 March 2012 additional reductions from 26% to 24% effective from 1 April 2012 and from 24% to 23% from 1 April 2013 were substantively enacted.
The Finance Act 2013 substantively enacted on 2 July 2013 included legislation reducing the main rate of UK corporation tax from 23% to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014 and a further phased reduction in the mainstream rate to 20% at 1 April 2015.
The Groups profit before taxation will continue to arise in jurisdictions where the effective rate of taxation differs from that in the UK.
Furthermore, unsuccessful exploration expenditure is often incurred in jurisdictions where the Group has no taxable profits, such that no related tax benefit arises.
Accordingly, the Groups tax charge will continue to vary according to the jurisdictions in which pre-tax profits and exploration costs written off arise.
The Group has tax losses of $1,783.0 million 2012: $1,724.7 million that are available for offset against future taxable profits in the companies in which the losses arose.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group.
The Group has recognised $52.0 million in deferred tax assets in relation to taxable losses 2012: $49.4 million : this is disclosed net of a deferred tax liability in respect of capitalised interest.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of $24.5 million 2012: $30.0 million relating to unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Current tax assets As at 31 December 2013, current tax assets were $226.2 million 2012: $28.6 million of which $203.0 million relates to Norway, where 78% of exploration expenditure is refunded as a tax refund in the following year.

Acquisitions of subsidiaries On 11 December 2012 Tullow announced that it had acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital of Spring Energy Norway AS Spring.
The acquisition of Spring added a portfolio of 28 offshore licences across Norways continental shelf in the North, Norwegian and Barents Seas.
The acquisition enables the Group to rapidly build a strong platform for future growth in Norway.
The transaction had an effective date of 1 September 2012 but completed on 22 January 2013 and this is therefore the acquisition date.

The following table summarises the techniques used to arrive at fair value and certain key assumptions.

The total purchase consideration equals the aggregate of the pre-tax fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of Spring.
Given the nature of the oil and gas regime in Norway, the fair value of the business acquired has been determined based on the purchase price which is net of tax attributes.
As a consequence, the goodwill balance solely results from the requirement on an acquisition to recognise a deferred tax liability, calculated as the difference between the tax effect of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
Further details regarding the key inputs and assumptions on the valuation of intangible, exploration and evaluation assets and property plant and equipment are disclosed in notes 11, 12 and 13.
Provisions represent the present value of decommissioning costs $18.6 million which are expected to be incurred up to 2025 and a $10.0 million liability on development of the PL407 licence.
The contingent consideration represents the fair value of a contingent amount payable to the previous owners of Spring.
The payable is calculated as $0.5 bbl to $1.0 bbl of recoverable resources recognised by four operated wells expected to be drilled in 2013 and 2014 and is capped at $300 million.
All other items includes other non-current assets, trade receivables, other current assets, current tax assets, cash and cash equivalents, trade and other payables, other financial liabilities and deferred tax liabilities.
Other current financial liabilities at 31 December and at the acquisition date relate to Springs Exploration Finance Facility, which provides funding for 74% of Norwegian exploration costs secured against the exploration tax refund on exploration expenditure of 78%.
com 143 Financial Statements NOTES TO GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2013 Note 9.
Acquisitions of subsidiaries continued Transaction costs of $0.9m in respect of the acquisition are recognised in the 2013 income statement.
From the date of acquisition, Spring has contributed $11.2 million to Group revenues and a loss of $17.7 million to the profit of the Group.
If the acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for the period would have been $2,647.8 million and Group profit would have been $216.9 million.
There were no acquisitions involving business combinations in 2012.
Disposals In 2013 the Group completed the disposal of Tullow Bangladesh Limited for $41.4 million which was previously classified as held for sale note 19.
During 2013 the Group also farmed down a portion of its interest in CI-103 in Cte dIvoire and received $8.6 million in cash for past costs note 12.
In 2012 the Group completed the farm-down of one-third of its Uganda interests to both Total and CNOOC the partners for consideration of $3.3 billion including $341.3 million of discounted contingent consideration, note 15, generating a profit on disposal of $701.0 million.
In 2012 the Group provided for $30.0 million in respect of the $313.0 million recoverable security paid by Tullow to the Uganda Revenue Authority as agent to the transaction between Tullow and Heritage Oil and Gas Ltd note 15.
This balance was initially capitalised as a cost of the Uganda assets which were subsequently farmed down.
Therefore on receipt of the receivable in full the Group recorded $30 million as a profit on disposal in the 2013 income statement.
The $30.0 million balance previously provided for has been treated as an investing activity in the cash flow statement whereas the remaining $283.0 million is treated as a decrease in receivables.
Further disposals of oil and gas assets and non-oil and gas assets generating a loss on disposal of $0.5 million were completed in 2013 2012: $1.5 million, profit.
Goodwill 2013 2012 $m $m At 1 January Acquisition of subsidiaries note 9 350.5 350.5 At 31 December Related deferred tax at 31 December 285.8 64.7 Total net asset impact after tax The Groups goodwill arose from acquisition of Spring in 2013 note 9 and is allocated to the group of cash-generating units CGUs that represent the assets acquired.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as at 31 December and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
The goodwill balance solely results from the requirement on an acquisition to recognise a deferred tax liability, calculated as the difference between the tax effect of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
As a result, for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, the related deferred tax liabilities recognised on acquisition are included in the group of CGUs.
The above table details the net impact of goodwill and the related deferred tax on the CGU.
In assessing goodwill for impairment the Group has compared the carrying value of goodwill and carrying value of the related group of CGUs with the recoverable amounts relating to those CGUs.
The carrying value of goodwill and carrying value of the related group of CGUs was $640.7 million and the recoverable amount of the CGUs was $646.5 million, resulting in no impairment.
Key assumptions The valuation techniques, methodology, inputs and assumptions used for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing performed as at 31 December 2013 are the same as those used as part of the IFRS 3 fair value allocation detailed in note 9.
Further details of how those key assumptions were calculated are summarised below: Commodity prices Forecast commodity prices are estimated using observable market forward curves.
Recoverable reserves and resources Proven and probable reserves are estimated using standard recognised evaluation techniques.
The estimate is reviewed at least twice annually and is regularly reviewed by independent consultants.
Future development costs are estimated taking into account the level of development required to produce the reserves by reference to operators, where applicable, and internal engineers.
Capital expenditure The capital expenditure assumptions represent managements best estimate at the date of impairment testing of future capital requirements linked to the costs associated with the extraction of the related reserves and resources.
144 Tullow Oil plc 2013 Annual Report and Accounts Financial Statements 4 Operating costs The operating cost assumptions represent managements best estimate at the date of impairment testing of the costs to be incurred.
The estimation of operating costs includes consideration of current operating costs, expectation of future costs and the nature and location of the operation.
Dollar per boe of risk resources For exploration prospects a dollar per boe $ boe valuation methodology was used, whereby value was ascribed to prospects based on an internal estimate of risked resources multiplied by a $ boe figure representing a likely sales case.
The $ boe was risked to reflect the proximity to existing infrastructure, subsurface risks and the likelihood of development from a recognised valuation of $2 boe for Norwegian North Sea prospects.
Discount rates Discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks specific to each CGU, taking into consideration the time value of money and individual risks of the underlying assets that have not been incorporated in the cash flow estimates.
The discount rate calculation is based on the specific circumstances of the Group and its operating segments and is derived from its Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC, with appropriate adjustments made to reflect the risks specific to the CGU and to determine the pre-tax rate.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions Management believes that there are no reasonably possible changes in any of the above key assumptions that would cause the carrying value of the CGU to materially exceed its recoverable amount.

Other fixed assets include leasehold improvements, motor vehicles and office equipment.
During 2012, the TEN Project in Ghana was transferred from contingent resources to commercial reserves following submission of the Plan of Development to the Government of Ghana.
No material transfers were made in 2013.
An impairment loss after tax of $27 million $44.0 million before tax was recognised in respect of the Thames field in the UK 2012: MBoundi, $31.3 million as a result of an increase in the estimated cost to decommission.
The recoverable amount was determined by estimating its value in use.
In calculating this impairment, management used a production profile based on proven and probable reserves estimates and a range of assumptions, including a gas price assumption equal to the forward curve in 2014 and 2015 and 60.0p th thereafter and a pre-tax discount rate assumption of 10%.
The remainder of the impairment loss relates to current year expenditure on the Brage field, Norway, which has a zero recoverable amount.
Depletion and amortisation for oil and gas properties is calculated on a unit-of-production basis, using the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves at the end of the period plus production in the period, generally on a field-by-field basis.
Commercial reserves estimates are based on a number of underlying assumptions including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, which are inherently uncertain.
Commercial reserves estimates are based on a Group reserves report produced by an independent engineer.
However, the amount of reserves that will ultimately be recovered from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the fields life.

Assets classified as held for sale In March 2012, the Board resolved to dispose of the Groups Asia operations.
In April 2013 Tullow announced the sale of Tullow Bangladesh limited to KrisEnergy Asia Limited for a consideration of $41.4 million.
The sale completed in December 2013.
The consideration post working capital adjustment was lower than the carrying value of Tullow Bangladesh Limited and an impairment of $4.7 million has been recognised in cost of sales.
On 11 October 2013, Tullow signed a Sale and Purchase agreement with Ocean Pakistan Limited, a part of the Hashoo Group, for the sale of Tullows 100% owned Pakistan subsidiary, Tullow Pakistan Developments Limited.
The sale is expected to complete in early 2014.
The consideration post working capital adjustment is expected to be lower than the carrying value of Tullow Pakistan Developments Limited and an exploration write-off of $5.1 million has been recognised in the income statement.
The Groups Asia operations are included in the Europe, South America and Asia segment.

Short-term borrowings, term loans and most guarantees are secured by fixed and floating charges over the oil and gas assets of the Group.
The $3.5 billion Reserves Based Lending credit facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at Sterling or US dollar LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
The outstanding debt is repayable in line with the amortisation of bank commitments over the period to the final maturity date of 7 November 2019, or such time as is determined by reference to the remaining reserves of the assets, whichever is earlier.
The $500 million Revolving credit facility is repayable in full on 29 November 2014.
The facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at US dollar LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
The NOK 2,000 million Revolving Norwegian Exploration Finance facility is used to finance certain exploration activities on the Norwegian Continental Shelf which are eligible for a tax refund.
The facility is available for drawings until 31 December 2014 and its final maturity date is either the date the 2014 tax reimbursement claims are received or 31 December 2015, whichever is the earlier.
The facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at NIBOR plus an applicable margin.
At the end of December 2013, the headroom under the three facilities amounted to $2,403 million: $1,903 million under the $3.5 billion Reserves Based Lending credit facility, $500 million under the Revolving credit facility and nil under the Revolving Norwegian Exploration Finance facility.
At the end of December 2012, the headroom under the facilities amounted to $2,202 million: $1,702 million under the Reserves Based Lending credit facility and $500 million under the Revolving credit facility.
In November 2013 the Company completed an offering of $650 million aggregate principal amount of 6% senior notes due 2020.
Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually.
The notes, whose net proceeds were used to repay certain existing indebtedness under the Companys credit facilities but not cancel commitments under such facilities are senior obligations of the Company and are guaranteed by certain of the Companys subsidiaries.
Capital management The Group defines capital as the total equity of the Group.
Capital is managed in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits to stakeholders and to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
Tullow is not subject to any externally-imposed capital requirements.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may put in place new debt facilities, issue new shares for cash, repay debt, engage in active portfolio management, adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, or undertake other such restructuring activities as appropriate.
No significant changes were made to the capital management objectives, policies or processes during the year ended 31 December 2013.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the net debt ratio, that is, the ratio of net debt to equity.
Net debt is calculated as gross debt, as shown in the balance sheet, less cash and cash equivalents.

com 149 Financial Statements NOTES TO GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2013 Note 22.
Financial instruments Financial risk management objectives The Group is exposed to a variety of risks including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, foreign currency risk and liquidity risk.
The Group holds a portfolio of commodity derivative contracts, with various counterparties, covering its underlying oil and gas businesses.
In addition, the Group holds a portfolio of interest rate derivatives.
The use of derivative financial instruments derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is monitored and reviewed internally on a regular basis.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivatives, for speculative purposes.
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities With the exception of the senior notes, the Group considers the carrying value of all its financial assets and liabilities to be materially the same as their fair value.
The fair value of the senior notes, as determined using market values at 31 December 2013 was $665.0 million.
The Group has no material financial assets that are past due.
The Group predominantly sells to large oil and gas multinationals, no financial assets are impaired at the balance sheet date and all are considered to be fully recoverable.
Fair values of derivative instruments All derivatives are recognised at fair value on the balance sheet with valuation changes recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the derivatives have been designated as cash flow or fair value hedges.
Fair value is the amount for which the asset or liability could be exchanged in an arms length transaction at the relevant date.
Where available fair values are determined using quoted prices in active markets.
To the extent that market prices are not available, fair values are estimated by reference to market-based transactions, or using standard valuation techniques for the applicable instruments and commodities involved.
The following provides an analysis of the Groups financial instruments measured at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1: fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques which include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
All the Groups derivatives are Level 2 2012: Level 2.
There were no transfers between fair value levels during the year.
For financial instruments which are recognised on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels by reassessing categorisation based on the lowest-level input which is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period.
Commodity price risk The Group uses a number of derivatives to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with its underlying oil and gas revenues.
Such commodity derivatives will tend to be priced using benchmarks, such as Dated Brent, D-1 Heren and M-1 Heren, which correlate as far as possible to the underlying oil and gas revenues respectively.
The Group hedges its 150 Tullow Oil plc 2013 Annual Report and Accounts Financial Statements 4 estimated oil and gas revenues on a portfolio basis, aggregating its oil revenues from substantially all of its African oil interests and its gas revenues from substantially all of its UK gas interests.
As at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012, all of the Groups oil and gas derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges.
The Groups oil and gas hedges have been assessed to be highly effective within the range prescribed under IAS 39 using regression analysis.
There is, however, the potential for a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Groups oil hedges arising from, among other factors, the discount on the Groups underlying African crude relative to Brent and the timing of oil liftings relative to the hedges.
There is also the potential for a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Groups gas hedges which arises from, among other factors, daily field production performance.
Income statement hedge summary Losses from commodity derivative settlements during the period, included in the income statement, were $56.0 million 2012: $77.0 million note 2.
Derivative fair value movements during the year which have been recognised in the income statement were as follows: 2013 2012 $m $m Loss on hedging instruments: Cash flow hedges Gas derivatives Time value 0.2 1.3 0.2 1.3 Oil derivatives Ineffectiveness 0.1 0.2 Time value 20.0 21.4 19.9 21.2 19.7 19.9 Total net loss for the year in the income statement Hedge reserve summary The hedge reserve represents the portion of deferred gains and losses on hedging instruments deemed to be effective cash flow hedges.

Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance from overnight to three months at rates determined by US dollar LIBOR, Sterling LIBOR and Norwegian NIBOR.
Fixed rate debt comprises senior notes, bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance for periods greater than three months or bank borrowings where the interest rate has been fixed through interest rate hedging.
The Group hedges its floating interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis through the use of interest rate swaps.
The mark-to-market position of the Groups interest rate portfolio as at 31 December 2013 is an asset of $2.3 million 2012: $2.9 million liability.
Interest rate hedges are included in fixed rate debt in the table below.
com 151 Financial Statements NOTES TO GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2013 Note 22.
Financial instruments continued The interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities, excluding trade and other receivables and trade and other payables, at 31 December 2013 and 2012 was as follows: 2013 2013 2012 2012 2013 Fixed rate Floating rate 2013 2012 Fixed rate Floating rate 2012 Cash at bank debt debt Total Cash at bank debt debt Total $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m US$ 258.2 1,000.0 927.2 1,669.0 271.3 50.0 1,097.1 875.8 Euro 14.8 14.8 24.5 24.5 Sterling 24.0 174.8 150.8 28.3 171.6 143.3 Other 55.9 159.4 103.5 6.1 6.1 352.9 1,000.0 1,261.4 1,908.5 330.2 50.0 1,268.7 988.5 The Group has a financial asset of $370.2 million in respect of contingent consideration due from Total and CNOOC, this is non-interest bearing and is due in US dollar note 15.
Cash at bank consisted mainly of deposits which earn interest at rates set in advance for periods ranging from overnight to one month by reference to market rates.
Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will fail to perform, or fail to pay amounts due, resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The primary activities of the Group are oil and gas exploration and production.
The Group has a credit policy that governs the management of credit risk, including the establishment of counterparty credit limits and specific transaction approvals.
The Group limits credit risk by assessing creditworthiness of potential counterparties before entering into transactions with them and continuing to evaluate their creditworthiness after transactions have been initiated.
To the extent possible the Group mitigates credit risk by entering into contracts and agreements which enable netting and allow for termination of the contract upon the occurrence of certain events of default.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions undertaken is spread amongst approved counterparties.
The Group generally enters into derivative agreements with banks who are lenders under the Reserves Based Lending credit facility.
Security is provided under the facility agreement which mitigates non-performance risk.
The Group is due $370.2 million from Total and CNOOC in respect of contingent consideration in connection with the 2012 Ugandan farmdown note 15, as at 31 December 2013 this balance is not past due or impaired.
The Group has accounted for the credit risk of Total and CNOOC through discounting of the receivable with their effective credit risk.
The Group does not have any other significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics.
The maximum financial exposure due to credit risk on the Groups financial assets, representing the sum of cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivative assets, trade receivables, current tax assets and other current assets, as at 31 December 2013 was $1,908.7 million 2012: $1,769.7 million.
Foreign currency risk Wherever possible, the Group conducts and manages its business in sterling UK and US dollars all other countries, the operating currencies of the industry in the areas in which it operates.
The Groups borrowing facilities are also mainly denominated in Sterling and US dollars, which further assists in foreign currency risk management.
From time to time the Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in other currencies.
These exposures are often managed by executing foreign currency financial derivatives.
There were no material foreign currency financial derivatives in place at the 2013 year-end 2012: nil.
Cash balances are held in other currencies to meet immediate operating and administrative expenses or to comply with local currency regulations.
As at 31 December 2013, the only material monetary assets or liabilities of the Group that were not denominated in the functional currency of the respective subsidiaries involved were $37.3 million in non-US dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents 2012: $28.3 million and 106.0 million cash drawings under the Groups borrowing facilities 2012: 106.0 million.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are net liabilities of $137.5 million 2012: net liabilities of $143.3 million.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity risk using both shortand long-term cash flow projections, supplemented by debt financing plans and active portfolio management.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has established an appropriate liquidity risk management framework covering the Groups short-, mediumand long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group closely monitors and manages its liquidity risk.
Cash forecasts are regularly produced and sensitivities run for different scenarios including, but not limited to, changes in commodity prices, different production rates from the Groups portfolio of producing fields and delays in development projects.
In addition to the Groups operating cash flows, portfolio management opportunities are reviewed to potentially enhance the financial capacity and flexibility of the Group.
The Groups forecasts, taking into account reasonably possible changes as described above, show that the Group will be able to operate within its current debt facilities and have significant financial headroom for the 12 months from the date of approval of the 2013 Annual Report and Accounts.

A review of all decommissioning estimates was undertaken by an independent specialist at the start of 2013 which has been assessed and updated internally for the purposes of the 2013 Financial Statements.
Assumptions, based on the current economic environment, have been made which management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions.
However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time.
Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates.
This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.
Other provisions include a liability acquired through the acquisition of Spring note 9 which is contingent in terms of timing and amount on the development of the PL407 licence in Norway.
Other provisions also include the contingent consideration in respect of the Spring acquisition note 9.
The amount recorded on acquisition was $104.5 million and subsequent information provided through drilling results during 2013 has resulted in a net uplift of the provision to $131.2 million, which includes a specific write-off of $41.2 million in relation to the Mantra well result in Norway note 12.

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent it is considered probable that those assets will be recoverable.
This involves an assessment of when those deferred tax assets are likely to reverse, and a judgement as to whether or not there will be sufficient taxable profits available to offset the tax assets when they do reverse.
This requires assumptions regarding future profitability and is therefore inherently uncertain.
To the extent assumptions regarding future profitability change, there can be an increase or decrease in the level of deferred tax assets recognised which can result in a charge or credit in the period in which the change occurs.

Awards made before 8 March 2010 were made as conditional awards to acquire free shares on vesting.
To provide flexibility to participants, those awards have been converted into nil exercise price options.
Awards vest subject to a Total Shareholder Return TSR performance condition, 50% 70% for awards granted to Directors in 2013 and 2012 of an award is tested against a comparator group of oil and gas companies.
The remaining 50% 30% for awards granted to Directors in 2013 and 2012 is tested against constituents of the FTSE 100 index excluding investment trusts.
Performance is measured over a fixed three-year period starting on 1 January prior to grant, and an individual must normally remain in employment for three years from grant for the shares to vest.
No dividends are paid over the vesting period.
There are further details of PSP award measurement in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 98 to 115.
2005 Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP Under the DSBP, the portion of any annual bonus above 75% of the base salary of a senior executive nominated by the Remuneration Committee is deferred into shares.
Awards normally vest following the end of three financial years commencing with that in which they are granted.
They are granted as nil exercise price options, normally exercisable from when they vest until 10 years from grant.
Awards granted before 8 March 2010 as conditional awards to acquire free shares have been converted into nil exercise price options to provide flexibility to participants.
2010 Share Option Plan 2010 SOP and 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme 2000 ESOS The only share option scheme operated by the Company during the year was the 2010 SOP.
Options have an exercise price equal to market value shortly before grant and normally only become exercisable from the third anniversary of the date of the grant.
Options granted prior to 2011 were granted under the 2000 ESOS on very similar terms except that their exercise was subject to a performance condition.
These awards are tested against constituents of the FTSE 100 index excluding investment trusts and 100% of awards will vest if the Companys TSR is above the median of the index companies over three years following grant.
Options outstanding at 31 December 2013 had exercise prices of 103p to 1530p 2012: 85p to 1530p and remaining contractual lives of one to ten years.
During the year phantom options were granted to replace certain options granted under the 2000 ESOS that lapsed as a result of performance conditions not being satisfied.
These replacement phantom options provide a cash bonus equivalent to the gain that could be made from a share option being granted over a notional number of shares with a notional exercise price.
Phantom options have also been granted under the 2010 SOP and the 2000 ESOS in situations where the grant of share options was not practicable.
156 Tullow Oil plc 2013 Annual Report and Accounts Financial Statements 4 UK & Irish Share Incentive Plans SIPs These are all-employee plans set up in the UK and Ireland, to enable employees to save out of salary up to prescribed monthly limits.
Contributions are used by the SIP trustees to buy Tullow shares Partnership Shares at the end of each three-month accumulation period.
The Company makes a matching contribution to acquire Tullow shares Matching Shares on a one-for-one basis.
Under the UK SIP, Matching Shares are subject to time-based forfeiture over three years on leaving employment in certain circumstances or if the related Partnership Shares are sold.
The fair value of a Matching Share is its market value when it is awarded.
Under the UK SIP: i Partnership Shares are purchased at the lower of their market values at the start of the accumulation period and the purchase date which is treated as a three month share option for IFRS 2 purposes and therefore results in an accounting charge, and ii Matching Shares vest over the three years after being awarded resulting in their accounting charge being spread over that period.
Under the Irish SIP: i Partnership Shares are bought at the market value at the purchase date which does not result in any accounting charge, and ii Matching Shares vest when they are awarded so that their accounting charge is not spread beyond the year in which they are awarded.

Share-based payments continued The options granted during the year were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model for the PSP awards and a proprietary binomial valuation model for awards under the DSBP and 2010 SOP.
The following table details the weighted average fair value of awards granted and the assumptions used in the fair value expense calculations.
Includes the replacement phantom awards made during 2013, which, as cash-settled awards, have been measured as at the accounting date.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over a period commensurate with the expected life of the awards.
The expected life is the average expected period from date of grant to exercise allowing for the Companys best estimate of participants expected exercise behaviour.
Zero turnover is assumed for PSP awards made to Directors, 5% for PSP awards to senior employees.

Where Tullow acts as operator of a joint venture the capital commitments reported represent Tullows net share.
Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for certain of its office properties and a lease for an FPSO vessel for use on the Chinguetti field in Mauritania.
Leases on office properties are negotiated for an average of six years and rentals are fixed for an average of six years.
Based on advice from external counsel management have determined that there is a possible chance less than 50% but greater than 5% that both Ugandan Tax Tribunal and International Arbitration will not award in Tullows favour.
The current best estimate of the potential exposure is $399 million.
Performance guarantees are in respect of abandonment obligations, committed work programmes and certain financial obligations.
