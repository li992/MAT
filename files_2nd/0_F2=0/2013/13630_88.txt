Under FRS 1 the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that the Group includes the Company in its own published consolidated financial statements.

Consequently, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 29 not to present separate financial instrument disclosures for the Company.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
The Company continues to account for intragroup cross guarantees under FRS 12.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.

Long leasehold buildings are amortised over 50 years or the expected useful life of the building where less than 50 years.

As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
Classification of preference shares Following the adoption of the presentation elements of FRS 25, Financial Instruments, the cumulative redeemable preference shares issued by the Company are classified as long term debt.
The preference dividends are charged within interest payable.
