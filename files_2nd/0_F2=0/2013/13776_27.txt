It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the accounting policies.
We continually evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgements based on available information.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity are described below.
Revenue recognition The key area of judgement in respect of recognising revenue is the timing of recognition, specifically in relation to recognition and deferral of revenue on support contracts where management assumptions and estimates are necessary.
Goodwill impairment The judgements in relation to goodwill impairment testing relate to the assumptions applied in calculating the value in use of the operating companies being tested for impairment.
The key assumptions applied in the calculation relates to the future performance expectations of the business.
The carrying value of goodwill and the key assumptions used in performing the annual impairment assessment are disclosed in note 5.
Disposals The calculation of the loss on disposal of businesses is an area of complexity where management applies judgement.
Goodwill allocated to the disposals was equal to the goodwill created on original acquisition, reflecting benefits associated with the original acquisitions no longer remaining within the Group.
In addition to the loss on disposal noted above, one-off revenue and cost items in relation to these disposals have been recognised as exceptional in the financial statements.
The financial performance of the businesses disposed of have not been treated as discontinued operations in the period as the products being sold do not represent major lines of business or geographical areas.
Archer Capital litigation The claim for damages made by Archer Capital in relation to the potential purchase of MYOB is strongly rejected by management.
On that basis, and with supporting expert legal advice, management do not consider there to be a present obligation and the possibility of an outflow of resources is remote.
As such, no provision or contingent liability has been recognised in these financial statements.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and the contingently issuable shares under the Groups long-term incentive plan.
For performance-related share plans, a calculation is performed to determine the satisfaction, or otherwise, of the forecast performance conditions at the end of the reporting period, and the number of shares which would be issued based on the forecast status at the end of the reporting period.

During the year, goodwill was reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36.
For the purposes of this impairment review, goodwill for continuing operations has been valued on the basis of discounted future cash flows arising in each relevant CGU.
Goodwill impairment tests The following table shows the allocation of the carrying value of goodwill at the end of the reporting period by CGU: 2013 2012 m m France 212.2 253.7 UK & Ireland 180.6 195.4 Spain 121.2 124.2 Sage Pay Europe 25.1 27.4 Germany 26.4 25.2 Switzerland 34.7 33.6 Poland 6.5 6.4 Portugal 4.1 4.7 North America Sage Business Solutions Division 533.2 765.2 Sage Payment Solutions Division 156.1 156.6 Brazil 130.8 133.5 South Africa 40.6 44.0 Australia 24.8 24.2 Asia 18.9 20.3 1,515.2 1,814.4 The Group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the recoverable amount of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The key assumptions in the value-in-use calculations are the discount rate applied, the long-term operating margin EBITA and the long-term growth rate of net operating cash flows.
In all cases, the approved budget for the following financial year formed the basis for the cash flow projections for a CGU.
The approved cash flow projections in the four financial years following the budget year reflected managements expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the CGU and growth prospects in the CGUs market.
The discount rate applied to a CGU represents a pre-tax rate that reflects the market assessment of the time value of money at the end of the reporting period and the risks specific to the CGU.
The long-term operating margin assumed for a CGUs operations is primarily based on past performance.
For some CGUs, those for which management has strong reason to believe that past operating margins are not indicative of future operating margins, expected future improvements are also included in managements assessment of the long-term operating margin.
The long-term operating margin applied to CGUs was in the range of 20% 2012: 21% to 47% 2012: 62%.
Long-term growth rates of net operating cash flows are assumed equal to the long-term growth rate in the gross domestic product of the country in which the CGUs operations are undertaken and were in the range of 1.8% 2012: 1.8% to 5.8% 2012: 5.5%.

The Group considers the credit quality of trade and other receivables by geographical location.
The Group considers that the carrying value of the trade and other receivables that is disclosed below gives a fair presentation of the credit quality of the assets.
This is considered to be the case as there is a low risk of default due to the high number of recurring customers and credit control policies: thus the carrying value is expected to be the final value received.

The directors believe that there is no further provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
The creation and release of provision for impaired receivables have been included in selling and administrative expenses in the income statement.
Amounts charged to the allowance account are generally written-off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.

The Finance Act 2013, which was substantively enacted on 17 July 2013, includes legislation reducing the main rate of UK corporation tax to 21% from 1 April 2014.
As such, deferred tax balances at 30 September 2013 have been calculated using a rate of 21%.

These have been included within the Other category.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.

13.5 Sensitivity analysis Financial instruments affected by market risks include borrowings and deposits.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being sterling, US Dollar and Euro interest rates, and sterling US Dollar and sterling Euro exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis assumes reasonable movements in foreign exchange and interest rates before the effect of tax.
The Group considers a reasonable interest rate movement in LIBOR to be 1%, based on interest rate history.
Similarly, sensitivity to movements in sterling US Dollar and sterling Euro exchange rates of 10% are shown reflecting changes of reasonable proportion in the context of movement in those currency pairs over the last year.
Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the Consolidated income statement and equity.

Executive Share Option Scheme There have been no grants of executive share options under the 1999 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS since June 2008.
Long-term incentive awards are made under The Sage Group plc Performance Share Plan.
The performance targets governing the vesting of options are based on stretching EPS growth measured over a fixed three-year period from the start of the financial year in which the grant is made.
30% of options will vest at the end of the period if the increase in EPS exceeds the Retail Prices Index RPI by 15% an average of 5% per year and 100% of those options will vest at that time only if the RPI is exceeded in that period by 27% an average of 9% per year.
Between those targets, options will vest on a straight-line basis.
If those targets are not met at the end of the three-year period, then no further retesting of the performance criteria will be undertaken and the options will lapse.
Options were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last four years.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.

The Sage Group Performance Share Plan Annual grants of performance shares will normally be made to Executive Directors and senior executives across the Group after the preliminary declaration of the annual results.
Awards prior to 2013 Annual awards under the Plan are limited to shares worth up to 300% of base salary.
In practice, annual grants to Executive Directors are limited to shares with a maximum value on award of 210% of base salary except in exceptional circumstances, such as a promotion or recruitment or to reflect local market practice.
The performance shares are subject to performance conditions on a sliding scale based on EPS.
25% of the award will vest at the end of the period if the increase in EPS exceeds RPI by 9% an average of 3% per year : 100% of the award will vest at that time only if RPI is exceeded in that period by 27% an average of 9% per year.
Between those targets, awards will vest on a straight-line basis, and if those targets are not met there is no opportunity for re-testing.
Awards are then subject to a TSR multiplier whereby the level of vesting based on EPS achievement will be adjusted according to TSR performance over the same three-year period compared with a group of international software and computer services companies.
The comparator group for awards made in 2012 comprised the following companies: Adobe Systems Cegid Logica Salesforce.
com ARM Holdings Dassault Systmes Micro Focus International SAP Blackbaud Exact Microsoft Software AG Cap Gemini Intuit Oracle If Sages TSR is ranked at lower quartile in the group, the multiplier is 0.75.
If Sages TSR is ranked at median in the group, the multiplier is 1.
If Sages TSR is ranked at upper quartile in the group, then the multiplier is 1.5.
Straight-line pro-rating applies between 0.75 and 1, and between 1 and 1.5, but the multiplier cannot be higher or lower than these figures.
Awards from 2013 onwards The performance shares are subject to both performance conditions and a TSR target.
Performance conditions are weighted one third on the achievement of an EPS target, and one third the achievement of an organic revenue growth target.
The remaining one third is based on a TSR target.
The EPS vesting percentage is based on compound EPS growth.
Where compound EPS growth is between 6% and 12%, the EPS vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 6.7% and 26.7% and where compound EPS growth is between 12% and 15% the EPS vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 26.7% and 33.3%.
The organic revenue growth target is based on the Companys compound annual organic revenue growth.
Where growth is between 4% and 8% the organic revenue growth vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 6.7% and 26.7%, and where the Companys compound organic revenue growth is between 8% and 10%, the organic revenue growth vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 26.7% and 33.3%.
In order for organic revenue growth target proportion to vest, the EBITA margin in the financial year ending 30 September 2015 must not be less than that of the EBITA margin for the financial year ending 30 September 2012.

Where the Companys TSR is between median and upper quartile, the TSR vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 6.7% and 26.7% and where the Companys TSR is between upper quartile and upper decile, the TSR vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 26.7% and 33.3% The TSR vesting percentage may only exceed 26.7% Stretch level if performance against either the EPS target or the organic revenue growth target is also at Stretch level.
The comparator group for awards in 2013 is the companies comprised in the FTSE100 Index at the start of the performance period, excluding financial services and extraction companies.
Awards were valued using the Monte Carlo option-pricing model.
Performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.
