The defined benefit pension schemes included in the following disclosures are: i UK schemes: the United Pension Plan UPP, the United Magazines Final Salary Scheme UMFSS, the defined benefit section of the United Group Pension Scheme UGPS and the United Newspapers Executive Pension Scheme UNEPS : ii US schemes: the CMP Media LLC Cash Balance Retirement Plan and the CMP Post Retirement Medical Plan: and iii Retirement Indemnity Plans in France.
The UGPS, UMFSS and UPP schemes were merged on 30 December 2013 into a new scheme, the UBM Pension Scheme UBMPS.
All of the plans are final salary pension plans, which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided depends on members length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement.
The vast majority of the liabilities in the schemes relate to members who are no longer employed by the Group but are not yet retired deferred members, and pensions in payment.
Responsibility for governance of the plans including investment decisions and contribution schedules lies jointly with the Company and the Board of Trustees.
The Board of Trustees must comprise one-third nominated by the plan members and the remainder are appointed by the Company and can include independent appointees, in accordance with the plans regulations.
Deferred members benefits and pensions in payment are generally increased by a fixed amount or updated in line with the retail price index.
Plan assets are held in Trusts and are invested in accordance with the Statement of Investment Principles.
Every three years, in accordance with legislation, the Board of Trustees reviews the level funding of the pension plans and the level of contribution required by the Group to clear the deficit.
In 2012, the Group agreed to make special contributions to the UK pension schemes of 3.5m per annum until 31 January 2018.
This contribution schedule remains in place until the 2014 funding valuations are finalised expected in the first half of 2015.
