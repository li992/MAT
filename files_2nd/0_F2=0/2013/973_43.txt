Mining method: OP Open Pit.
Mine Life the extraction period in years for scheduled Ore Reserves comprising Proved and Probable Reserves only.
Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to some Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will necessarily be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Resource after continued exploration.
238 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2013 Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES NIOBIUM estimates as at 31 December 2013 1 Boa Vista Oxide Ore Reserves OP : The increase is primarily due to ongoing grade control and a new drilling campaign identifying additional ore. 2 Phosphate Tailings Ore Reserves: The fines portion of the Phosphate tailings from Chapado are processed in the Niobium Tailings Plant to recover Niobium.
The increase is a result of the approval of the Boa Vista Fresh Rock project enabling the tailings plant to continue operating once the Oxide Reserves are depleted.
3 Boa Vista Oxide Mineral Resources OP : The Oxide Resources are reported above a 0.5% Nb O cut-off.
The decrease is due to the introduction of a new 2 5 mine plan which allows additional Mineral Resources to be converted to Ore Reserves.
4 Boa Vista Fresh Rock Ore Reserves OP : Approval of the Boa Vista Fresh Rock project permits the declaration of Ore Reserves.
5 Area Leste Oxide Mineral Resources OP : The Oxide Resources are reported above a 0.5% Nb O cut-off.
The increase is due to reallocation of Ore 2 5 Reserves to Mineral Resource following a reclassification of historical estimates to the Inferred category.
6 Area Leste Fresh Rock Mineral Resources UG : The Fresh Rock Resources are reported above a 0.7 %Nb O cut-off.
The difference is attributable to the 2 5 application of underground mining as the basis for reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.
7 Boa Vista Fresh Rock Mineral Resources OP : The Fresh Rock Resources are reported above a 0.5 %Nb O cut-off.
The decrease is the result of Mineral 2 5 Resources conversion to Ore Reserves which is partially offset by a change in the slope angle of the pit allowing more Mineral Resources to be declared.
8 Boa Vista Fresh Rock Mineral Resources UG : The Fresh Rock Resources are reported above a 0.5 %Nb O cut-off.
The application of underground 2 5 mining as the basis for reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction allows for declaration of this resource for the first time.
9 Mina I Oxide Mineral Resources OP : The Oxide Resources are reported above a 0.5% Nb O cut-off.
The Mina I Ore Reserves previously declared as part 2 5 of Boa Vista Oxides were reallocated to Mineral Resource following re-classification of historical estimates to Inferred.
10 Mina II Fresh Rock Mineral Resources OP : The Fresh Rock Resources are reported above a 0.7 %Nb O cut-off.
The application of an open pit mining 2 5 method is the basis for reasonable prospect for eventual economic extraction of this material, formerly considered for underground extraction and reclassification of historical estimates to the Inferred category has also been applied.
11 Mina II Fresh Rock Mineral Resources UG : The Fresh Rock Resources are reported above a 0.7 %Nb O cut-off.
Application of underground mining 2 5 method is the basis for defining reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction for this material and the declaration of a Mineral Resource.
12 Morro do Padre Fresh Rock Mineral Resources UG : The Fresh Rock Resources are reported above a 0.7 %Nb O cut-off.
Application of underground 2 5 mining method is the basis for defining reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction of this material and reclassification of historical estimates to the Inferred category has also been applied.
Following the reclassification of historical estimates to the Inferred category in order to ensure compliance with Anglo American standards, a systematic programme of re-analysis of historical samples and additional drilling is underway to upgrade the confidence in the project resources.
