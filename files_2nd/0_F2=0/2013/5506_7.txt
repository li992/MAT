Following a major 003 08 rig reactivation project, the investment programme yielded excellent MERLIN re 003 12 sults in 2013, with Thistle delivering its highest levels of production since CHEVIOT DUNLIN the 1990s.
A particular success was the new production well in the Western STATFJORD DUNBAR CAUSEWAY Fault Block, which came on stream in mid-August 2013.
Work throughout the year also included process simplification, new process control and CORMORANT safety systems.
The Thistle brownfield tax allowance, secured in 2012, NORTH proved key to ensuring the delivery of the latter stages of this field life 211 22 extension programme.

The rig reactivation phase of the project was completed at the end of 2013.
The investment in the platforms rig facilities paved the way for the first drilling programme on Heather since 2006, four wells are scheduled for 2014, the start of a two year infill drilling programme.
A complementary facilities upgrade project has also begun with an initial focus on gas compression stability, new production and water injection flowlines and conductors reinforcement.
The team is utilising its technical expertise, creativity and innovation and building on the experience gained from the Thistle project.
LLX saw two new cranes procured and an electrical power generator commissioned in 2013.
2014 will see the refurbishment of the separation process and the installation of the associated control and safety system.
