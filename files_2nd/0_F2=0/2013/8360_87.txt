In 2013, the Group has marginally increased its facilities, leaving it with a combined total facility of 250 million, maturing in 2016 and 2017.
Fees paid as a result of entering into these new facilities are held as a prepayment and are being amortised over the expected life of the facility.
The majority of the Groups borrowings bear interest at floating rates which are set according to published LIBoR rates.
The remainder bear interest at rates that are determined by bank base rates.
The Group seeks to control its exposure to changes in interest rates by using interest rate swaps see note 22 b.
The Group has access to committed borrowing facilities that expire in two to five years.
Amounts are drawn down against these facilities on a short-term basis but the ageing of the total amount borrowed is classified according to the maturity of the facilities.
Contractual interest on bank loans, that will accrue between the year end and the date of rollover of the amounts drawn down, is 0.1 million and is all due for payment within one year 2012: 0.4 million within one year.
