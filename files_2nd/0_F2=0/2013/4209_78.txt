During the year, as a result of forthcoming changes in the UK corporation tax rate from 23% to 21% from 1 April 2014 and then to 20% from 1 April 2015 that were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013, the relevant deferred tax balances have been re-measured.
Deferred tax expected to reverse in the year to 31 December 2014 and beyond has been measured using the rate due to prevail in the year of reversal.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised in all cases where such assets arise, as it is probable the assets will be recovered.
Deferred tax is only recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries to the extent that remittance is expected in the foreseeable future.
If all earnings were remitted, an additional 2.2m 2012: 2.4m of tax would be payable.
Deferred tax assets of 2.4m 2012: 7.9m are expected to be recovered within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
All movements on deferred tax balances have been recognised in income with the exception of the charges shown in note 5 b, which have been recognised directly in equity.
