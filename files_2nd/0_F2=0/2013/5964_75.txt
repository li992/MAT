Fidessa group plc 58 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued d Fair values IFRSs require many assets, liabilities and expenses to be recognised at fair value.
This includes the intangible assets note 13 and share-based payments note 19.
By their nature fair values are estimates and subject to assumptions and different interpretation.
e Impairment of goodwill The determination of whether or not goodwill has been impaired requires an estimate to be made of the value in use of the cash generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation includes estimates about the future financial performance of the cash generating unit, the discount rate to apply to projected future cash flows, long-term operating margins and long-term growth rates note 13.
If the results of the cash generating unit in future periods are materially adverse to the estimates used for the impairment testing an impairment charge may be triggered.
f Expected useful lives The carrying value of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and the respective depreciation and amortisation of these assets is affected by the assumptions made in determining the expected useful lives of the assets.
Management makes estimates of the useful lives.
5 Segment reporting During 2013 the business has restructured with the former Enterprise and Hosted business units combining to form the Sell-side business unit.
This change reflects the marketplace trend for larger customers to want to take more of their solution on a managed service basis.
The primary management and performance monitoring continues to be undertaken by the Operating Board which comprises the heads of the business units and global functional heads.
The Sell-side business unit provides solutions and tools to support the trading of cash equities and derivatives globally.
The solutions are scalable from the largest to the smallest operations in the sector.
The Buy-side business unit provides the systems to cover every stage of the investment process for all asset classes.
The systems are used by the largest investment managers in the world, as well as some of the boutiques and hedge funds.
Both business units leverage the connectivity and market data infrastructure.
The Operating Board monitors overall operating profit excluding amortisation of acquired intangibles and product development capitalisation and amortisation, which is not an IFRS measure.
Finance income, assets and liabilities are not reported by business unit.
No single external customer accounts for 5% or more of revenue.
Recurring revenue reflects the periodic fees for software and related services that is charged on a rental or subscription basis.
Non-recurring revenue comprises the consultancy fees for implementation, configuration and ongoing support activity.
