| | | | Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financial statements Discount rate The discount rate applied to cash flows of each CGU is based on the Groups Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC.
WACC is the average cost of sources of financing debt and equity, each of which is weighted by its respective use.
Key inputs to the WACC calculation are the risk free rate, the equity market risk premium the return that Savills shares provide over the risk free rate, beta reflecting the risk of the Group relative to the market as a whole and the Groups borrowing rates.
Group WACC was adjusted for risk relative to the country in which the assets were located.
The risk-adjusted pre-tax discount range of rates used in each region for impairment testing are as follows: 2013 2012 Pre-tax discount rate range Pre-tax discount rate range United Kingdom 10.9% 10.9% Continental Europe 10.9% 10.9 11.9% Asia Pacific 9.3% 21.0% 9.5 21.3% United States 10.9% 12.9% Long-term growth rate To forecast beyond the five years covered by detailed forecasts, a terminal value was calculated, using average long-term growth rates.
The long-term growth rates used to calculate terminal values ranged from 1.5% 5.6% 2012: 1.5%.
The rates are based on the long-term growth rate in the countries in which the Group operates.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The level of impairment is a reflection of best estimates in arriving at value-in-use, future growth rates and the discount rate applied to cash flow projections.
Nonetheless, there are no CGUs which management considers a reasonable possible change in a key assumption would give rise to an impairment, apart from the Groups US business.
In the US business, the recoverable amount calculated based on value-in-use exceeded carrying value by 56.7%.
The value-in-use calculation is sensitive to achievement of 2014 budget and future revenue growth rate assumptions.
If 2014 revenue is 20% below budget or if assumed future revenue growth rates decreased by 750bps per annum the available headroom would be reduced to nil.
Future impairments on goodwill and intangible assets relating to any of the Groups investments may be impacted by the following factors: Market conditions the timing and growth expectations for further market improvements are key assumptions in the determination of the cash flow projections.
For the purposes of the impairment tests, management expects the market to continue to improve from 2014 onwards.
Cost base the cost base assumptions reflect 2013s costs with limited growth in the fixed cost base going forward.
Commissions and profit shares are correlated to the Groups revenue and profits and the percentage payout.
These are assumed to be consistent with existing rates.
