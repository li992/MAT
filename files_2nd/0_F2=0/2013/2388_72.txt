b The UK tax credits arise predominantly in overseas branches of UK entities based in jurisdictions with high tax rates.
No deferred tax asset has been recognized on these tax credits as they are unlikely to have value in the future: UK taxes on these overseas branches are largely mitigated by double tax relief on the overseas tax.
These tax credits have no fixed expiry date.
c The US tax credits expire 10 years after generation and will all expire in the period 2015-2021. d Other deductible temporary differences of $0.7 billion are expected to expire in the period 2014-2020, the remainder do not have an expiry date.
