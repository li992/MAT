RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The Group operates a funded fide ned bene t pension scheme in the UK the Plan.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out at 31 March 2013 and updated to 30 September 2013 by a quali ed independent actuary.
The liabilities of the Plan are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash ows to be paid out by the scheme using the Projected Unit method.
This amount is re ected in the liability in the balance sheet.
The Projected Unit method is an accrued bene ts valuation method in which the technical provisions are calculated based on service up until the valuation date allowing for future salary growth until the date of retirement, withdrawal or death, as appropriate.
The future service rate is then calculated as the contribution rate required to fund the service accruing over the control period again allowing for future salary growth.
As a result of the Plan being closed to new entrants, the service cost as a percentage of pensionable salaries is expected to increase as the members of the Plan approach retirement.
However the membership is expected to reduce so that the service charge in monetary terms will gradually reduce.

The Trustee of the Plan is required to act in the best interests of the Plans bene ciaries.
The appointment of directors to the Trustee is determined by the schemes trust documentation.
The Group has a policy that one third of all directors of the Trustee should be nominated by active and pensioner members of the Plan.
At 30 September 2013 the Plan assets were invested in a diversi ed portfolio that consisted primarily of equity and gilt investments.
The majority of the equities held by the Plan are in developed markets.
The target asset allocations for the year ending 30 September 2014 are 50% equities, 30% bonds and 20% other assets.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 136 D The accounts In conjunction with the Trustee, the Group has continued to conduct asset-liability reviews of the Plan.
These studies are used to assist the Trustee and the Group to determine the optimal long-term asset allocation with regard to the structure of liabilities within the Plan.
The results of the studies are used to assist the Trustee in managing the volatility in the underlying investment performance and risk of a signi cant increase in the scheme fide cit by providing information used to determine the investment strategy of the Plan.
Following the 2013 actuarial valuation, the Trustee put in place a recovery plan.
The Trustees recovery plan aims to meet the statutory funding objective within six years and five months from the date of valuation, i. e. by 31 August 2019.
The rate of return expected on scheme assets is based on the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
The movement in the market value of the scheme assets during the year were as follows: 2013 2012 m m At 1 October 2012 69.3 59.1 Movement in year Contributions by the Group 2.9 2.9 Contributions by scheme members 0.3 0.3 Bene ts paid 1.3 0.9 Expected return on scheme assets 3.6 3.5 Actuarial gain 4.6 4.4 At 30 September 2013 79.4 69.3 The actual return on scheme assets in the year ended 30 September 2013 was 8.2m 2012: 8.0m.
The movement in the present value of the scheme liabilities during the year was as follows: 2013 2012 m m At 1 October 2012 83.2 73.5 Movement in year Current service cost 1.7 1.5 Past service costs - - Contributions by scheme members 0.3 0.3 Plan curtailments - - Bene ts paid 1.3 0.9 Finance cost 3.8 3.9 Actuarial loss 7.4 4.9 At 30 September 2013 95.1 83.2 The most recent valuation of the scheme liabilities on a buy-out basis obtained by the Trustee in accordance with section 224 of the Pensions Act 2004 was calculated at 31 March 2013, when the valuation on that basis was 144.5m.

Since 1 April 2010 an additional contribution of 1.5m per annum has been paid by monthly instalments.
From 8 October 2013, following the nalisation of the March 2013 valuation, contributions rose to 27.0% of gross salaries for participating employees, the 1.5m contribution remained in place and a further additional contribution of 0.4m to cover administration and life cover was agreed.
The present best estimate of the contributions to be made to the plan by the Group in the year ending 30 September 2014 is 3.3m.
