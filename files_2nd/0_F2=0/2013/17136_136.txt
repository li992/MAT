Pension risk arises in respect of the defined benefit scheme where the cost of funding retirement benefits ultimately falls upon the Group.
In common with many such pension schemes the Groups defined benefit scheme is currently in a funding deficit position and during 2013 the Group made additional deficit repair contributions of 8.8m to the scheme plus a contribution of 1.5m towards the cost of life assurance premiums and other expenses of the scheme.
The Group seeks to manage the cash flow impact arising from pensions risk.
Accordingly, the defined benefit scheme was closed to new entrants in 2002 and was restricted as to future accrual from April 2011.
The Group attempts to further manage its exposure by agreeing with the Pension Scheme Trustees the assumptions to be used to calculate the scheme liabilities, the investment strategy to be followed and any cash contributions to be made by the Group.
Having completed a formal triennial actuarial valuation in 2010, the Group has agreed a recovery plan with the Trustees which aims to eliminate the funding deficit over the period to 2018.
An updated triennial actuarial valuation is currently underway.
