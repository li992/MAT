Acquisitions Prior year acquisitions Deferred consideration payments in relation to prior year acquisitions were made in 2013 totalling 18.6m.
This represented 11.9m in respect of Intelenet and 6.7m in relation to The Listening Company.
During 2012, a cash payment of 6.6m was made in respect of deferred contingent consideration payable following the acquisition of The Listening Company Limited in 2011.
After a review of the provisional acquisition accounting for Vertex Public Services Limited as recognised in the 2012 accounts, the comparative information in relation to this acquisition has been adjusted retrospectively to increase the fair value of deferred tax assets by 2.3m offset by a decrease in goodwill of 2.3m.
Following a review of the provisional acquisition accounting for DMS Maritime Pty Limited as reported in the 2012 accounts, the comparative information in relation to this acquisition has been adjusted retrospectively to reduce the fair value of intangible assets recognised by 7.9m, offset by an increase in goodwill of 7.2m and a decrease in the deferred tax liability of 0.7m.
As a result of the failure to meet earn-out criteria, an adjustment was made to the deferred consideration arising on the Intelenet acquisition in 2011 of 10.3m.
