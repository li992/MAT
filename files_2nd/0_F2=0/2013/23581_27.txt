Strategic Report Notes to the parent company financial statements Governance Financial Statements Parent company accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the financial statements except as noted below.
1 Basis of preparation of financial statements The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.

Consequently, the Directors believe that the Company has adequate resources to remain a going concern for the foreseeable future.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit and loss account of the parent company is not presented.
The financial statements do not include a cash flow statement because the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare such a statement under FRS 1 revised.
The cash flows of the Company are included in the consolidated Group cash flow statement of esure Group plc.
