Audit Committee Report INTERNAL AUDIT The Company has no employees and operates no systems of its own, relying instead on the employees and systems of its external service providers.
The Board has therefore taken the decision that it would be of insufficient benefit for the Company to engage an internal auditor.
EXTERNAL AUDIT The effectiveness of the external audit process is dependent on appropriate audit risk identification at the start of the audit cycle.
We receive from EY a detailed audit plan, identifying their assessment of these key risks.
For the 2013 Financial Year the primary risks identified were the existence and ownership together with the valuation of the Companys assets.
Using our collective skills we assess the effectiveness of the audit process in addressing these matters through the reporting we receive from EY at the year-end.
In addition we also seek feedback from the Administrator on the effectiveness of the audit process.
For the 2013 Financial Year, we were satisfied that there had been appropriate focus and challenge on the primary areas of audit risk and assessed the quality of the audit process to be good.
We hold private meetings with the external auditor at our meetings to provide additional opportunity for open dialogue and feedback from the Auditor without the Administrator being present.
Matters typically discussed include the Auditors assessment of business risks and management activity thereon, the transparency and openness of interactions with the Administrator, confirmation that there has been no restriction in scope placed on them by the Administrator on the independence of their audit and how they have exercised professional scepticism.
APPOINTMENT AND INDEPENDENCE We consider the reappointment of the external auditor, including the rotation of the audit partner, each year and also assess their independence on an ongoing basis.
