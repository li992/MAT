Prior to this date it was a company domiciled in the British Virgin Islands and was incorporated on 12 September 2002 as an offshore company with limited liability.
Playtech plc and its subsidiaries the Group develop unified software platforms for the online and land based gambling industry, targeting online and land based operators.
Playtechs gaming applications online casino, poker and other P2P games, bingo, mobile, live gaming, land-based kiosk networks, land based terminal and fixed-odds games are fully inter-compatible and can be freely incorporated as stand-alone applications, accessed and funded by the operators players through the same user account and managed by the operator by means of a single, powerful management interface.
Basis of preparation The directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and that it is therefore appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements.
The financial information set out in this document does not constitute the Groups statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013 or 31 December 2012.
The annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 were approved by the Board of Directors on 20 February 2014.
The auditors report on the statutory accounts for both the year ended 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 was unqualified.
nOte 2 significAnt AccOunting POlicies The significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the financial information, on a consistent basis, are: Accounting principles This financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting standards and interpretations collectively IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as adopted by the European Union adopted IFRSs.
In the current year the Group has adopted all of the new and revised standards and interpretations issued by the IASB and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC of the IASB, as they have been adopted by the European Union, that are relevant to its operations and effective for accounting periods beginning on 1 January 2013.
Changes in accounting policies a New standards, interpretations and amendments effective from 1 January 2013 The following new standards, interpretations and amendments, applied for the first time from 1 January 2013, have had an effect on the financial information: IFRS 7 Amended Transfers of Financial Assets effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012 : Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income Amendments to IAS 1 effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012 : and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
None of the other new standards, interpretations and amendments effective for the first time from 1 January 2013, which have been adopted in the year, effect the financial information.
b New standards, interpretations and amendments not yet effective The following new standards, interpretations and amendments, which have not been applied to these financial information, will or may have an effect on the Groups future financial information: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial information effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 : IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 : IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 : IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 : IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 : Disclosures Offsetting Financial Assets and Liabilities Amendments to IFRS 7 effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 : and Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Amendments to IAS 32 effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.

None of the other new standards, interpretations and amendments, which are effective for periods beginning after 1 January 2013 and which have not been adopted early, are expected to have a material effect on the Groups future financial information.
Foreign currency The financial information of the Company and its subsidiaries is prepared in Euros the functional currency, which is the currency that best reflects the economic substance of the underlying events and circumstances relevant to the Group.
Transactions and balances in foreign currencies are converted into Euros in accordance with the principles set forth by International Accounting Standard IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.
Accordingly, transactions and balances have been converted as follows: monetary assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange applicable at the balance sheet date: and income and expense items at exchange rates applicable as of the date of recognition of those items.
Non-monetary items are converted at the rate of exchange used to convert the related balance sheet items i. e. at the time of the transaction.
Exchange gains and losses from the aforementioned conversion are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Basis of consolidation Where the Company has the power, either directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of another entity or business so as to obtain benefits from its activities, it is classified as a subsidiary.
The consolidated financial information presents the results of the Company and its subsidiaries the Group as if they formed a single entity.
Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
Revenue recognition Revenue represents income receivable from contracting parties comprising a percentage of the revenue generated by the contracting party from use of the Groups intellectual property in online gaming activities and land based gaming operations, and from fees charged for services rendered.
Revenue is recognised in the accounting periods in which the gaming transactions occur or the services are rendered.
Royalty and other income receivable under fixedterm arrangements are recognised as revenue over the term of the agreement on a straight line basis.
Distribution costs Distribution costs represent the direct costs of the function of providing services to customers, costs of the development function and advertising costs.
Share-based payments Certain employees participate in the Groups share option plans which commenced with effect from 1December 2005.
The fair value of the equity settled options granted is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the vesting period and the credit is taken to equity, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is determined by the Black-Scholes and Binomial valuation model.
The share options plan does not have any performance conditions other than continued service.
Where equity settled share options are settled in cash at the groups discretion the debit is taken to equity.
Income taxes and deferred taxation Provision for income taxes is calculated in accordance with the tax legislations and applicable tax rates in force at the balance sheet date in the countries in which the Group companies have been incorporated.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheet differs from its tax base, except for differences arising on: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting or taxable profit: and investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Playtech plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 85 Financial statements Governance Strategic report Financial statements Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts continued The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities assets are settled recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on either: the same taxable group company: or different group entities which intend either to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or recovered.
Dividend distribution Final dividends are recorded in the Groups financial information in the period in which they are approved by the Groups shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment comprise computers and gaming machines, leasehold improvements, office furniture and equipment, and motor vehicles and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Carrying amounts are reviewed on each balance sheet date for impairment.
Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down immediately to its recoverable amount.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of fixed assets on a straight line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
The principal annual rates used for this purpose, which are consistent with those of the previous years, are: % Computers and gaming machines 33 Office furniture and equipment 7-20 Building and Leasehold improvements 10-20, or over the length of the lease Motor vehicles 15 Subsequent expenditures are included in the asset carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount and are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Business combinations The consolidated financial information incorporate the results of business combinations using the purchase method.
In the consolidated balance sheet, the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiary undertakings are recognised at cost less, if any, provision for impairment.
Intangible assets Intangible assets comprise externally acquired patents, domains and customer lists.
Intangible assets also include internally generated capitalised software development costs.
All such intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Where intangible assets are acquired as part of a business combination they are recorded initially at their fair value.
Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down to its recoverable amount.
Playtech plc 86 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Amortisation is calculated at annual rates estimated to write off the costs of the assets over their expected useful lives and is charged to operating expenses from the point the asset is brought into use.
The principal annual rates used for this purpose, which are consistent with those of the previous years, are: % Domain names nil Internally generated capitalised development costs 33 Technology IP 20-33 Customer lists 7-12.5 Affiliate contracts 5-12.5 Patents and licenses Over the expected useful lives 10-33 Intangible assets identified under the investment in equity accounted associates are: % Software 10 Customer relationships 71 Affiliate contracts 52 WH Brands 7 Purchased assets brands 10 Covenant not to compete 20 Management believes that the useful life of the domain names is indefinite.
Domain names are reviewed for impairment annually.
Expenditure incurred on development activities including the Groups software development is capitalised only where the expenditure will lead to new or substantially improved products, the products are technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only where it clearly increases the economic benefits to be derived from the asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure, including that incurred in order to maintain an intangible assets current level of performance, is expensed as incurred.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over, in the case of business combinations completed prior to 1 January 2010, the Groups interest in the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired and, in the case of business combinations completed on or after 1 January 2010, the total acquisition date fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
For business combinations completed prior to 1 January 2010, cost comprised the fair value of assets given, and liabilities assumed, plus any direct costs of acquisition.
Changes in the estimated value of contingent consideration arising on business combinations completed by this date were treated as an adjustment to cost and, in consequence, resulted in a change in the carrying value of goodwill.
For business combinations completed on or after 1 January 2010, cost comprises the fair value of assets given and liabilities assumed, plus the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquired business.
Contingent consideration is included in cost at its acquisition date fair value and, in the case of contingent consideration classified as a financial liability, remeasured subsequently through profit or loss.
For combinations completed on or after 1 January 2010, direct costs of acquisition are recognised immediately as an expense in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, within administrative costs.
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated income statement.
Goodwill is not amortised and is reviewed for impairment, annually or more specifically if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Impairment Impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually at the financial year end.
Other non-financial assets are subject to annual impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount i. e. the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell, the asset is written down accordingly.
Where it is not possible to establish the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the assets cash generating unit i. e. the lowest group of assets in which the asset belongs for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
Goodwill is allocated on initial recognition to each of the groups cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination giving rise to the goodwill.
Playtech plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 87 Financial statements Governance Strategic report Financial statements Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts continued Impairment charges are included in the administrative expenses line item in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, except to the extent they reverse gains previously recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed.
Associates Where the Group has the power to participate in but not control the financial and operating policy decisions of another entity, it is classified as an associate.
Associates are initially recognised in the consolidated balance sheet at cost.
The Groups share of postacquisition profits and losses is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income except that losses in excess of the Groups investment in the associate are not recognised unless there is an obligation to make good those losses.
Profits and losses arising on transactions between the Group and its associates are recognised only to the extent of unrelated investors interests in the associate.
The investors share in the associates profits and losses resulting from these transactions is eliminated against the carrying value of the associate.
Any premium paid for an associate above the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is capitalised as goodwill and included in the carrying amount of the associate.
The carrying amount of investment in associate is subject to impairment in the same way as goodwill arising on a business combination described above.
Joint ventures The Groups investment in a jointly controlled entity is included in the financial information under the equity method of accounting.
The group includes the assets it controls, its share of any income and the liabilities and expenses of jointly controlled operations and jointly controlled assets in accordance with the terms of the underlying contractual arrangement.
Financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets into one of the categories discussed below, depending on the purpose for which the asset was acquired.
The Group has not classified any of its financial assets as held to maturity.
The Group does not hold any financial assets at fair value through profit and loss.
Loans and receivables These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise principally through the provision of services to customers e. g. trade receivables, but also incorporate other types of contractual monetary asset.
They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
The Groups receivables comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and loans to customers in the balance sheet.
Trade receivables which principally represent amounts due from licensees are carried at original invoice value less an estimate made for bad and doubtful debts based on a review of all outstanding amounts at the year-end.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Where cash is on deposit with maturity dates greater than three months, it is disclosed within other receivables.
Loans to customers are in respect of formal loan agreements entered into between the Group and its customer, which are carried at original advanced value less provision for impairment.
They are classified between current and non-current assets in accordance with the contractual repayment terms of each loan agreement.
Available-for-sale financial assets Non-derivative financial assets classified as available-for-sale comprise the Groups strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities.
They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value generally recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the available for sale reserve.
In accordance with IAS 39, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Purchases and sales of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised on settlement date with any change in fair value between trade date and settlement date being recognised in the available for sale reserve.
On sale, the amount held in the available-for-sale reserve associated with that asset is removed from equity and recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the available-for-sale reserve except to the extent that any decrease in value in excess of the credit balance on the available-for-sale reserve, or reversal of such a transaction, is recognised in profit or loss.
Playtech plc 88 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity and are stated at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Several of the Groups licensees participate in progressive jackpot games.
Each time a progressive jackpot game is played, a preset amount is added to a cumulative jackpot for that specific game.
The accrual for the jackpot at the consolidated balance sheet date is included in progressive jackpot and other operators jackpot liabilities.
Loans and bank borrowings are initially recognised at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument.
Such interest bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, which ensures that any interest expense over the period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability carried in the consolidated balance sheet.
Interest expense in this context includes initial transaction costs and premia payable on redemption, as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability is outstanding.
Fair value measurement hierarchy IFRS 7 requires certain disclosure which require the classification of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the fair value measurement see note 30.
The fair value hierarchy has the following levels: a Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 : b Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 2 : and c Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs Level 3.
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the financial asset or financial liability is categorized is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety into only one of the three levels.
The Group measures its Available-for-sale investments at fair value refer to note 15 for more detailed information in respect of the fair value measurement.
Long term liabilities Long term liabilities are those liabilities that are due for repayment or settlement in more than twelve months from balance sheet date.
Provisions Provisions, which are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount, are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of past events, if it is probable that an outflow of funds will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Leases Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are not transferred to the Group an operating lease, the total rentals payable under the lease are charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The aggregate benefit of lease incentives is recognised as a reduction of the rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Non-controlling interests Non-controlling interest is recognised at the present ownership instruments proportionate share in the recognised amounts of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
The total comprehensive income of non-wholly owned subsidiaries is attributed to owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests in proportion to their relative ownership interests.
nOte 3 cRiticAl AccOunting estimAtes And judgements The preparation of financial information in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial information and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The areas requiring the use of estimates and critical judgments that may potentially have a significant impact on the Groups earnings and financial position are impairment of goodwill, the recognition and amortisation of development costs and other intangible assets, and the useful life of property, plant and equipment, the fair value of available-for-sale investments, share based payments, legal proceedings and contingent liabilities, determination of fair values of intangible assets acquired in business combinations, income tax, and determination of fair value of contingent consideration.
Playtech plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 89 Financial statements Governance Strategic report Financial statements Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts continued Estimates and assumptions Impairment of goodwill The Group is required to test, on an annual basis, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment.
The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the choice of a discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows.
Such estimates are based on managements experience of the business, but actual outcomes may vary.
More details including carrying values are included in Note 12.
Amortisation of development costs and other intangible assets and the useful life of property, plant and equipment Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are amortised or depreciated over their useful lives.
Useful lives are based on managements estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue, which are periodically reviewed for continued appropriateness.
Changes to estimates can result in significant variations in the amounts charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in specific periods.
More details including carrying values are included in Notes 11 and 12.
Fair value of available-for-sale investments The Group determines the fair value of available-for-sale investments that are not quoted using valuation techniques.
Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates for future cash flows.
In that regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot always be substantiated by comparison with independent markets and, in many cases, may not be capable of being realised immediately.
The methods and assumptions applied, and the valuation techniques used, are disclosed in Note 15.
Share based payments The Group has share based remuneration schemes for employees.
The fair value of share options is estimated by using the BlackScholes and Binomial models on the date of grant, based on certain assumptions.
Those assumptions are described in Note 10 and include, among others, the dividend growth rate, expected share price volatility, expected life of the options and number of options expected to vest.
Legal proceedings and contingent liabilities Management regularly monitors the key risks affecting the Group, including the regulatory environment in which the Group operates.
A provision will be made where there is a present obligation from a past event, a transfer of economic benefits is probable and the amount of costs of the transfer can be estimated reliably.
In instances where the criteria are not met, a contingent liability may be disclosed in the notes to the financial information.
More details are included in Note 32.
Determination of fair value of intangible assets acquired The fair value of the intangible assets acquired is based on the discounted cash flows expected to be derived from the use of the asset.
Further information in relation to the determination of fair value of intangible assets acquired is given in Notes 25 and 26.
Income taxes The Group is subject to income tax in jurisdictions in which it is registered and judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes.
During the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
As a result, the Group recognises tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due.
The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open audit years based on its assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law.
More details are included in Note 8.
Determination of the fair value of contingent consideration The fair value of contingent consideration is based on the probability of expected cash flow outcomes and the assessment of present values using appropriate discount rates.
Further information in relation to the determination of the fair value of contingent consideration is given in Note 26.
Playtech plc 90 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 nOte 4 segment infORmAtiOn Management considers that the Groups activity as a single source supplier of online gaming solutions constitutes one operating and reporting segment, as defined under IFRS 8.
Management review the performance of the Group by reference to Group-wide profit measures and the revenues derived from six 2012: five main product groupings: Casino Services Bingo Sport Poker Videobet The Group-wide profit measures are adjusted net profit and adjusted EBITDA see Note 5.
Management believes the adjusted profit measures represent more closely the underlying trading performance of the business.
No other differences exist between the basis of preparation of the performance measures used by management and the figures in the group financial information.
There is no allocation of operating expenses, profit measures, assets and liabilities to individual product groupings.
Accordingly the disclosures below are provided on an entity-wide basis.

The objective of financial risk management is to contain, where appropriate, exposures in these financial risks to limit any negative impact on the Groups financial performance and position.
The Groups financial instruments are its cash, available-for-sale financial assets, trade receivables, loan receivables, bank borrowings, accounts payable and accrued expenses.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operation.
The Group actively measures, monitors and manages its financial risk exposures by various functions pursuant to the segregation of duties and principals.
The risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are credit risk and market price risk, which include interest rate risk, currency risk and equity price risk.
The risk management policies employed by the Group to manage these risks are discussed below.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
The Groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest changes.
The management monitors interest rate fluctuations on a continuous basis and acts accordingly.
Where the Group has generated a significant amount of cash, it will invest in higher earning interest deposit accounts.
These deposit accounts are short term and the Group is not unduly exposed to market interest rate fluctuations.
During the year the group advanced loans to affiliates and customers for a total amount of 2.3 million 2012: 2.3 million.
The average interest on the loans is 5%.
A 1% change in deposit interest rates would impact on the profit before tax by 23 thousands.
As at 31 December 2013 the Group held undrawn credit facilities of 35.0 million 2012: 35.0 million.
Credit risk Credit risk arises when a failure by counterparties to discharge their obligations could reduce the amount of future cash inflows from financial assets on hand at the balance sheet date.
The Group closely monitors the activities of its counterparties and controls the access to its intellectual property which enables it to ensure the prompt collection of customers balances.
The Groups main financial assets are cash and cash equivalents as well as trade and other receivables and represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in connection with its financial assets.
Trade and other receivables are carried on the balance sheet net of bad debt provisions estimated by the Directors based on prior year experience and an evaluation of prevailing economic circumstances.
Playtech plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 107 Financial statements Governance Strategic report Financial statements Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts continued Wherever possible and commercially practical the Group invests cash with major financial institutions that have a rating of Aas defined by Standard & Poors.
The Group maintains monthly operational balances with banks that do not meet this credit rating in Israel, Bulgaria, Philippines and Cyprus to meet local salaries and expenses.
These balances are kept to a minimum and typically do not exceed 1 million at any time during the monthly payment cycle.
Also, the Group holds 113.1 million in financial institutions that have a rating of BBB as part of the Group treasury policy.
The Group holds approximately 28% of its funds 2012: 14% in financial institutions below A-rate.
total Financial Financial institutes with institutes below Aand above Arating rating 000 000 000 At 31 Dec 2013 527,394 379,669 147,725 At 31 Dec 2012 120,880 84,710 36,170 The ageing of trade receivables that are past due but not impaired can be analysed as follows: total not past due 1-2 months overdue more than 2 months past due 000 000 000 000 At 31 Dec 2013 41,336 27,602 7,279 6,455 At 31 Dec 2012 47,784 27,840 15,788 4,156 The above balances relate to customers with no default history.
A provision for doubtful debtors is included within trade receivables that can be reconciled as follows: 2013 2012 000 000 Provision at the beginning of the year 829 1,829 Charged to income statement 1,566 29 Utilised 1,463 1,029 Provision at end of year 932 829 Related party receivables included in Note 17 are not past due.
C. Currency risk Currency risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
Foreign exchange risk arises because the Group has operations located in various parts of the world.
However, the functional currency of those operations is the same as the Groups primary functional currency euro and the Group is not substantially exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates in respect of assets held overseas.
Foreign exchange risk also arises when Group operations are entered into in currencies denominated in a currency other than the functional currency.
The Groups policy is not to enter into any currency hedging transactions.
D. Equity price risk The Groups balance sheet is exposed to market risk by way of holding some investments in other companies on a short term basis Note 15.
Variations in market value over the life of these investments have or will have an impact on the balance sheet and the income statement.
The directors believe that the exposure to market price risk is acceptable in the Groups circumstances.
The Groups balance sheet at 31 December 2013 includes available for sale investments with a value of 33.7 million 2012: 35.3 million which are subject to fluctuations in the underlying share price.
A change of 1% in shares price will have an impact of 0.3 million on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and the fair value of the available for sale investments will change by the same amount.
E. Capital disclosures The Group seeks to maintain a capital structure which enables it to continue as a going concern and which supports its business strategy.
The Groups capital is provided by equity and debt funding.
The Group manages its capital structure through cash flow from operations, returns to shareholders primarily in the form of dividends and the raising or repayment of debt.
The Group had in 2012 net cash and cash equivalents at the balance sheet date of 52.1 million, which included loans and borrowings of 68.8 million.
During 2013, the Group repaid the entire balance of the loans and borrowings.
Playtech plc 108 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 F. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the Groups management of working capital and the financial charges on its debt instruments.
The Groups policy is to ensure that it will have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due.
The following are the contractual maturities representing undiscounted contractual cash flows of the Groups financial liabilities: total Within 1 year 1-2 years 2-5 years 000 000 000 000 2013 Trade payables 22,546 22,546 Other accounts payable 26,378 26,378 Progressive and other operators jackpots 48,544 33,544 15,000 Deferred consideration 28,630 28,630 Other non-current liabilities 245 245 2012 Trade payables 14,522 14,522 Loans and borrowings 69,220 37,970 31,250 Other accounts payable 22,461 22,461 Progressive and other operators jackpots 31,607 31,607 Deferred consideration 98,000 70,000 28,000 Contingent consideration 16,950 737 413 15,800 Other non-current liabilities 424 424 G.
