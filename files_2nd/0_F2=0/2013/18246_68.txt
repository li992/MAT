Financial Assets and Liabilities The Groups financial instruments are analysed into category as follows: 2013 2012 Financing Financing Carrying income Carrying income amount expense amount expense 000 000 000 000 Current asset investments 236 8 220 3 Current assets at fair value 236 8 220 3 Derivative financial instruments 6,470 321 6,149 2,167 Fixed rate loans and borrowings 190,681 8,658 177,745 14,127 Current and non-current liabilities at fair value 197,151 8,979 183,894 16,294 Trade and other receivables 43,150 243 69,578 344 Cash and cash equivalents 63,513 497 32,474 168 Current assets at amortised cost 106,663 740 102,052 512 Trade and other payables 35,374 31 38,379 23 Floating rate loans and borrowings 96,518 2,445 53,281 2,203 Current and non-current liabilities at amortised cost 131,892 2,476 91,660 2,226 Total financial instruments 222,144 10,707 173,282 18,011 In common with all businesses, the Group is exposed to the following types of risk which arise from its use of financial instruments: Credit risk Liquidity risk Market risk This note presents information about the nature of the Groups exposure to such risks, its objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the Groups management of capital.
Reference to disclosures given elsewhere in the financial statements is included as appropriate.
The Board has overall responsibility for determining the Groups risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, has delegated to the finance function the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of those objectives.
The overall objectives of the Board are to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Groups competitiveness and flexibility.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk arises from the potential financial loss if a tenant or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Groups trade receivables from tenants.

qxp 18 07 2013 10:33 Page 44 Daejan Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Trade receivables The majority of the Groups rental income is demanded quarterly in advance and demands are sent out prior to the due date.
Management monitors arrears continually and prompt action is taken to address potential defaults as appropriate.
The credit worthiness of each tenant is assessed prior to the agreement of the lease.
Collateral is generally required by the Group to support lease obligations.
In many cases this takes the form of a tenant security deposit but also includes parent company guarantees or bank or other guarantees where appropriate.
Provision is made on a sliding scale against any rental arrears where recovery is in doubt or where solicitors have been instructed to recover the debt, with full provision for impairment usually being made where a tenant is in arrears for more than a year.
Details of the Groups trade receivables and the extent of impairment provisions against them are set out in Note 11.
Due to the large number of tenants across various sectors and geographical locations, the Board does not consider there to be a significant concentration of credit risk.
Cash and derivative financial instruments The credit rating of counterparties to financial instruments is kept under review, particularly in the current economic conditions.
The Groups interest rate swaps are currently significantly out-of-the - money: consequently, counterparty risk on swaps does not represent a major risk at the current time.
The counterparty risk on cash and short-term deposits is managed by limiting the aggregate exposure to any institution by reference to their credit rating.
Such balances are generally placed with major financial institutions where credit risk is not considered significant.
Maximum exposure The aggregate carrying amounts of the Groups financial assets, which are stated net of impairment provisions, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk, before taking into account the value of the tenant security deposits held and other collateral.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due and arises from the Groups management of its working capital and the finance charges and amortisation of its loans and borrowings.
The Groups policy is to seek to maintain cash balances to meet all short and medium term requirements.
The Group has a low level of gearing relative to the property investment sector as a whole and has long standing relationships with many leading banks and financial institutions from which the Board expect to be able to raise further funds if required.
At 31 March 2013, gearing was 18.9 per cent.
on the basis of gross debt to gross assets.
Cash and short-term deposits at 31 March 2013, were 63.5 million 2012 32.5 million and 18.3 million of loans and borrowings were repayable within one year 2012 18.1 million.
In addition, at the same date, the Group had undrawn committed facilities of 20.0 million 2012 64.6 million, which expire in 2017.

qxp 18 07 2013 10:33 Page 45 Daejan Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013 The maturity analysis of the undiscounted cash flows arising from the Groups financial liabilities at 31 March 2013 was as follows: Aggregate Due Due Due Due after Carrying undiscounted within within within more than amount cash flows one year 1-2 years 2-5 years 5 years 000 000 000 000 000 000 Bank loans 96,518 96,518 1,375 1,375 66,986 26,782 Mortgages 190,681 171,407 13,191 13,887 54,905 89,424 Interest 55,848 9,077 8,205 18,478 20,088 Interest rate swaps 6,470 7,222 1,281 1,281 3,843 817 Trade and other payables 35,374 35,374 35,374 329,043 366,369 60,298 24,748 144,212 137,111 Market risk Market risk arises mainly from the impact that changes in interest rates might have on the cost of Group borrowing and the impact that changes in the US$ exchange rate might have on the Groups USA net assets.
Interest rates The Group seeks to reduce the interest rate risk by fixing rates on a majority of its loans and borrowings, whilst maintaining some loans at floating rates in order to retain flexibility in relation to short term interest rates.
Interest rates are fixed either through the use of fixed rate mortgage finance or through interest rate swaps.
The Group does not speculate in treasury products but uses these only to limit exposure to potential interest rate fluctuations.
The interest rate profile of the Groups loans and borrowings is set out in Note 16.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would decrease the Groups profit before taxation by approximately 0.6 million, after taking account of the interest swaps in place.
There also exists a risk to the income statement arising from the recognition and re-measurement of fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps at fair value.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would give rise to a reduction in fair value of fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps of 9.8 million.
Interest rate swaps The interest rate swaps held by the Group at the year end were as follows: Contracted rate excluding margin Notional principal Fair value 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 Per cent.
