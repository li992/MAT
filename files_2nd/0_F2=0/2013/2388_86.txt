Over-the-counter OTC financial swaps and physical commodity sale and purchase contracts are generally valued using readily available information in the public markets and quotations provided by brokers and price index developers.
These quotes are corroborated with market data and are categorized within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
In certain less liquid markets, or for longer-term contracts, forward prices are not as readily available.
In these circumstances, OTC financial swaps and physical commodity sale and purchase contracts are valued using internally developed methodologies that consider historical relationships between various commodities, and that result in managements best estimate of fair value.
These contracts are categorized within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

At 31 December 2013, the US natural gas derivatives in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy had a net fair value of $351 million.
Of this amount, $71 million asset of $598 million and liability of $527 million depends on level 3 inputs, with the remainder valued using level 2 inputs.
The significant unobservable inputs for fair value measurements categorized within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the year ended 31 December 2013 are presented below.
Range Weighted average Unobservable inputs $ mmBtu $ mmBtu Natural gas price contracts Long-dated market price 3.15-6.71 4.63 If the natural gas prices after 2018 were 10% higher lower, this would result in a decrease increase in derivative assets of $82 million, and decrease increase in derivative liabilities of $78 million, and a net decrease increase in profit before tax of $4 million.
Derivative gains and losses Gains and losses relating to derivative contracts are included within sales and other operating revenues and within purchases in the income statement depending upon the nature of the activity and type of contract involved.
The contract types treated in this way include futures, options, swaps and certain forward sales and forward purchases contracts, and relate to both currency and commodity trading activities.
Gains or losses arise on contracts entered into for risk management purposes, optimization activity and entrepreneurial trading.
They also arise on certain contracts that are for normal procurement or sales activity for the group but that are required to be fair valued under accounting standards.
Also included within sales and other operating revenues are gains and losses on inventory held for trading purposes.
The total amount relating to all these items excluding gains and losses on realized physical derivative contracts that have been reflected gross in the income statement within sales and purchases was a gain of $587 million a 2012 $411 million net loss and 2011 $216 million net gain.
a The comparative amounts for 2012 and 2011 have been amended and now reflect only the margin on derivative contracts that have been reflected net within the income statement.
Embedded derivatives The group is a party to contracts containing embedded derivatives, the majority of which relate to certain natural gas contracts.
Prior to the development of an active gas trading market, UK gas contracts were priced using a basket of available price indices, primarily relating to oil products, power and inflation.
After the development of an active UK gas market, certain contracts were entered into or renegotiated using pricing formulae not directly related to gas prices, for example, oil product and power prices.
In these circumstances, pricing formulae have been determined to be derivatives, embedded within the overall contractual arrangements that are not clearly and closely related to the underlying commodity.
The resulting fair value relating to these contracts is recognized on the balance sheet with gains or losses recognized in the income statement.
Key information on the natural gas contracts is given below.
At 31 December 2013 2012 Remaining contract terms 1 year and 5 months to 4 years and 9 months 2 years and 5 months to 5 years and 9 months Contractual notional amount 153 million therms 117 million therms The commodity price embedded derivatives relate to natural gas contracts and are categorized in levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The contracts in level 2 are valued using inputs that include price curves for each of the different products that are built up from active market pricing data.
Where necessary, the price curves are extrapolated to the expiry of the contracts the last of which is in 2018 using all available external pricing information: additionally, where limited data exists for certain products, prices are interpolated using historic and long-term pricing relationships.
These valuations are categorized in level 3.
Transfers from level 3 to level 2 occur when the valuation no longer depends significantly on extrapolated or interpolated data.
Valuations use observable market data for maturities up to 36 months, and internally developed price curves based on economic forecasts for periods beyond that time.
The following table shows the changes during the year in the net fair value of embedded derivatives, within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
