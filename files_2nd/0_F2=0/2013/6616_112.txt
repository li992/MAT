The purchase is expected to complete in the first half of 2014.
At 31 December 2012, Other payables include 585 million in respect of the maximum potential amount payable to non-controlling shareholders in GSK Consumer Healthcare Ltd, the Groups consumer healthcare subsidiary in India see Note 39.
Customer return and rebate accruals are provided for by the Group at the point of sale in respect of the estimated rebates, discounts or allowances payable to customers, including 1,188 million 2012 1,210 million in respect of US Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines.
Accruals are made at the time of sale but the actual amounts paid are based on claims made some time after the initial recognition of the sale.
As the amounts are estimated they may not fully reflect the final outcome and are subject to change dependent upon, amongst other things, the types of buying group and product sales mix.
The level of accrual is reviewed and adjusted quarterly in the light of historical experience of actual rebates, discounts or allowances given and returns made and any changes in arrangements.
Future events could cause the assumptions on which the accruals are based to change, which could affect the future results of the Group.

These arrangements have been developed in accordance with local practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benefits can be provided by state schemes: by defined contribution schemes, whereby retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee: or by defined benefit schemes, whereby retirement benefits are based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
Some hybrid defined benefit schemes also include defined contribution sections.
164 GSK Annual Report 2013 28 Pensions and other post-employment benefits continued Pension costs of defined benefit schemes for accounting purposes have been calculated using the projected unit method.
In certain countries pension benefits are provided on an unfunded basis, some administered by trustee companies.
Formal, independent, actuarial valuations of the Groups main plans are undertaken regularly, normally at least every three years.
Actuarial movements in the year are recognised through the statement of comprehensive income.
Discount rates are derived from AA rated corporate bond yields except in countries where there is no deep market in corporate bonds where government bond yields are used.
Discount rates are selected to reflect the term of the expected benefit payments.
Projected inflation rate and pension increases are long-term predictions based on the yield gap between long-term index-linked and fixed interest Gilts.
In the UK, mortality rates are determined by adjusting the SAPS standard mortality tables to reflect recent scheme experience.
These rates are then projected to reflect improvements in life expectancy in line with the CMI projections with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% per year for both males and females.
In the USA, mortality rates are calculated using the RP2000 fully generational table, projected using scale AA, with the white collar adjustment.
The average life expectancy assumed now for an individual at the age of 60 and projected to apply in 2033 for an individual then at the age of 60 is as follows: UK USA Male Female Male Female Years Years Years Years Current 27.5 29.7 24.9 26.4 Projected for 2033 29.4 31.5 26.7 27.6 The assets of funded schemes are generally held in separately administered trusts, either as specific assets or as a proportion of a general fund, or are insurance contracts.
Assets are invested in different classes in order to maintain a balance between risk and return.
Investments are diversified to limit the financial effect of the failure of any individual investment.
The Group reviewed the investment strategy of the UK plans in 2011 and the asset allocation for the UK plans has been adjusted to approximately 55% return seeking assets and 45% liability matching assets.
In 2013, the target asset allocation of the US plans was also updated to 55% return seeking assets and 45% liability matching assets.
In the UK the defined benefit pension schemes operated for the benefit of former Glaxo Wellcome employees and former SmithKline Beecham employees remain separate.
These schemes were closed to new entrants in 2001 and subsequent UK employees are entitled to join a defined contribution scheme.
In the USA the former Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham defined benefit schemes were merged during 2001.
In addition, the Group operates a number of post-retirement healthcare schemes, the principal one of which is in the USA.
During 2013, the Group restructured US post-retirement medical obligations for both active and retired members under the age of 65.
The current plan for participants over 65, paid for medical expenses in excess of those covered by Medicare Part A and Part B as well as for prescription drugs.
Under the new arrangement these participants will instead be eligible to receive an amount, from age 65, from a health reimbursement account, based on years service, subject to an inflation linked maximum of $1,500 per year.
Those already retired and over the age of 65 have also been given the option to switch to this new arrangement.
The impact of this change in 2013 is a credit to the income statement of 279 million and a similar reduction in the post-retirement obligation.
During 2012, the Group changed its policy towards granting discretionary pension increase in the Smithkline Beecham defined benefit schemes.
In the year, the Group also introduced a limit for all UK defined benefit schemes of 2% per year on the rate at which pensionable pay may increase.
The Group has applied the following financial assumptions in assessing the defined benefit liabilities: UK USA Rest of World 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa Rate of increase of future earnings 2.00 2.00 4.00 4.00 4.00 4.00 2.80 3.00 2.90 Discount rate 4.50 4.40 4.80 4.60 3.80 4.40 3.40 3.30 4.20 Expected pension increases 3.40 3.00 3.00 n a n a n a 2.10 1.90 1.90 Cash balance credit conversion rate n a n a n a 4.20 3.35 3.75 0.90 1.30 1.20 Inflation rate 3.40 3.00 3.00 2.25 2.25 2.25 1.80 1.70 1.60 GSK Annual Report 2013 165 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 28 Pensions and other post-employment benefits continued The amounts recorded in the income statement and statement of comprehensive income for the three years ended 31 December 2013 in relation to the defined benefit pension and post-retirement healthcare schemes were as follows: Post-retirement benefits Pensions UK USA Rest of World Group Group 2013 m m m m m Amounts charged to operating profit Current service cost 117 74 89 280 37 Past service cost credit 4 31 27 273 Net interest cost 12 17 17 46 61 Expenses 6 4 4 14 139 95 79 313 175 Remeasurements recorded in the statement of comprehensive income 349 257 74 680 167 Post-retirement benefits Pensions UK USA Rest of World Group Group restated restated restated restated restated 2012 m m m m m Amounts charged to operating profit Current service cost 130 66 75 271 36 Past service credit cost 391 391 2 Net interest cost 31 26 10 67 66 230 92 85 53 104 Remeasurements recorded in the statement of comprehensive income 384 48 230 566 119 Post-retirement Pensions benefits UK USA Rest of World Group Group restated restated restated restated restated 2011 m m m m m Amounts charged to operating profit Current service cost 123 64 75 262 31 Past service credit cost 43 43 13 Net interest cost 32 25 9 66 71 Gains and losses on settlement 1 1 5 112 89 83 284 84 Remeasurements recorded in the statement of comprehensive income 577 70 104 751 133 The past service credit of 273 million in 2013 includes an amount of 279 million in relation to the restructuring of the US post-retirement medical obligations.

During 2013, the Group made special funding contributions to the UK pension schemes totalling 93 million 2012 366 million: 2011 368 million and nil million 2012 32 million: 2011 82 million to the US scheme.
In 2013, GSK reached an agreement with the trustees of the UK pension schemes to make additional contributions to eliminate the pension deficit identified at the 31 December 2011 actuarial funding valuation.
Based on the funding agreements following the 2011 valuation, the additional contributions are expected to be 85 million in 2014.
The contributions were based on a government bond yield curve approach to selecting the discount rate: the rate chosen included an allowance for expected investment returns which reflected the asset mix of the schemes.
Employer contributions for 2014, including special funding contributions, are estimated to be approximately 330 million in respect of defined benefit pension schemes and 80 million in respect of post-retirement benefits.
