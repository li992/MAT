Employee Contributions T he June 2011 revisions to IAS 19 become effective for the Group for the first time in its 2014 financial year.
The two main effects on the Group of these revisions are that: i the expected return on defined benefit pension scheme assets will have to be calculated with reference to the discount rate rather than the rate of expected return on those assets as is the case in the former version of IAS 19, which is used in these financial statements.
This results in a reduction of the expected return on assets and therefore an increase in the net pensions finance charge compared to the former version of IAS 19: ii the scheme administration costs, which were previously deducted from return on assets, will now form an additional part of the total service cost.
By way of illustration, the 2013 total defined benefit charge to the income statement is 16.3m, whereas it would have been 19.7m under these IAS19 revisions.
A s well as the June 2011 revisions to IAS 19, which are discussed above, these additional standards, amendments, and interpretations are applicable to the Group for the first time in its 2014 financial year.

All deferred tax assets and liabilities have been recognised at 20% 2012: 23%.
P ermanent differences arise in relation to share schemes, resulting from a difference between the accounting and tax treatments.
In accordance with IAS 12, the excess of current and deferred tax over and above the related cumulative remuneration expense under IFRS 2 has been recognised directly in equity.
T his arises mainly due to the Group assuming no tax relief for the payments and provisions made in association with the legacy properties until the tax position is agreed with HMRC, as well as other expenses permanently disallowed.

The proposed final dividend for the current period is subject to the approval of the shareholders at the 2014 Annual General Meeting, and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
14 OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS The other intangible assets shown below all relate to software, as detailed further in the accounting policies note.
More details are given in note 20.
At 28 December 2013, the Group had entered into contractual commitments to acquire property, plant and equipment amounting to 6.5m 2012: 5.2m.

The presentation in the balance sheet is as follows: 28 December 2013 29 December 2012 m m Deferred tax assets 23.2 46.1 Deferred tax liabilities 3.6 4.3 19.6 41.8 At the balance sheet date the Group had unused trading tax losses with a potential value of 10.5m 2012: 12.1m.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised as it is not considered probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised.
The Group also has carried forward capital losses and the related potential deferred tax asset of 17.0m 2012: 19.6m which has not been recognised.
Both of these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

96 Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual report & accounts 2013 18 OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS Trade and other receivables 28 December 2013 29 December 2012 m m Trade receivables net of allowance 96.3 71.2 Prepayments and accrued income 24.6 23.1 Other receivables 1.5 1.7 122.4 96.0 Trade and other receivables are not interest-bearing, and are on commercial terms.
Their carrying value approximates to their fair value.
An analysis of the Groups allowance for doubtful receivables is as follows: 28 December 2013 29 December 2012 m m Balance at start of period 8.1 8.7 Decrease in allowance recognised in the income statement 1.3 0.6 Balance at end of period 6.8 8.1 The Groups exposure to the credit risk inherent in its trade receivables is discussed in note 28.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
Interest is charged at appropriate market rates on balances which are in litigation.
Before accepting any new credit customer, the Group obtains a credit check from an external agency to assess the potential customers credit quality, and then sets credit limits on a customer-by-customer basis.
These credit limits are reviewed regularly.
In the case of one-off customers, the Groups policy is to require immediate payment at the point of sale, and not to offer credit terms.
The historical level of customer default is low, and as a result the credit quality of year end trade receivables is considered to be high.
The Group reviews trade receivables past due but not impaired on a regular basis and considers, based on past experience, whether the credit quality of these amounts at the balance sheet date has deteriorated since the transaction was entered into and therefore whether the amounts are recoverable or require provision.
Regular contact is maintained with all such customers and, where necessary, legal action is taken to recover the receivable.
An allowance for impairment is made for any specific amounts which are considered irrecoverable or only partly recoverable.
There is also a separate allowance, which is calculated as a percentage of sales.
At the period end, the total bad debt provision of 6.8m 2012: 8.1m consists of a specific provision of 3.3m 2012: 3.8m which has been made against specific debts with a gross carrying value of 4.1m 2012: 4.8m, and a provision of 3.5m 2012: 4.3m based on sales and on the historic default rate.
To the extent that recoverable amounts are estimated to be less than their associated carrying values, impairment charges have been recorded in the consolidated income statement and the carrying values have been written down to their recoverable amounts.
5.0m debts were written off in the period 2012: 5.6m.
Included within the Groups aggregate trade receivables balance are specific debtor balances with customers totalling 13.0m before bad debt provision 2012: 13.6m before provision which are past due as at the reporting date.
The Group has assessed these balances for recoverability and believes that their credit quality remains intact.
97 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued An ageing analysis of these past due trade receivables is provided as follows: 28 December 2013 29 December 2012 m m 130 days past due 6.1 7.3 3160 days past due 1.4 1.0 6190 days past due 1.0 0.8 90 days past due 4.5 4.5 Total overdue amounts, excluding allowance for doubtful receivables 13.0 13.6 There were no trade receivables which would have been impaired at either period end were it not for the fact that their credit terms were renegotiated.
The Group does not renegotiate credit terms.
Cash at bank and in hand Cash at bank and in hand, which is the term used in the balance sheet, comprises cash on hand together with demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Cash at bank is either in current accounts, or is placed on short-term deposit with maturity periods of less than three months.
Interest on short-term deposits is paid at prevailing money market rates.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.
As explained in the accounting policy note, and as noted at the foot of the consolidated cash flow statement, this definition differs slightly from the definition of cash and cash equivalents, which is used in the cash flow statement, and which includes overdrafts repayable on demand.
Assets pledged as security The Group has pledged its other financial assets to secure bank borrowings.
19 OTHER FINANCIAL LIABILITIES Trade and other payables 28 December 2013 29 December 2012 m m Current liabilities Trade payables 70.4 60.4 Other tax and social security 40.4 37.7 Other payables 5.5 2.1 Accruals and deferred income 42.1 36.9 158.4 137.1 Trade payables, other payables, and accruals principally comprise amounts due in respect of trade purchases and ongoing costs.
Their carrying value in both periods approximates to their fair value.
The average credit taken for trade purchases during the period, based on total operations, was 44 days 2012: 46 days.
The Groups policy on payment of creditors is to agree terms of payment prior to commencing trade with a supplier, and to abide by those terms on the timely submission of satisfactory invoices.

The fees are then amortised over the life of the facility.
The Groups current facility expires in July 2016.
At the current and prior period ends, the amount of fees relating to the period in excess of one year from the balance sheet date were greater than the corresponding amounts drawn down under the facility, thereby creating a net debit balance as shown above.
At the current period end, the amount of fees relating to the period less than one year from the balance sheet date was also greater than the corresponding amount drawn down, creating a further net debit balance.
99 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued All bank borrowings are in sterling, and are drawn under the 160m 2012: 160m committed bank facility.
The terms of this facility are explained further in the final paragraph of note 28 a.
This facility is secured on the property and other assets of the Group.
The carrying values of each of these classes of assets is as presented in the balance sheet and notes to these consolidated financial statements.
The available facility limit is calculated every week, based on the asset backing at the time and can never exceed 160m.
In accordance with the terms of the facility agreement this limit will be reduced to 140m in May 2014.
As at 28 December 2013, the Group had available 123m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met 29 December 2012: 126m.
The loan carries interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin.
The margin will vary between 200 and 250 basis points and will be determined by the Groups rolling Adjusted Profit Before Tax.
Finance lease obligations The finance lease obligations are repayable as follows: 28 December 2013 29 December 2012 m m Current liabilities Within one year 0.1 0.1 Non-current liabilities In the second year 0.1 In the third to fifth years inclusive 0.1 0.1 Total finance lease obligations 0.2 0.2 All of the finance lease obligations are in sterling.
Each lease contract is at a fixed interest rate.
The finance lease obligations were unsecured, and the average remaining lease term at the period end was 2 years and 3 months 2012: 3 years and 3 months.
The reconciliation items between the total future minimum lease payments and their present value is as follows: Present value of Minimum lease payments minimum lease payments 28 December 2013 29 December 2012 28 December 2013 29 December 2012 m m m m Amounts payable under finance leases Within one year 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 In the second year 0.1 0.1 In the third to fifth years inclusive 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.2 0.2 Less future finance charges 0.1 Present value of lease obligations 0.2 0.2 Disclosed as: Current 0.1 0.1 Non-current 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 100 Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual report & accounts 2013 Interest rate and fair value information for bank borrowings and finance lease obligations The weighted average interest rates paid were as follows: 52 weeks to 53 weeks to 28 December 2013 29 December 2012 % % Finance lease obligations 5.0 5.0 Bank borrowings 2.5 2.9 The directors estimate the fair value of the Groups borrowings is as follows: 28 December 2013 29 December 2012 m m Finance lease obligations 0.2 0.2 Bank borrowings 1.0 0.1 21 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS Defined contribution: auto-enrolment plan The Group operates an auto-enrolment defined contribution scheme for employees, in line with recent UK Government legislation.
Under the terms of this scheme, employees make pension contributions out of their salaries, and the Group also makes additional contributions.
The Group decided to give employees the option to enter this scheme earlier than the mandatory start date, and so the auto-enrolment scheme was open to employees from November 2012 on a voluntary, opt-in, basis, although it was not mandatory to enrol employees into this scheme until July 2013.
The total cost charged to income in respect of this scheme in the current period of 1.4m 2012: 0.1m represents the Groups contributions due and payable in respect of the period.
Due to the timing of payments, 0.2m 2012: nil of this amount was unpaid at the period end, but was paid shortly afterwards.
Defined contribution: other plan The Group operates a defined contribution scheme for its employees.
The assets of this scheme are held separately from those of the Group, and are under the control of the scheme trustees.
This scheme began operation during 2006.
The total cost charged to income in respect of this scheme in the current period of 1.0m 2012: 0.9m represents the Groups contributions due and paid in respect of the period.
Defined benefit plan The Group operates a funded pension scheme which provides benefits based on the pensionable pay of participating employees.
This scheme was closed to new entrants from April 2013.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group, being invested with independent fund managers.
Contributions are charged to the consolidated income statement so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives with the Group.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost, and past service cost are determined by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The most recent completed actuarial valuation was carried out at 5 April 2011 by the scheme actuary.
The actuary advising the Group has subsequently rolled forward the results of the 5 April 2011 valuation to 28 December 2013, and has restated the results onto a basis consistent with market conditions at that date.
101 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Differences between the defined benefit pension deficit on an IAS 19 basis and on a funding basis As is mandatory under International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group values its pension deficit in these accounts on an IAS 19 basis.
As shown below, the IAS 19 deficit at the current period end is 54m.
On a funding basis also know as a Technical Provisions basis, being the basis on which the triennial actuarial valuations are carried out, the funding deficit at the current year end is estimated at 150m.
The Group currently has an agreement with the pension scheme trustees to make additional deficit contributions to the scheme of 35m per year over and above the normal level of contributions.

Females S1PFA, CMI 2010 core projections with a long-term improvement rate of 1.5% p. a.
Note T he underlying S1PMA and S1PFA tables are also adjusted by scaling factors.
Separate scaling factors apply to males and females and to the different categories of members.
The mortality assumption adopted by the Group in 2013 and 2012 is equivalent to the following life expectancies: 2013 2012 Male yrs Female yrs Male yrs Female yrs Non-pensioner age 45 89.3 91.7 89.2 91.6 Pensioner age 65 88.5 89.5 88.4 89.4 Sensitivities If there was an increase decrease in the discount rate of 0.25%, there would be a corresponding decrease increase in the scheme liabilities of around 4.7%, or 40m, and a decrease increase in the current service cost of around 5.7% or 0.7m.
An increase decrease of 0.25% to the inflation rate would increase decrease scheme liabilities by around 28m, or 3.2%, and would increase decrease current service cost by around 0.6m or 4.9%.
The effect of increasing the assumption regarding life expectancy by one year longer than shown above would be to increase the assessed value of liabilities by around 2.1% or 18m, and would increase current service cost by around 0.2m or 1.6%.

A single long-term assumption is then calculated as the weighted average of the actual asset allocation and the long-term assumption for each asset class.

106 Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual report & accounts 2013 22 PROVISIONS Property Warranty Business closure Total m m m m At 24 December 2011 33.0 2.3 35.3 Additional provision in the period 1.3 3.2 1.0 5.5 Provision released in the period 0.1 0.1 Utilisation of provision in the period 16.4 2.1 0.1 18.6 At 29 December 2012 17.8 3.4 0.9 22.1 Additional provision in the period 1.8 2.8 4.6 Provision released in the period 0.2 0.3 0.5 Utilisation of provision in the period 10.4 3.0 0.8 14.2 At 28 December 2013 9.0 2.9 0.1 12.0 Property provision The property provision covers onerous leases on any non-trading leased properties.
For some properties, the provision is based on the shortfall between rent payable and rent receivable.
For other properties, where negotiations to surrender the lease are in progress, the provision is based on the amount which the landlord has indicated that they are willing to take as a premium in order for the Group to surrender the lease.
The provision is based on the period until the end of the lease, or until the Group considers that it can cover the shortfall by subletting, assigning, or surrendering the lease.
Throughout the course of the year the Group reviews the range of options for unused properties, and maintains ongoing discussions with landlords and external agents, with a view to identifying possible lease surrenders and finding tenants.
The property provision also includes amounts for any related shortfalls in business rates on these properties, and for dilapidations, agents fees and other related costs of these properties.
During the current period, the property provision has been increased by 0.1m arising from an unwinding of the discount rate over time.
None of this amount relates to a change in the discount rate.
This amount is shown as a finance charge in note 10.
There is a discussion of the main sources of estimation and uncertainty which apply to this provision in note 3.
The amount of the expected future cash flows has been adjusted to reflect the expected range of possibilities and, as the outflows under this provision are expected to take place over a number or years, the provision has been discounted to its present value.
The timing of outflows from the provision is variable, and is dependent on property lease expiry dates and on opportunities to surrender leases.

Fair value of options granted The fair value of all options granted is estimated on the date of grant using either a binomial option valuation model or a Black Scholes model depending on the complexity of the option.
The key assumptions used in the models were: 52 weeks to 53 weeks to 28 December 2013 29 December 2012 Dividend yield % 2.5 1.5 Expected share price volatility % 52 54 Historical volatility % 52 54 Risk-free interest rate % 1.1 3.0 Expected life of options years 4.40 4.75 Historical volatility is measured for each scheme over the period equal to the vesting period of the scheme.
The figure arrived at is then used as the best estimate of expected future volatility.

28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT a Capital risk management The Group manages its capital structure to maximise the return to shareholders through the optimisation of its debt and equity balance, trading-off the benefits of financial leverage with the expected future costs of financial distress.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt including the borrowings disclosed in note 20 offset by cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent including issued share capital and reserves as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, and in note 23.
The Board of Directors reviews the capital structure regularly, including, but not limited to, at the time of preparing annual budgets, preparing three year corporate plans, and considering corporate transactions.
As part of this review, the Board reviews the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
The Group will balance its overall capital structure through the payment of dividends, new share issues and share buy-backs, taking on or issuing new debt or repaying any existing debt.
At the period end, the Group had a 160m committed bank facility secured against the assets of the Group and based on four sub-facilities stock, trade receivables, property and a cash flow facility.
The facility limit was the lower of 160m and the sum of the four sub-facilities.
The property component initially 17.4m amortises at the rate of 141,667 each month, whereas the other components act as a revolving credit facility with no amortisation.
Under the terms of the facility, none of the Groups principal subsidiary companies can sign up to additional secured borrowings, other than those expressly permitted within the terms of the facility.
The facility i permits normal trade credit granted to it in the ordinary course of business: ii allows up to 10m of additional secured borrowings, and iii allows up to 20m of finance lease borrowing.
During the previous period the maturity of the facility was extended from May 2014 to July 2016.
As part of that extension the facility will reduce from 160m to 140m with effect from May 2014.
The Groups overall strategy remains unchanged from 2012.
117 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued b Significant accounting policies Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 2 to the financial statements.
c Categories of financial instruments 28 December 2013 29 December 2012 m m Financial assets current and non-current Trade receivables 96.3 71.2 Cash and cash equivalents 139.7 96.7 Financial liabilities current and non-current Trade payables 70.4 60.4 Borrowings 0.8 0.3 d Financial risk management General The Group is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of financial instrument related risks.
The Board has approved and monitors the risk management processes, including documented treasury policies, counterparty limits, controlling and reporting structures.
The types of risk exposure, the way in which such exposure is managed, and the quantification of the level of exposure in the balance sheet is shown below sub-categorised into credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.
The Group is actively engaged in the management of all of these financial risks in order to minimise their potential adverse impact on the Groups financial performance.
The principles, practices and procedures governing the Group-wide financial risk management process have been approved by the Board and are overseen by the Executive Committee.
In turn, the Executive Committee delegates authority to a central treasury function Group Treasury for the practical implementation of the financial risk management process across the Group and for ensuring that the Groups entities adhere to specified financial risk management policies.
Group Treasury regularly reassesses and reports on the financial risk environment, identifying and evaluating financial risks.
The Group does not take positions on derivative contracts and only enters into contractual bank deposit or lending arrangements with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash at bank and in hand, which is the term used in the balance sheet, comprises cash on hand together with demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Cash and cash equivalents, which is the term used in the cash flow statement, comprises cash at bank and in hand, as defined immediately above, together with any overdrafts repayable on demand.
Arrangements are in place to ensure that cash is utilised most efficiently for the ongoing working capital needs of the Groups operating units and to ensure that the Group earns the most advantageous rates of interest available.
The prime consideration in the investment of cash balances is the security of the asset, followed by liquidity and then yield.
Management of trade receivables is discussed in note 18.
118 Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual report & accounts 2013 e Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, other assets, and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is mainly confined to the risk of customers defaulting on sales invoices raised.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a way of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
The Groups policy on dealing with trade customers is described in the accounting policies and in note 18.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty.
The Group limits exposure to credit risk on liquid funds through adherence to a policy of minimum long-term counterparty credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies Standard & Poors A and Moodys A2.
Full disclosure of the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is presented in the following table: 28 December 2013 29 December 2012 m m Trade receivables net of allowance 96.3 71.2 Cash and cash equivalents 139.7 96.7 Total credit risk exposure 236.0 167.9 f Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group could experience difficulties in meeting its commitments to creditors as financial liabilities fall due for payment.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by using reasonable and  assumptions to forecast the future cash-generative capabilities and working capital requirements of the businesses it operates and by maintaining sufficient reserves, committed borrowing facilities and other credit lines as appropriate.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has agreed an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities as far as is possible.
Included in note 20 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.
In addition, the Financial Review contains a section describing the interaction of liquidity risk and the going concern review.
119 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Maturity profile of outstanding financial liabilities The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The Group has no derivative financial liabilities.
The tables have been drawn up on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.

120 Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual report & accounts 2013 g Market risk This is the risk that financial instrument fair values will fluctuate owing to changes in market prices.
The significant market risks to which the Group is exposed are foreign exchange risk, and interest rate risk.
These are discussed further below: Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to several currencies, principally as a result of operating costs incurred in foreign currencies, and to a lesser extent, from non-Sterling revenues.
The Groups policy is generally not to hedge such exposures.
The exposure of the Groups financial assets and liabilities to currency risk is as follows: 28 December 2013 29 December 2012 m m Euro Trade receivables 1.7 1.5 Cash and cash equivalents 5.5 2.8 Trade payables 16.4 12.6 9.2 8.3 US Dollar Cash and cash equivalents 3.9 4.0 Trade payables 3.8 1.8 0.1 2.2 Hong Kong Dollar Cash and cash equivalents 0.3 0.1 0.3 0.1 Japanese Yen Trade payables 0.1 0.1 Total 8.8 6.1 Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as the parent company has borrowed funds at floating interest rates.
The Board has reviewed this risk of interest rate increases causing financial distress and concluded that hedging protection should only be considered if net borrowings or cash surpluses were to exceed 150m.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
Payments on the Groups finance leases are fixed on inception of the lease contract, and as such are regarded as fixed rate borrowings.
121 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued h Financial instrument sensitivities Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits, trade receivables and trade payables.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Groups financial instruments as at its year end to changes in market variables, being exchange rates and interest rates.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the components of net debt and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of liability outstanding at the year end date was outstanding for the whole year.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the position as at the balance sheet date.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: Debt and other deposits are carried at amortised cost and therefore carrying value does not change as interest rates move.
No sensitivity is provided for accrued interest as accruals are based on pre-agreed interest rates and therefore are not susceptible to further rate movements.
Finance lease interest payments are fixed at the inception of the contract and are not subject to repricing.
They have therefore been excluded from this analysis.
Translation of foreign subsidiaries and operations into the Groups presentation currency have been excluded from the sensitivity.
Using the above assumptions, the following analyses show the illustrative effect on the income statement and equity that would result from reasonably possible changes in the relevant foreign currency or interest rates: Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for floating rate nonderivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
The Group holds no derivative financial instruments.
Fixed rate liabilities are not susceptible to changes in interest rates, and are omitted from the analysis below.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 50 basis points increase is used as this represents managements assessment of the possible change in interest rates.
At the reporting date, if interest rates had been 50 basis points higher and all other variables were held constant, the Groups net profit and profit and loss reserve would remain the same 2012: remain the same.
For a decrease of 50 basis points, the current year figures would remain the same 2012: remain the same.
Foreign exchange sensitivity As noted above, the Group is mainly exposed to movements in Euro, US dollar, Chinese Yuan, and Japanese Yen exchange rates the Hong Kong dollar being effectively pegged to the US dollar.
The following information details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% weakening or strengthening in pounds Sterling against the Euro, and the US Dollar.
These percentages are the rates used by management when assessing sensitivities internally and represent managements assessment of the possible change in foreign currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the end of the financial period, and based on the outstanding foreign currency balances at the period end.
28 December 2013 29 December 2012 m m 10% weakening of Sterling to Euro 1.0 0.9 10% strengthening of Sterling to Euro 0.8 0.7 10% weakening of Sterling to US dollar 0.2 10% strengthening of Sterling to US dollar 0.2 The Groups sensitivity, on the basis above, to a strengthening or weakening of Sterling to the Hong Kong Dollar, the Chinese Yuan, or the Japanese Yen was less than 0.1m at both the current and prior period ends.
