There were no contracts subsisting during or at the end of the year in which a director of the Company is or was interested and which are or were significant in relation to the Companys business.
There were no other material transactions during the year with the directors of the Company.
22 RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Companys investing activities undertaken in pursuit of its investment objective, as set out on page 15, involve certain inherent risks.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks as summarised below.
These policies have remained substantially unchanged during the current and preceding periods.
Market price risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys business.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Board meets on seven scheduled occasions in each year and at each meeting it receives sufficient financial and statistical information to enable it to monitor adequately the investment performance and status of the business.
In addition, financial information is circulated to the directors on a monthly basis.
The Board has also established a series of investment parameters, which are reviewed annually, designed to limit the risk inherent in managing a portfolio of investments.
The Companys borrowings have the effect of increasing the risk faced by shareholders.
This gearing effect is such that, for example, for a 10% movement in the valuation of the Companys investments, the net assets attributable to shareholders would move by approximately 11.2%.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk of movements in the value of financial instruments that arise as a result of fluctuations in interest rates.
The Company finances its operations through retained profits including capital profits, and additional financing is obtained through the two debenture stocks in issue and the Private Placement Loan, on all of which interest is paid at a fixed rate.
Liquidity risk The Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of cash balances and short-term bank deposits.
42 Temple Bar Investment Trust PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013 230986 Temple Bar pp31-pp51 14 02 2014 17:33 Page 43 Active investment working for you Notes to the Financial Statements continued 22 RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss.
This is mitigated by the Manager reviewing the credit ratings of broker counterparties.
The risk attached to dividend flows is mitigated by the Managers research of potential investee companies.
The Companys custodian bank is responsible for the collection of income on behalf of the Company.
Cash is held either with reputable banks with high quality external credit enhancements or in liquidity cash funds providing a spread of exposures to various underlying banks in order to diversify risk.
Currency risk The income and capital value of the Companys investments and liabilities can be affected by exchange rate movements as some of the Companys assets and income are denominated in currencies other than Pounds Sterling which is the Companys reporting currency.
The key areas where foreign currency risk could have an impact on the Company are: movements in rates that would affect the value of investments and liabilities: and movements in rates that would affect the income received.
The Company had the following currency exposures, all of which are included in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value based on the exchange rates ruling at the respective year-ends.
The Company mitigates some of the currency risk through the use of forward currency contracts.
The analysis below assumes that the Euro and US Dollar exchange rates may move -2% against Pounds Sterling.
000 000 Projected movement 2% -2% Effect on net assets for the year 2,634 2,634 Effect on capital return 2,616 2,616 Financial assets Interest rate risk The majority of the Companys financial assets are equity shares and other investments which neither pay interest nor have a maturity date.
The Companys fixed interest holdings have a market value of 101,840,000, representing 12.9% of net assets of 792,070,000 2012: 52,405,000: 8.7%.
The weighted average running yield as at 31 December 2013 was 3.1% 2012: 5.7% and the weighted average remaining life was 4.5 years 2012: 5.7 years.
The Companys cash balance of 14,139,000 2012: 28,063,000 earns interest, calculated on a tiered basis, depending on the balance held, by reference to the base rate.
If the bank base rate had increased by 0.5%, the impact on the profit or loss and net assets would have been a positive 70,695 2012: 140,315.
If the bank base rate had decreased by 0.5%, the impact on the profit or loss and net assets would have been a negative 70,695 2012: negative 140,315.
The calculations are based on the cash balances at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole.

All current liabilities have no interest rate and are repayable within one year.
The 9.875% debenture stock, the 5.5% debenture stock and the 4.05% Private Placement Loan, which are repayable in 2017, 2021 and 2028 respectively, pay interest at fixed rates.
The weighted average period until maturity of the loans is 9 years 2012: 7 years and the weighted average interest rate payable is 6.0% 2012: 7.2% p. a.
Other price risk exposure If the investment valuation fell by 10% at 31 December 2013, the impact on profit or loss and net assets would have been negative 88.9 million 2012: negative 63.5 million.
If the investment portfolio valuation rose by 10% at 31 December 2013, the impact on profit or loss and net assets would have been positive 88.9 million 2012: positive 63.5 million.
