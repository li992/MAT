The differences are explained below: 31 August 1 September 2013 2012 m m Profit on ordinary activities before tax 154.0 158.3 Profit on ordinary activities at standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 23.6% 2012: 25.2% 36.3 39.9 Effects of: Permanent differences 4.0 Overseas tax rates 0.5 1.5 Utilisation of tax losses 4.7 3.1 Non-qualifying depreciation and lease transactions 1.5 0.4 Effect on deferred taxation of the change in corporation tax rate 1.6 0.2 Adjustments in relation to prior periods 9.1 9.5 Tax charge for the financial year 26.1 33.0 The Finance Act 2013, which became substantively enacted on 2 July 2013, included legislation reducing the main rate of corporation tax from 23.0% to 21.0% from 1 April 2014 with a further reduction in the main rate of corporation tax to 20.0% from 1 April 2015.
The effect of the reduction in the corporation tax rate enacted in the Finance Act 2013 has been to reduce the net deferred tax asset recognised at 1 September 2012 by approximately 2.2 million.
This 2.2 million decrease has been recognised in line with the treatment of the assets and liabilities giving rise to the net deferred tax asset.
The prior year adjustment of 9.1 million relates to the reassessment of historic tax liabilities no longer considered likely to arise.
