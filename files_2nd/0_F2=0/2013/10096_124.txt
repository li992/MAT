Finance costs comprise interest expense, finance charges on finance leases, applicable foreign exchange losses and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
Interest income and interest expense are recognised as they accrue, using the effective interest method.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs The Group capitalises borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of assets taking a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use as part of the cost of that asset.
Net investment in foreign entities On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to equity.
The Group treats specific intercompany loan balances, which are not intended to be repaid in the foreseeable future, as part of its net investment.
In the event of a foreign entity being sold or a hedging item being extinguished, such exchange differences would be recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
