3 Segmental reporting The Groups principal activity is that of retailing, derived solely from the UK.
The Group is not reliant on any major customer for 1% or more of revenues.
Consideration of IFRS 8 Operating segments The Group has made the following considerations in arriving at conclusions and the corresponding disclosure in these financial statements.
IFRS 8 requires consideration of the chief operating decision maker CODM within the Group.
In line with the Groups internal reporting framework and management structure, the key operating decisions and resource allocations are made by the Management Board.
The Directors therefore consider the Management Board to be the CODM.
Consideration in particular was given to retail outlets, the fuel resale operation, the manufacturing entities and multi-channel operations.
70 Performance and strategy review Governance Financial statements 3 Segmental reporting continued Key internal reports received by the CODM, primarily the Board Management Accounts, focus on the performance of the Group as a whole.
The operations of all elements of the business are driven by the retail sales environment and hence have fundamentally the same economic characteristics.
All operational decisions made are focused on the performance and growth of the retail outlets and the ability of the business to meet the supply demands of the stores.
Given this, the Group has considered the overriding core principles of IFRS 8 and has determined that it has one operating segment.
Reconciliations of reportable segment revenues, profit or loss, assets and liabilities and other material items Performance is measured by the CODM based on profit as reported in the Board Management Accounts.
This report presents the financial position before a income tax: b pension interest income volatility: and c profit loss arising from property related transactions: d significant one-off costs that do not relate to the Groups principal activities.
This underlying profit figure is used to measure performance as management believes that this is the most relevant in evaluating the results of the Group relative to other entities that operate within the retail industry.
This information and the reconciliation to the statutory position can be found in note 1.
In addition, the Board Management Accounts present a Group balance sheet containing assets and liabilities.
This balance sheet is as shown within the Consolidated balance sheet.

The impact of this change in tax rate is a credit of 41m to the income statement.
In addition, further changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the Autumn Statement 2012.
This includes a further reduction to the main rate to reduce the rate to 21% from 1 April 2014.
This change had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and, therefore, is not included in these financial statements.
The proposed reduction of the main rate of corporation tax to 21% from 1 April 2014 will be enacted separately.
The overall effect of this further change, if it applied to the deferred tax balance at 3 February 2013, would be to further reduce the deferred tax liability by an additional 40m.

9 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
The Company has two 2012: two classes of instrument that are potentially dilutive: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the period and contingently issuable shares under the Groups long term incentive plan LTIPs.

The cost of internal labour capitalised is not material for separate disclosure.
The goodwill arose on the acquisition of kiddicare.
com Limited Kiddicare 24m, Flower World Limited 3m and Farmers Boy Deeside Limited 7m.
The value of goodwill has been tested for impairment during the current financial year by comparing the recoverable amount on a value in use basis of each cash generating unit to the carrying value of goodwill.
The key assumptions for the Kiddicare value in use calculations are based on the latest Board approved cash flow projections, with long term projections based on a growth rate of 2%.
These cash flows have been discounted at a pre-tax rate of 8%.
Changes in income and expenditure are based on expectations of future changes in the market.
No impairment arose during the year as a result of this test.
Impairment tests have been performed on the remaining goodwill based on value in use and similar assumptions to those above, or on a net asset basis where appropriate.
No impairment loss was identified in the current financial year 2012: nil.
The valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of the related goodwill.

Impairment is measured at a cash generating unit level CGU, with each store considered to be a CGU.
Impairment losses are recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount may not be recoverable, calculated as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Value in use has been assessed by projecting individual store cash flows over their useful life, with a growth rate applied after five years based on long term growth rates for the UK food retail sector, and discounted back to present value at the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
The store cash flows are based on budgets reviewed by the Board.

On 18 July 2012, the Group issued 400m of sterling bonds at a fixed rate of 3.50%, expiring in July 2026.
The issue is part of a 3,000m Euro Medium Term Note Programme where the Group can from time-to-time issue notes denominated in any agreed currency.
As at 3 February 2013, the Group had issued, in total, 800m of fixed rate sterling bonds as part of this programme.
On 26 November 2012, the Group entered into a 200m term loan, which expires on 28 May 2014.
In the event of default of covenants on the bank facility, the principal amounts and any interest accrued are repayable on demand.
The Group has the following undrawn floating committed borrowing facilities available in respect of which all conditions present had been met at the balance sheet date: 2013 2012 m m Undrawn facilities expiring: Between three and five years 675 725 79 Financial statements Annual report and financial statements 2012 13 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 53 weeks ended 3 February 2013 18 Financial instruments a Financial risk management The Groups treasury operations are controlled centrally by the Treasury Committee in accordance with clearly defined policies and procedures that have been authorised by the Board.
There is an amount of delegated authority to the Treasury Committee, but all activities are summarised in half yearly treasury reports which are presented to the Audit Committee.
The Groups principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans and overdrafts, bonds, other borrowings, finance leases and trade and other creditors.
The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various financial assets such as trade debtors and cash and short term deposits which arise directly from its operations.
The Group enters into derivative transactions, in the form of forward currency contracts, cross-currency swaps and energy price contracts.
The purpose of these derivative instruments is to manage risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
As part of normal banking arrangements, the Group utilises letters of credit in order to facilitate contracts with third parties.
The financial derivatives relating to commitments entered into during the year are to manage the risks arising from its usage of energy and foreign currency.
It remains the Groups policy not to engage in speculative trading of financial instruments.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing these risks are stated below: i Foreign currency risk The Group makes the majority of its purchases in sterling, however it incurs currency exposure in respect of overseas trade purchases made in currencies other than sterling, primarily being euro and US dollar.
The Groups objective is to reduce risk to short term profits and losses from exchange rate fluctuations.
It is Group policy that any transactional currency exposures recognised to have a material impact on short term profits and losses will be hedged through the use of derivative financial instruments.
At the balance sheet date, the Group had entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency exposure on up to 74% 2012: 50% of its forecasted purchases within the next six months.
Cross-currency swaps are used to mitigate the Groups currency exposure arising from payments of interest and repayment of the principal in relation to US dollar private placement loan notes.
The sensitivity to a reasonably possible change - 10% in the US dollar and euro exchange rates has been determined as being immaterial.
ii Liquidity risk The Group policy is to maintain a balance of funding with a range of maturities and a sufficient level of undrawn committed borrowing facilities to meet any unforeseen obligations and opportunities.
Short term cash balances, together with undrawn committed facilities, enable the Group to manage its liquidity risk.
The Group finances its operations with a combination of bank credit facilities, bonds and US private placement loan notes.
The Treasury Committee monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity reserve on a quarterly basis, which comprises committed and uncommitted borrowing facilities on the basis of expected cash flow.
At 3 February 2013, the Group had undrawn committed facilities of 675m 2012: 725m note 17.
These facilities remain available to the Group.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups other financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments, which includes interest payments.
Creditors and current tax liabilities have been excluded from this analysis.
These balances are due within 12 months and their contractual undiscounted payments equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.
Where borrowings are subject to a floating rate, an estimate for interest has been made.
The amounts included in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows, and therefore do not agree to the amounts disclosed on the balance sheet for borrowings.

Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banking groups as well as credit exposures from other sources of income such as supplier income and tenants of investment properties.
The Group maintains deposits with banks and financial institutions who must possess a long term credit rating of A3 or higher with Moodys for a period not exceeding six months.
Further, the Group has specified limits that can be deposited with any banking group or financial institution at any point.
The maximum exposure on cash and cash equivalents and deposits is equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
The Group does not expect any significant performance losses from counterparties.
The Group trades only with recognised third parties.
It is the Groups policy that tenants of investment properties who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant.
The maximum exposure is the carrying amount as disclosed in note 15.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
iv Other risks Pricing risk: The Group manages the risks associated with the purchase of electricity, gas and diesel consumed by its activities excluding fuel purchased for resale to customers by entering into bank swap contracts to fix prices for expected consumption.
The Treasury Committee reviews the Groups market price exposure to these commodities on a quarterly basis and determines a strategy for utilising derivative financial products in order to mitigate the volatility of energy prices.
A - 10 % change in the fair value of the commodity price at the balance sheet date impacts the hedging reserve by 24m 2012: 16m.
The Group intends to hold derivatives to maintain cover of its energy purchases of up to 75% over an appropriate timescale.
Cash flow interest rate risk: The Groups long term policy is to protect itself against adverse movements in interest rates by maintaining at least 60% of its total borrowings at fixed interest rates.
As at the balance sheet date 62% 2012: 66% of the Groups borrowings are at fixed rate, thereby substantially reducing the Groups exposure to adverse movements in interest rates.

The Groups objectives are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern providing returns to shareholders, through the optimisation of the debt and equity balances, maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating and, having adequate liquidity headroom.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes appropriate decisions in light of the current economic conditions and strategic objectives of the Group.
Initiatives available to achieve the Groups desired capital structure include adjusting the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, issuing new shares and buying back share capital.
During the current financial year, the proportion of debt relative to equity has increased, resulting from 579m incurred on the equity retirement programme, and a strategy of pursuing a more diversified funding portfolio.
Additional funding of 400m has been obtained through the Groups bond programme and a 200m term loan with Lloyds Banking Group.
This has contributed to a significant increase in average maturity period of the Groups debt.
A key objective of the Groups capital management is to maintain compliance with the covenants set out in the revolving credit facility.
The Groups covenants require maintenance of a gearing ratio of less than 3.5 and interest cover of at least 3.0 times.
Throughout the year, the Group has comfortably complied with these covenants.
c Fair values i Financial assets All financial derivatives are held at fair value, which has been determined by reference to prices available from the markets on which the instruments are traded.
Cash and cash equivalents and debtors are held at book value, which equals the fair value.
The values of other financial assets are disclosed within note 14. ii Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost.
The US dollar private placement loan notes are retranslated at balance sheet date spot rates.
The fair value of the sterling bonds and US dollar private placement loan notes are measured using closing market prices.
These compare to carrying values as follows: 2013 2013 2012 2012 Amortised Fair Amortised Fair cost value cost value m m m m Total bonds: non-current 1,346 1,455 955 1,057 Total loan notes: non-current 156 169 156 164 1,502 1,624 1,111 1,221 The fair value of other items within current and non-current borrowing equals their carrying amount, as the impact of discounting is not significant.
d Hedging activities Cash flow hedges At 3 February 2013 and 29 January 2012, the Group held cross-currency swaps which have been designated as cash flow hedges.
Prior to this, the cross-currency swaps were designated as fair value hedges against the commitment to issue US private placement loan notes.
This derivative financial instrument is used to minimise risk from potential movements in foreign exchange rates inherent in cash flow of certain liabilities.
The cross-currency swaps cover the Group from currency exposure arising from payments of interest and repayment of the principal in relation to US dollar private placement loan notes note 17.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding cross-currency swaps at 3 February 2013 was $250m 2012: $250m.
To minimise the risk from potential movements in energy prices, the Group has energy price contracts which are also designated as cash flow hedges.
82 Performance and strategy review Governance Financial statements 18 Financial instruments continued The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the cost of future purchases of goods for resale, where those purchases are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the purchasing company.
The hedging instruments are primarily used to hedge purchases in euros and US dollars.
The cash flows hedged will occur within six months of the balance sheet date.
At 3 February 2013, the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange and option contracts to which the Group has committed was 154m 2012: 67m.
The fair value of these outstanding contracts at the balance sheet date was an asset of 4m 2012: liability of 1m.
e Fair value hierarchy IFRS 7 requires an analysis of financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method.
All financial instruments carried at fair value within the Group at 3 February 2013 and 29 January 2012 are financial derivatives and all are categorised as Level 2 instruments.

83 Financial statements Annual report and financial statements 2012 13 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 53 weeks ended 3 February 2013 20 Pensions a Defined benefit pension scheme The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes, the Morrison and Safeway schemes the schemes, providing benefits defined on retirement based on age at date of retirement, years of service and a formula using either the employees compensation package or career average revalued earnings CARE.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds: no part of the schemes is wholly unfunded.
The latest full actuarial valuations, which were carried out at 6 April 2010 and 1 April 2010 for the Morrison and Safeway schemes respectively, were updated for IAS 19 Employee benefits purposes for the period to 3 February 2013 by a qualified independent actuary.
The Deed and Rules of the Morrison Pension Scheme gives the Trustees power to set the level of contributions.
In the Safeway Scheme this power is given to the Group, subject to regulatory override.
The current best estimate of employer contributions to be paid for the period commencing 4 February 2013 is 33m 2012: 31m.
b Assumptions The major assumptions used in this valuation to determine the present value of the schemes defined benefit obligation are shown below: i Financial 2013 2012 Rate of increases in salaries 3.70% 4.55% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.30%3.70% 2.50%3.30% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 4.85% 4.75% Inflation assumption RPI CPI 3.70% 2.90% 3.30% 2.50% ii Longevity The average life expectancy in years of a member who reaches normal retirement age of 65 and is currently aged 45 is as follows: 2013 2012 Male 24.5 24.4 Female 25.4 25.3 The average life expectancy in years of a member retiring at the age of 65 at balance sheet date is as follows: 2013 2012 Male 22.1 22.0 Female 23.1 23.0 Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on actuarial advice and in accordance with published statistics.
The longevity assumption considers how long a member will live when they reach the age of retirement.
Amongst the UK population, there is a continuing trend for a generation to live longer than the preceding generation, and this has been reflected in the longevity assumption.
This means that a 45 year old today is assumed to live on average longer than a 65 year old today.
This particular adjustment, described in the mortality tables below, is known as long cohort and is in line with the latest advice from the Pension Regulator.
In calculating the present value of the liabilities, the actuary selects the appropriate mortality table that reflects the longevity assumption.
The most up-to-date tables are used in each period.
The current mortality table used is S1PMA S1PFA-Heavy YOB 2012: S1PMA S1PFA-Heavy YOB.
As disclosed in the critical accounting assumptions and estimates section on page 69, the results of the experience study conducted for the Safeway scheme have been used to adjust the longevity assumption for both schemes.
84 Performance and strategy review Governance Financial statements 20 Pensions continued iii Expected return on assets The major assumptions used to determine the expected future return on the schemes assets, were as follows: 2013 2012 Long term rate of return on: Equities 7.30% 5.90% Corporate bonds 4.85% 4.75% Gilts 2.90% Liability driven investments 3.30% Cash 0.60% 1.50% The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescales covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The expected return on plan assets is based on market expectation at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligation.
c Valuations Assets of the schemes are held in order to generate cash to be used to satisfy the schemes obligations, and are not necessarily intended to be realised in the short term.
The allocation of assets between categories is governed by the investment principles of each scheme and is the responsibility of the trustees of each respective scheme.
The trustees should take due consideration of the Groups views and a representative of the Group attends Trustee Investment Committees.
The fair value of the schemes assets, which may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain, are as follows: 2013 2012 m m Equities 1,213 1,054 Corporate bonds 793 724 Gilts 805 Liability driven investments 831 Cash 2 6 Total fair value of schemes assets 2,839 2,589 Present value of defined benefit funded obligation 2,859 2,600 Net pension liability recognised in the balance sheet 20 11 Related deferred tax asset note 19 5 2 Net deficit 15 9 The movement in the fair value of the schemes assets over the period was as follows: 2013 2012 m m Fair value of scheme assets at start of period 2,589 2,304 Expected return on scheme assets 120 140 Actuarial gain recognised in other comprehensive income 145 148 Employer contributions 33 31 Employee contributions 10 10 Benefits paid 58 44 Fair value of scheme assets at end of period 2,839 2,589 The above pension scheme assets do not include any investments in the parent Companys own shares or property occupied by any member of the Group.

In June 2001, the Group established a stakeholder pension scheme, open to all employees, to which the Group makes matching contributions of a maximum of 5% of eligible earnings.
This was closed to new members with effect from September 2012 following the introduction of the Morrisons Retirement Saver Plan.
Pension costs for the defined contribution scheme are as follows: 2013 2012 m m Stakeholder pension scheme 5 5 i Post retirement benefit plan On 24 September 2012, the Group opened a new post retirement benefit plan, the Morrisons Retirement Saver Plan.
The scheme provides a lump sum benefit based upon a defined proportion of an employees earnings each year, revalued in line with a guaranteed rate prior to retirement.
All employees joining the Group after 24 September 2012 are automatically enrolled.
Existing employees are also eligible to join.
In the year contributions of 4m were made into the scheme by the Group.
On 31 January 2013, the Group made a contribution to the Morrison and Safeway pension schemes of 90m.
On the same day the pension schemes trustees invested 90m in Wm Morrison Property Partnership SLP as limited partners.
SLP was established by Wm Property Investments Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, to hold investments in retail and distribution properties of the Group with a market value of 141m.
The Group retains control over the SLP, and as such it is fully consolidated within these Group financial statements.
These properties have been leased to Wm Morrison Supermarkets Plc and Safeway Stores Limited.
As a partner in SLP the Morrison and Safeway pension schemes are entitled to a semi-annual share of the profits of SLP each year for 20 years.
The profits shared with the pension schemes will be reflected in the Group financial statements as pension contributions.
21 Provisions Property provisions m At 29 January 2012 84 Charged to profit for the period 3 Unused amounts reversed during the period 3 Utilised in period 12 Unwinding of discount 4 At 3 February 2013 76 Property provisions comprise onerous leases provision, petrol filling station decommissioning reserve and provisions for dilapidations on leased buildings.
Onerous leases relate to sublet and vacant properties.
Where the rent receivable on the properties is less than the rent payable, a provision based on present value of the net cost is made to cover the expected shortfall.
The lease commitments range from one to 59 years.
Market conditions have a significant impact and hence the assumptions on future cash flows are reviewed regularly and revisions to the provision made where necessary.
Other property provisions comprise petrol filling station decommissioning reserve and dilapidations cost.
Provision is made for decommissioning costs for when the petrol filling station tanks reach the end of their useful life or when they become redundant and is based on the present value of costs to be incurred to decommission the petrol tanks.
Dilapidation costs are incurred to bring a leased building back to the condition in which it was originally leased.
Provision is made for these costs, which are incurred on termination of the lease.

90 Performance and strategy review Governance Financial statements 26 Share-based payments The Group operates a number of share-based payments schemes: the Executive share option scheme, the Sharesave scheme, an equity-settled long term incentive plan LTIP, restricted share awards and deferred share awards.
The net charge for the period relating to employee share-based payment plans was 4m 2012: 24m, all of which related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
a Share option schemes The Sharesave scheme has been in operation since May 2000 and all employees including Executive Directors are eligible once the necessary service requirements have been met.
The scheme allows participants to save up to a maximum of 250 each month for a fixed period of three years.
Options are offered at a discount of 20% to the mid-market closing price on the day prior to the offer and are exercisable for a period of six months commencing after the end of the fixed period of the contract.
The exercise of options under this scheme is only subject to service conditions and is equity-settled.
The scheme launched in May 2011 and is under the new scheme rules, approved by the shareholders in June 2010.
Options which have been granted to those eligible employees, including Directors, who chose to participate in the scheme have been fair valued using a binomial stochastic option pricing model.
The fair value of options granted and the assumptions were as follows: Grant date 14 May 2012 17 May 2011 18 May 2010 14 May 2009 Share price at grant date 2.79 3.01 2.70 2.43 Fair value of options granted 9.12m 11.5m 9.7m 17.4m Exercise price 2.36 2.28 2.37 1.98 Dividend yield 3.69% 3.20% 3.04% 2.38% Annual risk free interest rate 0.53% 1.65% 1.63% 2.10% Expected volatility 19.4% 24.2% 26.5% 28.0% The volatility measured at the standard deviation of expected share price returns is based on statistical analysis on weekly share prices over the past 3.37 years prior to the date of grant.
The requirement that the employee has to save in order to purchase shares under the Sharesave plan is a non-vesting condition.
This feature has been incorporated into the fair value at grant date by applying a discount to the valuation obtained from the binomial stochastic option pricing model using the assumptions disclosed above.
The discount has been determined by estimating the probability that the employee will stop saving based on expected future trends in the share price and employee behaviour.

The awards are free share-based awards, with non-market vesting conditions attached, that accrue the value of dividends over the vesting period.
The maximum total market value of shares over which awards may be granted to any employee during any financial period of the Company is 300% of salary.
Awards normally vest three years after the original grant date, provided the relevant performance criteria have been met.
The fair value at the date of grant, which is being charged to profit for the period over the three year vesting period, has been calculated based on the following assumptions: 15 Oct 13 Apr 1 Oct 18 Apr 14 Oct 22 Apr 29 Jan Grant date 2012 2012 2011 2011 2010 2010 2010 Share price at grant date 2.68 2.93 3.02 2.85 2.96 2.97 2.93 Assumed leavers 5% 5% 5% 5% 8% 8% Performance criteria 65% 65% 77% 77% 80% 80% 90% Fair value of share awards granted 28.1m 1.5m 1.4m 23.3m 1.7m 21.9m 1.1m 2013 2012 Share Share awards awards thousands thousands Movement in outstanding share awards Outstanding at start of period 22,706 19,725 Granted 10,185 8,651 Exercised 6,114 4,258 Forfeited 2,147 1,412 Outstanding at end of period 24,630 22,706 Exercisable at end of period 2013 2012 Share awards outstanding at the end of the period Weighted average remaining contractual life 1.4 years 1.8 years c Restricted share awards As part of the package for certain senior management, restricted share awards may be granted.
These are primarily designed to replace the value of share scheme awards forfeited from the previous employer.
