Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Financial statements Section 2: Segment information Operating segments The Group considers that operating segments presented on a products and services basis are the most appropriate way to demonstrate the performance of the Group.
This is consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Group Chief Executive Officer and the Group Chief Financial Officer, together the chief operating decision maker CODM, and reflects the way in which resources are allocated.
On 8 April 2013, the Group sold the majority of the Delta businesses.
Products that were classified as Data Services prior to 31 December 2012 that were not part of Delta have been reclassified to Marketing Services and Events given their natures.
In addition, the Group sold UBM Channel on 16 September 2013 and Built MS on 31 October 2013.
Accordingly, these operations have been treated as discontinued as detailed in Section 1 and Note 6.4.
The segment results do not include amounts for discontinued operations.
The CODM now considers there to be four operating segments: Events which provide face to face interaction in the form of exhibitions, tradeshows, conferences and other live events: Marketing Services Online which provide website sponsorships and banner advertising as well as online directory and data products: Marketing Services Print which publishes magazines and trade press to specialist markets: and PR Newswire which provides communications products and services to professionals working in marketing, public relations, corporate communications or investor relations roles distributing messages, identifying target audiences and monitoring the impact.
Marketing Services Online and Marketing Services Print have been aggregated to form one reportable segment Other Marketing Services.
The two operating segments have similar economic characteristics and meet the aggregation criteria defined in IFRS 8 Operating segments.
Segment measures The CODM assesses the performance of the operating segments and the allocation of resources using revenue and adjusted operating profit.
Adjusted operating profit is IFRS operating profit excluding amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions, exceptional items and share of tax on results of joint ventures and associates.
Finance income expense and tax are not allocated to operating segments and are reported to the CODM only in aggregate.
Segment assets and liabilities are not reported to the CODM.
Transactions between segments are measured on the basis of prices that would apply to third-party transactions.
