Segmental analysis The Groups operating segments under IFRS 8 have been determined based on management accounts reviewed by the Board.
The performance of operating segments is assessed on profits before interest and tax, excluding equity settled share option charges recognised under IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment and unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses on derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting.
The activities, products and services of the operating segments are detailed in the Directors Report on page 3.
The Property Management segment holds properties and property leases which are sub-let to other segments and external parties.
Segment revenue and segment profit include transactions between business segments which are eliminated on consolidation.

From November 2012, the future accrual of benefits for remaining employee members is based on pensionable earnings at that time, rather than final earnings.
This change gave rise to a one-off accounting gain of 42.1m.
b In June 2012 a second tranche of pensions in payment were subject to a buy-in arrangement.
The Plan paid 23.4m to an insurance company and in return will receive payments equal to those pensions.
This eliminates the Plans exposure to the interest, inflation and longevity risks of those pensions.
The contract also allows for the buy-in to be converted to a buy-out, following which the insurance company would become directly responsible for those pensions, and steps are being taken to proceed on this basis.
Accordingly, the transaction has been accounted for as a settlement, with the 6.3m accounting charge presented in the income statement as an exceptional item.
c During the year the Group sold its last remaining stock from its property development activities for 15.0m which had a book value of 5.9m.
The 9.1m gain is presented as an exceptional item because of its size and non-recurring nature.
d Last year, the Group reached agreement with HM Revenue & Customs for the recovery of overpaid VAT on product sales made during the period from 1973 to 1988.
The total amount recoverable was 9.2m, comprising 3.1m of VAT and interest of 6.1m.
e The Group sold its customer services management business, Ventura, which resulted in an exceptional gain of 38.0m last year.
Net cash proceeds of 63.0m were received on completion and the final balance of 1.5m was received in the current year.

Dilutive shares arise from employee share option schemes where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the period.
Their dilutive effect is calculated on the basis of the equivalent number of nilcost options.
Where the option price is above the average market price, the option is not dilutive and is excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.
There were no such share options in the current year 2012: nil.

The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the following cash generating units: 2013 2012 m m NEXT Sourcing 30.5 30.5 Lipsy 12.0 12.0 42.5 42.5 Goodwill is tested for impairment at the balance sheet date on the basis of value in use.
As this exceeded carrying value for each of the cash generating units concerned, no impairment loss was recognised 2012: nil.
NEXT Sourcing The key assumptions in the calculation are the future sourcing requirements of the Group and the ability of NEXT Sourcing to meet these requirements based on past experience.
In assessing value in use, the most recent financial results and internal budgets for the next year were used and extrapolated for four further years with no subsequent growth assumed, and discounted at 10% 2012: 10%.
Lipsy In assessing the recoverable amount of goodwill and intangibles, the five year business plan for Lipsy was used and cash flows beyond this period extrapolated using a growth rate of 2% 2012: 2%, and discounted at 15% 2012: 15%.
The key assumption is the net contribution margin from sales.
For both NEXT Sourcing and Lipsy, the calculated value in use significantly exceeded the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets and no further sensitivity calculations were necessary to conclude that there was no impairment.

The Group also provides unfunded retirement benefits to plan members whose benefits would otherwise be restricted by the lifetime allowance.
In June 2012, the Plan purchased a second buy-in contract for 23.4m in respect of pensions which had come into payment since the first buy-in in 2010.
The contract allows for the transaction to be converted to a buy-out, following which the insurance company would become directly responsible for the pension payments, and it is intended to proceed on this basis.
Accordingly, the transaction has been accounted for as a settlement and the accounting charge of 6.3m is included in the income statement as an exceptional item.
From November 2012 the future accrual of benefits for remaining employee members is based on pensionable earnings frozen at that time rather than final earnings.
Those employees receive either additional contributions to the defined contribution section or a salary supplement.
This change resulted in an accounting gain in the current year of 42.1m which is included in the income statement as an exceptional item.
The defined contribution section is for all members who joined after 2000, and benefits are based on each individual members personal account.
The Group has also made arrangements for auto-enrolment and contributions commenced in February 2013.

As a substantial majority of pensions in payment are now insured, this year we have adopted separate assumptions for pensioner and non-pensioner liabilities.
Changes in the assumptions for pensioner members covered by insurance which now represent approximately 27% of the gross pension liabilities have a neutral effect on the net IAS 19 balance sheet position.
80 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013 21.
Pension benefits continued The principal actuarial assumptions used in the valuation were as follows: NonPensioners pensioners 2013 2013 2012 Discount rate 4.25% 4.75% 5.00% Salary increases N A Nil 3.10% Inflation RPI 3.30% 3.45% 3.10% Inflation CPI 2.30% 2.45% 2.10% 2013 2012 Life expectancy at age 65 years Pensioner aged 65 male 22.6 22.5 Pensioner aged 65 female 25.0 24.9 Non-pensioner aged 45 male 24.8 24.7 Non-pensioner aged 45 female 27.3 27.2 Expected rate of return on assets Equities N A 6.95% Bonds N A 3.95% Gilts N A 2.65% Property N A 5.55% Insurance contracts N A 5.00% Other N A 2.65% Average N A 5.18% The adoption of IAS 19 revised from the beginning of the 2013 14 financial year means that it is not necessary to set assumptions for expected asset returns as at 26 January 2013.
Expected rates of return on plan assets are based on external historical and forecast market information, and actual rates will most likely vary from those shown above.
The key sensitivity in the calculation is the discount rate.
A decrease of 0.25% in the discount rates used would increase the gross liabilities by approximately 29m, which would be partly mitigated by an increase of approximately 5m on the insurance assets.
Members of the defined benefit section contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings, whilst the Company currently makes contributions at the rate of 17.5%.
The most recent full actuarial valuation was undertaken as at March 2010.
The next full actuarial valuation will be performed as at March 2013 and future funding requirements will be determined taking into account recent plan changes.
Members of the defined contribution section contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings, which is matched by the Company.
Total employer contributions of 24.3m 2012: 13.1m were made during the year, including a special contribution of 11m in respect of the buy-in and 5.4m 2012: 4.2m in respect of the defined contribution section.

Equity settled share-based payments continued Fair value calculation The fair value of management, sharesave and share matching plan options granted is calculated at the date of grant using a BlackScholes option pricing model.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over a period equivalent to the expected life of the option.
The expected life applied in the model is based on historical analyses of exercise patterns, taking into account any early exercises.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for options granted in the years ended 26 January 2013 and 28 January 2012 based on information at the date of grant: Management share options 2013 2012 Weighted average share price at date of grant 29.67 20.70 Weighted average exercise price 29.67 20.70 Volatility 37.9% 41.4% Expected life 4 years 4 years Risk free rate 0.70% 2.37% Dividend yield 2.71% 3.48% Weighted average fair value per option 7.12 5.51 Sharesave plans 2013 2012 Weighted average share price at date of grant 34.44 26.05 Weighted average exercise price 27.56 20.84 Volatility 25.4% 34.4% Expected life 3.3 years 3.3 years Risk free rate 0.46% 0.96% Dividend yield 2.61% 2.99% Weighted average fair value per option 8.04 7.23 Share Matching Plan 2013 2012 Weighted average share price at date of grant 30.32 22.37 Weighted average exercise price Nil Nil Volatility 26.0% 41.4% Expected life 3 years 3 years Risk free rate 0.63% 1.59% Dividend yield 2.97% 3.49% Weighted average fair value per option 27.74 20.15 26.
Shares held by ESOT The NEXT 2003 Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT has an independent professional trustee resident in Jersey and provides for the issue of shares to Group employees, including share issues under share options, at the discretion of the Trustee.

Financial instruments: risk management and hedging activities NEXT operates a centralised treasury function which is responsible for managing the liquidity, interest and foreign currency risks associated with the Groups activities.
As part of its strategy for the management of these risks, the Group uses derivative financial instruments.
In accordance with the Groups treasury policy, derivative instruments are not entered into for speculative purposes.
Treasury policy is reviewed and approved by the Board and specifies the parameters within which treasury operations must be conducted, including authorised counterparties, instrument types and transaction limits, and principles governing the management of liquidity, interest and foreign currency risks.
The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, are cash and short term deposits, bank overdrafts and loans, and corporate bonds.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
In addition, the Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables arising directly from its operations.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its cash and borrowing requirements centrally to minimise net interest expense within risk parameters agreed by the Board, whilst ensuring that the Group has sufficient liquid resources to meet the operating needs of its businesses.
The forecast cash and borrowings profile of the Group is monitored to ensure that adequate headroom remains under committed borrowing facilities.
The table below shows the maturity analysis of the undiscounted remaining contractual cash flows including interest of the Groups financial liabilities: Less than 1 to 2 2 to 5 Over 1 year years years 5 years Total 2013 m m m m m Bank loans and overdrafts 5.4 5.4 Trade and other payables 345.5 2.5 348.0 Finance lease liabilities 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.4 Corporate bonds 120.0 30.0 290.0 394.9 834.9 Other liabilities 83.3 83.3 554.3 32.6 290.2 394.9 1,272.0 Derivatives: net settled 13.0 4.5 11.8 11.3 40.6 Derivatives: gross settled Cash inflows 787.9 50.9 838.8 Cash outflows 772.5 49.3 821.8 Total cash flows 525.9 26.5 278.4 383.6 1,214.4 85 Additional information Parent Company accounts Consolidated accounts Governance Business reports ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 27.

None of this facility was drawn down at 26 January 2013 2012: nil.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its fixed rate corporate bonds and cash flow interest rate risk on floating rate bank loans and overdrafts.
The forecast cash and borrowings profile of the Group is monitored regularly to assess the mix of fixed and variable rate debt, and the Group uses interest rate derivatives where appropriate to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates and the economic environment.
Interest rates: fair value hedges The Group has interest rate swap agreements in place as fair value hedges of part of the interest rate risk associated with the Companys corporate bonds.
Under the terms of the swaps, which have the same key features as the bonds, the Group receives a fixed rate of interest equivalent to the relevant coupon rate, and pays a variable rate.
Details of the effective rates payable are given in Note 20.
The fair values of the Groups interest rate swaps, including accrued interest, are as follows: 2013 2012 m m Derivatives in designated fair value hedging relationships 34.0 31.4 Other interest rate derivatives 4.3 8.8 Total interest rate derivatives 38.3 40.2 Other interest rate derivatives relate to economic hedges of variable rate interest payments due under swaps relating to the 2013 corporate bond which are not able to be hedge accounted for under IAS 39.
The fair values of derivatives have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and are based on market prices at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currency risk The Groups principal foreign currency exposures arise from the purchase of overseas sourced products.
Group policy allows for these exposures to be hedged for up to 24 months ahead in order to fix the cost in Sterling.
This hedging activity involves, inter alia, the use of spot, forward and option contracts.
The market value of outstanding foreign exchange contracts is reported regularly at Board level, and reviewed in conjunction with percentage cover taken by season and current market conditions in order to assess and manage the Groups ongoing exposure.
86 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013 27.
Financial instruments: risk management and hedging activities continued The Group does not have a material exposure to currency movements in relation to translation of overseas investments and consequently does not hedge any such exposure.
The Groups net exposure to foreign currencies, taking hedging activities into account is illustrated by the sensitivity analysis in Note 30.
Foreign currency: cash flow hedges The fair values of foreign exchange derivatives are as follows: 2013 2012 m m Derivatives in designated hedging relationships 8.3 11.5 Other foreign exchange derivatives 1.7 1.6 Total foreign exchange derivatives 10.0 9.9 The total notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts at the balance sheet date is as follows: 2013 2012 m m US Dollar 770.3 727.5 Euro 64.1 90.3 Other 4.4 838.8 817.8 Credit risk Investments of cash surpluses, borrowings and derivative instruments are made through banks and companies which must fulfil credit rating and investment criteria approved by the Board.
Concentrations of risk are mitigated by the use of various counterparties at any one time.
All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and provision is made for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the Directory customer base being large and diverse.
The Groups outstanding receivables balances are detailed in Note 14.
Capital risk The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, as analysed in Note 31, and equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent company, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as shown in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
The Group manages its capital with the objective that all entities within the Group continue as going concerns while maintaining an efficient structure to minimise the cost of capital.
The Group is not restricted by any externally imposed capital requirements.
As part of its strategy for delivering sustainable long term growth in earnings per share, the Group has been returning capital to shareholders by way of share buybacks in addition to dividends.
Share buybacks are transacted through both on-market purchases and contingent contracts for off-market share purchases.

Financial instruments: sensitivity analysis Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Groups principal foreign currency exposures are to US Dollars and the Euro.
The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and closing equity to a 10% increase and decrease in the US Dollar Sterling and Euro Sterling exchange rates at the year end date, assuming all other variables remain unchanged.
The sensitivity rate of 10% represents the directors assessment of a reasonably possible change, based on historic volatility.
The analysis assumes that exchange rate fluctuations on currency derivatives that form part of an effective cash flow hedge relationship affect the fair value reserve in equity and the fair value of the hedging derivatives.
For foreign exchange derivatives which are not designated hedges, movements in exchange rates impact the income statement.
Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity.
Strengthening and weakening of Sterling may not produce symmetrical results depending on the proportion and nature of foreign exchange derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and closing equity to a 0.5% increase or decrease in interest rates, assuming all other variables were unchanged.
The sensitivity rate of 0.5% represents the directors assessment of a reasonably possible change, based on historic volatility.
The analysis has been prepared using the following assumptions: For floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is assumed to have been outstanding for the whole year.
Fixed rate financial instruments that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk for the purpose of this analysis.

These non-cancellable leases have remaining terms of between 1 month and approximately 20 years.
Contingent rentals are payable on certain retail store leases based on store revenues.
The majority of the Groups operating leases provide for their renewal by mutual agreement at the expiry of the lease term.
