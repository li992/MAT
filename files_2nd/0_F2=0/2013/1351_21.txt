a TraDE rECEivablES: CrEDiT riSk The Groups exposure to the credit risk inherent in its trade receivables and the associated risk management techniques that the Group deploys in order to mitigate this risk are discussed in note 23.
The credit periods offered to customers vary according to the credit risk profiles of, and the invoicing conventions established in, the Groups markets.
The contractual terms on invoices issued to customers vary between the US and the UK in that, invoices issued by A-Plant are payable within 30-60 days whereas, invoices issued by Sunbelt are payable on receipt.
Therefore, on this basis, a significant proportion of the Groups trade receivables are contractually past due.
The allowance for bad and doubtful receivables is calculated based on prior experience reflecting the level of uncollected receivables over the last year within each business.
Accordingly, this cannot be attributed to specific receivables so the aged analysis of trade receivables, including those past due, is shown gross of the allowance for bad and doubtful receivables.

The growth rate assumptions used in the plans reflect managements expectations of market developments and take account of past performance.
The valuation uses an annual growth rate to determine the cash flows beyond the three-year period of 2%, which does not exceed the average long-term growth rates for the relevant markets, and a terminal value reflective of market multiples.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the projected cash flows is 10.5% 2012: 9.5%.
The impairment review is sensitive to a change in key assumptions used, most notably the discount rate and the annuity growth rates.
A sensitivity analysis has been undertaken by changing the key assumptions used for both Sunbelt and A-Plant.
Based on this sensitivity analysis, no reasonably possible change in the assumptions resulted in the recoverable amount of the Sunbelt CGU being reduced to the carrying value.
The A-Plant CGU has headroom of 21m at the reporting date.
An increase in the discount rate of 10.5% by 1% or a decrease in the annuity growth rate from 2% to 1% would reduce the recoverable amount of the CGU to its carrying value.

firST prioriTy SENior SECurED CrEDiT faCiliTy At 30 April 2013, $1.8bn was committed by our senior lenders under the asset-based senior secured revolving credit facility ABL facility until March 2016 while the amount utilised was $1,161m including letters of credit totalling $37m.
The ABL facility is secured by a first priority interest in substantially all of the Groups assets.
Pricing for the revolving credit facility is based on the ratio of funded debt to EBITDA before exceptional items according to a grid which varies, depending on leverage, from LIBOR plus 200bp to LIBOR plus 250bp.
At 30 April 2013 the Groups borrowing rate was LIBOR plus 200bp.
There are two financial performance covenants under the asset-based first priority senior bank facility: funded debt to LTM EBITDA before exceptional items not to exceed 4.0 times: and a fixed charge ratio comprising LTM EBITDA before exceptional items less LTM net capital expenditure paid in cash over the sum of scheduled debt repayments plus cash interest, cash tax payments and dividends paid in the last twelve months which must be equal to, or greater than, 1.1 times.
These covenants do not, however, apply when excess availability the difference between the borrowing base and net facility utilisation exceeds $216m.
At 30 April 2013 availability under the bank facility was $667m $516m at 30 April 2012, with an additional $262m of suppressed availability meaning that covenants were not measured at 30 April 2013 and are unlikely to be measured in forthcoming quarters.
However, as a matter of good practice, we still calculate the covenant ratios each quarter.
At 30 April 2013, as a result of the significant investment in our rental fleet, the fixed charge ratio, as expected, did not meet the covenant requirement whilst the leverage ratio did so comfortably.
The fact the fixed charge ratio is below 1.1 times does not cause concern given the strong availability and managements ability to flex capital expenditure downwards at short notice.
Accordingly, the accounts are prepared on a going concern basis.

The notes are secured by second priority interests over substantially the same assets as the ABL facility and are also guaranteed by Ashtead Group plc.
Under the terms of the 6.5% notes the Group is, subject to important exceptions, restricted in its ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends, make investments, sell assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and merge or consolidate with another company.

It holds a beneficial interest in 2,784,242 ordinary shares of the Company acquired at an average cost of 265.9p per share.
The shares had a market value of 16.4m at 30 April 2013.
The ESOT has waived the right to receive dividends on the shares it holds.
The costs of operating the ESOT are borne by the Group but are not significant.
Details of the PSP are given on pages 44, 49 and 50.
The costs of this scheme are charged to the income statement over the vesting period, based on the fair value of the award at the grant date and the likelihood of allocations vesting under the scheme.
In 2013, there was a net charge to pre-tax profit in respect of the PSP of 2.7m 2012: 2.5m.
After deferred tax, the total charge was 1.9m 2012: 2.0m.
The fair value of awards granted during the year is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: share price at grant date of 328p, nil exercise price, a dividend yield of 1.07%, volatility of 58.0%, a risk-free rate of 0.32% and an expected life of three years.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility over the previous three years.
The expected life used in the model is based on the terms of the plan.

22 pensions The Group operates pension plans for the benefit of qualifying employees.
The major plans for new employees throughout the Group are all defined contribution plans following the introduction of the stakeholder pension plan for UK employees in May 2002.
Pension costs for defined contribution plans were 5.4m 2012: 5.1m.
The Group also has a defined benefit plan for UK employees which was closed to new members in 2001.
This plan is a funded defined benefit plan with trustee administered assets held separately from those of the Group.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 30 April 2010 and updated to 30 April 2013 by a qualified independent actuary.
The actuary is engaged by the Company to perform a valuation in accordance with IAS 19.

23 financial risk management The Groups trading and financing activities expose it to various financial risks that, if left unmanaged, could adversely impact on current or future earnings.
Although not necessarily mutually exclusive, these financial risks are categorised separately according to their different generic risk characteristics and include market risk foreign currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
It is the role of the Group treasury function to manage and monitor the Groups financial risks and internal and external funding requirements in support of the Groups corporate objectives.
Treasury activities are governed by policies and procedures approved by the Board and monitored by the Finance and Administration Committee.
In particular, the Board of directors or, through delegated authority, the Finance and Administration Committee, approves any derivative transactions.
Derivative transactions are only undertaken for the purposes of managing interest rate risk and currency risk.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
The Group maintains treasury control systems and procedures to monitor liquidity, currency, credit and financial risks.
The Group reports and pays dividends in pounds sterling.
MarkET riSk The Groups activities expose it primarily to interest rate and currency risk.
Interest rate risk is monitored on a continuous basis and managed, where appropriate, through the use of interest rate swaps whereas, the use of forward foreign exchange contracts to manage currency risk is considered on an individual non-trading transaction basis.
The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk or equity price risk as defined in IFRS 7. interest rate risk Management of fixed and variable rate debt The Group has fixed and variable rate debt in issue with 31% of the drawn debt at a fixed rate as at 30 April 2013.
The Groups accounting policy requires all borrowings to be held at amortised cost.
As a result the carrying value of fixed rate debt is unaffected by changes in credit conditions in the debt markets and there is therefore no exposure to fair value interest rate risk.
The Groups debt that bears interest at a variable rate comprises all outstanding borrowings under the senior secured credit facility.
The interest rates currently applicable to this variable rate debt are LIBOR as applicable to the currency borrowed US dollars or pounds plus 200bp.
The Group periodically utilises interest rate swap agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates.
However, during the year ended and as at 30 April 2013, the Group had no such swap agreements outstanding.
The Group also may at times hold cash and cash equivalents which earn interest at a variable rate.
Net variable rate debt sensitivity At 30 April 2013, based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding, the Groups pre-tax profits would change by approximately 7m for each one percentage point change in interest rates applicable to the variable rate debt and, after tax effects, equity would change by approximately 4m.
The amount of the Groups variable rate debt may fluctuate as a result of changes in the amount of debt outstanding under the senior secured credit facility.
78 ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 Currency exchange risk Currency exchange risk is limited to translation risk as there are no transactions in the ordinary course of business that take place between foreign entities.
The Groups reporting currency is the pound sterling.
However, the majority of our assets, liabilities, revenue and costs is denominated in US dollars.
The Group has arranged its financing such that, at 30 April 2013, virtually all of its debt was denominated in US dollars so that there is a natural partial offset between its dollar-denominated net assets and earnings and its dollar-denominated debt and interest expense.
At 30 April 2013, dollar-denominated debt represented approximately 71% of the value of dollar-denominated net assets other than debt.
The Groups exposure to exchange rate movements on trading transactions is relatively limited.
All Group companies invoice revenue in their respective local currency and generally incur expense and purchase assets in their local currency.
Consequently, the Group does not routinely hedge either forecast foreign exchange exposures or the impact of exchange rate movements on the translation of overseas profits into sterling.
Where the Group does hedge, it maintains appropriate hedging documentation.
Foreign exchange risk on significant non-trading transactions e. g. acquisitions is considered on an individual basis.
Resultant impacts of reasonably possible changes to foreign exchange rates Based upon the level of US operations and of the US dollar-denominated debt balance and US interest rates at 30 April 2013, a 1% change in the US dollar-pound exchange rate would have impacted our pre-tax profits by approximately 2m and equity by approximately 6m.
At 30 April 2013, the Group had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts.
CrEDiT riSk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and bank balances and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is presented in the following table: 2013 2012 m m Cash and cash equivalents 20.3 23.4 Trade and other receivables 218.6 178.0 238.9 201.4 Substantially all of the Groups cash and cash equivalents at 30 April 2013 are deposited with a large UK-based financial institution which is not expected to fail.
The Group has a large number of unrelated customers, serving almost 500,000 during the financial year, and does not have any significant credit exposure to any particular customer.
Each business segment manages its own exposure to credit risk according to the economic circumstances and characteristics of the markets they serve.
The Group believes that management of credit risk on a devolved basis enables it to assess and manage it more effectively.
However, broad principles of credit risk management practice are observed across the Group, such as the use of credit reference agencies and the maintenance of credit control functions.
liquiDiTy riSk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group could experience difficulties in meeting its commitments to creditors as financial liabilities fall due for payment.
The Group generates significant free cash flow defined as cash flow from operations less replacement capital expenditure net of proceeds of asset disposals, interest paid and tax paid.
This free cash flow is available to the Group to invest in growth capital expenditure, acquisitions and dividend payments or to reduce debt.
In addition to the strong free cash flow from normal trading activities, additional liquidity is available through the Groups ABL facility.
At 30 April 2013, excess availability under the $1.8bn facility was $667m 429m.
Contractual maturity analysis Trade receivables, the principal class of non-derivative financial asset held by the Group, are settled gross by customers.
The following table presents the Groups outstanding contractual maturity profile for its non-derivative financial liabilities, excluding trade and other payables which fall due within one year.
The analysis presented is based on the undiscounted contractual maturities of the Groups financial liabilities, including any interest that will accrue, except where the Group is entitled and intends to repay a financial liability, or part of a financial liability, before its contractual maturity.
