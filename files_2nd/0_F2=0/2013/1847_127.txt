Inventories Group 2013 2012 m m Land held for development 2,127.0 2,077.3 Construction work in progress 1,001.9 1,065.5 Part-exchange properties 79.0 80.2 Other inventories 1.9 3.6 3,209.8 3,226.6 a Nature of inventories The Directors consider all inventories to be essentially current in nature, although the Groups operational cycle is such that a proportion of inventories will not be realised within twelve months.
It is not possible to determine with accuracy when speci c inventory will be realised as this will be subject to a number of variables such as consumer demand and planning permission delays.
b Impairment of inventories At 30 June 2013, the Group reviewed the net realisable value of its land and work in progress carrying values of its sites.
The impairment review compared the estimated future net present realisable value of development sites with their balance sheet carrying value.
During the year, due to performance variations upon individual housebuilding sites, there were gross impairment charges of 34.8m 2012: 44.8m and gross impairment reversals of 22.5m 2012: 31.5m resulting in a net inventory impairment of 12.3m 2012: 13.3m included within pro t from operations.
There was also a gross impairment charge of 0.6m 2012: 3.3m and a gross impairment reversal of 0.1m 2012: 3.3m for the commercial developments business, resulting in a net inventory impairment of 0.5m 2012: nil, due to performance variations upon individual commercial sites.
The key judgements in these reviews were estimating the realisable value of a site which is determined by forecast sales rates, expected sales prices and estimated costs to complete.
Sales prices were estimated on a site-by-site basis based upon local market conditions and took into account the current prices being achieved upon each site for each product type.
In addition, the estimation of future sales prices included an allowance on a site-by-site basis for low single-digit sales price in ation in future periods.
The estimation of costs to complete also included an allowance for low single-digit build cost in ation in future periods.
Further information regarding these judgements is included within the Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty section on page 99.
During the year, the Group has experienced stable market conditions in the first three quarters of the financial year and signs of sustainable improvement in the final quarter.
If the UK housing market were to change beyond management expectations in the future, in particular with regards to the assumptions around likely sales prices and estimated costs to complete, further adjustments to the carrying value of land and work in progress may be required.
Following these impairments, 325.7m 2012: 607.5m of inventories are valued at fair value less costs to sell rather than at historical cost.
c Expensed inventories The value of inventories expensed in the year ended 30 June 2013 and included in cost of sales was 2,139.3m 2012: 1,900.5m including the inventory impairments.
d Company The Company has no inventories.
