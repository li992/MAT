The Group incurred 14.7m of exceptional operating charges in 2012 as a result of the programme to integrate BSS colleagues, systems and processes into the Group.
In 2012, the Group released 6.0m through operating profit as an exceptional item for onerous lease provisions that were no longer required because properties had been sublet.
In 2012, the Group recognised 35.3m of exceptional fair value gains in investment income when the requirements of IFRS 3 2008 Business Combinations were applied to the investments held in Toolstation.
This acquisition resulted in the Groups existing 30% associate interest being remeasured to its fair value at the acquisition date.

e. Prior period restatement IAS 19 revised 2011 and the related consequential amendments have impacted the accounting for the Groups defined benefit schemes, by replacing the combined interest cost on liabilities and expected return on plan assets with a net interest charge on the net defined benefit liability.
Prior year comparatives have been restated with an increase in the net finance cost of 13.2m in the year ended 31 December 2012.
Administration expenses for the schemes, totalling 0.9m, have been deducted from operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2012 and actuarial losses in the statement of other comprehensive income have been reduced by 14.1m for the same period.
The combined net deficit of the schemes at 31 December is unaffected.
There is no impact on cash flows.
Following recent guidance from the FRRP regarding the treatment of a schedule of contributions in relation to a minimum funding requirement under IFRIC 14, the Group has reconsidered the appropriate accounting treatment for its pension fund obligations.
In respect of the Travis Perkins defined benefit pension scheme the pension obligation in the balance sheet has been restated at 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2012 with consequent adjustments to deferred tax.
For the BSS scheme, no restatement is required however the 31 December 2013 closing balance sheet position is impacted.
Details of the liabilities arising in respect of minimum funding requirements are set out in note 28.
