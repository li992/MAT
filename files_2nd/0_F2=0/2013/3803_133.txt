The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts, cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps to hedge the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
As explained in section Q of the Groups accounting policies, such derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date, and are re-measured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
For derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the income statement in the period.
