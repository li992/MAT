the carrying value of goodwill and brands that are considered to have an indefinite life are allocated to the groups operating segments before aggregation.
with the exception of everlast, none of the individual cash-generating units cgus are considered material to goodwill or indefinite life intangibles brands.
the carrying value of goodwill and brands allocated to the groups cgus, as aggregated except in the case of everlast, is shown below: Goodwill Brands 000 000 uk sports retail 9,051 8,500 lifestyle & other 13,288 - international retail 6,747 - brands excl.
everlast 46,281 2,437 everlast 54,438 70,054 129,805 80,991 the group tests the carrying amount of goodwill and assets with an indefinite life annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that their carrying value might be impaired.
the carrying amounts of other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if there is an indication of impairment.
impairment is calculated by comparing the carrying amounts to the value in use derived from discounted cash flow projections for each cgu to which the intangible assets are allocated.
a cgu is deemed to be an individual fascia, these have been grouped together into similar classes for the purpose of formulating operating segments as reported in note 4. value in use calculations are based on 5 year management forecasts with a terminal growth rate applied thereafter, representing managements estimate of the long term growth rate of the sector served by the cgus.
the business review management & governance Financial Statements & Notes additional information 75 the key assumptions, which are equally applicable to each cgu, in the cash flow projections used to support the carrying amount of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives as at 28 april 2013 were as follows: UK Sport Lifestyle & International Brands excl.

a reasonably possible change in any key assumption would not cause the carrying value of any cgu to exceed its recoverable amount.
the intangible assets that have an indefinite life are brands and trading names and are considered to have an indefinite life on the grounds of the proven longevity of the brands and trading names and the groups commitment to maintaining those brands.
all key assumptions are consistent with known external sources of information.

there are no significant restrictions on the ability of associated undertakings to transfer funds to the parent, other than those imposed by legal requirements.
as stated in the groups accounting policies the directors review the carrying amounts of the groups fixed assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
if any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any.
recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
in assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to these assets.
indicators of impairment exist for certain of the freehold properties held within our associate.
accordingly an impairment review has been performed in accordance with the above policy.
value in use calculations have been prepared based on 5 year management forecasts with a terminal growth rate of 2% applied thereafter, representing managements estimate of the long term growth rate of the sector served by these assets.
these cash flows have been discounted at a risk adjusted pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of 11.9%.

a number of employees sold their shares upon vesting to the sports direct international plc employee benefit trust.
the 2009 bonus share scheme has been accounted for as an equity settled share scheme.
this has been decided based on the following: the rules of the scheme are that the awards will be settled in equity and this has not changed: upon vesting the company entered into a separate contract with the employees to buy their shares although the company only facilitated the sale of shares on behalf of employees: the company only communicated to the employees that the company would arrange the sale of the shares, and not that the company would buy the shares: the employee does not have a choice of settlement under the scheme rules: upon vesting the default settlement option if an employee failed to notify the company was to receive the shares: and there is no obligation on the group to buy the shares upon future vesting of the share schemes.

the business review management & governance Financial Statements & Notes additional information 85 Fair value hierarchy the group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: and level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
as at 28 april 2013, the only financial instruments were derivative financial assets and liabilities, which are classified as level 2, and available-for-sale financial assets, which are classified as level 1. b Derivatives: foreign currency forward purchase contracts the most significant exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations relates to purchases made in foreign currencies, principally the us dollar.
the groups policy is to reduce substantially the risk associated with foreign currency spot rates by using forward fixed rate currency purchase contracts, taking into account any foreign currency cash flows.
the group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes, however if derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting they are accounted for as such and accordingly any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
the carrying values of forward foreign currency purchase contracts were as follows: 28 April 2013 000 29 April 2012 000 fair value of derivative financial instruments - assets 17,965 4,356 the sterling principal amounts of forward foreign currency purchase contracts and contracted forward rates were as follows: 28 April 2013 000 29 April 2012 000 us dollar purchases 285,000 371,986 contracted rates 1.63 1.61-1.65 us dollar sales - 40,000 contracted rates - 1.53-1.54 euro sales 44,031 24,678 contracted rates 1.13-1.14 1.13-1.14 at 28 april 2013 285m of forward us dollar purchase contracts qualified for hedge accounting and the profit on fair valuation of these contracts of 15.6m has therefore been recognised in other comprehensive income.
this amount is split between a profit of 15.4m recognised in the period, a gain of 2.5m reclassified and reported in net profit and a loss of 2.3m recognised in inventories.
forward foreign currency purchase and sale contracts generally have a maturity at inception of approximately 12 months.
at 28 april 2013 nil of purchase contracts and nil of sale contracts had a maturity at inception of greater than 12 months 2012: 60 million of purchase contracts and 3.5m of sale contracts.
c Sensitivity analysis Foreign currency sensitivity analysis the groups principal foreign currency exposures are to us dollars and the euro.
the table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the groups reported profit and equity to a 5% increase and decrease in the us dollar sterling and euro sterling exchange rates at the year end date, assuming all other variables remain unchanged.
the figures have been calculated by comparing the fair values of outstanding foreign currency contracts at the current exchange rate to those if exchange rates moved as illustrated.
the income statement figures include the profit effect of any relevant derivatives which are not in a designated cash flow hedge.
the impact on us dollar related hedging instruments is included in equity.
positive figures represent an increase decrease in profit or equity: Income statement Equity 28 April 2013 000 29 April 2012 000 28 April 2013 000 29 April 2012 000 sterling strengthens by 5% us dollar 1 810 1,783 4,284 euro 34 559 34 559 sterling weakens by 5% us dollar 702 851 1,872 4,498 euro 35 587 35 587 Sports Direct plc Annual Report 2013 86 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the 52 weeks ended 28 april 2013 27.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Interest rate sensitivity analysis the table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the groups reported profit and equity to a 0.5% increase or decrease in interest rates, assuming all other variables were unchanged.
the analysis has been prepared using the following assumptions: for floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is assumed to have been outstanding for the whole year.
fixed rate financial instruments that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk for the purpose of this analysis.
positive figures represent a decrease increase in profit or equity: Income statement Equity 28 April 2013 000 29 April 2012 000 28 April 2013 000 29 April 2012 000 interest rate increase of 0.5% 1,507 1,119 1,507 1,119 interest rate decrease of 0.5% 1,507 1,119 1,507 1,119 d Liquidity risk the table below shows the maturity analysis of the undiscounted remaining contractual cash flows of the groups financial liabilities: Less than 1 year 1 to 2 years 2 to 5 years Over 5 years Total 000 000 000 000 000 2013 bank loans and overdrafts 50,450 102 250,228 2,256 303,036 obligations under finance leases - 1 1 - 2 trade and other payables 169,976 - - - 169,976 derivative financial liabilities cash inflows 344,439 - - - 344,439 cash outflows 327,087 - - - 327,087 203,074 103 250,229 2,256 455,662 2012 bank loans and overdrafts 9,290 220,168 - - 229,458 obligations under finance leases 13 541 284 29 867 trade and other payables 155,468 - - - 155,468 derivative financial liabilities cash inflows 418,502 - - - 418,502 cash outflows 415,637 - - - 415,637 161,906 220,709 284 29 382,928 Capital management the capital structure of the group consists of equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent, compromising issued share capital, share premium and retained earnings and cash and borrowings.
it is the groups policy to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain the development of the business.
in respect of equity, the board have decided that, in order to maximise flexibility in the near term with regards to a number of inorganic growth opportunities under review, not to return any cash by way of a dividend at this time.
the board is committed to keeping this policy under constant review and that it would look to evaluate alternative methods of returning cash to shareholders when appropriate.
the objective of the bonus share scheme is to encourage employee share ownership and to link employees remuneration to the performance of the company.
it is not designed as a means of managing capital.
in respect of cash and borrowings the board regularly monitors the ratio of net debt to underlying ebitda, the working capital requirements and forecasted cash flows however no minimum or maximum ratios are set.
the ratio for net debt to reported underlying ebitda, excluding charges for the bonus share schemes, is 0.58 2012:0.68. the objective is to keep this figure below 2.0. based on this analysis, the board determines the appropriate return to equity holders whilst ensuring sufficient capital is retained within the group to meet its strategic objectives, including but not limited to, acquisition opportunities.
