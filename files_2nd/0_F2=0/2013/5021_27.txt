Notes to the annual financial statements For the 52 weeks ended 29 June 2013 1Segmental reporting The Group has one reportable segment, retail of homewares in the UK.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Board of Directors of Dunelm Group plc.
Internal management reports are reviewed by them on a monthly basis.
Performance of the segment is assessed based on a number of financial and non-financial KPIs as well as on profit before taxation.
Management believe that these measures are the most relevant in evaluating the performance of the segment and for making resource allocation decisions.
All material operations of the reportable segment are carried out in the UK.
The Groups revenue is driven by the consolidation of individual small value transactions and as a result Group revenue is not reliant on a major customer or group of customers.

8Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the period.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive Potential Ordinary Shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys Ordinary Shares during the period.

16 Interest bearing loans and borrowings The Group maintains a 10m overdraft facility.
Interest is payable on funds utilised under the facility at the rate of 1.5% above the banks base rate.
17 Financial risk management The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
A formal process for reviewing and managing risk in the business has been developed.
A register of strategic and operational risks is maintained and reviewed quarterly by the Board, who also monitor the status of agreed actions to mitigate key risks.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Groups foreign exchange hedging agreements with its banking counterparties.
The Group only deals with creditworthy counterparties and uses publicly available financial information to rate its counterparties.
As the principal business of the Group is retail related, trade receivables consist of a relatively small number of customers, which tend to be charity or local authority based.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and extreme circumstances.
The Group manages this risk by continuously monitoring cash flow forecasts.
The Groups available facilities can be found in note 16.
Group policy is that surplus funds are placed on deposit with counterparties approved by the Board, with a minimum of A credit rating.
Credit limits with approved counterparties are limited to 25m for any individual party.
78 Dunelm Group plcAnnual report and accounts 2013 Business overview Business review Governance Financial statements Company information 17 Financial risk management continued Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Groupsincome.
Interest rate risk The Groups bank borrowings incur variable interest rate charges linked to LIBOR and Barclays Bank Base Rate.
The Directors do not consider that future changes in interest rates are likely to cause a material direct impact on profitability.
The Groups exposure to interest rates on financial assets and liabilities is detailed in note 16.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on purchases denominated in US dollars.
These amounted to approximately 16% of the total stock purchases in the year ended 29 June 2013.
The outstanding US dollar liabilities at the year end were $525,000 2012:$256,000 and payments on account were $6,234,000 2012: $6,227,000.
During the year the Group entered into exchange rate swaps for $65.7m to sell sterling and buy US dollars.
These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
During the year the net mark to market profit on foreign currency hedging instruments taken to equity was 0.3m 2012: 0.3m.
At the balance sheet date the Group had16 swap contracts outstanding with a maximum value of $45.9m.
All of the Groups revenues are in sterling.
Purchases of promotional goods are generally in US dollars.
Purchase of regular range goods are generally in sterling, although some lines are now being imported directly and paid for in US dollars.
We cover exchange rate exposure on expected promotional product purchases up to a maximum of 100% of forecast purchases over a four month horizon.
We cover exchange rate exposure on expected regular range purchases up to a maximum of 50% of forecast purchases over a 12 month horizon.
We use various means to cover the above currency exposures: hold excess funds in US dollars, take out forward contracts for the purchase of US dollars, enter into forward rate options.
In the event of a significant adverse movement in the US dollar exchange rate, the Group would seek to minimise the impact on profitability by changing the selling price of goods.
Sensitivity analysis The Groups principal foreign currency exposure is to the US dollar.
The Directors believe that an increase or decrease of 10% in the US dollar to sterling exchange rates would not have a material effect on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The US dollar year end exchange rate applied in the above analysis is 1.5239 2012: 1.5617.
Strengthening and weakening of sterling may not produce symmetrical results depending on the proportion and nature of foreign exchange derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Fair values The fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities is not materially different from their carrying value.
The fair value of foreign currency contracts are sums required by the counterparties to cancel the contracts at the end of the year.
Fair value hierarchy Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels: Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All financial instruments carried at fair value have been measured by a Level 2 valuation method.
Gains on cash flow hedges during the year amounted to 387,000 2012: gain 476,000.
Capital management The Company manages its equity as capital.
The Boards objective with respect to capital management is to ensure the Group continues as a going concern in order to optimise returns to shareholders.
The Boards policy is to retain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development.
The Board regularly monitors the level of capital in the Group to ensure that this can be achieved.
From time to time the Group purchases its own shares on the market.
The shares are intended to be used for issuing shares under the Groups share option programmes.
The Board has authorised a share purchase programme designed to ensure that all options expected to vest under share option schemes can be fulfilled out of treasury shares.
