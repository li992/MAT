2011 12 greenhouse gas emissions data has been restated using the 2013 conversion factors.
Transmission and distribution losses are reported as Scope 3 emissions.
Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as metric tonnes CO e t CO e and greenhouse gas intensity is reported 2 2 as kilogrammes of CO equivalent kg CO e. Greenhouse gas emissions from Germany electricity consumption and transmission and 2 2 distribution are reported in carbon dioxide CO only per the UK Governments Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2013.
2 Germany Scope 1 emissions use the emissions factors based on UK natural gas calculations, as the greenhouse gas content of natural gas varies only marginally over time and between regions.
Scope 3 emissions are for transmission and distribution losses associated with purchased electricity only and do not include business travel or supply chain emissions.
For more information on our scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions please refer to our mandatory greenhouse gas statement.
