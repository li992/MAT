64 Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2013 General information John Wood Group PLC, its subsidiaries and joint ventures, provide services to the oil and gas and power generation industries worldwide.
Details of the Groups activities during the year are provided in the Strategic Report.
John Wood Group PLC is a public limited company, incorporated and domiciled in Scotland and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and IFRIC interpretations adopted by the European Union EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Group financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through the income statement.
Significant accounting policies The Groups significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements are the result of the consolidation of the financial statements of the Groups subsidiary undertakings from the date of acquisition or up until the date of divestment as appropriate.
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies and generally accompanies a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
The Groups interests in joint ventures are accounted for using proportional consolidation.
Under this method the Group includes its share of each joint ventures income, expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows on a line by line basis in the consolidated financial statements.
Transactions between Group subsidiaries are eliminated and transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the joint venture.
All Group companies apply the Groups accounting policies and prepare financial statements to 31 December.
At 31 December 2013, certain Wood Group GTS assets and liabilities that are being transferred into a new joint venture with Siemens, which is currently anticipated to take place in the first half of 2014, have been shown as assets and liabilities held for sale in the Group balance sheet.
Assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost and fair value.
The 2012 and 2013 trading activity for the relevant entities has been presented as profit from discontinued activities in the Group income statement, the 2012 income statement having been restated accordingly.
See note 27 for further details.
Critical accounting judgments and estimates The preparation of the financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the year.
These estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions and actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The estimates and assumptions that could result in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are addressed below.
a Impairment of goodwill The Group carries out impairment reviews whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable.
In addition, the Group carries out an annual impairment review.
An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable amount of goodwill is less than the carrying amount.
The impairment tests are carried out by CGU Cash Generating Unit and reflect the latest Group budgets.
The budgets are based on various assumptions relating to the Groups businesses including assumptions relating to market outlook, resource utilisation, foreign exchange rates, contract awards and contract margins.
The outlook for the Group is discussed in the CEO Review.
Pre-tax discount rates of between 11% and 13% have been used to discount the CGU cash flows and a sensitivity analysis has also been performed see note 8. b Revenue recognition Revenue on fixed price or lump sum contracts for services, construction contracts and fixed price long-term service agreements is recognised according to the stage of completion reached in the contract by measuring the proportion of costs incurred for work performed to total estimated costs.
Estimating the costs to completion and therefore the total contract costs is a key judgment in respect of the revenue recognition on these contracts.
c Income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
Judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due.
Where the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.
d Retirement benefit liabilities The value of the Groups retirement benefit liabilities is determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions.
Changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying value of the liability.
The Group determines the appropriate discount rate to be used in the actuarial valuation at the end of each financial year following consultation with the retirement benefit scheme actuary.
In determining the rate used, consideration is given to the interest rates of high quality corporate bonds in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity similar to those of the related retirement benefit obligation.
See note 29 for further details.
e Provisions The Group records provisions where it has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made.
Where the outcome is less than probable, but more than remote, no provision is recorded but a contingent liability is disclosed in the financial statements, if material.
The recording of provisions is an area which requires the exercise of management judgement relating to the nature, timing and probability of the liability and typically the Groups balance sheet includes provisions for doubtful debts, inventory and warranty provisions, contract provisions including onerous contracts and pending legal issues.
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Our business Strategic report Risks and uncertainties Governance Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 65 Accounting policies continued Functional currency The Groups earnings stream is primarily US dollars and the principal functional currency is the US dollar, being the most representative currency of the Group.
The Groups financial statements are therefore prepared in US dollars.
The following exchange rates have been used in the preparation of these accounts: 2013 2012 Average rate 1 $ 1.5673 1.5845 Closing rate 1 $ 1.6563 1.6255 Foreign currencies Income statements of entities whose functional currency is not the US dollar are translated into US dollars at average rates of exchange for the period and assets and liabilities are translated into US dollars at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on translation of net assets in such entities held at the beginning of the year, together with those differences resulting from the restatement of profits and losses from average to year end rates, are taken to the currency translation reserve.
In each individual entity, transactions in overseas currencies are translated into the relevant functional currency at the exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction.
Where more than one exchange rate is available, the appropriate rate at which assets can be readily realised and liabilities can be extinguished is used.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Any exchange differences are taken to the income statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
The directors consider it appropriate to record sterling denominated equity share capital in the accounts of John Wood Group PLC at the exchange rate ruling on the date it was raised.
Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the Groups activities.
Revenue is recognised only when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with a transaction will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Revenue from services is recognised as the services are rendered, including where they are based on contractual rates per man hour in respect of multi-year service contracts.
Incentive performance revenue is recognised upon completion of agreed objectives.
Revenue from product sales is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, which is normally upon delivery of products and customer acceptance, if any.
Revenue is stated net of sales taxes such as VAT and discounts.
Revenue on fixed price or lump sum contracts for services, construction contracts and fixed price long-term service agreements is recognised according to the stage of completion reached in the contract by measuring the proportion of costs incurred for work performed to total estimated costs.
An estimate of the profit attributable to work completed is recognised, on a basis that the directors consider to be appropriate, once the outcome of the contract can be estimated reliably, which is when a contract is not less than 20% complete.
Expected losses are recognised in full as soon as losses are probable.
The net amount of costs incurred to date plus recognised profits less the sum of recognised losses and progress billings is disclosed within trade receivables trade payables.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are those significant items which are separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Groups financial performance.
Transactions which may give rise to exceptional items include gains and losses on divestment of businesses, write downs or impairments of assets including goodwill, restructuring costs or provisions, litigation settlements, provisions for onerous contracts and acquisition and divestment costs.
Finance expense income Interest income and expense is recorded in the income statement in the period to which it relates.
Arrangement fees in respect of the Groups borrowing facilities are amortised over the period which the Group expects the facility to be in place.
Interest relating to the unwinding of the discount on deferred and contingent consideration liabilities is included in finance expense.
Interest relating to the Groups retirement benefit scheme is also included as finance income expense.
Dividends Dividends to the Groups shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Goodwill The Group uses the purchase method of accounting to account for acquisitions.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Acquisition costs are expensed in the income statement.
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Notes to the financial statements continued 66 Accounting policies continued Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Intangible assets are recognised if it is probable that there will be future economic benefits attributable to the asset, the cost of the asset can be measured reliably, the asset is separately identifiable and there is control over the use of the asset.
Where the Group acquires a business, intangible assets on acquisition such as customer contracts are identified and evaluated to determine the carrying value on the acquisition balance sheet.
Intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Software and development costs 3-5 years Intangible assets on acquisition 3-10 years Property plant and equipment Property plant and equipment PP&E is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.
No depreciation is charged with respect to freehold land and assets in the course of construction.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives of the assets: Freehold and long leasehold buildings 25-50 years Short leasehold buildings period of lease Plant and equipment 3-10 years When estimating the useful life of an asset group, the principal factors the Group takes into account are the durability of the assets, the intensity at which the assets are expected to be used and the expected rate of technological developments.
Asset lives and residual values are assessed at each balance sheet date.
Impairment The Group performs impairment reviews in respect of PP&E and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
In addition, the Group carries out annual impairment reviews in respect of goodwill.
An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable amount of an asset, which is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, is less than its carrying amount.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the appropriate cash generating unit CGU.
The CGUs are aligned to the structure the Group uses to manage its business.
Cash flows are discounted in determining the value in use.
Inventories Inventories, which include materials, work in progress and finished goods and goods for resale, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Service based businesses inventories consist of spare parts and other consumables.
Serialised parts are costed using the specific identification method and other materials are generally costed using the first in, first out method.
Product based businesses determine cost by weighted average cost methods using standard costing to gather material, labour and overhead costs.
These costs are adjusted, where appropriate, to correlate closely the standard costs to the actual costs incurred based on variance analysis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and estimated selling expenses.
Allowance is made for obsolete and slow-moving items, based upon annual usage.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and other short-term bank deposits with maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are included within borrowings in current liabilities.
Where the Group uses pooling arrangements with a right of set-off, overdrafts and cash are netted and included in the appropriate category depending on the net position of the pool.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The provision is determined by reference to previous experience of recoverability for receivables in each market in which the Group operates.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Deferred and contingent consideration Where it is probable that deferred or contingent consideration is payable on the acquisition of a business based on an earn out arrangement, an estimate of the amount payable is made at the date of acquisition and reviewed regularly thereafter, with any change in the estimated liability being reflected in the income statement.
Changes in the estimated liability in respect of acquisitions completed before 31 December 2009 are reflected in goodwill.
Where deferred consideration is payable after more than one year the estimated liability is discounted using an appropriate rate of interest.
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Our business Strategic report Risks and uncertainties Governance Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 67 Accounting policies continued Taxation The tax charge represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from the profit reported in the income statement due to items that are not taxable or deductible in any period and also due to items that are taxable or deductible in a different period.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the full liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
The principal temporary differences arise from depreciation on PP&E, tax losses carried forward and, in relation to acquisitions, the difference between the fair values of the net assets acquired and their tax base.
Tax rates enacted, or substantially enacted, at the balance sheet date are used to determine deferred tax.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either: 1 hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment fair value hedge : 2 hedges of highly probable forecast transactions cash flow hedge : or 3 hedges of net investments in foreign operations net investment hedge.
Where hedging is to be undertaken, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item at the inception of the transaction, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged items.
The Group performs effectiveness testing on a quarterly basis.
a Fair value hedge Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in administrative expenses in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
b Cash flow hedge The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in the hedging reserve in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in administrative expenses in the case of forward contracts or finance income expense in the case of interest rate swaps in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled through the income statement in periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
c Net investment hedge Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in the currency translation reserve in equity: the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in administrative expenses in the income statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in administrative expenses in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
d Derivatives that are not designated as hedges Certain derivatives, whilst providing effective economic hedges are not designated as hedges.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that are not designated for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in administrative expenses in the income statement.
Fair value estimation The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of their estimated future cash flows.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward foreign exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are obtained from valuations provided by financial institutions.
The carrying values of trade receivables and payables approximate to their fair values.
The fair value of financial liabilities is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Notes to the financial statements continued 68 Accounting policies continued Operating leases As lessee Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the period of lease.
As lessor Operating lease rental income arising from leased assets is recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Retirement benefit liabilities The Group operates a defined benefit scheme and a number of defined contribution schemes.
The liability recognised in respect of the defined benefit scheme represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations less the fair value of the scheme assets.
The assets of this scheme are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The defined benefit schemes assets are measured using fair values.
Pension scheme liabilities are measured annually by an independent actuary using the projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.
The increase in the present value of the liabilities of the Groups defined benefit scheme expected to arise from employee service in the period is charged to operating profit.
The interest income on scheme assets and the increase during the period in the present value of the schemes liabilities arising from the passage of time are included in finance income expense.
Remeasurement gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in full in the period in which they occur.
The defined benefit schemes net assets or net liabilities are recognised in full and presented on the face of the balance sheet.
The Groups contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate.
Provisions Provision is made for the estimated liability on all products and services still under warranty, including claims already received, based on past experience.
Other provisions are recognised where the Group is deemed to have a legal or constructive obligation, it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made.
Where amounts provided are payable after more than one year the estimated liability is discounted using an appropriate rate of interest.
Share based charges relating to employee share schemes The Group has a number of employee share schemes: i Share options granted under Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS are granted at market value.
A charge is booked to the income statement as an employee benefit expense for the fair value of share options expected to be exercised, accrued over the vesting period.
The corresponding credit is taken to retained earnings.
The fair value is calculated using an option pricing model.
ii Share options granted under the Long Term Retention Plan LTRP are granted at par value.
The charge to the income statement for LTRP shares is also calculated using an option pricing model and, as with ESOS grants, the fair value of the share options expected to be exercised is accrued over the vesting period.
The corresponding credit is also taken to retained earnings.
iii The Groups Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP for executive directors and certain senior executives was in place from 2008 to 2012.
Participants are awarded shares or share options dependent on the achievement of performance targets.
The charge to the income statement for shares awarded under the LTIP is based on the fair value of those shares at the grant date, spread over the vesting period.
For those awards that have a market related performance measure, the fair value of the market related element is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
iv The Groups Long Term Cash Incentive Plan LTCIP for senior management was in place in 2011 and 2012.
Participants are paid a cash bonus dependent on the achievement of performance targets.
The charge to the income statement is based on the fair value of the awards and is linked to movements in the Groups share price.
The charge is spread over the vesting period with the corresponding credit being recorded in liabilities.
v During 2013, the Group introduced the Long Term Plan LTP to replace the LTRP, LTIP and LTCIP.
The LTP comprises two separate awards, an award of share options on a similar basis to the LTRP and an award of shares or share options on a broadly similar basis to the LTIP scheme.
The charge to the income statement for the LTP is as outlined for the LTRP and LTIP above with the corresponding credit being recorded in retained earnings.
Proceeds received on the exercise of share options are credited to share capital and share premium.
Share capital John Wood Group PLC has one class of ordinary shares and these are classified as equity.
Dividends on ordinary shares are not recognised as a liability or charged to equity until they have been approved by shareholders.
The Group is deemed to have control of the assets, liabilities, income and costs of its employee share trusts, therefore they have been consolidated in the financial statements of the Group.
Shares acquired by and disposed of by the employee share trusts are recorded at cost.
The cost of shares held by the employee share trusts is deducted from equity.
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Our business Strategic report Risks and uncertainties Governance Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 69 Accounting policies continued Segmental reporting The Group has determined that its operating segments are based on management reports reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM, the Groups Chief Executive.
The Groups reportable segments are Wood Group Engineering, Wood Group PSN and Wood Group GTS.

Disclosure of impact of new and future accounting standards a Amended standards and interpretations The following revisions and amendments to standards and interpretations are mandatory as of 1 January 2013: IAS 1 amended 2012 Financial statement presentation IAS 19 revised 2011 Employee benefits IFRS 13 amended 2012 Fair value measurement The amendments to IAS 1 relates to other comprehensive income.
The main change resulting from these amendments is a requirement for entities to group items presented in other comprehensive income OCI on the basis of whether they are potentially reclassifiable to profit or loss subsequently reclassification adjustments.
The amendments do not address which items are presented in OCI.
The revision to IAS 19 does not have a material impact on the financial statements.
The revision has been adopted in the current period and has resulted in an increase of $2.5m in net finance expense in the income statement see note 29.
As the impact of this revision is not material in both the current and prior period, no restatement of the comparative information has been made.
IFRS 13 measurement and disclosure requirements are applicable for periods commencing from 1 January 2013.
IFRS 13 does not have a material impact on the financial statements.
Disclosure of impact of new and future accounting standards continued b Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group The following relevant standards and amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 or later periods, but the Group has not early adopted them: IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements IFRS 11 Joint arrangements IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in other entities The Group does not anticipate any material impact on the financial statements on the adoption of IFRS 10.
The Group currently accounts for its interests in joint ventures using proportional consolidation.
IFRS 11 does not permit proportional consolidation and therefore from 1 January 2014, for all periods presented, the Group will account for its interests in joint ventures using equity accounting.
The use of equity accounting will have no impact on Group profit for the year or earnings per share, but will impact the presentation of the Groups interests in joint ventures in the income statement and in the balance sheet.
The Group will continue to prepare its management information using proportional consolidation and this will be presented in the segmental reporting note in future years.
The adoption of IFRS 12 may result in some additional disclosures in the financial statements.

Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 3% per annum for a further three year period.
A terminal value is applied thereafter in order to calculate long-term estimated cash flows using the same anticipated long-term growth rate of 3% across all CGUs.
The growth rate used does not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the regions in which the CGUs operate.
The cash flows have been discounted using pretax discount rates appropriate for each CGU.

The value-in-use has been compared to the carrying value for each CGU.
No goodwill has been written off during the year.
$1.9m of goodwill was impaired during 2012.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the basis that the expected long-term growth rate falls to 2% and that the discount rates are 1% higher than those above in order to assess the impact of reasonable possible changes to the assumptions used in the impairment review.
This analysis did not identify any impairment.
Intangibles arising on acquisition include the valuation of customer contracts and customer relationships recognised on business combinations.

17 Financial instruments The Groups activities give rise to a variety of financial risks: market risk including foreign exchange risk and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management strategy is to hedge exposures wherever practicable in order to minimise any potential adverse impact on the Groups financial performance.
Risk management is carried out by the Group Treasury department in line with the Groups Treasury policies.
Group Treasury, together with the Groups business units identify, evaluate and where appropriate, hedge financial risks.
The Groups Treasury policies cover specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess cash.
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Notes to the financial statements continued 88 17 Financial instruments continued Where the Board considers that a material element of the Groups profits and net assets are exposed to a country in which there is significant geo-political uncertainty a strategy is agreed to ensure that the risk is minimised.
a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currencies.
The Group has a number of subsidiary companies whose revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar.
The Group uses strategies such as the payment of dividends to minimise the amount of net assets exposed to foreign currency revaluation.
Some of the revenues of the Groups businesses are to customers in overseas locations.
Where possible, the Groups policy is to eliminate all significant currency exposures on revenues at the time of the transaction by using financial instruments such as forward currency contracts.
Changes in the forward contract fair values are booked through the income statement, except where hedge accounting is used in which case the change in fair value is recorded in equity.
The Group carefully monitors the economic and political situation in the countries in which it operates to ensure appropriate action is taken to minimise any foreign currency exposure.
The Groups main foreign exchange risk relates to movements in the sterling US dollar exchange rate.
Movements in the sterling US dollar rate impact the translation of sterling profit earned in the UK and the translation of sterling denominated net assets.
If the average sterling US dollar rate had been 10% higher or lower during 2013 2012:10%, post-tax profit for the year would have been $15.1m higher or lower 2012: $10.6m.
If the closing sterling US dollar rate was 10% higher or lower at 31 December 2013 2012:10%, exchange differences in equity would have been $59.4m 2012: $48.0m higher or lower respectively.
10% has been used in these calculations as it represents a reasonable possible change in the sterling US dollar exchange rate.
ii Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
The Group borrows in the desired currencies at floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps into fixed rates to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
At 31 December 2013, 24% 2012: 19% of the Groups borrowings were at fixed rates after taking account of interest rate swaps.
The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk on cash held on deposit.
The Groups policy is to maximise the return on cash deposits whilst ensuring that cash is deposited with a financial institution with a credit rating of A or better, where possible.
If average interest rates had been 1% higher or lower during 2013 2012: 1%, post-tax profit for the year would have been $2.6m lower or higher respectively 2012: $1.9m.
1% has been used in this calculation as it represents a reasonable possible change in interest rates.
iii Price risk The Group is not exposed to any significant price risk in relation to its financial instruments.
b Credit risk The Groups credit risk primarily relates to its trade receivables.
The Groups operations comprise three divisions, Wood Group Engineering, Wood Group PSN and Wood Group GTS each made up of a number of businesses.
Responsibility for managing credit risks lies within the businesses with support being provided by Group and divisional management where appropriate.
A customer evaluation is typically obtained from an appropriate credit rating agency.
Where required, appropriate trade finance instruments such as letters of credit, bonds, guarantees and credit insurance will be used to manage credit risk.
The Groups major customers are typically large companies which have strong credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Where a customer does not have sufficiently strong credit ratings, alternative forms of security such as the trade finance instruments referred to above may be obtained.
The Group has a broad customer base and management believe that no further credit risk provision is required in excess of the provision for impairment of trade receivables.
Management review trade receivables across the Group based on receivable days calculations to assess performance.
There is significant management focus on receivables that are overdue.
A table showing trade receivables and receivable days by division is provided in note 12.
Receivable days calculations are not provided on non-trade receivables as management do not believe that this information is a relevant metric.
The Group also has credit risk in relation to cash held on deposit.
The Groups policy is to deposit cash at institutions with a credit rating of A or better where possible.
81% of cash held on deposit at 31 December 2013 2012: 100% was held with such institutions.
c Liquidity risk With regard to liquidity, the Groups main priority is to ensure continuity of funding.
At 31 December 2013, 84% 2012: 96% of the Groups borrowing facilities excluding joint ventures were due to mature in more than one year.
Based on the current outlook the Group has sufficient funding in place to meet its future obligations.
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Our business Strategic report Risks and uncertainties Governance Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 89 17 Financial instruments continued d Capital risk The Group seeks to maintain an optimal capital structure.
The Group monitors its capital structure on the basis of its gearing ratio, interest cover and when applicable, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
Gearing is calculated by dividing net debt by equity attributable to owners of the parent.
Interest cover is calculated by dividing total EBITA by net finance expense.
Interest cover for the year to 31 December 2013 was 28.7 times 2012: 35.6 times.
The ratio of net debt to total EBITDA at 31 December 2013 was 0.53 2012: 0.31.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period from the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.
Drawdowns under long term bank facilities are for periods of three months or less and are not therefore discounted and loan interest payable is excluded from the amounts below.

Drawdowns under long-term bank facilities are for periods of three months or less and as a result, book value and fair value are considered to be the same.
Details of derivative financial instruments are not disclosed in the financial statements as they are not material.

Other provisions At 31 December 2013, other provisions of $53.6m 2012: $65.0m have been recognised.
This amount includes provisions for future losses on onerous contracts, a provision for non-recoverable indirect taxes and provisions relating to the divestment of businesses.
It is expected that any payment required in respect of these provisions would be made within the next two years.
The net movement of $14.5m during the year includes the release of the Well Support provision and the creation of the Oman onerous contract provision as detailed in note 4.

As these earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
The Group has unrecognised tax losses of $105.9m 2012: $192.7m to carry forward against future taxable income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.

These are the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS, the Long Term Retention Plan LTRP, the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the Long Term Cash Incentive Plan LTCIP and the Long Term Plan LTP.
The LTP replaced the LTRP, LTIP and LTCIP in 2013.
The charge to operating profit in 2013 for these schemes amounted to $22.4m 2012: $26.2m.
$21.0m 2012: $19.6m of the total charge is credited to retained earnings and $1.4m 2012: $6.6m, relating to the LTCIP, is included in liabilities as the LTCIP is a cash settled scheme.
The assumptions made in arriving at the charge for each scheme are detailed below: ESOS and LTRP Around 1,300 employees participate in these schemes.
For the purposes of calculating the fair value of the share options, a Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used.
Based on past experience, it has been assumed that options will be exercised, on average, six months after the earliest exercise date, which is four years after grant date, and there will be a lapse rate of between 15% and 20%.
The share price volatility used in the calculation of 35%-40% is based on the actual volatility of the Groups shares since IPO as well as that of comparable companies.
The risk free rate of return is based on the implied yield available on zero coupon gilts with a term remaining equal to the expected lifetime of the options at the date of grant.
The rate used ranges from 0.5% to 2.5%.
A dividend yield of between 1.0% and 2.0% has been used in the calculations.
The fair value of options granted under the ESOS during the year ranged from 2.29 to 2.52 2012: 2.09.
The fair value of options granted under the LTRP during the year ranged from 7.56 to 7.97 2012: 6.43 to 7.48.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of share options at 31 December 2013 is 5.9 years 2012: 5.6 years.
LTIP LTP The share based charge for the LTIP LTP was calculated using a fair value of 3.01 for the third cycle, 5.10 for the fourth cycle, 6.18 for the fifth cycle and 7.53 for the sixth cycle LTP.
The charge for market related performance targets has been calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model taking account of share price volatility against peer group companies, risk free rate of return, dividend yield and the expected lifetime of the award.
Further details of the LTIP LTP are provided in the Directors Remuneration Report.
LTCIP The share based charge for the LTCIP was calculated using a fair value of 6.62 2012: 7.01.
The fair value is calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model using similar assumptions to those used for ESOS and LTRP above.
Payments under the LTCIP are linked to movements in the Groups share price.
Share options are granted at an exercise price equal to the average mid-market price of the shares on the three days prior to the date of grant.
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Notes to the financial statements continued 92 20 Share based charges continued 1,139,791 options 2012: 687,486 were exercisable at 31 December 2013.
1,954,000 options were granted during the year, 2,130,318 options were exercised during the year and 742,850 options lapsed during the year.
The weighted average share price for ESOS options exercised during the year was 8.54 2012: 7.59.
Options granted to directors under the executive share option scheme are subject to performance criteria.
No options have been granted to executive directors since 2009.
There are no performance criteria under this scheme for options granted to employees.
The basis of the scheme is that an overall bonus pool is calculated annually based on performance criteria that consider the growth in the Groups adjusted earnings per share in the prior year.
There are no performance criteria attached to the exercise of options under the LTRP.
913,680 LTRP options were granted during the year, 2,104,012 LTRP options were exercised during the year and 304,424 LTRP options lapsed during the year.
The weighted average share price for LTRP options exercised during the year was 8.45 2012: 7.51.
Further details on the LTRP are provided in the Directors Remuneration Report.
Long Term Incentive Plan The Groups Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP has been in place since 2008.
Under this Scheme, the executive directors and certain senior executives are awarded shares or share options dependent upon the achievement of performance targets established by the Remuneration Committee.
The performance measures for the LTIP are EBITA, OCER ratio of operating capital employed to revenue, total shareholder return and adjusted diluted earnings per share.
The LTIP awards are in the form of shares or share options and forfeitable restricted shares or share options.
20% of any award earned over the three year performance cycle is deferred for a further two years in the form of forfeitable restricted shares or share options.
At 31 December 2013, 2,661,359 shares or share options were potentially issuable under this scheme.
Further details of the LTIP are provided in the Directors Remuneration Report.
Long Term Plan The Groups Long Term Plan LTP was introduced during 2013 to replace the LTRP, LTIP and LTCIP.
Two distinct awards will be made under LTP.
Nil value share options will be awarded on the same basis as awards under LTRP see above.
Awards to former LTIP and LTCIP participants will be made on a broadly similar basis to LTIP with the performance measures being EBITA, total shareholder return and adjusted diluted earnings per share.
These awards are in the form of shares or share options and forfeitable restricted shares or share options.
20% of any award is deferred for two years in the form of forfeitable restricted shares or share options.
At 31 December 2013, 1,742,591 shares were potentially issuable under this scheme.
Further details of the LTP are provided in the Directors Remuneration Report.

During the year the Group acquired 90% of the share capital of Intetech Limited, 95% of the share capital of Pyeroy Limited and 100% of the share capital of Elkhorn Holdings Inc. Due to its size, the acquisition of Elkhorn is considered material and has been presented separately in the table above.
The other acquisitions are not considered to be material on an individual basis and therefore have been aggregated above.
The acquired companies will be in a position to access the Groups wider client base and use the Groups resources to further grow and develop their businesses.
These factors contribute to the goodwill recognised on the acquisitions.
Provisional fair value adjustments of $82.5m, representing the fair value of customer contracts, have been recorded in relation to the acquisitions made in the year.
Other provisional fair value adjustments of $3.0m have also been recorded.
Trade and other receivables acquired of $94.3m are expected to be recovered in full.
The outflow of cash and cash equivalents in respect of acquisitions is analysed as follows: $m Cash consideration 304.1 Cash acquired 19.2 Borrowings acquired 2.4 Cash outflow 287.3 Included in the cash outflow above are deferred and contingent consideration payments of $11.8m made during the year in respect of acquisitions made in prior periods.
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Our business Strategic report Risks and uncertainties Governance Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 97 27 Acquisitions and divestments continued The results of the Group, as if the above acquisitions had been made at the beginning of period, would have been as follows: $m Total Revenue 7,458.1 Total EBITA 571.5 From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2013, the acquisitions contributed $113.1m to revenue and $8.8m to EBITA.
Divestments In October 2013, the Group entered into an agreement with Siemens to form a joint venture company containing the maintenance and power solutions businesses of Wood Group GTS and the Siemens TurboCare business unit.
Wood Group will have a 51% shareholding in the new joint venture and the transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2014.
Whilst Wood Group will have a 51% interest in the net assets and the income, all significant decision making requires unanimous consent from both parties and therefore Wood Group do not have control, and the new company will be treated as a joint venture.
Wood Group GTSs assets and liabilities that will be transferred into the new joint venture company have been treated as assets and liabilities held for sale in the Group balance sheet at 31 December 2013 and the profit of those businesses is included in profit from discontinued operations in the Group income statement.
Wood Group GTSs existing joint ventures, Rolls Wood Group, Trans Canada Turbines and Sulzer Wood will not form part of the new entity.
The assets and liabilities of these companies have not been treated as assets and liabilities held for sale and the profits of these joint venture companies are included in profit from continuing operations.
In December 2013, the Group disposed of a small Australian business for $0.3m.
The assets of this business had been provided against in previous periods and a small gain arose on the sale.
Details of the 2012 divestments are included in the 2012 Annual Report and Accounts.
Analysis of results from discontinued operations Discontinued operations comprise the Wood Group GTS business being transferred into the new joint venture company with Siemens, the aero engine overhaul business divested by Wood Group GTS in 2012 and the Well Support business divested in 2011.

John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Notes to the financial statements continued 100 29 Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK, the John Wood Group PLC Retirement Benefits Scheme, which is contracted out of the State Scheme, and a number of defined contribution plans.
The assets of the defined benefits scheme are held separately from those of the Group, being invested with independent investment companies in trustee administered funds.
Since 5 April 2007 members have accrued benefits under the scheme on a CARE Career Averaged Revalued Earnings basis.
The Group has entered into consultation with members of the scheme with regard to a proposal which would result in closure to future accrual from 30 June 2014.
No impact of the proposed change has been reflected in the 2013 net liability.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 5 April 2013 by a professionally qualified actuary.
As a result of the valuation, the Group has agreed to pay deficit reduction contributions of $4.7m 2.9m per annum from 2014 until 2021.
At 31 December 2013, there were 241 active members 2012: 254, 286 pensioners 2012: 270 and 654 deferred members 2012 : 667 of the scheme.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries at the balance sheet date were: 2013 2012 % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 5.40 5.00 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.40 3.00 Discount rate 4.50 4.50 Rate of retail price index inflation 3.40 3.00 Rate of consumer price index inflation 5.00 4.90 At 31 December 2013, the mortality assumption used to determine pension liabilities is based on the most recent mortality tables which consider UK wide mortality data relevant to the Groups pension scheme.
The mortality rates are then adjusted to allow for expected future improvements in mortality using up to date projections.
The mortality assumption can be fully described as PCA00 CMI 2012 1.25%.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows: 2013 2012 $m $m Present value of funded obligations 267.1 246.1 Fair value of scheme assets 225.9 191.1 Net liabilities 41.2 55.0 The major categories of scheme assets as a percentage of total scheme assets are as follows: 2013 2013 2012 2012 $m $m $m $m Equity securities 232.7 87.1 204.0 82.9 Corporate bonds 21.1 7.9 20.7 8.4 Gilts 9.6 3.6 20.4 8.3 Cash 3.7 1.4 1.0 0.4 267.1 100.0 246.1 100.0 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Our business Strategic report Risks and uncertainties Governance Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 101 29 Retirement benefit obligations continued The amounts recognised in the income statement are as follows: 2013 2012 $m $m Current service cost included within employee benefits expense 7.5 7.0 Interest cost 10.8 10.4 Interest income on scheme assets 8.4 10.5 Total included within finance expense income 2.4 0.1 The employee benefits expense is included within administrative expenses in the income statement.

Scheme risks The retirement benefit scheme is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are: Volatility The defined benefit obligation is measured with reference to corporate bond yields and if scheme assets underperform relative to this yield, this will create a deficit, all other things being equal.
The scheme investments are well diversified such that the failure of a single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in the corporate bond yields will increase the defined benefit obligation.
This would however be offset to some extent by a corresponding increase in the value of the schemes bond asset holdings.
Inflation risk The majority of benefits in deferment and in payment are linked to price inflation so higher actual inflation and higher assumed inflation will increase the defined benefit obligation.
Life expectancy The defined benefit obligation is generally made up of benefits payable for life and so increases to members life expectancies will increase the defined benefit obligation all other things being equal.
Sensitivity of the retirement benefit obligation The impact of changes to the key assumptions on the retirement benefit obligation is shown below.
The sensitivity is based on a change in an assumption whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method has been applied as when calculating the pension obligation recognised in the Group balance sheet.
Assumption Change Impact on obligation Discount rate 0.1% $5.3m Rate of retail prices index inflation 0.1% $3.4m Rate of consumer price index inflation 0.1% $1.0m Life expectancy 1 year $6.5m Defined contribution plans Pension costs for defined contribution plans are as follows: 2013 2012 $m $m 95.6 Defined contribution plans 87.5 There were no material contributions outstanding at 31 December 2013 in respect of defined contribution plans.

From time to time and in the normal course of business the Group is notified of legal claims in respect of work carried out.
Management believe that the Group is in a strong position to defend these claims.
In addition, the Group is currently cooperating with an investigation in relation to a facility where it previously provided services.
Management do not believe that it is probable that any material liability will arise from any of these matters.
