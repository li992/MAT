106 | Capita plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 6 Segmental information The Groups operations are organised and managed separately according to the nature of the services provided, with each segment representing a strategic business unit offering a different package of related services across the Groups markets.
A description of the service provision for each segment can be found in the strategic report on pages 1 to 57.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the reportable operating segments below.
The information disclosed below represents the way in which the results of the businesses are reported to the Group Board.
The comparative figures have been restated due to a reorganisation of the Groups business segments during the year and a consequent change in the way in which the results of the businesses are reported to the Group Board.
Before eliminating sales between business units on consolidation, the Group accounts for sales between business units as if they were to a third party at market rates.
The tables below present revenue, result and certain asset and liability information for the Groups business segments for the years 2013 and 2012.
