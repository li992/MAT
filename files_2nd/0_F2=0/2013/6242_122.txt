A reconciliation of the beginning balance to the ending balance for Level 3 financial instruments other than Silverstream which is disclosed in note 14 is shown below: 2013 2012 US$ thousands US$ thousands Balance at 1 January: 6,136 14,479 Changes in fair value 16,882 4,262 Realised embedded derivatives during the year 21,864 4,081 Balance at 31 December 1,154 6,136 The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
The following valuation techniques were used to estimate the fair values: Option and forward foreign exchange contracts: The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings.
The foreign currency forward Level 2 contracts are measured based on observable spot exchange rates, the yield curves of the respective currencies as well as the currency basis spreads between the respective currencies.
The foreign currency option contracts are valued using the Garmam-Kohlhagen formula, the significant inputs to which include observable spot exchange rates, interest rates and the volatility of the currency.
Silverstream contract: The fair value of the Silverstream contract is determined using a valuation model for further information relating to the Silverstream contract see note 14.
This derivative has a term of over 20 years and the valuation model utilises a number of inputs that are not based on observable market data due to the nature of these inputs and or the duration of the contract.
Inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are the volume of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine over the contract life, the future price of silver, future foreign exchange rates between the Mexican peso and US dollar, future inflation and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows.
The estimate of the volume of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine requires estimates of the recoverable silver reserves and resources, the related production profile based on the Sabinas mine plan and the expected recovery of silver from ore mined.
The estimation of these inputs is subject to a range of operating assumptions and may change over time.
Estimates of reserves and resources are updated annually by Peoles, the operator and sole interest holder in the Sabinas mine and provided to the Company.
The production profile and estimated payable silver that will be recovered from ore mined is based on the latest plan and estimates, also provided to the Company by Peoles.
The inputs assume no interruption in production over the life of the Silverstream contract and production levels which are consistent with those achieved in recent years.
com Fresnillo plc Annual report 2013 197 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Management regularly assesses a range of reasonably possible alternatives for those significant unobservable inputs described above, and determines their impact on the total fair value.
The significant unobservable inputs are not interrelated.
The fair value of the Silverstream is not significantly sensitive to a reasonable change in future exchange rates, however, it is to a reasonable change in future silver price, future inflation and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows.
The sensitivity of the valuation to the inputs relating to market risks, being the price of silver, foreign exchange rates, inflation and the discount rate is disclosed in note 31.
Quoted investments: Fair value of available-for-sale financial assets is derived from quoted market prices in active markets.
Interest-bearing loans: Fair value of the Groups interest-bearing loan is derived from quoted market prices in active markets.
Loans with related parties: Fair value of the Groups loan from related party is determined using a discounted cash flow method based on market interest rates at each reporting date.
Embedded derivatives within sales contracts: Sales of concentrates, precipitates and dor bars are provisionally priced and revenue is initially recognised using this provisional price and the Groups best estimate of the contained metal.
Revenue is subject to final price and metal content adjustments subsequent to the date of delivery see note 2 o.
This price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative and is separated from the sales contract.
At each reporting date the provisionally priced metal content is revalued based on the forward selling price for the quotational period stipulated in the relevant sales contract.
The selling price of metals can be reliably measured as these metals are actively traded on international exchanges but the estimated metal content is a non-observable input to this valuation.
At 31 December 2013 the fair value of embedded derivatives within sales contracts was US$ 1.2 million 2012: US$ 6.1 million.
The revaluation effects of embedded derivatives arising from these sales contracts are recorded as an adjustment to revenues.
c Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into certain forward and option contracts in order to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with costs incurred in Mexican pesos and other currencies.
The Group entered into a number of forward derivative contracts to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
The outstanding forward derivative contracts as at 31 December 2013 are as follows: As at 31 December 2013 Contract value Contract 2013 Fair value Term Currency thousands exchange rate US$ thousands EUR1.31:US$1 to Euro denominated forward contracts 2014 EUR 3,248 EUR1.38:US$1 216 MX$12.58:US$1 to US dollar denominated forward contracts 2014 USD 8,000 MX$12.61:US$1 317 The Groups euro-denominated forward derivative instruments mature over a period from 12 March to 10 September 2014 at a weighted average rate of US$1.31: 1.
The Group also entered into a number of US dollar denominated forward contracts to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
These derivative instruments mature on 13 January 2014 with a weighted average rate of MX$12.60: US$1.
The Group also entered into Mexican peso-US dollar collars to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
Collar derivative instruments mature over the period from 13 January 2014 to 15 December 2014.
The collar instruments hedge costs denominated in Mexican peso amounting to US$221 million with a range of floor prices from MX$12.40 to MX$13.59:US$1 and a range of capped prices from MX$13.21 to MX$14.50:US$1.
The fair value of the put options at 31 December 2013 was an asset of US$5.0 million, and the fair value of the call options at 31 December 2013 was a liability of US$3.7 million.
Forward derivative contracts that were outstanding as at 31 December 2012 were as follows: As at 31 December 2012 Contract value Contract 2012 Fair value Term Currency thousands exchange rate US$ thousands Euro denominated forward contracts 2013 EUR 1,396 EUR1.28: US$1 58 Swedish krona denominated forward SEK6.49:US$1 to contracts 2013 SEK 54,708 SEK7.25:US$1 237 The Groups euro-denominated forward derivative instruments mature on 14 June 2013 at a rate of US$1.28: 1.
The Group also entered into a number of SEK-US dollar forward contracts to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
These derivative instruments mature over the period from 15 March 2013 to 14 June 2013 with a weighted average rate of SEK6.78: US$1.
The Group does not apply hedge accounting for SEK:USD forward contracts, therefore, changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement in the year.
