2.3 Taxation Accounting policies Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement unless it relates to items recognised directly in equity, when it is recognised directly in equity, or when it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income, when it is recognised through the statement of comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided on certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and taxation purposes respectively.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
After considering forecast future profits, deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those assets can be utilised.

The comparative information uses the Luxembourg statutory rate.
During 2013 a number of changes associated with the IPO, including the restructuring of debt facilities and the settlement of interest rate swaps have led to an increased certainty over the availability of future taxable profits in the UK, which has led to the recognition of deferred tax assets in the UK, arising largely from unclaimed capital allowances.
Sensitivity analysis was performed when the asset was recognised.
This showed that no reasonably foreseeable changes in the future taxable profits of the UK operations or the forecast capital spend would result in non-utilisation of the deferred tax assets.
