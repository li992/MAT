18 Financial instruments Details of the objectives, policies and strategies pursued by Reed Elsevier in relation to financial instruments and capital management are set out on pages 58 and 59 of the Financial Review.
The main financial risks faced by Reed Elsevier are liquidity risk, market risk comprising interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk and credit risk.
Financial instruments are used to finance the Reed Elsevier businesses and to hedge interest rate and foreign exchange risks.
Reed Elseviers businesses do not enter into speculative derivative transactions.
Details of financial instruments subject to liquidity, market and credit risks are described below.
Liquidity risk Reed Elsevier maintains a range of borrowing facilities and debt programmes to fund its requirements, at short notice and at competitive rates.
The remaining contractual maturities for borrowings and derivative financial instruments are shown in the table below.
The table shows undiscounted principal and interest cash flows and includes contractual gross cash flows to be exchanged as part of cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts where there is a legal right of set-off.

The expected cash flows in respect of the cash collateral have been included in the tables above together with the cash flows for the related cross currency interest rate swaps.
At 31 December 2013, Reed Elsevier had access to a $2,000m committed bank facility maturing in July 2018, which was undrawn.
The bank facility, together with certain private placements, are subject to financial covenants typical to Reed Elseviers size and financial strength.
Reed Elsevier had significant headroom within these covenants for the year ended 31 December 2013.
There are no financial covenants in any outstanding public bonds.
After taking account of the maturity of committed bank facilities that back short term borrowings at 31 December 2013, and after utilising available cash resources, no borrowings mature within two years 2012: nil, no borrowings mature in the third year 2012: 27%, 50% in the fourth and fifth years 2012: 23%, 42% in the sixth to tenth years 2012: 39%, and 8% beyond the tenth year 2012: 11%.
Market risk Reed Elseviers primary market risks are to interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate movements.
Derivatives are used to hedge or reduce the risks of interest rate and exchange rate movements and are not entered into unless such risks exist.
Derivatives used by Reed Elsevier for hedging a particular risk are not specialised and are generally available from numerous sources.
The impact of market risks on net post employment benefit obligations and taxation is excluded from the following market risk sensitivity analysis.
Interest rate risk Reed Elseviers interest rate exposure management policy is aimed at reducing the exposure of the combined businesses to changes in interest rates.
At 31 December 2013, 57% of gross borrowings were either fixed rate or had been fixed through the use of interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options.
A 100 basis point reduction in interest rates would result in an estimated decrease in net finance costs of 12m 2012: 8m, based on the composition of financial instruments including cash, cash equivalents, bank loans and commercial paper borrowings at 31 December 2013.
A 100 basis point rise in interest rates would result in an estimated increase in net finance costs of 12m 2012: 8m.
The impact on net equity of a theoretical change in interest rates as at 31 December 2013 is restricted to the change in carrying value of floating rate to fixed rate interest rate derivatives in a designated cash flow hedge relationship and undesignated interest rate derivatives.
A 100 basis point reduction in interest rates would result in an estimated reduction in net equity of nil 2012: 1m and a 100basis point increase in interest rates would increase net equity by an estimated 1m 2012: 2m.
The impact of a change in interest rates on the carrying value of fixed rate borrowings in a designated fair value hedge relationship would be offset by the change in carrying value of the related interest rate derivative.
Fixed rate borrowings not in a designated hedging relationship are carried at amortised cost.

Some of these exposures are offset by denominating borrowings in US dollars see note 24.
A theoretical weakening of all currencies by 10% against sterling at 31 December 2013 would decrease the carrying value of net assets, excluding net borrowings, by 500m 2012: 495m.
This would be offset to a degree by a decrease in net borrowings of 246m 2012: 286m.
A strengthening of all currencies by 10% against sterling at 31 December 2013 would increase the carrying value of net assets, excluding net borrowings, by 500m 2012: 495m and increase net borrowings by 246m 2012: 286.
A retranslation of the combined businesses net profit for the year assuming a 10% weakening of all foreign currencies against sterling but excluding transactional exposures would reduce net profit by 92m 2012: 80m.
A 10% strengthening of all foreign currencies against sterling on this basis would increase net profit for the year by 92m 2012: 80m.
Credit risk Reed Elsevier seeks to limit interest rate and foreign exchange risks described above by the use of financial instruments and as a result has a credit risk from the potential non performance by the counterparties to these financial instruments, which are unsecured.
Theamount of this credit risk is normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount being hedged.
ReedElsevier also has a credit exposure to counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risks are controlled by monitoring the credit quality of these counterparties, principally licensed commercial banks and investment banks with strong long term credit ratings, and the amounts outstanding with each of them.
In certain situations, Reed Elsevier enters into credit support arrangements with derivative counterparties to mitigate the credit exposures arising from hedge gains on the related financial instruments.
Under these arrangements, Reed Elsevier receives or pays cash collateral equal to the mark to market valuation of the related derivative asset or liability on monthly settlement dates.
At 31 December 2013, 13m 2012: nil of cash collateral had been received, and the resulting payable balance was offset against the related derivative assets of 12m 2012: nil in the statement of financial position.
Reed Elsevier has treasury policies in place which do not allow concentrations of risk with individual counterparties and do not allow significant treasury exposures with counterparties which are rated lower than AA3 by Standard & Poors, Moodys and Fitch.
Reed Elsevier also has credit risk with respect to trade receivables due from its customers that include national and state governments, academic institutions and large and small enterprises including law firms, book stores and wholesalers.
The concentration of credit risk from trade receivables is limited due to the large and broad customer base.
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the business units where they arise.
Where appropriate, business units seek to minimise this exposure by taking payment in advance and through management of credit terms.
Allowance is made for bad and doubtful debts based on managements assessment of the risk taking into account the ageing profile, experience and circumstance.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, recorded in the statement of financial position.
Included within trade receivables are the following amounts which are past due but for which no allowance has been made.
Past due up to one month 156m 2012: 148m : past due two to three months 76m 2012: 58m : past due four to six months 26m 2012: 14m : and past due greater than six months 7m 2012: 1m.
Examples of trade receivables which are past due but for which no allowance has been made include those receivables where there is no concern over the creditworthiness of the customer and where the history of dealings with the customer indicate the amount will be settled.

Interest rate derivatives including cross currency interest rate swaps with a principal amount of 1,104m 2012: 1,502m were in place at 31 December 2013 swapping fixed rate term debt issues denominated in US dollars USD, sterling, euros and Swiss francs CHF to floating rate USD, sterling, euro and USD debt respectively for the whole or part of their term.
The gains and losses on the borrowings and related derivatives designated as fair value hedges, which are included in the income statement, for the two years ended 31 December 2013 were as follows: GAINS LOSSES ON BORROWINGS Fair value Fair value AND RELATED DERIVATIVES 1 January movement fideExchange 1 January movement Exchange 31 December 2012 gain loss designated gain loss 2013 gain loss gain loss 2013 m m m m m m m m USD debt 6 6 Related interest rate swaps 6 6 GBP debt 30 6 36 17 19 Related interest rate swaps 30 6 36 17 19 EUR debt 9 8 9 8 13 1 4 Related interest rate swaps 9 8 9 8 13 1 4 CHF debt 84 4 80 14 1 65 Related CHF to USD cross currency interest rate swaps 84 4 80 14 1 65 Total USD, GBP, EUR and CHF debt 123 14 9 4 124 50 74 Total related interest rate derivatives 123 14 9 4 124 50 74 Net gain All fair value hedges were highly effective throughout the two years ended 31 December 2013.
Gross borrowings as at 31 December 2013 included 31m 2012: 37m in relation to fair value adjustments to borrowings previously designated in a fair value hedge relationship which were fide-designated in 2008.
The related derivatives were closed out on fide-designation with a cash inflow of 62m.
5m 2012: 5m of these fair value adjustments were amortised in the year as a reduction to finance costs.
Gross borrowings included nil 2012: 2m in relation to fair value adjustments to borrowings previously designated in a fair value hedging relationship which were fide-designated during 2012.
2m 2012: 7m of these fair value adjustments were amortised in the year as a reduction to finance costs.

2 Revenue hedges comprising forward foreign exchange contracts which fix the exchange rate on a portion of future foreign currency subscription revenues forecast by the Scientific, Technical & Medical businesses for up to 50 months.
Movements in the hedge reserve pre-tax in 2012 and 2013, including gains and losses on cash flow hedging instruments, were asfollows: Total hedge Debt Revenue reserve hedges hedges pre-tax m m m Hedge reserve at 1 January 2012: losses deferred 17 46 63 Losses gains arising in 2012 2 72 70 Amounts recognised in income statement 16 10 26 Exchange translation differences 1 1 2 Hedge reserve at 1 January 2013: losses gains deferred 2 37 35 Gains arising in 2013 1 64 65 Amounts recognised in income statement 3 6 3 Exchange translation differences 1 1 Hedge reserve at 31 December 2013: gains deferred 2 94 96 All cash flow hedges were highly effective throughout the two years ended 31 December 2013.
A tax charge of 23m 2012: 9m in respect of the above gains and losses at 31 December 2013 was also deferred in the hedge reserve.
Of the amounts recognised in the income statement in the year, gains of 6m 2012: losses of 10m were recognised in revenue, and losses of3m 2012: 16m were recognised in finance costs.
A tax charge of 1m 2012: credit of 5m was recognised in relation to these items.
The deferred gains and losses on cash flow hedges at 31 December 2013 are currently expected to be recognised in the income statement in future years as follows: Total hedge Debt Revenue reserve hedges hedges pre-tax m m m 2014 2 38 36 2015 1 37 36 2016 17 17 2017 2 2 2018 5 5 Gains deferred in hedge reserve at end of year 2 94 96 The cash flows for these hedges are expected to occur in line with the recognition of the gains and losses in the income statement, other than in respect of certain forward foreign exchange hedges on subscriptions, where cash flows may be expected to occur in advance of the subscription year.
