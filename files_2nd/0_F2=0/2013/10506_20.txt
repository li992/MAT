FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
Corporate information The Consolidated Financial Statements of Moneysupermarket.
com Group PLC Company, a company incorporated in England, and its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2013 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 3 March 2014.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs.
The Company has elected to prepare its Company Financial Statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 75 to 80.
Summary of significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The Financial Statements are prepared on the historical cost basis.
Comparative figures presented in the Financial Statements represent the year ended 31 December 2012.
The Financial Statements are prepared on a going concern basis, which the Directors deem appropriate, given the Groups positive cash position, low level of net debt, continued growth and forecast profitability.
Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The most significant areas of estimation uncertainty, and areas where critical judgements are made in applying accounting policies that have a material effect on the Financial Statements, are listed below.
The uncertainties encountered, and judgements made, are described in more detail in the relevant accounting policies and accompanying notes: Note 3 contingent consideration and remuneration on acquisitions Note 12 goodwill and other intangibles, including their amortisation and impairment Note 13 revenue recognition Basis of consolidation These Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the Financial Statements of the Company and its subsidiaries and equity account the Groups interest in associates.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are recognised initially at cost.
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Groups share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of equity accounted investees, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
Accounting for business combinations From 1 January 2010 the Group has applied IFRS 3 Business Combinations 2008 in accounting for business combinations.
The change in accounting policy has been applied prospectively.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that currently are exercisable.
Acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010 For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: the fair value of the consideration transferred: plus the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree: plus if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree: less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships.
Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent amount payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
If the contingent amount is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity.
Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent amount are recognised in profit or loss.
Where the contingent amount is dependent on future employment, it shall be treated as a cost of continuing employment, and therefore is recognised as an expense over the relevant period.

Summary of significant accounting policies continued Acquisitions between 22 June 2007 and 1 January 2010 For acquisitions between 22 June 2007 and 1 January 2010, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Groups interest in the recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
When the excess was negative, a bargain purchase gain was recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurred in connection with business combinations were capitalised as part of the cost of the acquisition.
The Group was established via a series of transactions that occurred concurrently on 22 June 2007.
These comprised the incorporation of the Company with Simon Nixon as sole shareholder, the acquisition by the Company using a share for share exchange of Simon Nixons 45% interest in Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited and the acquisition by the Company of all other shares in Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited from third parties.
The acquisition of Simon Nixons shares was between two parties, being Simon Nixon and the Company, who were under common control at the time of the transaction.
The acquisition was of an interest in a company which gave the investor a significant influence in the company and it was concluded that this arrangement was a common control transaction and not within the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
As a result the Company accounted for this 45% interest in Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited at original carrying value rather than fair value at the date of the acquisition.
The acquisition of the remaining shares in Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited was accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations applying the accounting guidance for a business combination achieved in stages.
This resulted in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited being recognised in full and the goodwill in respect of the acquisition from third parties being recognised.
Foreign currency The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
The functional currency of the foreign subsidiary icero GmbH is the euro.
The income and expenses of the foreign operation are translated into sterling at an average exchange rate for the period in which the activity occurred.
The assets and liabilities of the foreign operation are translated into sterling using exchange rates ruling as at the balance sheet date.
The exchange difference arising upon translation is taken directly to a separate component of equity.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date.
Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised as a profit or loss.
Revenue The Group generates fees from internet lead generation click based revenue, commissions from brokerage sales and advertising through a variety of contractual arrangements.
The Group recognises click based revenues and associated costs in the period that the lead is generated.
Brokerage commissions are recognised at the point of completion of the transaction with the customer.

Revenue is recognised net of value added tax.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Assets under construction are not depreciated until brought into use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Buildings 50 years Plant and equipment including IT equipment 3 years Fixtures and fittings 5 years Office equipment 5 years The useful lives and depreciation rates are reassessed at each reporting date.

com Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 56 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Other intangible assets The cost of other intangible assets acquired in a business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition.
After initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
All the Groups intangible assets other than goodwill have been identified as having finite useful lives.
As such, they are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life is reviewed at least at each financial year end.
The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible asset.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Market-related 10 years Customer relationships 7 years Non-compete agreement 4 years Customer lists 3 years Technology 3 years Market-related intangible assets are defined as those that are primarily used in the marketing or promotion of products and services, for example trademarks, trade names and internet domain names.
Customer-related intangible assets consist of customer lists, customer contracts and relationships, and non-contractual customer relationships.
For accounting purposes, customer relationships and customer lists have been identified separately.
Relationships with high-profile customers provide the Group with prominence in the marketplace, create volume and traffic on the website, and enhance the reputation of the brand.
Customer lists allow the Group to undertake targeted marketing activities.
Technology-based intangible assets relate to innovations and technical advances such as computer software, patented and unpatented technology, databases and trade secrets.
Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets are reviewed annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
For the purposes of impairment reviews, the recoverable amount of the Groups assets is taken to be the higher of their fair value less costs to sell and their value in use.
Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining technical knowledge and understanding, is charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income when incurred.
Development expenditure is capitalised when it meets the criteria outlined in IAS 38.
Expenditure that does not meet the criteria is expensed directly to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
Employee benefits Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as incurred.
Share-based payment transactions The Groups share schemes allow certain Group employees to acquire ordinary shares in the Company.
The fair value of share awards made is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at award date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards.
The fair values of the share awards are measured using the Monte Carlo method for options subject to a market-based condition and the Black-Scholes model for all others, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were made.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of share awards expected to vest.
Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as the related service is provided.
A provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Advertising costs The Group incurs costs from advertising via a number of different media.
Costs associated with the production of adverts are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income only once the advert is available to the Group in a format ready for use, having been approved for airing or displaying.
The cost of airing or displaying the advert is taken as an expense in the period in which the advert is aired or displayed.

Summary of significant accounting policies continued Finance income Finance income comprises interest receivable, which is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as it accrues using the effective interest method.
Finance costs Finance costs comprise of interest charged on borrowings, and the unwind of the discount on contingent remuneration.
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
The effective interest rate method is then used for subsequent re-measurement of borrowings at amortised cost.
The unwind of the discount on contingent remuneration is charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as an interest expense.
Operating leases Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed.
Lease incentives and rent-free periods are amortised through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the term of the relevant lease.
Dividends Dividends payable to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders equity in the period in which the shareholders right to receive payment is established.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates in force for the year, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised at the expected future tax rate of the value of the intangible assets with finite lives which are acquired through business combinations representing the tax effect of the amortisation of these assets in future periods.
These liabilities will decrease in line with the amortisation of the related intangible assets, with the deferred tax credit recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in accordance with IAS 12.
Research and development tax credits are accounted for in accordance with IAS 20 as a government grant.
The credit is recognised once a reasonable estimate of the amount can be made.
Group management of capital The Groups objectives when managing capital are: to safeguard the entitys ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders: and to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk.
The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
In assessing the level of capital all components of equity are taken into account, i. e. share capital, retained earnings and reserves where applicable, as well as unvested share options and awards.
In line with internal capital management requirements, the Group manages its cash balances by where possible depositing them with a number of financial institutions to reduce credit risk.
The Group has drawn down 60 million from its revolving credit facility in the year.
The Group is subject to externally imposed quarterly covenants as a result of this facility which are based on EBITDA, interest and net debt.
None of these covenants were breached in the year, nor are expected to be breached within 12 months of the date of these Financial Statements.
Management of capital focuses around the Groups ability to generate cash from its operations.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to raise funds.
The Group believes it is meeting its objectives for managing capital as funds are available for reinvestment where necessary as well as being in a position to make returns to shareholders where this is felt appropriate.
There were no changes to the Groups approach to capital management during the year.

Following a review by management during the maximum measurement period of one year from the date of acquisition of MSE, as permitted by IFRS 3, no fair value adjustments have been required to the initial amounts recognised for the assets and liabilities of MSE at the date of acquisition.
Accordingly the value of goodwill recognised at the acquisition date has not been adjusted.
com by the Group has provided a number of benefits to both the Group and the acquired business, allowing the enlarged Group to reach a wider audience, and improve the visibility and accessibility of MoneySavingExpert.
The goodwill identified upon the acquisition of MoneySavingExpert.
com represented the benefits referred to above, as well as the skills and knowledge within the acquired business workforce.
During 2013 the business contributed revenue prior to consolidation adjustments of 19.5m 2012: 3.9m and a profit before tax of 13.3m 2012: 2.8m to the consolidated profit for the year.
Additional amounts of up to 27.0m may become payable on the third anniversary of the completion of the acquisition of MoneySavingExpert.
The amount payable depends in part upon the achievement of a number of non-financial performance measures specified in the purchase agreement and is, in part, at the discretion of the Companys Board, subject to the continued employment of Martin Lewis.
The arrangement to pay these additional amounts has been accounted for separate to the business combination as remuneration as their payment is linked to the continued employment of Martin Lewis.
The benefit payable will be charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the period in which services are provided the earnout period as an employment expense.
Management has estimated the benefit payable by assessing, amongst other things, the performance of the acquired business since acquisition, against the measures specified in the purchase agreement.
During the year 8.0m 2012: 2.3m has been charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as an employment expense, and 0.6m 2012: 0.2m has been recognised as an expense within net finance costs, being the unwinding of the discount rate applied.

The impact on both basic and diluted earnings per share was a decrease of 0.6p per share.
No acquisition-related costs have been incurred during 2013.
The Group was previously a significant customer of MoneySavingExpert.
Management considered the settlement of the pre-existing relationship on acquisition, and since the pre-acquisition trade was on an arms length, commercial basis, no settlement adjustments arose.

During 2007 the Group employed the services of an appropriately qualified and experienced independent third party to value the intangible assets acquired from Moneysupermarket.
This valuation was used as the initial carrying value for these assets.
Following the impairment in 2008, the market capitalisation of the Group approximated to the total carrying value of the goodwill, intangible and other non-current assets of the Group.
At 31 December 2013 the market capitalisation exceeded the carrying value of the goodwill, intangible and other non-current assets, and net current assets by more than 100% 2012: more than 100%.
On adoption of IFRS 8 the Group was required to allocate goodwill between its cash generating units CGU that represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, but are not larger than an operating segment as defined by IFRS 8.
These CGUs are the five operating segments Insurance, Money, Travel, Home Services and MoneySavingExpert.
The Group has performed impairment testing at a CGU level.
For the original four segments, the goodwill was allocated on 1 January 2009 based on estimates of the relative values of the operating segments at that date with 30.7m allocated to Insurance, 15.5m to Money, 6.6m to Travel and 2.2m to Home Services.
The balances at 31 December 2013 are in line with those at 1January 2009.
Goodwill impairment for MSE has been considered separately from the four operating segments outlined above and the Group.
Impairment review by vertical and Group For the current year, the recoverable amount of the assets was taken to be their value in use and was calculated by reference to the forecast cash flows.
The present value of the future cash flows has been calculated with the following key assumptions: Cash flows for year 1 for each CGU represent managements best estimate of future cash flows as at 31 December 2013, and are based upon the Groups approved budget for 2014 incorporating cost of sales, advertising and an allocation of overhead costs.
The main assumptions underlying the 2014 budget relate to visitor volumes, source of visitors, revenue per transaction visitor and marketing spend, which incorporate past experience.
The forecast assumes continued growth during the course of 2014, broadly in line with that seen in 2013, driven by new media campaigns, exploitation of the Groups data asset and further investments made during 2013 in the core technology underpinning the Groups key channels.
Cash flows for the second and third years assume revenue growth of approximately 10% per annum in the Insurance and Home Services segments, with a higher rate of growth in the Travel segment, and a lower rate of growth in the Money segment.
Costs are expected to grow broadly in line with revenues.
Cash flows after three years assume no growth.
Cash flows into perpetuity have been incorporated into the calculations.
A pre-tax discount rate of 13.5% 2012: 13.5% has been used in the forecast for the Travel, Insurance, Money and Home Services segments.
A different set of assumptions may be more appropriate in future years dependent on changes to the macro-economic environment.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the assets allocated to the Insurance, Money, Travel and Home Services segments exceeds their carrying value by in excess of 100%, and as such, no impairment was identified.
No reasonably possible change to a key assumption would result in an impairment.
com Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 66 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 12.
Intangible assets continued As explained in note 4, whilst the Group is able to allocate revenue between the Insurance, Money, Travel and Home Services operating segments, its cost base is reviewed by the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker at a Group rather than segmental level, and a number of the significant costs which the Group incurs cannot be allocated either directly or on a reasonable and consistent basis to the CGUs that are each operating segment.
Therefore the cash flows estimated for these segments include all of the Groups forecast revenues and an allocation of the Groups forecast costs.
The Group has therefore also performed a further impairment test for the Group as a whole, in a manner consistent with previous years.
In these calculations the Group is treated as one group of CGUs, and the test compared the carrying amount, including goodwill and other corporate assets, to the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount has been estimated based on the present value of its future cash flows which has been calculated with a set of assumptions consistent with those set out above in relation to the individual operating segment calculations.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the Groups assets exceeds their carrying value by 444m 2012: 469m, and as such, no impairment was identified.
With regard to the Group level impairment testing, the level of the decrease in cash flows, with all the other assumptions held constant, required to give a value in use for the Groups assets equal to their carrying value, would be in excess of what can reasonably be expected to happen 2012: outside of reasonable range.
Similarly, the level of the increase in the discount rate, with all the other assumptions held constant, required to give a value in use for the Groups assets equal to their carrying value, would be in excess of what can reasonably be expected to happen 2012: outside of reasonable range.
At an asset category level, management believe that the assumptions relating to each intangible asset remain applicable, and that no adjustment is required to their valuation, nor their useful economic lives.
Acquisition of Financial Services Net Limited FSN During 2012 FSN continued to trade below management expectations.
As a result of this management reviewed the remaining intangible assets for impairment.
The analysis performed calculated the value in use of FSN being lower than the carrying value of the business identified intangible assets.
Therefore, an impairment charge of 4.4m was recognised within administrative expenses, as well as a credit of 0.2m in relation to the release of the accrued contingent consideration.
During 2013 the business ceased to trade.
This has had no impact on the carrying value of the related goodwill and intangible assets.
An impairment review has not been performed on FSN in the current year as the related goodwill and intangible assets have no carrying value.
Acquisition of Local Daily Deals Limited LDD In 2012, LDD traded below its forecast performance, and as a result management reviewed the goodwill balance for impairment.
The analysis performed calculated the value in use of LDD being lower than the carrying value of goodwill created on the acquisition of LDD.
Therefore an impairment charge of 0.6m was recognised in 2012 in administrative expenses.
This has had no impact on the carrying value of the related goodwill.
Animpairment review has not been performed on LDD in the current year as the related goodwill has no carryingvalue.
Acquisition of certain trade and assets of Martin Lewis and MoneySavingExpert.
com The fair value of the intangible assets recognised upon the acquisition of trade and certain assets from Martin Lewis and MoneySavingExpert.
com MSE were calculated as set out below: Market related Within MSE, the main market related intangible assets are the MSE tradename, MSE domain name and Martin Lewis image and reputation.
These assets were valued using an income-based approach, namely, the royalty savings method, where it is assumed that a company, without similar assets, would license the right to use these assets and pay a royalty related to turnover achieved over their useful economic life of 10 years.
A royalty rate of 20% has been applied for the first three years after acquisition, which will include the use of Martin Lewis name and image, and a 10% royalty rate has been used for the following seven years when Martin Lewis name and image will not be included.
Customer lists This asset represents the value of the customer data held by MSE at the date of acquisition, and its valuation has been performed with reference to the cost of buying an equivalent book of customer data on the open market.
This was done through analysis of recent sales of comparable assets.
Non-compete agreement To value the non-compete agreement management considered what percentage of the business could be lost if Martin Lewis was to leave the acquired business and subsequently compete against the Group.
The non-compete agreement is valid for a period of four years following acquisition.
However, as the contingent remuneration which may become payable to Martin Lewis is dependent upon his continued employment by the business for three years following the acquisition, the non-compete agreement has been valued for the twelve months following the three year earnout period.
Tax amortisation benefit Included in the market related intangible and non-compete agreement is an additional increment of value, the tax amortisation benefit.
com Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 67 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 12.
Intangible assets continued The goodwill balance recognised upon the acquisition represented the anticipated incremental value which the Group expected to generate by applying the existing skills and expertise within the Groups workforce to the acquired business and assets, as well as the skills and expertise of the acquired workforce and Martin Lewis.
The recoverable amount has been estimated based on the present value of its future cashflows using the following key assumptions: Cash flows for year 1 represent managements best estimate of future cash flows as at 31 December 2013, and are based upon the Groups approved budget for 2014.
The main assumptions underlying the budget relate to visitor numbers, the amount of revenue generated per visitor, and the staff resource required to run the business.
The forecast assumes an improvement during 2014, driven by investments in technology and search engine optimisation.
Cash flows for the first three years assume an average 10% per annum increase in revenue, with costs expected to grow at around 10% per annum.
Cash flows into perpetuity have been built into the model.
A pre-tax discount rate of 16.2% 2012: 16.2% has been used in the forecast.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the assets exceeds their carrying value by 24m 2012: 16m, and as such, no impairment was identified.
The discount rate would need to increase to 22% 2012: 19% with all other assumptions held constant, to give a value in use of MSEs assets equal to the carrying value.
Similarly, a decrease in the annual cash flows of 4.0m 2012: 2.5m with all other assumptions held constant, would also give a value in use equal to the carrying value.
Trade and other receivables 31 December 31 December 2013 2012 000 000 Trade receivables 21,907 20,768 All receivables fall due within one year.
As a result of click based revenue being recognised in the period that the lead is generated, a revenue accrual for approximately one months revenue is recognised at the year end date.
The accrued revenue is estimated by considering the volume of clicks that have passed from the Groups websites through to provider websites in the period, and the historic conversion of such clicks into completed product purchases, for which the Group would receive a fee.

Level 2: i nputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: i nputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All financial assets and liabilities are valued at amortised cost.
There have been no transfers between levels in the year.
