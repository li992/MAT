RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES BACKGROUND The Group has four defined benefit schemes in the UK, the SEGRO Pension Scheme the SEGRO scheme, the Bilton Group Pension Scheme the Bilton scheme and two additional schemes following the acquisition of Brixton Ltd, the Brixton plc Pension Plan the Brixton scheme and the J Saville Gordon Group plc and Subsidiary Companies Retirement and Death Benefit Scheme the JSG scheme.
The assets of the schemes are held by Trustees separately from the assets of the employer.
The Group also has a number of defined contribution schemes for which 1.3 million has been recognised as an expense 2012: 1.3 million.
All four defined benefit schemes are closed to new members.
Valuation of the schemes has been based on the most recent actuarial valuations: 31 March 2010 for the SEGRO scheme, 5 April 2010 for the Bilton scheme, 31 December 2011 for the Brixton scheme and 30 June 2010 for the JSG scheme and updated by the independent actuaries in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31 December 2013.
The actuarial valuations for the SEGRO, Bilton and JSG schemes are expected to be completed in 2014.
Other than market and demographic risks, which are common to all retirement benefit schemes, there are no specific risks in the relevant benefit schemes which the Group considers to be significant or unusual.
Around 65 per cent of the schemes assets are held in bonds and gilts which are a broad hedge for the schemes liabilities including some which are index-linked.
It is the intention of each scheme to move to less risky, gilt and bond assets as the scheme matures to match the liabilities of the scheme.
