Strategic report Governance Financial statements Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 1.
General information Xaar plc the Company is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006.
The address of the registered office is given on the inside back cover.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activity is set out in the Strategic report starting on page 2.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty and critical accounting judgements The key assumptions concerning the future and other sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows: Asset valuations Throughout the year, management considers the carrying value of both receivables and inventory balances.
Provisions against both balances are made on the basis of past losses, current trading patterns and anticipated future events.
Provisions Management regularly consider the potential liabilities which may arise from product warranty claims, commercial disputes, restructuring or other activities which may result in future losses or charges.
Management create and maintain appropriate financial provisions based on specific known issues and underlying historical experience.
Impairment of goodwill The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis.
This requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.
Estimating a value-in-use amount requires management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
The carrying amount of goodwill at 31 December 2013 was 720,000 2012: 720,000.
Further details are given in note 13.
Impairment of trade investments The Group determines whether its trade investments are impaired at least on an annual basis.
Unquoted investments are evaluated against the opportunity for return through trading gains as a result of continuing to hold the investment.
An impairment review of trade investments was performed in 2012 and the carrying value of the trade investment held was deemed to be fully impaired and therefore as at 31 December 2012 and 2013 the carrying value was nil.
Further details are given in note 17.
Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as adopted for use in the European Union.
Therefore the Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Article 4 of the EU IAS regulation.
The financial information has been prepared on the basis of all applicable IFRS, including all International Accounting Standards IAS, Standing Interpretations Committee SIC interpretations and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB that are applicable to the financial period, as adopted by the European Union.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments.
The Group financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds 000 except when otherwise indicated.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on the retranslation of trading balances with subsidiaries with different functional currencies are reported in the income statement.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the strategic report on pages 8 to 11.
Notes 19, 20 and 23 include a description of the Groups objectives: policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources and through a diverse customer base is exposed not only to the Western economies but also China, India and Latin America.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, based on the Groups forecasts and projections for the next four years, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance.
For this reason, we continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
com 79 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2013 3.
Significant accounting policies continued Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of the cash-generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes, but gross of any tax withheld.
Sales of goods are recognised when all of the following conditions are satisfied: the Company has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods the Company retains neither a continuing managerial involvement to the degree normally associated with ownership, nor effective control over goods sold the amount of revenue can be measured reliably it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity: and the costs incurred, or to be incurred, in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
For sales of goods to a distributor with consignment stock arrangements, revenue is recognised at the point of sale by the distributor which is when the risks and rewards of ownership of inventory have transferred.
Development fees gained from joint development agreements are treated as income over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs.
Funding received for internally generated intangible assets is recognised on a straight-line basis to match the amortisation period of the related intangible fixed asset.
Royalties are recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the actual revenue trend in the most recent quarterly statements received from each licensee.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease, except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which the economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed.
Contingent rentals arising under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability.
The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
80 Xaar plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 3.
Significant accounting policies continued Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary assets and liabilities, and on the retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities, are included in the income statement for the period.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group may enter into forward contracts see page 83 for details of the Groups accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments.
For the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at the exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income and taken to the translation reserve.
Exchange differences on the translation of net investments are taken to the translation reserve of the applicable entity.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as sterling denominated assets and liabilities.
Government and EU grants Government and EU grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attached to them and that the grant will be received.
Government and EU grants relating to research and development are treated as income over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated after charging restructuring costs but before investment income and finance costs.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Payments made to state managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Groups obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
To the extent that the Group receives a tax deduction relating to share-based payment transactions, deferred tax is provided at the appropriate tax rate on the difference in value between the market price of the underlying equity as at the date of the financial statements and the exercise price of the outstanding share options.
As a result, the deferred tax impact of share options will not be derived directly from the expense reported in the consolidated income statement.
The amount by which the deductible difference exceeds the cumulative charge to the consolidated income statement is recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
com 81 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2013 3.
Significant accounting policies continued Taxation continued Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis and are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment is shown at original historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Assets in the course of construction for production or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other assets in the same class, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets, less their residual values, other than assets in the course of construction, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Leasehold property improvements ten years or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease Plant and machinery three to five years Furniture, fittings and equipment three to five years Motor vehicles three years Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Internally generated intangible assets research and development expenditure Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
In accordance with IAS 38 Intangible assets where a project has entered the development phase and is sufficiently self-contained that the expected future economic benefits can be traced directly to the assets developed within the project, it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity, and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably, the development costs related to the project will be capitalised as an intangible asset.
Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Other intangible assets Costs incurred in maintaining the patent and trademark portfolio are written off to the income statement as incurred.
Payments in respect of software, external product development costs and licence rights acquired are capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use.
In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is calculated using the first in, first out FIFO cost formula, by applying the standard cost methodology, with costs including direct materials, direct labour costs and an attributable proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal levels of activity that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where applicable.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
82 Xaar plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 3.
Significant accounting policies continued Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
Investments Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the time frame established by the market concerned and are initially measured at fair value, equating to cost, including transaction costs.
Investments are classified as available for sale, and on the basis that the investments have no active market and their fair values cannot be reliably determined using valuation techniques, the investments are carried at cost.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on an unquoted equity investment that is not carried at fair value because its fair value cannot be reliably measured, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset.
Bonds with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity dates that the Group has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity investments.
Held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using effective interest method less any impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash within a period of up to three months post balance sheet and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Treasury deposits Treasury deposits comprise demand deposits that are convertible to a known amount of cash with an original maturity of up to twelve months, which are due to mature more than three months after the balance sheet date and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
The accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out within the policy on derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting below.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Interest-bearing loans and bank overdrafts are measured initially at fair value, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in the income statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are measured at original cost.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and liquidity risk.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments primarily foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations relating to certain firm commitments and forecast transactions.
The Groups interest rate risk arises mainly from its funds invested in short term bank deposits.
To mitigate these risks, limits have been set by the Board in relation to maturity period and maximum deposits with any one institution.
In order to mitigate the Groups liquidity risks, the Group can choose to fund significant fixed asset purchases by finance leases repayable over a period of three to five years dependent on the individual asset being financed and interest-bearing loans.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provides written principles on the use of financial derivatives consistent with the Groups risk management strategy.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated as hedges of future cash flows and deemed to be effective are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
com 83 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2013 3.
Significant accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting continued Changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value, with gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted where the effect of the time value of money is material.
A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it, and the plan has reached a stage where the decision is unlikely to be reversed.
The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring, which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the entity.
Provisions for the expected cost of warranty obligations under local sale of goods legislation are recognised in the month of sale of the relevant products, at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the Groups obligation.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
These payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
The fair value of options issued under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan is measured using a stochastic Monte Carlo binomial model for grants made between 2007 and 2009 inclusive.
The fair value of all other equity-settled share-based payments is measured using the Black-Scholes pricing model.
The expected life used in these models has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
SAYE share options granted to employees are treated as cancelled when employees cease to contribute to the scheme.
This results in accelerated recognition of the expenses that would have arisen over the remainder of the original vesting period.
Own shares Own shares are deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own shares.

Significant accounting policies continued New standards and interpretations In the current year, the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted: IFRS 7 amended Disclosures Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities As the Group does not have any offsetting arrangements in place, the application of the amendments has had no impact on the disclosures or on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 amended Investment Entities IAS 36 amendments Recoverable Amount Disclosures of Non-Financial Assets IAS 39 amendments Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting IFRIC Interpretation 21 Levies The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods.

The Finance Act 2013, which provides for reductions in the main rate of corporation tax from 23% to 21% effective from 1 April 2014 and to 20% effective from 1 April 2015, was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013.
These rate reductions have been reflected in the calculation of deferred tax at the balance sheet date.
In 2013, the Company benefited from the enhanced tax deduction for research and development expenditure for three months of the year under the large company scheme, compared with the full year 2012 under the SME scheme.
The Company has opted into the research and development expenditure credit scheme from 1 April 2013, which is not a tax deduction and is taken as income included in operating profit.

For 2013, there were no anti-dilutive share options at the period end.
For 2012, there were share options granted over 477,752 shares that had not been included in the diluted earnings per share calculation because they were anti-dilutive at the period end.
For 2012, the performance conditions for share options granted over 35,191 shares were not met and therefore the dilutive effect of the number of shares which would have been issued at the period end was not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation.
There were no comparable anti-dilutive options or LTIPs to exclude from the current period diluted earnings per share calculation.

The calculation of adjusted EPS excluding share-based payment charges, exchange differences relating to the Swedish operations, the gain or loss on derivative financial instruments, non-recurring royalty income, and impairment of investments and associated loans is based on earnings of: 2013 2012 000 000 Earnings for the purposes of basic earnings per share being net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent 31,861 12,628 Share-based payment charges 4,204 1,542 Exchange differences relating to the Swedish operations 416 262 Loss on derivative financial instruments 9 4 Non-recurring royalty income 2,994 Impairment of investments and associated loans 1,401 Tax effect of adjusting items 376 349 Adjusted profit after tax 33,102 14,964 The denominators used are the same as those detailed above for both basic and diluted earnings per share.

Goodwill The carrying amount of goodwill at 31 December 2013 was 720,000 2012: 720,000.
There were no accumulated impairment losses at the end of the year.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows: 2013 2012 000 000 Printheads and related products a single CGU 720 720 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined from a value-in-use calculation.
The key assumptions to which the value-in-use calculation is most sensitive are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts reviewed by management for the next four years and these have been used in the value-in-use calculation.
The discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 8% 2012: 8% and reflects managements estimate of return on capital employed.
Sensitivity analysis has been completed on each key assumption in isolation and this indicates that reasonable changes in key assumptions on which we have based our determination of the recoverable amount would not cause the carrying amount of goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.
Having performed impairment testing, no impairment has been identified and therefore no impairment loss has been recognised in either period.

The charge in 2012 for the impairment of a trade investment relates to a minority stake in an inkjet solutions provider.
The full value of this investment was recognised as an impairment loss in the income statement in the prior period, within general and administrative expenses, as the value is no longer deemed recoverable.
Held-to-maturity investments represent investment in bonds returning interest at 3% per annum, which mature on 22 November 2018.

Trade receivables The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 24 days 2012: 32 days.
No interest is charged on the receivables for the period agreed in the Requirements Contract or, if not specified or applicable, the first 30 days from the date of the invoice.
Thereafter, the Group reserves the right to charge interest at a daily rate of the greater of either 3% per annum above the base rate of Barclays Bank plc from time to time, or the maximum rate of interest allowable under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts Interest Act 1998, on all sums outstanding until payment in full is received.
The Group has provided fully for all receivables over 120 days because historical experience is such that receivables that are past due beyond 120 days are generally not recoverable.
Trade receivables between 30 days and 120 days are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods, determined by reference to past default experience.

Other financial assets continued Trade receivables continued The maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount of the financial assets as disclosed on page 95.
Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customers credit quality and defines credit limits by customer.
Credit limits are reviewed at least once per year.
Letters of credit may be used.
Credit insurance has typically been taken out over the most significant customers.
Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, seven customers each represented greater than 5% of the total receivables balance, totalling 7.2 million 2012: 5.3 million.
The total due from these customers represents 49% 2012: 38% of the Groups revenue: there are no other customers who represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
Included in the Groups trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 1.7 million 2012: 1.1 million which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
Of these amounts, the Group is in possession of letters of credit to the value of 1,667,000 2012: 818,000 which had not reached maturity as at the reporting date.
The Group does not hold any other collateral over these balances.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.

Treasury deposits Treasury deposits comprise bank deposits with an original maturity of six months or less, which do not mature until more than three months after the balance sheet date.

Financial instruments Categories of financial instruments Financial assets of 14,770,000 2012: 11,759,000 are categorised as loans and receivables.
Financial liabilities of 22,496,000 2012: 13,770,000 are categorised as measured at amortised cost.
Derivative financial assets and liabilities are derived from quoted prices unaudited in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Financial risk management objectives The Groups policy is to manage the Groups financial risk, secure cost effective funding for the Groups operations and to minimise the adverse effects of fluctuations in the financial markets on the value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities, on reported profitability and on the cash flows of the Group.
The Group finances its activities with a combination of bank loans, finance leases, cash and fixed term deposits and forward contracts as deemed appropriate.
Other financial assets and liabilities, such as trade debtors and trade creditors, arise directly from the Groups operating activities.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions forward currency contracts.
The purpose is to manage the currency risks arising from the Groups operations.
It is Group policy that no trading in derivatives shall be undertaken.
Financial instruments give rise to foreign currency, interest rate, credit and liquidity risk.
The Groups management of its exposure to credit risk is discussed in note 19 and to liquidity risk is discussed in note 24.
Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to manage its cost of borrowing using fixed rate debt.
Whilst fixed rate interest-bearing debt is not exposed to cash flow interest rate risk, there is no opportunity for the Group to enjoy a reduction in borrowing costs in markets where rates are falling.
In addition, the fair value risk inherent in fixed rate borrowing means that the Group is exposed to unplanned costs should debt be restructured or repaid early as part of the liquidity management process.
The sensitivity analysis prepared below relates to cash balances, since borrowings are at fixed rates of interest.
The closing cash and cash equivalents, and treasury deposits balance at the year end have been used as the basis for the calculations.
A 2% increase or decrease represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 2% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 31 December 2013 would increase by 1.1 million or decrease by 0.4 million 2012: increase by 0.6 million decrease by 0.2 million.
This is mainly attributable to the Groups exposure to interest rates on its cash balances.
There would be no effect on equity reserves.
Foreign currency risk The Group receives approximately 5% of its revenues in US dollars and 25% of its revenue in Euros, which are partially naturally hedged by supplies in these currencies, but the remainder requires conversion into sterling in order to fund the remaining costs of the UK offices.
The Group has a manufacturing facility in Sweden which necessitates the need for the Group to convert sterling into Swedish kronor in order to fund the running costs of this manufacturing facility.
The Group may enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk, including forward contracts.

The following table demonstrates the Groups sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the sterling exchange rate against the relevant foreign currencies on the Groups profit before tax and equity due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets, liabilities and forward currency contracts.
10% represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible movement in exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.

The Group does not currently designate its foreign currency denominated debt as a hedging instrument for the purpose of hedging the translation of its foreign operations.
At 31 December 2013, the Group had open currency derivative assets of 6,000 2012: liabilities 4,000.
As at 31 December 2013 the Group held outstanding forward contracts to cover a proportion of the expected monthly currency exposures for the period January 2014 to February 2014.
In total the contracts represented a conversion of 2.4 million into 2.0 million.
Capital risk management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business, maximise shareholder value and provide flexibility for value enhancing investments.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions or as a result of corporate strategy.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
In addition, any potential value enhancing investments may be funded through additional debt instruments.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the current or prior year, except for the proposed increase in final dividend for 2013, as detailed in note 11 on page 91.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is determined as the proportion of debt to equity.
Debt is defined as long and short term borrowings.
Equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group attributable to the equity holders of the parent.
The Groups policy for its existing business is to use debt where appropriate, whilst maintaining the gearing ratio at a level under 10%.
The gearing ratio at the year end is as follows: 2013 2012 000 000 Bank loans 594 Obligations under finance leases and hire purchase contracts Net debt 594 Equity 110,042 74,119 Gearing ratio 0% 1% The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across different industries and geographical areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.

Liquidity risk The Group aims to mitigate liquidity risk by managing cash generation by its operations and applying cash collection targets throughout the Group.
Investment is carefully controlled, with authorisation limits operating up to Group Board level and cash payback periods applied as part of the investment appraisal process.
In this way the Group aims to maintain a good credit rating to facilitate fund raising.
In its funding strategy, the Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts, bank loans, finance leases and hire purchase contracts.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities by continually monitoring cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The Group is inherently a net generator of cash at the operating level.
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is only invested in financial instruments exposed to insignificant risk of changes in market value, being placed on interest-bearing deposit with maturities no more than 12 months allowed per the policy.
Short term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities.

Share-based payments Equity-settled share option scheme The Companys share option schemes are open to all employees of the Group.
Options are exercisable at a price equal to the average quoted market price of the Companys shares on the date of grant.
The standard vesting period is three years.
An option granted under the Xaar plc 2004 Share Option Plan before 2011 will be exercisable over shares with a market value at the date of grant not exceeding a persons annual salary if at the third anniversary of grant the EPS growth of the Company since grant has exceeded the growth in the Retail Prices Indent RPI over the same period by at least 12%.
To the extent that an option relates to shares with a market value as at the date of grant in excess of a persons annual salary, the option will be exercisable over all of the excess shares if EPS growth over this period has exceeded RPI growth by at least 15%.
For EPS performance between these two points, options will be exercisable over the excess shares on a sliding scale.
In addition, options can only be exercised if EPS is at least 5.5p for the financial year preceding the third anniversary of grant.
Performance may be retested once only from the date of grant to the fourth or fifth anniversary of grant at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, but the original EPS growth targets will be increased from 12 15% to 16 20% and 20 25% respectively.
The 5.5p target will apply for the final financial year in the extended period.
An option granted under the Xaar plc 2004 Share Option Plan from 2011 onwards will be exercisable over shares with a market value at the date of grant not exceeding a persons annual salary, if at the third anniversary of grant, Xaar plc has achieved positive adjusted profit before tax as shown in the consolidated income statement in the Companys Annual Report and Accounts for any of the three years ending during the vesting period.
One third of the shares subject to the option granted rounded to the nearest whole share, will vest based on the performance condition being met per year for each of the three years ending in the vesting period.
If the adjusted profit before tax as shown in the consolidated income statement in Xaar plcs Annual Report and Accounts for any relevant year is restated before the option becomes exercisable, the restated figure shall, unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, be applied in determining whether the above targets are met.
In addition, options shall only become exercisable in respect of any shares if the committee in its absolute discretion determines that the overall financial performance of Xaar plc over the performance period is satisfactory.
The Xaar 2007 Share Save Scheme provides an opportunity to all UK employees to save a set monthly amount currently up to 250 over three years towards the exercise of a discounted share option, which is granted at the start of the three years.
