Strategy and KPIs continued 1 Operate Maximise the potential of existing operations In 2013, we ramped up production at our newest What we said we would do in 2013 mines, Saucito and Noche Buena, optimised Optimise capacity and recovery rates by rening milling processes and increased ore throughput mining methods and beneficiation processes at Cinega, which has been in operation for Maintain attributable silver production at a stable 41 moz, including more than 20 years, and achieved a number of Silverstream: produce 490,000 ounces of attributable gold operating efficiencies that allowed us to mitigate Conclude construction of the Jarillas shaft cost pressures.
However, as a result of the events Commission the dynamic leaching plant at Herradura in 4Q 2013 related to the El Bajo litigation see pages 11 and Optimise the milling process at Cinega by reducing bottlenecks, increasing the volume of ore processed and maintaining production 64-69, we were unable to pursue our strategic levels at expected lower gold ore grades objectives at the Penmont mines.
Accelerate the leaching process in the pads at Soledad-Dipolos Replenish reserves Generate continuous improvements in productivity and cost controls Implement cost cutting and efficiency initiatives to mitigate the expected ination in operating materials, increased stripping ratios and longer haulage distance Leverage expansion opportunities Evaluate new and or expanded processing capacity in the Fresnillo district, including a 2,000 tpd extension to the current Fresnillo beneficiation plant, and a pyrites plant at Saucito to increase gold recoveries from Fresnillo and Saucito tailings Strategy in action The milling process at Cinega has been optimised and increased above its nominal capacity with the use of technology, the knowledge and experience of our personnel, and continuous investment in improvements at our facilities.
As a result, the size of the mineral fed to the mills is smaller, which improves the use ofreagents and thus lowers cost per tonne.

These effects were mitigated, and in the case of Cinega more than offset, by efficiencies achieved through economies of scale and cost reduction initiatives such as the use of wire mesh to optimise shotcreting, better operating controls that reduced consumption of materials such as steel balls for milling, and the optimised use of reagents.

2013 results Fresnillo: The decrease reects the additional number of contractors hired for development and backlling activities.
Saucito: The increase is due to the ramp-up of production and access to the Jarillas vein, which allowed for additional ore to be processed from development activities.
2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2011 2012 2013 Cienga and San Ramn: The increase is due to the optimisation of the milling process.

In 2012, ore from development activities and from upper parts of the pit was deposited at the leaching pads.

2013 results Silver reserves decreased by 4.3% primarily as a result of lower ore grade, reecting the change in price and development delays at Fresnillo: this was partially mitigated by increased reserves at Saucito.
Gold reserves decreased by 14.5% due mainly to the 2012 2013 2010 2011 2012 2013 reduced tonnage at Herradura and Soledad-Dipolos as a result of the new calculation methodology.
