Accounts N otes to the Group financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 In preparing the 2013 financial statements, we have grouped notes into sections under six key categories which are considered to be most relevant for shareholders and other users: 1.
Result for the year 3. Financing the Groups activities 4.
Company financial statements The key accounting policies have been incorporated throughout the notes to the financial statements adjacent to the disclosure to which they relate.
All accounting policies are included within an outlined box.
Where possible, wording has been simplified to provide clearer commentary on the financial performance of the Group.
1.0 Basis of preparation 1.1 General information Afren plc the Company, and together with its subsidiaries, the Group is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act.
The address of the registered office is Kinnaird House, 1 Pall Mall East, London SW1Y 5AU, England.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 2.2 and in the Chairmans statement and Chief Executives review and Operations review on pages 10, 16 and 40.
These financial statements are presented in US dollars because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 1.5.
1.2 Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments and oil inventory which is subject to certain commodity swap arrangements that have been measured at fair value.
1.3 Going concern The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the going concern basis of accounting.
The use of this basis of accounting takes into consideration the Groups current and forecast financing position, additional details of which are provided in the Going Concern section of the Directors Report.
1.4 Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company itssubsidiaries made up to 31 December each year.
During the year, the Group adopted a suite of new accounting standards, including IFRS10, IFRS 11, and IFRS 12.
The adoption of these standards resulted in a change in accounting policy for determining when control exists and consolidation should take place, which in turn resulted in a change in the control conclusion for the Groups interest in First Hydrocarbon Nigeria Company Limited FHN which led to the consolidation of FHN in the Group financial statements.
The Groups financial statements for 2012 have been restated to reflect this change in accounting policy, further details are provided in note 5.15.
The new accounting policy is as follows: Control is achieved where the Company has power over an investee, exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and ability to use its power to affect those returns.
The determination of whether control exists includes fide facto circumstances that give the Company power over the investee irrespective of the Groups shareholding.
Where the Group has an interest in a joint operation, those interests are accounted for using proportionate consolidation, under which the Group records its share of revenue, expenditure, assets and liabilities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of the acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of the subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
1.5 Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are maintained in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in US dollars which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentational currency for the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
For the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of each Group company are translated as required into US dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences if any arising are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expense in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
At present the Group has no subsidiaries with functional currencies other than US dollars.
Afren plc 116 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Accounts 1.6 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described above and in Sections 2 to 5, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The following are the critical judgements and key assumptions made by the Directors, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that may have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Carrying value of oil and gas assets and goodwill Management assesses the Groups oil and gas assets for indicators of impairment at least annually, with reference to indicators in IAS 36 and tests goodwill for impairment at least annually irrespective of whether or not there are any indicators of impairment.
Note4.4 discloses the carrying value of tangible oil and gas assets and details of the key assumptions used, which include a production profile based on managements best estimate of proven and probable reserves of the assets, an internal oil price profile benchmarked to mean analysts consensus and a 10% pre-tax discount rate which, taking into account other assumptions used in the calculation, management considers to be reflective of the risks.
Intangible exploration and evaluation assets Management assesses impairment in respect of intangible exploration and evaluation assets with reference to indicators in IFRS 6 and the specific facts and circumstances of each asset.
Note 4.3 discloses the carrying value of such assets.
In making the assessment, management is required to make judgements on the status of each project and the future plans towards finding commercial reserves.
The nature of exploration and evaluation activity is such that only a proportion of projects are ultimately successful and some assets are likely to become impaired in future periods.
Amounts due to participants in fields Included within Trade and other payables described in note 5.5 to the financial statements is a balance at 31 December 2013 of US$366.0million of Other creditors and operating Partners due under the contractual agreements through which the Group participates inits fields 31 December 2012: US$193.1 million.
In calculating certain amounts included within this balance, aspects of these agreements can be unclear and potentially open to interpretation and negotiation, for example, the levels of costs which will be agreed as recoverable capital expenditure, levels of allowable overhead orfinancing charges allocable to individual assets.
Management has recorded such amounts at its best estimate, having considered a range ofreasonably possible outcomes.
However, this estimation uncertainty could potentially lead to a material gain or loss in future periods, asand when the interpretation of the underlying agreements is confirmed with the relevant counterparties.
Share-based payments Management is required to make assumptions in respect of the fair value of share-based payments in issue, in respect of the inputs used tocalculate the fair values of these contracts.
Details of these can be found in note 5.8.
Decommissioning Provision for environmental clean-up and associated costs depend on the legal requirements at the date of decommissioning, the costs and timing of work and the discount rate to be applied.
Decommissioning provisions are updated each year to reflect managements best estimates of future cost estimates and timings.
Taxation and royalties The application of tax legislation in jurisdictions in which the Group operates can be uncertain and subject to interpretation.
Afren calculates the tax charge for the period using the latest information available, taking external advice where necessary, in order to arrive at our best estimate of the final tax position.
During the year, key judgements were made by management related to the assumptions used in accounting for the effects of a tax exemption for the Ebok asset in Nigeria.
Judgements are required when estimating the future unwinding of temporary differences and the relevant tax rates at which temporary differences will unwind for the purposes of valuing deferred tax assets and liabilities.
These estimates will be updated at each reporting period.
Revisions to our tax liabilities either upward or downward may occur as the Groups tax filings and royalties are agreed with the relevant authorities in future periods.
Our tax charge and estimate of our tax liabilities is disclosed in note 2.3.
Adoption of IFRS 10 As explained in notes 1.4 and 5.1, the Group adopted IFRS 10 during 2013.
The most significant test in determining whether a control relationship exists under the Groups previous accounting policy under IAS 27, was whether the Group had a shareholding of over 50%.
One key change in IFRS 10 is a new requirement for an investor to consider whether it has fide facto power over an investee: this is relevant for the decision regarding the treatment of FHN.
Although Afren had a minority shareholding of FHN, the other shareholders were relatively widely dispersed and there was no evidence of them organising their interests in such a way that they could exercise more votes than Afren as minority shareholder.
Therefore under IFRS 10 this was one of the indicators, when forming a consolidation conclusion, that Afren controlled FHN when the shareholding was below 50%.
Under IAS 27 a holding of over 50% was a more significant test.
Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 117 Accounts N otes to the Group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2013 2.0 Result for the year This section focuses on the results and performance of the Group.
On the following pages are disclosures explaining the Groups results fortheyear, segmental information, taxation, normalised profit before tax and earnings per share.
2.1 Revenues Revenue represents the sales value, net of VAT and royalties paid in kind or where the financial obligation does not fall directly to Afren, ofthe Groups share of oil liftings in the year.
Oil revenue is recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
Following the Groups reclassification of its interest in the CI-11 block and Lion Gas Plant as a discontinued operation, and its subsequent disposal note5.14, the Group revenue no longer includes gas revenue.
Oil revenue for the year are set out in the table below: Restated 2013 2012 US$m US$m Oil revenue 1,644.3 1,571.4 Total 1,644.3 1,571.4 2.2 Segmental reporting a Geographical segments The Group operates in three geographical markets which form the basis of the information evaluated by the Groups chief operating decisionmaker: Nigeria and other West Africa, East Africa and the Kurdistan region of Iraq.
This is the basis on which the Group records its primary segment information.
Unallocated operating expenses, assets and liabilities relate to the general management, financing and administration ofthe Group.
Comparative information for 2012 has been restated to reflect the consolidation of FHN on adoption of IFRS 10.
FHN is included in the Nigeria and other West Africa segment.
Assets in Cte dIvoire, which were sold during 2013 note 5.14, are included in the Nigeria and other WestAfrica segment for management purposes but have been deducted in a separate column in the analysis below to enable a reconciliation to the income statement.
The results of these assets are disclosed as discontinued operations in the income statement.

Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 119 Accounts N otes to the Group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2013 b Business segments The operations of the Group comprise one class of business, being oil and gas exploration, development and production.
2.3 Taxation The Group is subject to various forms of taxation in the countries in which it operates.
These include income tax on profits, royalties on production, sales taxes on revenues generated, and payroll taxes on benefits to employees.
a Income tax credit expense The income tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax, and includes a credit in respect of the reversal of prior year taxes no longer expected to be payable, and recognition of deferred tax assets described further below.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheetdate.

Afren Resources Limited, the subsidiary which holds Afrens interest in the Ebok asset, will benefit from the award of a five-year tax exemption which is effective from thecommencement of commercial production until May 2016.
As a result, no income tax will be payable in respect of the 2011-2016 period and therefore the provision for all current tax provided for up to the point of confirming the five-year tax exemption has been reversed in the current period resulting in a current tax credit of US$254.3 million and a deferred tax credit of US$192.7 million.
The Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of US$97.5 million, representing the expected future tax benefit of depreciation charged in excess of capital allowances claimed to date.
During 2013, the Group agreed to make payments of US$300.0 million in relation to amending the structure of its partnerships, one of the principal benefits of which is securing future tax benefits relating to the rights to capital allowances available for future utilisation.
Afren plc 120 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Accounts b Deferred taxation Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates of tax expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
i Recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities The Groups deferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following: 2013 2012 Assets US$m US$m Property, plant and equipment 88.3 Decommissioning provision 9.2 Deferred tax assets 97.5 Restated 2013 2012 Liabilities US$m US$m Property, plant and equipment 115.8 470.6 Intangible oil and gas assets 39.8 39.8 Decommissioning provision 2.3 14.7 Tax losses 24.0 6.7 Other temporary differences 17.0 11.4 Deferred tax liabilities 146.3 477.6 Net deferred tax liabilities 48.8 477.6 At 1 January 2013 Credit charge for the year Effect of tax exemption Tax allowances secured At 31 December 2013 Analysis of movement during the year 2013 US$m US$m US$m US$m US$m Assets Property, plant and equipment 88.3 88.3 Decommissioning provision 9.2 9.2 Deferred tax asset 97.5 97.5 Liabilities Property, plant and equipment 470.6 46.6 201.0 200.2 115.8 Intangible oil and gas assets 39.8 39.8 Decommissioning provision 14.7 1.7 10.7 2.3 Tax losses 6.7 17.3 24.0 Other temporary differences 11.4 30.8 2.4 17.0 Deferred tax liability 477.6 61.6 192.7 200.2 146.3 Net Deferred tax liability 477.6 61.6 192.7 297.7 48.8 At 1 January 2012 Charge credit for the year At 31 December 2012 Restated Analysis of movement during the year 2012 US$m US$m US$m Liabilities Property, plant and equipment 209.1 261.5 470.6 Intangible oil and gas assets 39.8 39.8 Decommissioning provision 12.6 2.1 14.7 Tax losses 8.4 1.7 6.7 Other temporary differences 1.6 9.8 11.4 226.3 251.3 477.6 ii Unrecognised deferred tax assets At the balance sheet date the Group also had tax losses primarily arising in the UK of US$297.5 million 2012: US$141.3 million in respect of which a deferred tax asset has not been recognised as there is insufficient evidence of future taxable profits against which these tax losses could be recovered.
Such losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 121 Accounts N otes to the Group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2013 The Group had temporary differences of US$23.3 million 2012: US$12.5 million in respect of share-based payments, property, plant and equipment and pensions in respect of which deferred tax assets have not been recognised as there is insufficient evidence of future taxable profits against which these tax losses could be recovered.
Deferred tax has not been recognised on undistributed earnings of subsidiaries as the largest proportion of dividends would be from subsidiaries where no additional tax would be applied on dividend income.
2.4 Reconciliation of profit before tax to normalised profit before tax Normalised profit before tax is a non-IFRS measure of financial performance of the Group, which in managements view provides a better understanding of the Groups underlying financial performance.
This may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by othercompanies.
The table below reconciles the IFRS profit before tax from continuing operations to the normalised profit before tax: Restated 2013 2012 Notes US$m US$m Profit before tax from continuing operations 318.1 568.9 Unrealised losses on derivative financial instruments 3.3 4.2 20.0 Finance costs on settlement of borrowings 54.6 1.8 Share-based payment charge 25.6 29.4 Foreign exchange gains 3.6 0.1 Fair value gain loss on financial liabilities and assets 3.3 3.5 2.5 Share of joint venture impairment losses profits 4.7 26.6 0.3 Impairment of exploration and evaluation assets 4.3 60.5 15.0 Normalised profit before tax 482.5 637.2 2.5 Earnings per ordinary share Earnings per share EPS is the amount of post-tax profit attributable to each share.
Where a profit or loss in the period from a discontinued operation has occurred, this profit or loss is factored into the EPS calculation in order to present a Group result from continuing operations.
Basic EPS from continuing operations is calculated on the Groups profit for the year from continuing operations attributable to equity shareholders of US$478.3 million 2012: US$200.5 million divided by 1,090.8 million 2012: 1,080.8 million being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
Diluted EPS takes into account the dilutive effect of all share options and warrants being exercised.

The Directors determine the appropriate capital structure of Afren: specifically, how much is raised from shareholders equity and how much is borrowed from financial institutions debt in order to finance the Groups business strategy, both now and in the future and to maximise shareholder value.
The Directors consider that debt and equity are both capital, and managing net debt as disclosed below is the key strategy for managing capital.
The Directors consider the Groups capital structure and funding requirements a minimum of twice a year ahead of announcing results in the context of the Groups ability to continue as a going concern and deliver its business strategy.
The Groups funding requirements are met through a combination of debt, equity and operational cash flow.
3.1 Net debt and cash flow commitments Key cash flow activity in the year The Group invested US$765.0 million in exploration and evaluation activities, and in developing its oil and gas assets, funded from operating cashflow.
US$109.0 million was invested in acquiring additional equity in FHN, bringing the Groups interest to 78% by 31 December 2013 furtherdetails are provided in note 5.10.
In December 2013, the Group raised US$360.0 million from the issue of senior secured notes, with a seven-year term.
The proceeds were used to repurchase US$246.6 million of the 2016 senior secured notes and US$50.0 million of the 2019 senior secured notes.
During the year the Group also repaid the US$50.0 million corporate facility and US$101.3 million FHN acquisition and development facility.
Net debt Net debt is the key measure by which the Group monitors its funding.
Net debt is defined as borrowings, less finance lease liabilities and cash and cash equivalents.

The facility has a three-year term and bears interest at LIBOR plus 4.25%.
The new facility replaces the previous facility.
The new extended facility will be used to fund ongoing capital expenditure and general corporate requirements, including Group loans.
b Socar facility In August 2011, the Group entered into a US$50.0 million facility agreement the Socar facility with Socar Trading S. A.
The Socar facility had a term of the earlier of i 23 months from the date of the agreement July 2013 or ii 90 days from the date that Afrens Ebok Crude Oil Purchase Contract with Socar terminates the later of 4 September 2012 or the cumulative lifting of 18.5 mmbbl of crude oil from the Ebokfield.
The facility was repaid in full on 5 July 2013. c 2016 Notes In January and February 2011, the Group completed its first bond issue and raised US$500.0 million before issue costs.
The Notes, which are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, are guaranteed on a senior basis by certain subsidiaries of Afren plc and on a senior subordinated basis by Afren Resources Limited.
In December 2013, the Group repurchased US$247.0 million of the 2016 notes, funded by the issue of 2020 Senior Secured loan notes.
d 2019 Notes In March 2012, the Group completed its second bond issue raising US$300.0 million before issue costs.

Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 123 Accounts N otes to the Group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2013 e 2020 Notes In December 2013, the Group completed its third bond issue raising US$360.0 million before issue costs.
f Convertible loan notes On 5 July 2013, the Group redeemed convertible loan notes issued by First Hydrocarbon Nigeria Company Limited FHN in 2011.
US$50.0million ofsenior unsecured unsubordinated convertible notes were issued by FHN in September 2011 to fund ongoing development activities.
Theloan notes could have been converted to shares in FHN at any time from the date of issue until maturity 2017 in minimum tranches of US$5.0 million, at a conversion price of US$1.85 per share, which equated to approximately 27 million FHN shares.
If not previously repaid or redeemed, the notes would have been redeemed by FHN at maturity at a premium of 200% of the par value of the notes.
The notes were redeemed for US$62.5 million resulting in an accounting gain of US$0.3 million, which is included in finance income.
g Cash and cash equivalents The cash flow statement on page 114 gives a breakdown of cash movements in the year.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held by the Group in the form of short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less and earn interest at respective short-term deposit rates.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2013 includes US$19.7 million 2012: US$28.5 million that is restricted.
Contracted cash flow commitments The Group uses both shortand long-term projected cash flows to monitor funding requirements for the Groups activities.
Cash flow projections take into consideration the Groups debt financing plans and covenant compliance.
The table below analyses the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities borrowings, finance lease liabilities, trade and other payables and deferred consideration by when they fall due for payment.
The values in the table are based on undiscounted cash flows on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The values are greater than the values in the net debt table note 3.1 as they include contractual forecast interest payments.
The non-interest bearing category in the table below comprises trade and other payables and deferred consideration on acquisitions.

These typically have a fixed interest rate and are for a fixed term.
The interest and other costs payable on these borrowings are shown in note 3.6.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equityinstruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Borrowings including senior loan notes are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings.
Interest is calculated by applying the coupon rate to the redemption value.
Convertible loan notes are regarded as compound instruments consisting of a liability component and an equity component.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
Thedifference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible loan notes and the fair value assigned to the liability component represents the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the issuing entity and is included in equity.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible loan notes based on their relative carrying amounts at the date of issue.
The portion relating to the equity is charged directly against equity.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated based on the effective interest rate and is recognised in the income statement.

Its value changes over time in response to changes to the underlying variables such ascrude oil price.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
If the Group does not apply hedge accounting to the derivatives, gains and losses arising out of changes in fair value of these instruments together with settlements in the period are accounted for in other operating income expense in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
If the Group hedge accounts for the derivatives, each period the portion of the gains and losses on the cash flow hedging instruments that is determined to be an effective hedge is taken to equity other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion, as well as any change intime value, is recognised in the income statement.
Third-party valuations are used to value the Groups derivatives.
The Group has the following derivatives: Purpose Hedge accounting Commodity deferred put options cash flow hedges a Hedge against the price of crude oil falling Yes Interest rate swap b To link interest payments to the performance of certain indices No that look to take advantage of a theoretical bias in the forward curve Foreign exchange hedge c Hedge against changes in the USD GBP exchange rate No a Commodity deferred put options The Group will receive a minimum amount if the market price of crude oil falls.
These instruments have been classified as cash flow hedges, with a portion of the gains and losses on the instruments that are determined to be an effective hedge taken to equity and the ineffective portion, as well as any change in time value, recognised in the income statement for each period.
During the year, a loss of US$30.8 million 2012: US$49.1 million loss was charged to the income statement in relation to these instruments.
Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 125 Accounts N otes to the Group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2013 b Interest rate swap The Group entered into interest rate swap contracts whereby it receives a fixed rate and pays a floating rate with a downside cap up to a maximum of 2% above the fixed rate coupon.

All other leases are classified as operating leases.
For a finance lease, an asset and corresponding liability is recognised on the balance sheet.
No asset or liability is recognised for an operating lease.
Finance lease assets are recognised at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined atthe inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the leasor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance expenses are recognised immediately in the income statement, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Groups general policy on borrowingcosts.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis, such as a unit of production method, is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability.
The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
Obligations under finance lease The Group has a seven-year lease of a Mobile Offshore Production Unit MOPU and a Floating Storage Offloading Vessel FSO from Mercator Offshore Nigeria Limited in respect of the production operations of the Ebok field, offshore Nigeria.
The carrying amount of the Groups lease obligations approximates its fair value.
For the year ended 31 December 2013, the effective interest rate was 6% 2012: 6%.
The amounts reported in the balance sheet relating to finance leases mature as follows: Afren plc 126 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Accounts 2013 2012 Obligations under finance leases US$m US$m Including interest Amounts payable under finance leases: Within one year 27.9 26.5 In the second to fifth years inclusive 85.9 113.2 Less: future finance charges 14.0 22.3 Present value of lease obligations 99.8 117.4 Excluding interest Amounts payable under finance leases: Within one year 22.1 19.3 In the second to fifth years inclusive 77.7 98.1 Present value of lease obligations 99.8 117.4 No amounts were due after five years as at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012.

The so called cash box method of effecting an issue of shares for cash is commonplace and enabled the Company to issue shares without giving rise toany share premium.
Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 127 Accounts N otes to the Group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2013 3.6 Finance costs and income Financial costs of debt are allocated to periods over the term of the related debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Arrangement fees and issue costs are deducted from the debt proceeds on initial recognition of the liability and are amortised and charged to the income statement as finance costs over the term of the debt.
Borrowing costs, including interest on loans, which are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost ofthose assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Capitalised borrowing costs are amortised in line with the underlying asset.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.

Afren plc 128 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Accounts 4.0 Oil and gas activities This section shows the assets used to generate the Groups trading performance and the liabilities incurred as a result.
Liabilities relating to the Groups financing activities are addressed in Section 3.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are shown in note 2.3.
On the following pages there are disclosures showing intangible and tangible oil and gas assets, capital commitments, inventories, interests inother entities and contingent liabilities.
Other working capital balances are shown in Section 5.
4.1 Licences summary The Group has interests in oil and gas licences at the three different stages of the operational work programme cycle exploration, appraisal and development, and production.
Further details on each licence and the stage of the work programme can be found on pages 40 to 61 andon page 152.
The classifications reflect the stage of each work programme from an operational perspective as explained further in the Operations review.
The classification within the financial statements may be different due to the criteria for determining when the work programme has moved from exploration intangible oil and gas assets to development and then to production both categories tangible oil and gas assets being different under accounting standards.
4.2 Oil and gas reserves Commercial reserves are proven and probable oil and gas reserves also commonly referred to as 2P reserves, which are defined as the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological, geophysical and engineering data demonstrate with a specified degree of certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs and which are considered commercially producible.
There should be a 50% statistical probability that the actual quantity of recoverable reserves will be more than the amount estimated asproven and probable reserves and a 50% statistical probability that it will be less.
The Groups commercial reserves as at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2013 are detailed in the table on page 154 of this Annual Report and Accounts.
These commercial reserves are stated on a working interest basis, and have been prepared in accordance with the definitions and guidelines set forth in the 2007 PRMS approved by the Society of Petroleum Engineers SPE.
The commercial reserves are unaudited.
The commercial reserves are used in a number of ways in the financial statements: in particular: 1 to assess whether a prospect is commercially viable, and therefore support that the recoverable amount of oil and gas assets both intangible and property, plant and equipment continue to exceed the carrying amount of the assets: and 2 in the calculation of depletion of the property, plant and equipment: oil and gas assets.
4.3 Intangible exploration and evaluation assets The Group follows the successful efforts method of accounting for intangible exploration and evaluation costs.
All licence acquisition, exploration and evaluation costs are initially capitalised as intangible fixed assets in cost centres by field or exploration area, as appropriate, pending determination of commerciality of the relevant property.
Directly attributable administration costs are capitalised insofar as they relate to specific exploration activities.
Pre-licence costs and general exploration costs not specific to any particular licence or prospect are expensed as incurred.

Additions during 2012 included US$68.0 million in respect of the Okoro East Field Extension in Nigeria, all of which was transferred from intangible exploration and evaluation assets to tangible oil and gas assets.
Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 129 Accounts N otes to the Group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2013 b Transfer to property, plant and equipment: oil and gas assets Non-current assets are tested for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed the recoverable amount.
Such triggering events are defined in IFRS 6 in respect of exploration and evaluation assets and include the point at which determination is made as to whether commercial reserves exist.
If prospects are deemed to be commercially viable on completion of the evaluation, the attributable costs are transferred to property, plantand equipment in single field cost centres.
Prospects deemed to be commercially viable, and transferred to property, plant and equipment during 2012, primarily related to the Okoro Field Extension as disclosed in a above.
As part of this assessment in 2012, management performed an impairment test upon its Okoro asset, on transfer from intangible exploration and evaluation assets.
This test compared the carrying value of the assets at the balance sheet date with the expected discounted cash flows from each project.
For the discounted cash flows to be calculated, management used a production profile based on its best estimate of proven and probable reserves of the assets and a range of assumptions, including an internal oil price profile benchmarked to mean analysts consensus and a 10% pre-tax discount rate which, taking into account other assumptions used in the calculation, management considers to be reflective of the risks.
c Exploration costs written off If prospects are deemed to be impaired unsuccessful on making the above determination as to whether commercial reserves exist, theassociated costs are charged to the income statement.
Restated 2013 2012 US$m US$m Exploration costs written off 60.5 15.0 Amounts written off in 2013 relate to the cumulative costs of Block 10A in Kenya, following the decision to relinquish the block, and the Groups cumulative costs on the La Noumbi licence in Congo Brazzaville.
Kola 1 and Kola 2 were drilled in the year and, following conclusion that the wells were unsuccessful, they were plugged and abandoned.
4.4 Property, plant and equipment Oil and gas assets Development assets are costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves and to provide facilities for extracting, treating, gathering and storing oil and gas.
Examples include costs incurred to gain access to and prepare well locations for drilling: drill development wells, including cost of platforms and well equipment: acquire, construct, and install production facilities such as ease flow lines, separators, treaters, and heaters: and other items as appropriate.
Intangible exploration and evaluation assets are transferred into development assets once the property has proved reserves and a development plan approved by all relevant parties including, where applicable, thegovernment.
Production assets are those properties which have begun producing.
These assets are typically development properties which are transferred into the production portfolio or through acquisition of a subsidiary.
Once commercial production starts on a development asset, the property is reclassified as a production asset and depletion of the property commences.
Other property, plant and equipment assets Other property, plant and equipment comprises the Groups investment in leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment and computer hardware and software, and is stated at cost less depreciation and any provision for impairment.
a Additions Additions during the year included capital expenditure in respect of the Ebok field of US$274.1 million, Okoro development of US$104.1 million, OML 26 field of US$7.9 million and Barda Rash field of US$224.1 million.
Additions during 2012 included capital expenditure in respect of the Ebok field of US$204.4 million and Barda Rash field of US$121.1 million.
In addition, US$68.0 million relating to the Okoro Field Extension was transferred from intangible exploration and evaluation assets to development during the year.
b Provision for decommissioning A provision for decommissioning the oil and gas assets is recognised in full when the related facilities are installed.
The extent to which a provision is required depends on the legal requirements for decommissioning, the costs and timing of work and the discount rate tobeapplied.
The provision represents the present value of the decommissioning costs relating to Ebok, Okoro and OML 26 fields that are expected to be incurred up to 2033.
Following the disposal of the Groups interest in CI-11, the related provision was released.
The table below details the movements in the provision.

The amount recognised is the estimated cost of decommissioning, discounted to its net present value, and is reassessed eachyear in accordance with local conditions and requirements, reflecting managements best estimates.
Additions during the year relate to provisions for abandonment of additional wells drilled at the Ebok field.
Management believe the estimates continue to form a reasonable basis for the expected future costs of decommissioning, which are expected to be incurred up to 2033.
Changes in the estimated timing of decommissioning or decommissioning cost estimates are dealt with prospectively by recording anadjustment to the provision and a corresponding adjustment to property, plant and equipment.
The unwinding of the discount on the decommissioning is included as a finance cost.
c Transfer from development to production Transfers from development to production in 2012 include a portion of the Okoro Field Extension of US$45.1 million.
d Depreciation, depletion and amortisation Oil and gas assets Oil and gas assets are amortised from the commencement of production on a unit of production basis, which is the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves, generally on a field by field basis.
Costs used in the unit of production calculation comprise the net book value of capitalised costs plus the estimated future field development costs.
Changes in the estimates of commercial reserves or future field development costs are dealt with prospectively.
The gas plant was being depreciated straight line over six and a quarter years but was sold in the year.
Included in the depletion, depreciation and amortisation charge during the year is US$28.8 million 2012: US$32.4 million attributable to the assets under finance lease in respect of the Ebok field.
Other property, plant and equipment Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of the property, plant and equipment, less anticipated disposal proceeds, ona straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic life as follows: Leasehold improvements life of lease Fixtures and equipment over three years all artwork paintings depreciated over 15 years Computer hardware and software over three years Impairment Non-current assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverableamount.
Where there has been an indication of a possible impairment, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of the asset by comparison with the estimated discounted future net cash flows based on managements expectation of future production, oil prices and costs.
Any impairment identified is charged to the income statement as additional depletion and amortisation.
Where conditions giving rise to impairment subsequently reverse, the effect of the impairment is also reversed as a credit to the income statement, net of any depreciation that would have been charged since the impairment.
As part of this assessment, management carried out a review of all property, plant and equipment and oil and gas assets.
No impairment indicators were noted 2012: no impairment indicators noted.
4.5 Capital commitments As at 31 December, the Group has committed to the following capital expenditure, but as the related assets have not been received as at that date, no liability is recognised in the financial statements.

The inventory subject to this swap is recorded at its fair value.
Spare parts and materials inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Costs comprise direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
The cash flows associated with the purchase of spare parts and materials are classified in investment activities with the oil and gas assets.
Netrealisable value represents the estimated selling price less costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Lifting or offtake arrangements for oil and gas produced in certain of the Groups jointly owned operations are such that each participant may not receive and sell its precise share of the overall production in each period.
The resulting imbalance between cumulative entitlement and cumulative production is underlift or overlift.
Underlift and overlift are valued at market value and included within debtors and creditors respectively.
Movements during an accounting period are adjusted through cost of sales such that gross profit is recognised on an entitlements basis.

4.7 Interests in other entities Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity.
Joint arrangements are those arrangements where the Group shares joint control.
Such arrangements may be classified as either a joint venture the Group has an interest in the net assets of the jointly controlled entity, or a joint operation the Group has joint rights to the assets and joint obligations for the liabilities of the joint arrangement.
The Group applies equity accounting for joint ventures and proportional consolidation forjoint operations.
a Subsidiaries A list of the significant investments in subsidiaries, including the name, country of incorporation, and proportion of ownership interest is given in note 6.2 to the Companys separate financial statements.
Details of the non-controlling interest in subsidiaries which are not wholly-owned are provided in note 5.10. b Joint ventures The Group has an interest in two joint ventures.
During the year, the Group recognised a loss from its share in joint ventures of US$26.6 million.
The loss comprises the write-off of the Groups interest in joint ventures of US$8.4 million and impairment of amounts receivable from the joint venture of US$18.2 million.
This predominantly relates to the impairment of exploration and evaluation assets in respect of JDZBlock1.
During the year, as a result of adopting IFRS 11, the Group changed the accounting for these interests from proportional consolidation toequity accounting.
The effects of this change are described further in note 5.15.

In our view, these disclosures are less important and or material to the core operations of Afren, or other one off events, and as such they have been grouped in Section 5.
5.1 Adoption of new and revised standards The following accounting standards were all adopted as of their effective date which was 1 January 2013: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IAS 27 revised Separate Financial Statements IAS 28 revised Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures Where necessary the 2012 and 2011 comparatives have been restated to reflect the impact of the adoption of the above accounting standards details are provided in note 5.15 Effect of change in accounting policies.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments had not been endorsed by the European Union as at 31 December 2013 and so has not been adopted early.
5.2 Audit and non-audit fees Restated 2013 2012 US$m US$m An analysis of auditors remuneration is as follows: Fees payable to the Companys auditor for the audit of the Companys annual accounts 0.5 0.4 Fees payable to the Companys auditor and their associates for other services to the Group: The audit of the Companys subsidiaries pursuant to legislation 0.5 0.5 Total audit fees 1.0 0.9 Audit related assurance services 0.3 0.3 Taxation compliance services 0.1 Other taxation advisory services 0.1 Corporate finance services 0.9 Total non-audit fees 1.2 0.5 Audit related assurance services in 2013 include the fees related to the auditors reviews of the Groups interim and quarterly reporting.
Fees paid to Deloitte for audit and other services to the Company are not disclosed in its individual accounts as the Group accounts are required to discuss such fees on a consolidated basis.
During the year, external auditors performed a significant amount of non-audit work on projects such as the acquisition of a beneficial interest of 10.4% in FHN and the issuing of Senior Secured Notes.
This is work external auditors would ordinarily perform for companies involved insuch projects.
5.3 Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty most commonly a customer will default on its contractual obligations for example default oninvoice payment resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group reviews the credit risk of the entities that it sells its products to or that it enters into contractual arrangements with and will obtain guarantees and commercial letters of credit as may be considered necessary where risks are significant to the Group.
The Groups sales are diversified in terms of both region and the number of counterparties and, other than transactions with major oil companies with high credit rating and balances due from its partners, the Group does not have significant exposure to any single counterparty or group of counterparties with similar characteristics.
The credit risk on cash is limited because the majority is deposited with banks with good credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies or with governmental guarantee.
The Groups total maximum exposure to credit risk as at 31 December 2013 was US$545.7 million 2012: US$909.3 million made up of cash and bank balances and trade and other receivables excluding prepayments.
Afren plc 134 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Accounts 5.4 Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at the value of the invoice sent to the customer and subsequently at the amounts considered recoverable amortised cost.

Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 135 Accounts N otes to the Group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2013 5.6 Fair values The financial instruments on the Afren balance sheet are measured at either fair value or amortised cost.
The following table provides an analysis of carrying amounts and fair values of the Groups financial instruments.
Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade creditors, other creditors, finance leases and accruals and deferred consideration and payables on acquisitions have been excluded from this analysis as their fair values are equal to the carrying values.
The financial instruments in the table are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the inputs used to calculate the fair value are observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
Carrying amount Fair value Restated Restated 2013 2012 2013 2012 Carried at Level Notes US$m US$m US$m US$m Financial assets Available for sale investment Fair value 1 1.3 0.9 1.3 0.9 Derivative financial instruments Fair value 2 0.1 0.1 1.4 0.9 1.4 0.9 Financial liabilities Derivative financial instruments Fair value 2 45.3 41.0 45.3 41.0 Derivatives over own equity Amortised cost 3 iii 52.3 20.4 43.5 9.4 Borrowings Ebok RBL Amortised cost 2 i 204.2 184.6 229.3 179.2 Borrowings FHN Amortised cost 2 i 77.3 80.0 Borrowings Socar Amortised cost 2 i 49.6 49.7 Loan notes Amortised cost 1 ii 847.6 779.1 936.1 927.5 1,226.6 1,074.7 1,334.2 1,206.8 Notes: i Bank borrowings: Fair values have been determined by reference to LIBOR forward curves and by discounting future cash outflows at 10%.
ii Transfer between levels: As at 31 December 2012 the fair value of the Loan notes was determined using discounted future cash flows and stated at US$988.6 million.
As the Loan notes are actively traded on the Luxembourg Bourse stock exchange, it is considered more appropriate to disclose the fair value at the prevailing market price as at the close of business on the reporting date.
The Loan notes have therefore been reclassified from Level 2 to Level 1.
The impact of this reclassification has been to reduce the fair value at 31 December 2012 by US$61.1 million from US$988.6 million to US$927.5 million.
There is no effect on the amount reported in the balance sheet.
iii Relates to FHN options which are classified at Level 3.
As such their valuation requires assumptions regarding FHNs share price which isnot readily available.
These options were valued using a Black Scholes model for which changing certain inputs to reflect reasonable possible alternative assumptions does not change the fair value significantly.
5.7 Sensitivity analysis Interest rate risk The risk of the Group being adversely affected by a 1% change in interest rates was not material in 2013 or 2012.
Oil price risk The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in oil price relates primarily to the Groups derivative financial instruments.
The terms of the derivative financial instruments are such that the Group will receive a minimum amount if the market falls, but will receive a set discount from the market price if the oil price is above that minimum.
The effect on Group result and equity of changes in the oil price on the fair value ofthe derivative financial instruments is as follows: Restated Positive adverse 2013 Positive adverse 2012 US$m US$m Increase in oil price by 10% 2.9 8.7 Decrease in oil price by 10% 6.2 14.8 Foreign exchange risk The impact of a 10% change in the sterling or the Nigerian Naira to US dollar exchange rate was not material in 2013 or 2012.
Afren plc 136 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Accounts 5.8 Staff costs Restated 2013 2012 The average monthly number of employees including Executive Directors employed was as follows: Administration 36 38 Professional 258 243 294 281 Their aggregate remuneration comprised: Restated 2013 2012 US$m US$m Wages and salaries 59.0 49.2 Share-based payments a 25.2 26.7 Social security costs 8.5 7.6 Pension costs b 3.5 2.8 96.1 86.3 A proportion of the Groups staff costs shown above are recharged to the Groups joint venture partners and a proportion is capitalised into the cost of intangible and tangible oil and gas assets under the Groups accounting policy for exploration, evaluation and oil and gas assets.
The amount ultimately remaining in the income statement was US$36.9 million 2012: US$28.6 million.
The 2012 numbers have been restated to reflect the Groups consolidation of FHN and Cte dIvoire operations as discontinued.
Details of Directors remuneration are provided in the part of the Directors remuneration report described as having been audited.
a Share-based payments A transaction is accounted for as a share-based payment where the Group receives services from employees, Directors or other third parties andpays for these in shares or similar equity instruments.
The Group makes equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees and Directors.
Equity-settled share-based schemes are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant, measured by use of an appropriate valuation model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the period toexercise, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The Company is liable for Employers National Insurance on the difference between the market value at date of exercise and exercise price.
Thisexpense is accrued by reference to the share price of the Company at the balance sheet date.
Share-based payments made to employees ofsubsidiaries of the Company are recharged to the relevant subsidiary when awarded.
The share-based payments expense comprises the following three schemes: 2013 2012 US$m US$m Equity-settled share option scheme i 12.6 17.1 Long Term Incentive Plan: Afren Performance Share Plan equity-settled share ii 12.6 10.0 award scheme Share Award Scheme equity-settled share award scheme iii 25.2 27.1 Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 137 Accounts N otes to the Group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2013 i Equity-settled share option scheme The Group operates a share option scheme for employees.
The Groups policy is to award options to employees on appointment or completion of their probationary period and periodically thereafter.
Options are issued at market price on the grant date and have vesting periods of up to three years.
The options expire after ten years if they remain unexercised and are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest except at the discretion of the Board.
Details of the share options outstanding during the year are as follows: 2013 2012 Number of Weighted average Number of Weighted average share options exercise price share options exercise price Outstanding at beginning of the year 55,209,834 0.82 56,552,175 0.81 Granted during the year 2,040,000 1.41 2,040,000 1.29 Exercised during the year 6,416,000 0.63 2,101,333 0.56 Lapsed during the year 1,430,000 1.38 1,281,008 1.41 49,403,834 0.85 55,209,834 0.82 Exercisable at end of the year 43,066,334 0.78 46,455,334 0.73 The weighted average remaining contractual life of the options outstanding at 31 December 2013 was 5.3 years 2012: 6.1 years.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year ended 31 December 2013 was 148p 2012: 129p.
In 2013 options were granted on 3, 8 and 15 January, 27 March, 11 and 18 June, 28 August, 4 and 24 September and 1 October.
Theaggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates was US$1.3 million.
In 2012 options were granted on 3 January, 28 March, 2 and 23 April, 4, 12, 18 and 30 June, 22 August, 2, 23 and 30 October, 6and27 November and 7 December.
The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates was US$1.3 million.
The options granted during the year have been valued by reference to the Barrier option valuation model, consistent with the prior year.
Theinputs into the Barrier model were as follows: 2013 2012 Weighted average share price pence 141.9 129.9 Weighted average exercise price pence 141.9 181.0 Weighted average target price before eligibility to exercise barrier pence 198.5 181.0 Expected volatility 40% 40% Expected life years 3 3 Risk free rate 4% 4% Expected dividends The volatility of Afren shares was again reviewed following a further 12 months of share price data.
The volatility was measured utilising several formulae, including an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average model and a GARCH Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity model, and over several time periods.
These gave a range of estimates for the share price volatility which is in line with the prior year.
The Group recognised total expenses related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the form of options in 2013 of US$1.0million, all of which related to employees, including Executive Directors, of the Group 2012: US$5.0 million, all of which related toemployees, including Executive Directors, of the Group.
ii Long Term Incentive Plan: Afren Performance Share Plan equity-settled share award scheme Under the Afren Performance Share Plan, the Group also gives awards to Directors and staff subject to outperforming a comparator group ofsimilarly focused oil and gas exploration and production companies in terms of shareholder return over a three-year period and based upon a multiple of salary.
However, these shares only vest after a three-year period and the full award is made only if Afren has performed in the top quartile when compared against a selected peer group of upstream oil and gas companies, which for the 2012 award was as follows: Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Apache Corporation, Cairn Energy, Canadian Natural Resources, DNO, Dragon Oil, Genel Energy, Gulfsands Petroleum, Hess Corporation, Heritage Oil, JKX Oil & Gas, Lundin Petroleum, Marathon Oil Corporation, Maurel et Prom, Melrose Resources, Nexen, Niko Resources, Noble Energy, PA Resources, Pioneer Natural Resources, Premier Oil, Salamander Energy, SOCO International, Talisman Energy, Tullow Oil, Vaalco Energy and Woodside Petroleum.
If Afren does not achieve at least median performance in the peer group, no shares will be awarded.
At the median level, 30% of the shares will vest and there is a sliding scale between median and top quartile performance where only a percentage of the total award will vest.
A second performance target was applied to the 2012 award relating to the Groups Reserves Replacement Ratio RRR, setting a target RRR of 105% over the three-year vesting period of the awards.
In the event that aratio of less than 105% is achieved then the overall award amount is reduced pro-rata.
Afren plc 138 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Accounts Awards are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the awards vest, except under certain circumstances, e. g. redundancies, where the number of awards vesting will be pro-rated according to the length of time the employee has been employed during the three-year vesting period.
Details of the share awards outstanding are as follows: 2013 2012 Number of Weighted average Number of Weighted average share options exercise price share options exercise price Outstanding at beginning of the year 27,704,588 0.01 23,574,101 0.01 Granted during the year 13,512,561 0.01 16,226,772 0.01 Exercised during the year 4,188,209 0.01 11,240,276 0.01 Forfeited during the year 3,124,785 0.01 856,009 0.01 Outstanding at end of the year 33,904,155 0.01 27,704,588 0.01 Exercisable at end of the year 0.01 0.01 The awards outstanding at the end of 31 December 2013 have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.7 years 2012: 2.3 years and an exercise price of 0.01 2012: 0.01.
The aggregate of the fair value of the options granted during the year ended 31 December 2013 was US$13.1 million 2012: US$12.8 million.
The fair values were calculated using a stochastic model.
The inputs used for fair valuing awards granted during the two periods were asfollows: 2013 2012 Weighted average share price pence 123.6 98.0 Weighted average exercise price pence 0.0 1.0 Expected volatility 40% 40% Expected life years 3 3 Risk free rate Expected dividends The volatility of Afren shares was again reviewed following a further 12 months of share price data.
Therefore the volatility assumption has remained consistent with the prior year, but will remain under review going forwards.
The Group recognised total expenses related to the above equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the form of options during the year ended 31 December 2013 of US$12.0 million 2012: US$10.0 million.
iii Share Award Scheme equity-settled share award scheme As part of the incentives to attract the Jefferies, Randall & Dewey technical team, a number of shares were awarded in 2008, subject to continuing employment in the most part, to the team.
None of this team was eligible to an award under the Long Term Incentive Plan.
Thetiming of the shares issued range from six months to three years over which the fair value was spread.
The share award scheme was closed in 2011. b Pension costs The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme.
The Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and has no legal orconstructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to the defined contribution plan are recognised as staff costs and are expensed to the income statement in the periods during which related services are rendered by employees.

b Put option over own equity During 2012, the Group held three put and or call option contracts in relation to FHN.
In the 2012 financial statements, these contracts were treated as derivative financial instruments.
Following the adoption of IFRS 10, the IFRS classification of these instruments changed and under the guidance of IAS 39, they are treated as options over own equity in the restated 2012 financial statements and measured at amortised cost.
During 2013, one option expired and one was exercised as part of Afrens increase in equity ownership of FHN.
In July 2013, Afren entered into a put and call agreement with Earl Act Global Investments in respect of 18,299,993 million FHN shares, representing approximately 12.5% of FHNs share capital, at a price of US$3.32 per share.
These options may only be exercised after 24months and for a period of six months thereafter.
In accordance with IAS 39, the options are accounted for as options over own equity, where a liability for the present value of the obligation is recognised within other financial liabilities, with a corresponding charge in other equity.
Further details are provided in note 5.6. c Convertible loan note In July 2013, the Group redeemed the convertible loan note in full.

FHN is the Groups only subsidiary that is not wholly controlled.
FHN has a 45% interest in the OML 26 licence onshore Nigeria and a 9% interest in OML 113 offshore Nigeria, via its own subsidiaries.
During 2013, Afren increased its beneficial interest in FHN from approximately 46.7% to 78%.
As at 31 December 2013, 22% of FHN was owned by non-controlling shareholders.
The analysis above shows the effect of the change in ownership on the equity attributable to the non-controlling interest in FHN.

Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest if any in the entity, over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually.

The recoverable amount of CGU has been determined based on a fair value less costs to sell calculation for the duration of the licence which expires in 2044.
For the discounted cash flows to be calculated, management has made the following key assumptions: Production volumes: Estimates are based on detailed independent forecasts for the field and take into account a development plan agreed by management as part of the long-term planning process.
Discount rate: A 10% pre-tax discount rate has been used which, taking into account other assumptions used in the calculation, management considers to be reflective of the risks.
The present value of future cash flows remains above the carrying value of the CGUsnet assets at 10% and 12.5% but not at 15%.
Crude oil price: Management uses long-term US$100 per barrel price forecast for calculation of future cash flows.
5.14 Discontinued operations On 16 May 2013, the Group entered into a sale agreement to dispose of Afren Cte dIvoire Limited and Lion GPL SA, which held Afrens interest in the CI-11 Block and Lion Gas Plant respectively.
The disposal was completed on 31 August 2013, on which date control of these twoentities passed to the acquirer.
A provisional profit on disposal of US$25.3 million has been recognised in the year.
This remains subject to finalisation on agreement ofworking capital adjustments.

The quantitative impact on the 31 December 2012 financial statements of adopting these standards is set out in the following tables.
The adoption of IFRS 10 has resulted in the consolidation of FHN as a subsidiary in all comparative periods restated.
