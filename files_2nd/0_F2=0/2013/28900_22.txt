EARNINGS PER SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS OF THE PARENT COMPANY The earnings per ordinary share are calculated by reference to the profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
Basic Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders of the Parent Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding ordinary shares purchased by various share trusts and held as own shares.

The Parent Company has share options and contingently issuable shares as categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The calculation is performed for the dilutive potential ordinary shares to determine the number of shares that could have been issued at fair value determined as the average annual market share price of the Parent Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the dilutive potential ordinary shares.

Additions of software development comprise 14m 2012: 12m of external software and 112m 2012: 128m of internally developed software.
As part of the Group business review, a decision has been made to refine and rationalise IT infrastructure.
As a result of this decision, a software impairment charge of 221m 2012: nil has been recognised within other operating expenses.
Further software impairment charges of 4m 2012: 12m have been charged to underwriting and policy acquisition costs during the year due to the integration of operational systems in Scandinavia.
Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash generating units CGUs, which are contained within the following operating segments as follows: 2013 2012 m m Scandinavia 161 163 Canada 216 230 UK and Western Europe 79 92 Emerging Markets 133 235 When testing for impairment, the recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use cashflow projections based on operating plans approved by management covering a three year period.
Cashflows beyond this period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates which management deem appropriate for the CGU.
RSA ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 137 A number of other assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of a cashflow model to forecast operating cashflows, premium volumes, expenses and working capital requirements.
Forecasts of future cashflows are based on the best estimates of future premiums, operating expenses and taxes using historical trends, general geographical market conditions, industry trends and forecasts and other available information.
These assumptions are subject to review by management.
The cashflow forecasts are adjusted by appropriate discount rates.
Discount rates used in 2013 are within a range of 8% to 24% 2012: 6% to 24%, are post tax and reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segments at the date of evaluation.
The weighted average growth rates used in 2013 are within a range of 0% to 15% 2012: 2% to 13%.
Goodwill impairment charges of 106m 2012: nil have been recognised within other operating expenses, split between Emerging Markets 90m and UK and Western Europe 16m.
In Emerging Markets the impairment charge reflects slower than anticipated economic growth in Poland and increased economic uncertainty in Argentina.
In UK and Western Europe the impairment charge reflects plans to contract some lines of business in the UK and reduced economic growth projections in Italy.
Sensitivity analysis The Groups impairment tests have identified the goodwill of the Irish CGU as having headroom of 33m.
Headroom is defined as the recoverable amount less the carrying value of the CGU, negative headroom indicates impairment.
A reasonable change in key assumptions could potentially cause the Irish CGU to be impaired.
The following sensitivity analysis shows the available headroom compared to the carrying value for reasonable changes to the key assumptions used in the impairment review of the Irish CGU which included a terminal growth rate of 1.7% and discount rate of 10.1%.

The external independent valuers have appropriate recognised professional qualifications and recent experience in the location and category of the properties being valued.
The valuations of buildings with vacant possession are based on the comparative method of valuation with reference to sales of other vacant buildings.
Fair value would change based on the locational qualities and physical building characteristics principally condition, size, specification and layout as appropriate.
Investment properties are valued using discounted cashflow models which takes into account the net present value of cashflows to be generated from the properties.
The cashflow streams reflect the current rent the gross rent payable to lease expiry, at which point it is assumed that each unit will be relet at its estimated rental value.
Allowances have been made for voids and rent free periods where applicable.
The appropriate rent to be capitalised is selected on the basis of the location of the building, its quality, tenant credit quality and lease terms amongst other factors.
These cashflows are discounted at an appropriate rate of interest to determine their present value.
In both cases the estimated fair value would increase decrease if: The estimated rental value is higher lower Void periods were shorter longer The occupancy rate were higher lower Rent free periods were shorter longer The discount rates were lower higher RSA ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 143 Loan capital The Groups loan capital instruments are classified as Level 2 financial liabilities with the exception of the Subordinated guaranteed US$ bonds which are classified as Level 3 financial liabilities.
The fair value measurement of these Level 2 financial liabilities is based on pricing obtained from a range of financial intermediaries who base their valuations on recent transactions of the Groups loan capital instruments and other observable market inputs such as applicable risk free rates and appropriate credit risk spreads.
The fair value measurement of the Level 3 financial liabilities is also obtained from a range of financial intermediaries and is an indicative valuation based on the applicable risk free rate and appropriate credit risk spreads.

The Group is able to control the remittance of earnings to the UK and there is no intention to remit any such earnings in the foreseeable future if the remittance would trigger a material incremental tax liability.
As such the Group has not recognised any deferred tax in respect of the potential taxes on the temporary differences arising on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates.
Net deferred tax assets of 233m 2012: 241m, that relate to tax jurisdictions in which the Group has suffered a loss in either the current or preceding period, have been recognised on the basis that future taxable profits will be available against which these can be utilised.
The evidence for the future taxable profits is a forecast consistent with the three year operational plans prepared by the relevant businesses, which are subject to internal review and challenge.
Where relevant, the forecast includes extrapolations of the operation plans using assumptions consistent with those used in the plans.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes, funded and unfunded defined benefit pension schemes, and has other post retirement obligations.
Defined contribution pension schemes Costs of 68m 2012: 68m were recognised in respect of defined contribution schemes by the Group.
The Groups Swedish subsidiaries are part of a multi-employer defined benefit scheme along with other financial institutions in Sweden.
As it is not possible to determine the assets and liabilities in respect of any one employer under this scheme, it is included in these accounts as a defined contribution scheme.
Contributions of 11m 2012: 11m were paid to this scheme during 2013 and are included in the costs shown above.
The expected contributions in 2014 are 11m.
Total contributions to the scheme from all employers in 2013 were estimated at 80m.
The latest information regarding the funding of this scheme is taken from the interim report for the first half of 2013, when the scheme funding rate was 114% 2012: 106%.
Defined benefit pension schemes and other post retirement benefits The major defined benefit pension schemes are located in the UK.
The assets of these schemes are mainly held in separate trustee administered funds.
The UK defined benefit schemes were effectively closed to new entrants in 2002.
The profile of the members of the three main UK schemes at 30 September 2013 the latest date at which full information is available is as follows: Number Active members members in employment with the Group and accruing benefits 2,844 Deferred members members no longer accruing and not yet receiving benefits 26,844 Pensioners members and dependants receiving benefits 17,055 Total members at 30 September 2013 46,743 Active members of the schemes accrue additional benefits in each year based on salaries subject to a salary cap in that year.
Employees are entitled to join the stakeholder pension scheme for earnings above the cap.
Accrued benefits are revalued up to retirement in accordance with government indices for inflation.
A cap of 2.5% per annum applies to the revaluation of accrued benefits.
A cap of 5% per annum applies for benefits which accrued prior to March 2010.
After retirement, pensions in payment are increased each year based on the increases in the government indices for inflation.
A cap of 5% applies to benefits in excess of Guaranteed Minimum Pensions which accrued prior to 31 December 2005, and a cap of 2.5% applies to benefits accruing after that date.
The UK schemes are managed through trusts with independent trustees responsible for the safeguard of the interests of all members.
The trustees meet regularly with Group management to discuss the funding position and any proposed changes to the schemes.
The schemes are regulated by The Pension Regulator.
Each scheme is subject to triennial valuations, which are used to determine the future funding of the schemes by the Group including funding to repair any funding deficit.
The effective date of the most recent valuations of the three main UK funds is 31 March 2012.
The Group is exposed to risks through its obligation to fund the schemes.
These risks include market risk assets not performing as well as expected, inflation risk and longevity risk over the lives of the members.
The Group and the trustees of the schemes work together to reduce these risks through agreement of investment policy including the use of interest rate, inflation rate and longevity swaps.
During 2009 the Group entered into arrangements that provide coverage against longevity risk for 55% of the retirement obligations relating to pensions in payment of the two largest UK schemes at that time.
The arrangement provides for reimbursement of the covered pension obligations in return for the contractual return receivable on portfolios of assets including some interest rate swaps held by the pension funds at the inception of the arrangement.
The arrangement is accounted for as a longevity swap.
The pension schemes continue to hold the original assets used to fund the arrangements.
For the accounting periods ended 31 December 2012 and earlier, part of the arrangement had been measured in accordance with its legal form as an insurance contract.
The premiums payable under the insurance contract were measured at fair value and the amounts receivable under the insurance contract were valued on the same basis as the insured retirement obligations.
Following the adoption of IFRS 13 all the cashflows of the arrangement are measured at fair value.
The impact of valuing the net cashflows of the arrangement at fair value is to increase the value of the Groups pension schemes assets by 160m.
This increase is recognised in remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability asset in other comprehensive income.
The valuation at 31 December 2012 has not been restated in accordance with the transitional requirements of IFRS 13.

For the three main UK defined benefit schemes, the level of contributions in 2013 were 92m 2012: 97m of which 65m 2012: 72m were additional contributions in line with the plan to reduce funding deficits.
Expected contributions to the three schemes for the year ending 31 December 2014 are approximately 83m including 64m of additional contributions to reduce the deficit.
The 2002 Scheme which was the scheme to which new UK employees had been admitted following the closure of the main defined benefit schemes has been closed to further accrual from 1 January 2006.
It has been replaced by a stakeholder arrangement and members of the 2002 Scheme and future new employees in the UK now accrue future benefits on a defined contribution basis under the stakeholder pension scheme.
The Group also operates defined benefits schemes in other countries.
The most significant of these schemes are in Canada and Ireland.
The Group also provides post retirement healthcare benefits to certain current and retired Canadian employees.
The benefits are not prefunded.
Life insurance benefits, which provide varying levels of coverage, are provided at no cost to retirees.

For the UK the annual rate of increase in pensions shown is the rate that applies to pensions that increase at RPI subject to a cap of 5%.
For other schemes the weighted average assumption is shown.
Mortality rate The mortality assumptions are set following investigations of the main schemes recent experience by the schemes actuaries for the funding valuations.
At the funding valuation in March 2012, the mortality assumptions adopted for the main UK schemes used the SAPS Light Normal base table with percentage adjustments to reflect the schemes recent experience compared with that expected under these tables.
Reductions in future mortality rates are allowed for by using the Continuous Mortality Investigation CMI 2013 tables with a long-term rate of 1.00%.
The weighted average assumptions imply that a current pensioner aged 60 has an expected future lifetime of 27.6 2012: 27.6 years for males and 28.8 2012: 28.2 years for females and a future pensioner aged 60 in 15 years time has a future expected lifetime from age 60 of 28.6 2012: 28.3 years for males and 30.0 2012: 28.7 years for females.
Sensitivity analysis Sensitivities for the defined benefit obligations of the three main UK schemes are shown below net of tax : 2013 2012 Changes in assumption m m Discount rate Increase by 0.25% 200 153 1 RPI CPI Increase by 0.25% 145 110 2 Mortality long-term rate Increase by 0.25% 53 Life expectancy Increase by 1 year 157 97 Notes: 1.
The impact shown is for the appropriate increase in the revaluation of deferred pensions and the increases to pensions in payment resulting from the specified increase in RPI and CPI.
During the year the Group moved to the use of CMI projections for future improvements to mortality with a long-term rate of 1.0%.
Impact of adoption of the revised IAS 19 in the 2013 financial statements The Group has adopted the revised version of IAS 19 Employee Benefits at 1 January 2013.
The changes in the revised IAS 19 are described in the significant accounting policies.
The revised IAS 19 is applied retrospectively and consequently the results for 2012 have been restated.
The effect of the restatement is to increase the charge previously recognised in the consolidated income statement by 31m 24m net of taxes.
This charge includes an 8m increase in the gross claims incurred, a 9m increase in underwriting and policy acquisition costs, an 8m increase in other operating expenses and a new charge of 6m for pension net interest included within finance costs in the consolidated income statement.
There is a corresponding reduction in the actuarial losses recognised in other comprehensive income.
The deferred tax of 7m generated on the charges is also a direct switch between the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
There is no impact on the net asset value of the Group.

Awards have been made each year since 2006 following shareholder approval.
The structure of the plan allows for a number of different types of awards to be made.
Voluntarily Invested Deferred Shares are purchased by participants from net bonus payable limited to a maximum value of 33% of net bonus.
Voluntarily Invested Deferred Shares are held in trust for three years.
In addition, for senior executives, the Remuneration Committee may defer a portion of an individuals gross bonus limited to 33% of that bonus into an award over shares referred to for the purpose of the plan as Compulsory Deferred Shares.
Compulsory Deferred Share awards are normally forfeited on an employee leaving the Group.
No further performance conditions apply.
The Remuneration Committee may make a conditional award of shares on a matched basis to Voluntarily Invested and Compulsory Deferred Shares Matching Shares up to a maximum of 2:1 and these are normally forfeited on an employee leaving the Group.
Additionally, the Remuneration Committee may make conditional awards of Performance Shares to senior executives and conditional awards of Restricted Shares to other executives and senior managers.
Awards of Performance Shares and Matching Shares related to Compulsory Deferred Shares are subject to a performance condition consisting of a combination of a return on equity target and a total shareholder return target with performance measured by comparison against other European insurance companies over a single three year performance period.
Matching Shares related to Voluntarily Invested Deferred Shares are subject only to the return on equity performance condition.
Restricted Shares are not subject to performance conditions.
All awards vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
Performance Shares and Restricted Shares are normally forfeited on an employee leaving the Group.
Further information on the LTIP including details of a proposed new Long Term Incentive Plan can be found in the Remuneration Report within the Corporate Governance section.
Further disclosures in respect of the ESOS, SAYE and Sharebuild schemes have not been made on the grounds that the schemes are immaterial to the Group.
RSA ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 161 29.
HEDGE ACCOUNTING The Group designates certain forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange options as accounting hedges against the net investment in designated subsidiaries to reduce the foreign exchange risk exposure.
For forward foreign exchange contracts, on designation, the interest element is separated from the forward exchange rate and is excluded from the hedge relationship.
Effectiveness of the hedge is then measured using the spot rate, which is also the exchange rate used when measuring the net investment in the designated subsidiaries.
For foreign exchange options the hedge designation is to hedge the value of the foreign operations at the strike price at the exercise date of the option.
The fair value of the accounting hedges at 31 December 2013 are a liability of 1m 2012: 6m and an asset of 31m 2012: 14m.
The hedge ineffectiveness recognised in the consolidated income statement during 2013 is nil 2012: nil.
Further information on derivatives, including those designated as accounting hedges, can be found in the Risk Management section.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES RSA Insurance Group plc, incorporated in England and Wales, is the ultimate Parent Company the Company of the RSA group of companies.
The principal activity of the Company is to hold investments in its subsidiaries and the receipt and payment of dividends.
These separate financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
Except where otherwise stated, all figures included in the separate financial statements are presented in millions of Pounds Sterling Sterling, shown as m, rounded to the nearest million.
In accordance with section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Companys income statement and related notes have not been presented in these separate financial statements.
The accounting policies that are used in preparation of these separate financial statements are consistent with the accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements of RSA Insurance Group plc as set out in those financial statements.
The additional accounting policies that are specific to the separate financial statements of the Company are set out below.
Investment in subsidiaries The Company accounts for its investments in directly owned subsidiaries as available for sale financial assets, which are included in the accounts at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of the investments in subsidiaries are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Where there is a decline in the fair value of a directly owned subsidiary below cost, and there is objective evidence that the investment is impaired, the cumulative loss that has been recognised in equity is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
Dividend income Dividend income from investments in subsidiaries is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
INVESTMENTS 2013 2012 m m Investments at 1 January at valuation 6,479 5,066 Fair value adjustments 1,370 1,413 Investments at 31 December at valuation 5,109 6,479 The balance at 31 December comprises: 2013 2012 m m Investment in subsidiaries 4,146 5,475 Loans to subsidiaries 963 1,004 Investments at 31 December at valuation 5,109 6,479 The investments in subsidiaries are recognised in the statement of financial position at fair value measured in accordance with the Companys accounting policies.
The Companys investments are classified as level 2 financial assets.
Fair value of the Companys significant subsidiary is determined by reference to the market value derived from relevant indices of the Companys ordinary shares and loan capital instruments at the end of the reporting period, being the most transparent independent available indicator.
The market value is adjusted for the fair value of the Companys preference shares, assets and liabilities, excluding directly owned subsidiaries.
The adjusting items have been fair valued by determining the present value of future cashflow projections, using an appropriate arms length discount rate.
The remaining subsidiaries are held at fair value which has been determined to be net asset value.
The directors believe that the methodology used supports the inclusion of the investments in subsidiaries in the statement of financial position, at the fair values ascribed to them.
The market value of the Companys ordinary shares at 31 December 2013 was 91.4p.
A movement of 1% in the share price would have an impact of 34m on the fair value.
Full details of the principal subsidiaries of the Company are set out in note 30 to the consolidated financial statements.
