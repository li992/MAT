2012: $2,178.9 million, notwithstanding our key markets having remained broadly flat.
There was a $27.1 million revenue contribution from acquisitions, but lower fuel prices reduced revenue by $20.6 million.

Underlying operating profit excluding exceptional items increased by 4% to $200.1 million 2012: $192.7 million and the Group operating margin showed a modest improvement to 9.0% 2012 fuel adjusted: 8.9%.
The progress in underlying operating profit was largely due to the contribution from organic growth in Flight Support and margin progression in Aftermarket Services.

indb 26 12 03 2014 12:10 Strategic Report There was a $5.3 million reduction in the net underlying interest expense to $29.6 million Group Financial Summary 2012: $34.9 million due to a reduction in the blended average interest rate, principally as a result of closing out higher rate interest rate swaps in mid-2012.
Interest cover improved to 8.8 times 2012: 7.3 times as a result of the reduction in net interest charge, coupled with the improvement in underlying EBITDA.
Underlying profit before tax improved by 8% to $170.5 million 2012: $157.8 million.
The underlying effective tax rate of 14.5% was marginally lower than the prior year 2012: 15.4%.
As a result of the improvement in underlying operating profit and reduction in net interest expense, basic adjusted earnings per share increased by 9% to 30.5 cents 2012: 27.9 cents.
Profit before tax increased by 16% to $145.2 million 2012: $125.1 million and profit for the period increased by 25% to $138.1 million 2012: $110.3 million.
Net exceptional items after tax amounted to $7.6 million 2012: $23.2 million, a reduction of 67%.
We once again turned operating profit into good operating cash flow with cash conversion of 101%.
Free cash flow for the year increased by 21% to $146.5 million 2012: $121.2 million with the increase principally as a result of improved operating profit, working capital and net interest payments.
Net capital expenditure increased as planned to $76.3 million 2012: $55.4 million, equivalent to 1.2 times underlying depreciation and amortisation 2012: 0.9 times, with significant investments in key projects including the dedicated NetJets facility at Palm Beach, the new FBO terminal at Newark and the commencement of the redevelopment of our FBO at Luton.
The Groups strong cash conversion continued to support the on-going creation of significant investment capacity.
Total acquisition and licence spend in the year amounted to $86.1 million 2012: $35.5 million, including the $67.0 million acquisition of the Maguire Aviation FBO at Van Nuys, California, the $3.0 million purchase of the 75% share of Starlink Aviations FBO in Montreal, ASIGs $4.3 million acquisition of gategroups cleaning and fide-icing business in London and Dublin, and the $11.8 million investment in Legacy licences.

As announced on 3 February 2014, we completed the disposal of APPH, further increasing BBA Aviations focus as an aviation support and aftermarket services provider.
The total consideration of $128 million is equivalent to 17.8 times historic underlying operating profit.
Further to the disposal of APPH, BBA Aviation intends to return the net cash proceeds to shareholders by way of a $125 million share repurchase programme.
This is consistent with the Groups disciplined approach to capital management, whilst retaining the financial headroom to continue to implement the Groups acquisition strategy.
