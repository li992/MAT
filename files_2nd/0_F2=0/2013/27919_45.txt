The debt and equity amounts at 30 September 2013 and at 30 September 2012 were as follows: Note 2013 2012 m m Debt Corporate bond 48 110.0 110.0 Retail bonds 48 60.0 - Bank overdraft 47 1.4 0.6 Less: Applicable free cash 37 170.8 110.6 Net debt 0.6 - Equity Total equity 873.3 803.5 Less: cash ow hedging reserve 42 1.7 0.7 Adjusted equity 871.6 802.8 Total working capital 872.2 802.8 Debt 0.1% - Equity 99.9% 100.0% Total working capital 100.0% 100.0% In addition at 30 September 2012 the Group held 17.1m of free cash in excess of that shown above.
The stable proportion of working capital represented by equity during 2013 resulted primarily from the operation of the policy described above.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The principal financial risks arising from the Groups normal business activities are credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and currency risk.
The Board operates through the Credit Committee and the Asset and Liability Committee to review and agree policies for managing each of these risks, as described in the Corporate Governance Statement in Section B2, and they are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged throughout the year and since the year end.
The position disclosed below is materially similar to that existing throughout the year.
Use of derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes.
Such instruments are used only to limit the exposure of the Group to movements in market interest or exchange rates.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken, and hence all of the Groups derivative financial instruments are for commercial hedging purposes only.
These are used to protect the Group from exposures principally arising from xed rate lending or borrowing and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies.
Hedge accounting is applied where appropriate, though it should be noted that some derivatives, while forming part of an economic hedge relationship, do not qualify for this accounting treatment under the IAS 39 rules, while in other cases hedge accounting has not been adopted either because natural accounting offsets are expected or because complying with the IAS 39 hedge accounting rules would be especially onerous.
The Group has designated a number of derivatives as fair value hedges for accounting purposes.
In particular this treatment is used for: a hedging the inter est rate risk of groups of xed rate prepayable loan assets with interest rate derivatives on a portfolio basis.
The Group believes this solution is the most appropriate as it is consistent with the economic hedging approach taken by the Group to these assets.
b hedging the inter est rate risk of xed rate corporate bond borrowings with a designated xed to oating interest rate swap, which was taken out for this speci c purpose.
The Group has also designated cash ow hedging relationships, principally arising from currency borrowings, where a speci ed foreign exchange basis swap, set up as part of the terms of the borrowing is used.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 94 D The accounts The only derivative financial instrument held by the Company at 30 September 2011 was the swap related to the xed rate corporate bond borrowing described above.
This reached its term in the year ended 30 September 2012 and the Company now has no derivative assets or liabilities.
Credit risk The Groups business objectives rely on maintaining a high-quality customer base and place strong emphasis on good credit management, both at the time of acquiring or underwriting a new loan, where strict lending criteria are applied, and in the collections process.
Primary responsibility for credit risk management across the Group lies with the Credit Committee.
The Credit Committee is made up of four senior members of staff, headed by the Finance Director.
Its key responsibilities include setting and reviewing credit policy, controlling applicant quality, tracking account performance against targets, agreeing product criteria and lending guidelines and monitoring performance and trends.
The assets of the Group and the Company which are subject to credit risk are set out below: The Group The Company 2013 2012 2013 2012 Note m m m m Loans to customers 31 8,801.5 8,694.6 - - Investments in structured entities 34 23.8 9.1 - - Derivative financial assets 35 890.0 800.4 - - Amounts owed by Group companies 36 - - 115.0 80.1 Accrued interest 36 0.2 0.2 - - Cash 37 587.3 504.8 153.9 124.5 Maximum exposure to credit risk 10,302.8 10,009.1 268.9 204.6 The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its loans to customers.
While this maximum exposure represents the potential loss which might have to be accounted for by the Group, the terms on which the Groups loan assets are funded, described under Liquidity Risk below, limit the amount of principal repayments on the Groups securitised and warehouse borrowings in cases of capital losses on assets, signi cantly reducing the effective shareholder value at risk.
The Groups loan assets at 30 September 2013 are analysed as follows: 2013 2013 2012 2012 m % m % Buy-to-let mortgages 8,324.4 94.6% 8,196.4 94.3% Owner occupied mortgages 77.4 0.9% 99.2 1.1% Total first mortgages 8,401.8 95.5% 8,295.6 95.4% Secured loans 248.4 2.8% 279.9 3.2% Loans secured on property 8,650.2 98.3% 8,575.5 98.6% Car loans 1.3 - 2.5 0.1% Retail finance loans 1.5 - 2.0 - Other loans 148.5 1.7% 114.6 1.3% Total loans to customers 8,801.5 100.0% 8,694.6 100.0% Other loans include unsecured loans either advanced by Group companies or acquired from their originators at a discount.
There are no signi cant concentrations of credit risk due to the large number of customers included in the portfolios.
The Groups underwriting philosophy is based on a combination of sophisticated individual credit assessment and the automated ef ciencies of a scored decision making process.
Information on each applicant is combined with data taken from a credit reference bureau to provide a complete credit picture of the applicant and the borrowing requested.
Key information is validated through a combination of documentation and statistical data which collectively provides evidence of the applicants ability and willingness to pay the amount contracted under the loan agreement.
First mortgages and secured loans are secured by charges over residential properties in England and Wales, or similar Scottish or Northern Irish securities.
Car loans are effectively secured by the nanced vehicle.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 95 D The accounts Despite this security, in assessing credit risk, an applicants ability and propensity to repay the loan remain the principal factors in the decision to lend.
In considering whether to acquire pools of loan assets or invest in loan portfolios, the Group will undertake a due diligence exercise on the underlying loan accounts.
Such assets are generally not fully performing and are offered at a discount to their current balance.
The Groups procedures may include inspection of original loan documents, veri cation of security and the examination of the credit status of borrowers.
Current and historic cash ow data will also be examined.
The objective of the exercise is to establish, to a level of con dence similar to that provided by the underwriting process, that the assets will generate suf cient cash ows to recover the Groups investment and generate an appropriate return.
Investments in structured entities represent the Groups contribution made to special purpose vehicle SPV companies established and controlled by third parties to purchase pools of loan assets.
All such investments are denominated in sterling and the underlying loans are made to United Kingdom borrowers.
Cash generated by the assets is distributed to investors in accordance with a speci ed priority of payments.
The Group has no obligation to make further contributions to the SPV companies concerned.
The management has considered the position of the underlying assets and concluded that they will generate suf cient cash ows to repay the amount of the investment.
In order to control credit risk relating to counterparties to the Groups derivative financial instruments and cash deposits, the Asset and Liability Committee determines which counterparties the Group will deal with, establishes limits for each counterparty and monitors compliance with those limits.
Such counterparties are typically highly rated banks and, for all cash deposits and derivative positions held within the Groups securitisation structures, must comply with criteria set out in the nancing arrangements.
Where a derivative counterparty fails to meet the required criteria they are obliged under the terms of the instruments to set aside a cash collateral deposit.
The amounts of these cash collateral deposits, which do not form part of the Groups cash position, are given in note 35.
The Groups cash balances are held in sterling at London banks in current accounts and as short xed term deposits.
Credit risk on these balances, and the interest accrued thereon, is considered to be immaterial.
An analysis of the indexed loan to value ratio LTV for those loan accounts secured on property by value at 30 September 2013 is set out below.
For acquired accounts the effect of any discount on purchase is allowed for.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 96 D The accounts The number of accounts in arrears by asset class, based on the most commonly quoted fide nition of arrears for the type of asset, at 30 September 2013 and 30 September 2012, compared to the industry averages at those dates published by the Council of Mortgage Lenders CML and the Finance and Leasing Association FLA, was: 2013 2012 % % First mortgages Accounts more than three months in arrears Buy-to-Let accounts including receiver of rent cases 0.35 0.48 Buy-to-Let accounts excluding receiver of rent cases 0.07 0.06 Owner Occupied accounts 4.24 4.38 CML data for mortgage accounts more than three months in arrears Buy-to-Let accounts including receiver of rent cases 1.16 1.51 Buy-to-Let accounts excluding receiver of rent cases 0.99 1.22 Owner Occupied accounts 1.86 2.03 All mortgages 1.75 1.93 Secured loans Accounts more than 2 months in arrears 21.46 19.42 FLA data for secured loans 17.50 18.00 Car loans Accounts more than 2 months in arrears 25.52 18.45 FLA data for all personal loans 5.80 7.20 Other loan Accounts more than 2 months in arrears 81.98 62.92 No published industry data for asset classes comparable to the Groups other books has been identi ed.
Where revised data at 30 September 2012 has been published by the FLA or CML, the comparative industry gures above have been amended.
The number of accounts in arrears will be higher for closed books such as the owner occupied mortgage book and the car finance, retail finance and unsecured loan books than for comparable active ones, as performing accounts pay off their balances, leaving arrears accounts representing a greater proportion of the total.
The gures shown above for secured loans and other loans include purchased portfolios which generally include a high proportion of cases in arrears at the time of purchase and where this level of performance is allowed for in the discount to current balance represented by the purchase price.
The payment status of the carrying balances of the Groups loan assets, before provision for impairment, at 30 September 2013 and at 30 September 2012 split between those accounts considered as performing and those included in the population for impairment testing, is shown below.

This is fide ned as the sum of the undiscounted cash ows expected to be received over a speci ed future period.
In the Groups view, this measure may be suitable for heavily discounted, unsecured, distressed portfolios, but is less applicable for the types of portfolio in which the Group has invested, where cash ows are higher on acquisition, loans may be secured on property and customers may not be in default.
In such cases, the IAS 39 amortised cost balance, at which these assets are carried in the Group balance sheet, provides a better indication of value.
However, to aid comparability the 84 and 120 month ERC values for the Groups purchased assets are set out below, analysed by the balance sheet line on which they appear.
These are derived using the same models and assumptions used in the EIR calculations, but the differing bases of calculation lead to different outcomes.

Liquidity risk The Group uses securitisation to mitigate its exposure to liquidity risk, ensuring, as far as possible, that the maturities of assets and liabilities are matched.
The Groups originated loan assets are principally nanced by asset backed loan notes Notes issued through the securitisation process.
In a securitisation deal an SPV company within the Group will issue Notes secured on a pool of mortgage or other loan assets owned by the SPV.
The Notes have a maturity date later than the final repayment date for any asset in the pool, typically over thirty years from the issue date.
The noteholders are entitled to receive repayment of the Note principal out of principal funds generated by the loan assets from time to time, but their right to the repayment of principal is limited to the cash available in the SPV.
Similarly, payment of accrued interest to the noteholders is limited to cash generated within the SPV.
There is no requirement for any Group company other than the issuing SPV to make principal or interest payments in respect of the Notes.
This matching of the maturities of the assets and the related funding substantially reduces the Groups exposure to liquidity risk.
Details of Notes in issue are given in note 48 and the assets backing the Notes are shown in notes 29 and 30.
In the Groups consumer finance SPVs, principal cash was not required to be repaid to noteholders during an initial period, but instead could be used to acquire new loans from the Group, subject to underwriting conditions being met.
Following the completion of this initial period, principal cash is repaid in the same way as for other SPVs.
The Group also provides funding to the SPV at inception, subordinated to the Notes, which means that credit risk on the pool assets is retained within the Group.
The Group receives the residual income generated by the assets.
These factors mean that the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets remain with the Group, and hence the loans remain on the Groups balance sheet.
Cash received in each SPV is held until the next interest payment date, after which the remaining balances become available to the Group.
Cash balances are also held within each SPV to provide credit enhancement for the particular securitisation, allowing interest and principal payments to be made even if loans default.
In order to provide further credit enhancement in certain of the SPVs there exist speci c economic trigger events which cause additional cash to be retained in the SPV, rather than being transferred to the Group.
While the Group can, if it chooses, contribute additional cash to cover these requirements, it is under no obligation to do so.
During the year one such trigger event occurred in Paragon Secured Finance No.
1 plc, one of the Groups consumer finance securitisations, and 2.4m of additional cash was retained in that company 2012: nil.
Whether any such events in any of the Groups other SPVs arise in the future will depend on the performance of the general economy and its impact on mortgage and loan arrears in each SPV.
However if all of the remaining trigger events occurred, a total of 70.5m of additional cash would be retained in the SPV companies 2012: 67.9m.
The cash balances of the SPV companies are included within the restricted cash balances disclosed in note 37.
Newly originated mortgage loans are initially funded by a revolving loan facility or warehouse from the point of their origination until their inclusion in a securitisation deal.
A warehouse functions in a similar way to an SPV, except that funds are drawn down as advances are made and repaid when loans are securitised.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 99 D The accounts On 29 February 2008 the warehouse facility provided to Paragon Second Funding Limited ceased to be available for new drawings, although assets held within it at that time continued to be funded.
Repayment of the principal on these assets is not required unless amounts are realised from them.
The final repayment date of the facility is later than the final due date of the assets it is used to fund.
On 27 September 2010 Macquarie Bank and Paragon Fourth Funding Limited signed a new warehouse facility agreement, which was renewed on substantially the same terms during the current financial year.
This warehouse is available for drawing and redrawing until 13 December 2014 and is used to fund new first charge mortgage loans.
After that date the loan has a further two year period for the assets funded to be sold or re nanced.
Repayment of the principal drawn in respect of assets is not required unless amounts are realised from them either through repayment, securitisation or asset sales, even after the two year period.
There is no further recourse to other assets of the Group in respect of either interest or principal on the borrowing.
On 26 September 2012 the wholesale division of Lloyds Bank and Paragon Fifth Funding Limited signed an additional warehouse facility agreement, which was drawn on for the first time during the year and operates in parallel with the Paragon Fourth Funding facility.
The term of the facility is three years and is available to fund new loans in its first twenty four months.
As with the Paragon Fourth Funding facility repayment of the principal drawn in respect of assets is not required unless amounts are realised from them either through repayment, securitisation or asset sales, even after the initial period.
There is no further recourse to other assets of the Group in respect of either interest or principal on the borrowing As with the SPVs, the Group provides subordinated funding to the warehouse companies and restricted cash balances are held within them.
Further details of the warehouse facilities are given in note 48 and details of the loan assets within the warehouses are given in note 29.
Between 29 February 2008 and 4 October 2010 the only advances made by the Group were consumer loans and further advances on existing mortgage accounts, which were funded from existing drawings in the SPV companies.
The provision of new consumer loans ceased on 9 April 2009, when the period over which new loans could be sold to the consumer finance SPVs ended.
New first mortgage lending commenced on 5 October 2010.
The securitisation process and the terms of the warehouse facilities effectively limit liquidity risk from the funding of the Groups loan assets.
It remains to ensure that suf cient funding is available to fund the Groups participation in the SPVs, provide capital support for new loans and working capital for the Group.
This responsibility rests with the Asset and Liability Committee which sets the Groups liquidity policy and uses detailed cash ow projections to ensure that an adequate level of liquidity is available at all times.
The final repayment date for all of the securitisation borrowings and the old warehouse borrowing is more than five years from the balance sheet date, the earliest falling due in 2033 and the latest in 2050.
The equivalent sterling principal amount outstanding at 30 September 2013 under the SPV and warehouse arrangements, allowing for the effect of the cross currency basis swaps, described under currency risk below, which are net settled with the loan payments, was 8,324.0m 2012: 8,240.6m.
The total sterling amount payable under these arrangements, were these principal amounts to remain outstanding until the final repayment date would be 17,363.4m 2012: 16,429.1m.
As the principal will, as discussed above, reduce as customers repay or redeem their accounts, the cash ow will in practice be far less than this amount.
In February 2013, the Group initiated a Euro Medium Term Note issuance programme, with a maximum issuance of 1,000.0m, and in March made an issue under it of 60.0m xed term retail bonds falling due for payment in December 2020.
The Group has the ability to issue further notes under the programme within twelve months of its inauguration and it may subsequently be renewed.
The Groups investments in purchased loan portfolios and structured entities are funded from its free cash balances and these investments carry no obligation to make further payments.
They therefore pose no liquidity risk to the Group.
The total undiscounted amounts, inclusive of estimated interest, which would be payable in respect of the Groups other borrowings, should those balances remain outstanding until the contracted repayment date, together with amounts payable in respect of the other accruals shown in note 53 are shown below.

The cash ows which are expected to arise from derivative contracts in place at the year end, estimating future oating rate payments and receipts on the basis of the yield curve at the balance sheet date are as follows: 2013 2012 Total cash Total cash out ow out ow in ow in ow m m On derivative liabilities Payable in less than one year 0.3 1.6 Payable in one to two years 0.2 0.4 Payable in two to five years 0.4 0.8 Payable in over five years 1.0 2.8 1.9 5.6 On derivative assets Payable in less than one year 0.3 0.4 Payable in one to two years 0.2 0.3 Payable in two to five years 0.4 0.8 Payable in over five years 1.0 2.7 1.9 4.2 - 1.4 Interest rate risk The Group manages interest rate risk, the risk that margins will be adversely affected by movements in market interest rates, by maintaining oating rate liabilities and matching these with oating rate assets, hedging xed rate assets and liabilities by the use of interest rate swap or cap agreements.
The rates of interest payable on the loan facilities and on asset backed loan notes issued in the securitisation process are reset either quarterly or monthly on the basis of LIBOR.
Where asset backed loan notes are issued in foreign currencies, cross-currency basis swaps are put in place converting the reference interest rate to a sterling LIBOR basis.
The Groups loan assets predominantly bear LIBOR linked interest rates or are hedged xed rate assets.
The interest rates charged on the Groups variable rate loan assets are determined by reference to, inter alia, the Groups funding costs and the rates being charged on similar products in the market.
Generally this ensures the matching of changes in interest rates on the Groups loan assets and borrowings and any exposure arising on the interest rate resets is relatively short term.
Forward rate agreements may be used to hedge against any perceived risk of temporary increases in LIBOR rates at month ends.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 101 D The accounts The return to the Group from its investments in structured entities is primarily attributable to the cash generation of the underlying portfolio.
There is no direct exposure to market interest rate risk.
Until the optional repayment date on 20 April 2012, the xed rate corporate bond was hedged by use of a long-term interest rate swap agreement, of notional principal equal to the principal amount of the bond, which converted the interest payable to a LIBOR-linked oating rate basis.
Since that date interest has been payable on the Bond at a xed rate of 3.729%.
During the year retail bonds were issued under a Euro Medium Term Note Programme.
All bonds issued to date bear interest at xed rates only, although the programme includes the facility to issue oating rate instruments in the future.
The Group has entered into various interest rate basis swap arrangements to alter the effective basis of interest payments on certain borrowings to match the underlying assets, though due to their nature and the low notional value of these swaps, they do not have a signi cant impact on the Groups results.
The Asset and Liability Committee monitors the interest rate risk exposure on the Groups loan assets and asset backed loan notes and ensures compliance with the requirements of the trustees in respect of the Groups securitisations and the terms of other borrowings.
To assess the Groups exposure to interest rate movements the notional impact of a 1% change in UK interest rates on the equity of the Group at 30 September 2013, and the notional annualised impact of such a change on the operating pro t of the Group, based on the year-end balance sheet have been calculated.
On this basis a 1% increase in UK interest rates would reduce the Groups equity at 30 September 2013 by 4.0m 2012: 4.0m and increase pro t before tax by 8.2m 2012: 8.4m.
This calculation allows only for the direct effects of any change in UK interest rates.
In practice such a change might have wider economic consequences which would themselves potentially affect the Groups business and results.
Although certain of the Groups borrowings have interest rates dependant on US Dollar and Euro LIBOR rates, the effect of the cross currency basis swaps is such that the Groups results have no material exposure to movements in these rates.
The effects of independent 1% increases in US or Euro interest rates would be to increase the Groups equity by 1.2m 2012: 1.2m and 2.1m 2012: 2.0m respectively.
The only interest rate risk in the Company arose from the corporate bond described above, until it became a xed rate instrument in April 2012.
The Company has also issued retail bonds bearing xed rates of interest.
Assets and liabilities with other group companies bear interest at oating rates based on LIBOR which reset within three months of the balance sheet date.
The finance lease bears notional interest only: all other balances are non-interest bearing.
Currency risk All of the Groups assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling with the exception of the asset backed loan notes denominated in US dollars and euros, which are described in note 48.
Although IAS 39 requires that they be accounted for as currency liabilities and valued at their spot rates, a condition of the issue of these notes was that interest rate and currency swaps were put in place for the duration of the borrowing, having the effect of converting the liability to a LIBOR linked oating rate sterling borrowing.
As a result the Group has no material exposure to foreign currency risk, and no sensitivity analysis is presented for currency risk.
The equivalent sterling principal amounts of notes in issue under these arrangements, and their carrying values at 30 September 2013 and 30 September 2012 are: 2013 2013 2012 2012 Equivalent Carrying Equivalent Carrying sterling value sterling value principal principal m m m m US dollar notes 2,775.6 3,232.0 2,867.5 3,342.7 Euro notes 1,936.7 2,373.1 1,983.0 2,313.3 4,712.3 5,605.1 4,850.5 5,656.0 None of the assets or liabilities of the Company are denominated in foreign currencies.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 102 D The accounts Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Fair values have been determined for all derivatives, listed securities and any other financial assets and liabilities for which an active and liquid market exists.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at their fair values in the accounts.
The Group uses a number of techniques to determine the fair values of its derivative assets and liabilities, for which observable prices in active markets are not available.
These are principally present value calculations based on estimated future cash ows arising from the instruments, discounted using a risk adjusted interest rate.
The principal inputs to these valuation models are LIBOR benchmark interest rates for the currencies in which the instruments are denominated, sterling, euros and dollars.
The cross currency basis swaps have a notional principal related to the outstanding currency borrowings and therefore the estimated rate of repayment of these notes also affects the valuation of the swaps.
In order to determine the fair values the management applies valuation adjustments to observed data where that data would not fully re ect the attributes of the instrument being valued.
The management reviews the models used on an ongoing basis to ensure that the valuations produced are reasonable and re ect all relevant factors.
For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, IFRS 7 requires that the measurements should be classi ed using a fair value hierarchy re ecting the inputs used, and fide fines three levels.
Level 1 measurements are unadjusted market prices, level 2 measurements are derived from observable data, such as market prices or rates, while level 3 measurements rely on signi cant inputs which are not derived from observable data.
As described above the valuations of the Groups derivatives are based on market information and they are therefore classi ed as level 2 measurements.
Details of these assets are given in note 35.
The Group had no financial assets or liabilities in the year ended 30 September 2013 or the year ended 30 September 2012 valued using level 1 or level 3 measurements.
The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, bank loans and overdrafts and asset backed loan notes, which are carried at amortised cost, are not materially different from their book values because all the assets mature within three months of the year end and the interest rates charged on financial liabilities reset on a quarterly basis.
While the Groups asset backed loan notes are listed, the quoted prices for an individual note may not be indicative of the fair value of the issue as a whole, due to the specialised nature of the market in such instruments and the limited number of investors participating in it.
In the absence of a liquid market in loan assets the directors have considered the estimated cash ows expected to arise from the Groups investments in its loans to customers and have concluded that the carrying value of these assets, determined on the amortised cost basis, is not signi cantly different from the fair value of the assets derived on a discounted cash ow basis.
