London & Stamford Property Plc 33 Report and Accounts 2012 Notes forming part of the Group financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2012 1 Accounting policies a General information London & Stamford Property Plc was incorporated on 13 January 2010 under the Companies Act 2006 as a public limited company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The address of its registered office is 21 St Jamess Square, London SW1Y 4JZ.
The Group is a UK-REIT and London & Stamford Property Plc is the principal Company of the UK-REIT Group.
The Companys shares trade on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.
b Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
c Basis of preparation The functional and presentational currency of the Company and all subsidiaries the Group is sterling.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that investment and development properties and derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently in all material respects.
i Estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Significant items subject to such assumptions and estimates include the fair value of investment properties, the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for potential corporation tax, amortisation of intangible assets and the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
The most critical accounting polices in determining the financial condition and results of the Group are those requiring the greatest degree of subjective or complex judgements.
These relate to property valuation, business combinations and goodwill, intangible assets, investment in associates and joint ventures, derivative financial instruments and taxation and these are discussed in the policies below.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period.
If the revision affects both current and future periods, the change is recognised over those periods.

These are: Name Description Effective date IFRS 7 Amendments to IFRS 7 01 07 2011 IAS 12 Amendments to IAS 12 01 01 2012 IAS 1 Amendments to IAS 1 01 07 2012 IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements 01 01 2013 IFRS 11 Joint arrangements 01 01 2013 IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in other entities 01 01 2013 IFRS 13 Fair value measurement 01 01 2013 IAS 27 Amendments to IAS 27 01 01 2013 IAS 28 Amendments to IAS 28 01 01 2013 IFRS 9 Financial instruments 01 01 2015 The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application, other than on presentation and disclosure.
d Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the Group using the purchase method.
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group.
Control is assumed when the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity to gain benefits from its activities.
In the consolidated balance sheet, the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
The results of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Where properties are acquired through corporate acquisitions and there are no significant assets or liabilities other than property, the acquisition is treated as an asset acquisition, in other cases the purchase method is used.
ii Joint ventures and associates Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control.
Associates are those entities over whose activities the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence but does not have the power to jointly control.
Joint ventures and associates are accounted for under the equity method, whereby the consolidated balance sheet incorporates the Groups share of the net assets of its joint ventures and associates.
The consolidated income statement incorporates the Groups share of joint venture and associate profits after tax.
The Groups joint ventures and associates adopt the accounting policies of the Group for inclusion in the Group financial statements.
iii Intangible assets Intangible assets, such as property advisory agreements acquired through business combinations, are measured initially at fair value and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Intangible assets are subject to regular reviews for impairment.
London & Stamford Property Plc 35 Report and Accounts 2012 1 Accounting policies continued iv Goodwill Any excess of the purchase price of business combinations over the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired and resulting deferred tax thereon is recognised as goodwill.
This is recognised as an asset and is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss within administration expenses and is not subsequently reversed.
Any excess of the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired and resulting deferred tax thereon over the purchase price of business combinations is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
e Property portfolio i Investment properties Investment properties are properties owned or leased by the Group which are held for long-term rental income and for capital appreciation.
Investment property includes property that is being constructed, developed or redeveloped for future use as an investment property.
Investment property is initially recognised at cost, including related transaction costs.
They are subsequently carried at each published balance sheet date at fair value on an open market basis as determined by professionally qualified independent external valuers.
The determination of the fair value of each property requires, to the extent applicable, the use of estimates and assumptions in relation to factors such as future rental income, current market rental yields, future development costs and the appropriate discount rate.
In addition, to the extent possible, the valuers make reference to market evidence of transaction prices for similar properties.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment properties are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
In accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property, no depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties.
Investment property is recognised as an asset when: it is probable that the future economic benefits that are associated with the investment property will flow to the Group: there are no material conditions precedent which could prevent completion: and the cost of the investment property can be measured reliably.
All costs directly associated with the purchase of an investment property are capitalised.
Capital expenditure that is directly attributable to the redevelopment or refurbishment of investment property, up to the point of it being completed for its intended use, is capitalised in the carrying value of the property.
ii Trading properties Trading properties are initially recognised at cost and subsequently at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
iii Tenant leases Management has exercised judgement in considering the potential transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership in accordance with IAS 17 for all properties leased to tenants and has determined that such leases are operating leases.
iv Net rental income Revenue comprises rental income.
Rental income from investment property leased out under an operating lease is recognised in the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Contingent rents, such as turnover rents, rent reviews and indexation, are recorded as income in the periods in which they are earned.
Rent reviews are recognised when such reviews have been agreed with tenants.
Where a rent free period is included in a lease, the rental income foregone is allocated evenly over the period from the date of lease commencement to the lease termination date.
Lease incentives and costs associated with entering into tenant leases are amortised over the lease term.
Revenue from the sale of trading properties is recognised in the period within which there is an unconditional exchange of contracts.
Property operating expenses are expensed as incurred and any property operating expenditure not recovered from tenants through service charges is charged to profit or loss.

f Financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual terms of the instrument.
Unless otherwise indicated, the carrying amounts of the financial assets and liabilities are a reasonable approximation of their fair values.
i Loans and receivables These are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
Loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables, intra-group loans and cash and cash equivalents.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value, plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
ii Other financial assets These comprise deposits held with banks where the original maturity was more than three months.
iii Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
iv Other financial liabilities Other financial liabilities include interest bearing loans, trade payables including rent deposits and retentions under construction contracts and other short-term monetary liabilities.
Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Interest bearing loans are initially recorded at fair value net of direct issue costs, and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the profit and loss account using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
v Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate risks.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value, which equates to cost and subsequently remeasured at fair value, with changes in fair value being included in profit or loss.
g Finance costs Net finance costs include interest payable on borrowings, net of interest capitalised and finance costs amortised.
h Finance income Finance income includes interest receivable on funds invested, measured at the effective rate of interest on the underlying sum invested.
London & Stamford Property Plc 37 Report and Accounts 2012 1 Accounting policies continued i Dividends Dividends on equity shares are recognised when they become legally payable.
In the case of interim dividends, this is when paid.
In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
j Tax Tax is included in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the related tax is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, together with any adjustment in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their tax bases.
The following differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: goodwill for which amortisation is not tax deductible: the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting or taxable profit: and investments in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner or realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
k Share-based payments The fair value of equity-settled share-based payments to employees is determined at the date of grant and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The cost of the Companys shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust is deducted from equity in the Group balance sheet.
Any shares held by the Trust are not included in the calculation of earnings per share.
l Segmental reporting An operating segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that engages in business activities, earns revenue and incurs expenses, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Groups chief operating decision-makers and for which discrete financial information is available.
The Group has one business activity, being property investment and development and operates in the United Kingdom.
The Groups investment properties are managed as a single portfolio by an asset management team whose responsibilities are not segregated by asset type or location, but on an asset by asset basis.
The Board receives financial information for the portfolio as a whole and not as separate businesses or divisions.
The Directors have considered the nature of the business, how the business is managed and how they review performance and, in their judgement believe that the Group has only one reportable business segment.
m Capital management policy The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
In managing its capital, the Groups primary objective is to ensure its continued ability to provide a consistent return for its equity shareholders through a combination of capital growth and distributions.
In order to achieve this objective, the Group seeks to maintain a gearing ratio that balances risks and returns at an acceptable level and also maintain a sufficient funding base to enable the Group to meet its working capital and strategic investment needs.
In making decisions to adjust its capital structure to achieve these aims, either through altering its dividend policy, new share issues, or the reduction of debt, the Group considers not only its short-term position but also its long-term operational and strategic objectives.

b Financial risk management Financial risk factors The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Groups financial risk management objectives are to minimise the effect of risks it is exposed to through its operations and the use of debt financing.
The principal financial risks to the Group and the policies it has in place to manage these risks are summarised below: i Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a client or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Groups principal financial assets are cash balances and deposits and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its cash deposits and trade receivables.
The Group mitigates financial loss from tenant defaults by dealing with only creditworthy tenants.
The trade receivable amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables concerned.
The balance is low relative to the scale of the balance sheet and therefore the credit risk of trade receivables is considered to be low.
Cash is placed on deposit with a diverse mix of institutions with suitable credit ratings and rates of return and for varying periods of time.
At the year end deposits were spread across eight different banks.
The credit ratings of the banks are monitored by J C Rathbone Associates Limited and reported to the Board at least quarterly in order to make necessary changes and manage risk.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited due to the Groups policy of monitoring counterparty exposures with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties.
London & Stamford Property Plc 45 Report and Accounts 2012 15 Borrowings and financial instruments continued ii Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the Groups management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt instruments.
It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations and committed investments.
The Groups funding sources are diversified across a range of banks.
Quarterly cash flow forecasts are prepared for the Board in order to ensure sufficient resources of cash and undrawn borrowing facilities are in place to meet liabilities as they fall due.
The Group deposits surplus cash with a number of banks and for varying periods of time to ensure diversification, liquidity of resources and so as to deliver appropriate returns.
The Group had cash reserves of 136.9 million 2011: 156.8 million and available and undrawn bank loan facilities at 31 March 2012 of 22.3 million 2011: nil.
Following the disposal of the Triangle Distribution portfolio on 18 April 2012 a further 150 million of undrawn bank loan facilities became available to the Group.
The following table shows the contractual maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities on an undiscounted cash flow basis and assuming settlement on the earliest repayment date.
Less than One to Two to one year two years five years Total 000 000 000 000 At 31 March 2012 Bank loans 8,553 8,553 335,134 352,240 Derivative financial instruments 5,272 5,346 4,493 15,111 13,825 13,899 339,627 367,351 Less than One to Two to one year two years five years Total 000 000 000 000 At 31 March 2011 Bank loans 9,465 9,439 406,636 425,540 Derivative financial instruments 6,436 6,419 12,343 25,198 15,901 15,858 418,979 450,738 iii Market risk Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk from the use of debt financing at a variable rate.
It is the risk that future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates.
It is Group policy that a reasonable portion of external borrowings are at a fixed interest rate in order to manage this risk.
The Group uses interest rate swaps and caps to manage its interest rate exposure and hedge future interest rate risk for the term of the bank loan.
Although the Board accepts that this policy neither protects the Group entirely from the risk of paying rates in excess of current market rates nor eliminates fully the cash flow risk associated with interest payments, it considers that it achieves an appropriate balance of exposure to these risks.
At 31 March 2012 the Group had 289 million of hedges in place, and its debt was 84% fixed.
Consequently, based on year end debt levels, a 1% change in interest rates would increase or decrease the Groups annual profit before tax by 0.7 million.
The average interest rate payable by the Group on all bank borrowings at 31 March 2012 net of undrawn facility commitment fees was 4.12% 31 March 2011: 4.08%.

The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes long-term borrowings and undrawn debt facilities, and equity comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Group balances its overall capital structure through the payment of dividends, new share issues as well as the issue of new debt or the redemption of existing debt.

All derivative financial instruments are non current and are interest rate derivatives.
The market values of hedging products change with interest rate fluctuations, but the exposure of the Group to movements in interest rates is protected by way of the hedging products listed above.
In accordance with accounting standards, fair value is calculated on a replacement basis using mid-market rates.
For all derivative financial instruments this equates to a Level 2 fair value measurement as defined by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
The valuation therefore does not reflect the cost or gain to the Group of cancelling its interest rate protection at the balance sheet date, which is generally a marginally higher cost or smaller gain than a market valuation.
