Reinsurance assets Reinsurance assets represent recoveries from reinsurers in respect of incurred claims of $966.1m, and the unearned reinsurance premiums reserve of $221.2m.
The reinsurance receivables from reinsurers are split between recoveries on claims paid or notied of $266.6m and an actuarial estimate of recoveries on claims that have not yet been reported of $699.5m.
The groups exposure to reinsurers is managed through: minimising risk through selection of reinsurers who meet strict financial criteria eg minimum net assets, minimum A rating by S&P.
These criteria vary by type of business short vs medium-tail.
The chart on page 45 shows the prole of these assets based on S&P rating at the end of 2012: timely calculation and issuance of reinsurance collection notes from our ceded reinsurance team: and regular monitoring of the outstanding debtor position by our reinsurance security committee and credit control committees.
We continue to provide against impairment of reinsurance recoveries, and at the end of 2012 we had provided $18.0m 2011: $15.7m in respect of reinsurance recoveries.

Our unearned premium reserve has increased by 10% to $891.6m.
The majority of the UPR balance relates to current year premiums that have been deferred and will be earned in future periods.
Current indicators are that this business is profitable.
Gross insurance claims reserves are made up of claims which have been notied to us but not yet paid and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported IBNR.
These are estimated as part of the quarterly reserving process involving the underwriters and group actuary.
Gross insurance claims reserves have increased by 2% to $3,592.2m.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities comprise borrowings and derivative financial liabilities.
The group utilises three long-term debt facilities: In 2006 we raised 150m of lower tier 2 unsecured xed rate debt that is payable in 2026 and callable in 2016.
In 2012 we bought back a total of 47.3m of this debt in two tranches, rstly the acquisition of 30m of the debt in May 2012 at a price of 85% of par.
On 29 October we bought in a second tranche of the existing subordinated debt, 17.3m was acquired at a price of 96% of par.
The initial interest rate payable is 7.25% and the nominal value of this debt as at 31 December 2012 is 103m: A US$18m subordinated debt facility raised in 2004.
This loan is also unsecured and interest is payable at the US interbank offered rate LIBOR plus 3.65%.
These subordinated notes are due in 2034 and have been callable at the groups option since 2009: and During September 2012 we issued a sterling denominated 5.375% retail bond under a 250,000,000 euro medium term note programme which raised 75m for the group and are due in 2019.
This diversied the source and maturity prole of the groups debt nancing.
A syndicated short-term banking facility led by Lloyds Banking Group Plc provides potential borrowings up to $225m.
Under the facility $225m may be drawn as letters of credit to support underwriting at Lloyds.
$175m may be advanced as cash under a revolving facility.
The cost of the facility is based on a commitment fee of 0.7% per annum and any amounts drawn are charged at a margin of 1.75% per annum.
The cash element of the facility will last for three years, expiring on 31 December 2014, whilst letters of credit issued under the facility can be used to provide support for the 2012 and 2013 underwriting years.
The facility is currently unutilised.
