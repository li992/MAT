 For information on the Executive Directors Incentive Plan EDIP see the Directors remuneration report on pages 127-145.
 The group operates a number of equity-settled share plans under which share units are granted to its senior leaders and certain other employees.
These plans typically have a three-year performance or restricted period during which the units accrue net notional dividends which are treated as having been reinvested.
Leaving employment will normally preclude the conversion of units into shares, but special arrangements apply for participants that leave for qualifying reasons.
Grants are settled in cash where participants are located in a country whose regulatory environment prohibits the holding of BP shares.
Performance unit plans The number of units granted is related to the level of seniority of employees and country of operation.
The number of units converted to shares is determined by reference to performance measures over the three-year performance period.
Performance measures used include BPs total shareholder return TSR compared with the other oil majors, balanced scorecard and individual rating.
The relative weighting of these different measures is related to the level of seniority of the employee.
Plans included in this category are the Competitive Performance Plan CPP no further grants to be made under this plan after 2011 and the Share Value Plan SVP.
