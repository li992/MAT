On 8 October 2008, KSF went into administration and the Group was in dispute with the administrators concerning the ownership of the shares they held.
In the 2009 financial statements the Group concluded that it may not directly control the shares for accounting purposes and therefore treated them as having been derecognised.
This derecognition resulted in the transfer of historic losses, previously recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, of 53.2m into the income statement in the year ended 26 April 2009.
47.3m of this loss was in relation to the Groups shareholding in Blacks Leisure Group Plc Blacks.
On 21 February 2010 the Company entered into an agreement with the administrator of KSF to acquire any rights which may be determined that they hold.
On 13 May 2010 the judgment of the court proceedings which commenced on 26 April 2010 was handed down.
The court determined that the Group had acquired beneficial interest in 12,153,071 ordinary shares in Blacks and 5,775,255 in JD Sports on 8 October 2008.
This acquisition was reected in the 2010 financial statements.
The judgement also resulted in the Group regaining control of the shares.
