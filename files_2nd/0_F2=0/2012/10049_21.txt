Financial instruments For cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and obligations under finance leases, fair values approximate to their book values due to the short maturity periods of these financial instruments.
For trade and other receivables, allowances are made within the book value for credit risk.
For other financial instruments, fair values are based on market values, or where not available on discounting future cash ows at prevailing market rates, and by applying year end exchange rates.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures requires the disclosure of financial assets and liabilities held at fair value using a hierarchy that reects the signicance of the inputs used in making the fair value measurements.
Derivative financial instruments measured at fair value in the following table are classied as level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy, as they have been determined using significant inputs based on observable market data.
The fair value of the non-current portion of bank and other borrowings has been determined using significant inputs which are a mixture of those based on observable market data interest rate risk and those not based on observable market data for which the URXS WDNHV DGYLFH IURP D WKLUG SDUW FUHGLW ULVN 7KH QRQ FXUUHQW SRUWLRQ RI EDQN DQG RWKHU ERUURZLQJV KHOG DW IDLU YDOXH LQ WKH IROORZLQJ WDEOH is therefore classied as level 3 in the fair value measurement hierarchy.
