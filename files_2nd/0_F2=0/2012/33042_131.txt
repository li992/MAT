Financial instruments and risk management The group issues or holds financial instruments mainly to finance its operations: to finance corporate transactions such as dividends, share buybacks and acquisitions: for the temporary investment of short-term funds: and to manage the currency and interest rate risks arising from its operations and from its sources of finance.
In addition, various financial instruments, for example trade receivables and trade payables, arise directly from the groups operations.
Financial risk management The groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk : credit risk and liquidity risk.
Funding and exposure management The group nances its operations primarily by a mixture of issued share capital, retained profits and long-term and short-term borrowing.
The group borrows in the major long-term bond markets in major currencies and typically, but not exclusively, these markets provide the most cost effective means of long-term borrowing.
The group uses derivative financial instruments primarily to manage its exposure to changes in interest and foreign exchange rates against these borrowings.
The derivatives used for this purpose are principally interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The group also uses forward currency contracts to hedge some of its currency exposures arising from overseas operations.
The group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
All transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities.
Treasury operations The group has a centralised treasury operation whose primary role is to manage liquidity, funding, investments and counterparty credit risk arising from transactions with financial institutions.
The treasury operation also manages the groups market exposures, including risks from volatility in currency and interest rates.
The treasury operation acts as a central bank to group entities providing central deposit taking, funding and foreign exchange management services.
Funding and deposit taking is usually provided in the functional currency of the relevant entity.
The treasury operation is not a profit centre and its objective is to manage financial risk at optimum cost.
Treasury policy The Board sets the policy for the groups treasury operation.
Group treasury activities are subject to a set of controls commensurate with the magnitude of the borrowing, investments and group-wide exposures.
The Board has delegated its authority to operate these policies to a series of panels that are responsible for the management of key treasury risks and operations.
Appointment to and removal from the key panels requires approval from two of the Chairman, the Chief Executive or the Group Finance Director.
The management of exposures arising from trading related financial instruments, primarily trade receivables and trade payables, is through a series of policies and procedures set at a group and line of business level.
Line of business management apply and review these policies and procedures to assess and manage the financial risk arising from these financial instruments.
There has been no change in the nature of the groups risk prole between 31 March 2012 and the date of approval of these financial statements.
Interest rate risk management Management policy The group has interest-bearing financial assets and liabilities which may expose the group to either cash ow or fair value volatility.
The groups policy, as prescribed by the Board, is to ensure that at least 70% of net debt is at xed rates.
Short-term interest rate management is delegated to the treasury operation while long-term interest rate management decisions require further approval by the Group Finance Director, Director Treasury, Tax and Risk Management or the Treasurer who have been delegated such authority from the Board.

Financial instruments and risk management continued Hedging strategy In order to manage the groups interest rate prole, the group has entered into cross-currency and interest rate swap agreements with commercial banks and other institutions to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are xed.
The duration of the swap agreements matches the duration of the debt instruments.
The majority of the groups long-term borrowings have been, and are, subject to xed Sterling interest rates after applying the impact of these hedging instruments.
Outstanding cross-currency and interest rate swaps at 31 March 2012 are detailed in the Hedging activities and Other derivatives section below.
The groups xed to oating interest rate prole, after hedging, on gross borrowings was: 2012 2011 Fixed Floating Fixed Floating rate rate rate rate interest interest Total interest interest Total At 31 March m m m m m m a Total borrowings 7,954 1,971 9,925 7,972 1,215 9,187 Ratio of xed to oating 80% 20% 100% 87% 13% 100% a See note 24.
Sensitivities Interest rates The group is exposed to volatility in the income statement and shareholders equity arising from changes in interest rates.
To demonstrate this volatility, management have concluded that a 1% increase in interest rates and parallel shift in yield curves across Sterling, US Dollar and Euro currencies is a reasonable benchmark for performing a sensitivity analysis.
After the impact of hedging, the groups main exposure to interest rate volatility in the income statement arises from fair value movements on certain derivatives not in hedge relationships, oating rate borrowings, investments and cash equivalents which are largely inuenced by Sterling interest rates.
With all other factors remaining constant at 31 March 2012, a 1% increase in Sterling interest rates would increase the groups annual net finance expense by approximately 7m 2011: 2m.
The groups main exposure to interest rate volatility within shareholders equity arises from fair value movements on derivatives held in the cash ow reserve.
The derivatives have an underlying interest exposure to Sterling, Euro and US Dollar rates.
With all other factors remaining constant and based on the composition of derivatives included in the cash ow reserve at the balance sheet date, a 1% increase in interest rates in each of the currencies would impact equity, before tax, as detailed below: 2012 2011 m m Reduce Reduce At 31 March Increase Increase Sterling interest rates 435 426 US Dollar interest rates 406 355 Euro interest rates 66 94 A 1% decrease in interest rates would have broadly the same impact in the opposite direction.

Financial instruments and risk management continued Credit ratings The groups 2016 and 2030 bonds contain a covenant such that if the groups credit rating were downgraded below A3 in the case of Moodys or below A in the case of Standard & Poors S&P, additional interest would accrue from the next coupon period at a rate of 0.25% for each ratings category adjustment by each agency.
Based on the total notional value of debt outstanding of 2.4bn at 31 March 2012, the groups finance expense would increase decrease by approximately 12m a year if BTs credit rating were to be downgraded upgraded, respectively, by one credit rating category by both agencies from the current ratings.
The groups 600m 2014 bond attracts an additional 1.25% for a downgrade by one credit rating by either or both Moodys and S&P below Baa3 BBB-, respectively.
This would result in an additional finance expense of approximately 6m a year.
At 31 March the groups credit ratings were as detailed below: 2012 2011 At 31 March Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Rating agency Standard & Poors BBB Stable BBB Positive Moodys Baa2 Stable Baa2 Stable Foreign exchange risk management Management policy The purpose of the groups foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the group from the risk that eventual future net inows and net outows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
The Boards policy for foreign exchange risk management defines the type of transactions which should normally be covered, including significant operational, funding and currency interest exposures, and the period over which cover should extend for the different types of transactions.
Short-term foreign exchange management is delegated to the treasury operation whilst long-term foreign exchange management decisions require further approval from the Group Finance Director, Director Treasury, Tax and Risk Management or the Treasurer who have been delegated such authority by the Board.
The policy delegates authority to the Director Treasury, Tax and Risk Management to take positions of up to 100m and for the Group Finance Director to take positions of up to 1bn.
Hedging strategy A significant proportion of the groups external revenue and costs arise within the UK and are denominated in Sterling.
The groups overseas operations generally trade and are funded in their functional currency which limits their exposure to foreign exchange volatility.
Foreign currency borrowings used to finance the groups operations have been predominantly swapped into Sterling using cross-currency swaps.
At 31 March foreign currency borrowings comprised: 2012 2011 At 31 March m m Euro 3,341 3,361 US Dollar 3,543 2,966 Other 117 6,885 6,344 The currency prole of these borrowings after the impact of hedging is disclosed in note 24.
The group also enters into forward currency contracts to hedge foreign currency investments, interest expense, capital purchases and purchase and sale commitments on a selective basis.
The commitments hedged are principally denominated in US Dollar, Euro and Asia Pacic region currencies.
As a result, the groups exposure to foreign currency arises mainly on its non-UK subsidiary investments and on residual currency trading ows.

Financial instruments and risk management continued Sensitivities After hedging, with all other factors remaining constant and based on the composition of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, the groups exposure to foreign exchange volatility in the income statement from a 10% strengthening weakening in Sterling against other currencies would result in a credit charge respectively of approximately 14m 2011: approximately 5m.
The groups main exposure to foreign exchange volatility within shareholders equity excluding translation exposures arises from fair value movements on derivatives held in the cash ow reserve.
The majority of foreign exchange uctuations in the cash ow reserve are recycled immediately to the income statement to match the hedged item and therefore the groups exposure to foreign exchange uctuations in equity were insignicant in both 2012 and 2011.
Outstanding cross-currency swaps at 31 March 2012 are detailed in the Hedging activities and Other derivatives sections below.
Credit risk management Treasury management policy The groups exposure to credit risk arises from financial assets transacted by the treasury operation primarily derivatives, investments, cash and cash equivalents and from its trading-related receivables.
For treasury related balances, the Boards dened policy restricts exposure to any one counterparty by setting credit limits based on the credit quality as dened by Moodys and S&P and by dening the types of financial instruments which may be transacted.
The minimum credit ratings permitted with counterparties are A3 A for long-term and P1 A1 for short-term investments.
The treasury operation continuously reviews the limits applied to counterparties and will adjust the limit according to the nature and credit standing of the counterparty up to the maximum allowable limit set by the Board.
Where multiple transactions are undertaken with a single counterparty, or group of related counterparties, the group may enter into netting arrangements to reduce the groups exposure to credit risk by making use of standard International Swaps and Derivative Association ISDA documentation.
The group also seeks collateral or other security where it is considered necessary.
The treasury operation regularly reviews the credit limits applied when investing with counterparties in response to market conditions and continues to monitor their credit quality and actively manages any exposures which arise.
Exposures The maximum credit risk exposure of the groups financial assets at the balance sheet date is as follows: 2012 2011 At 31 March Notes m m Derivative financial assets 1,023 733 Investments 22 581 80 a Trade and other receivables 17 2,477 2,558 Cash and cash equivalents 23 331 351 4,412 3,722 a The carrying amount excludes 169m 2011: 286m of non-current trade and other receivables which relate to non-financial assets, and 830m 2011: 774m of prepayments and other receivables.
The credit quality and credit concentration of cash equivalents, current asset investments and derivative financial assets are detailed in the tables below.
Where the opinion of Moodys and S&P differ, the lower rating is used.

The concentration of credit risk for trading balances of the group is provided in note 17, which analyses outstanding balances by line of business and reects the nature of customers in each line of business.
The derivative financial assets were held with nine counterparties at 31 March 2012 2011: 14 counterparties.
After applying the legal right of set-off under the groups ISDA documentation, the group had a net exposure to derivative counterparties of 705m 2011: 549m of which 98% 2011: 94% was with six counterparties 2011: six.
The group has credit support agreements with certain swap counterparties whereby on a weekly and monthly basis the fair value position on a notional 945m of long dated cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps is collateralised.
As at 31 March 2012, the group had paid cash collateral of 22m 2011: 14m in respect of fair value losses and had received cash collateral of 350m 2011: 104m in respect of fair value gains.
The collateral paid and received is recognised within cash and cash equivalents, and loans and other borrowings, respectively.
The majority of the groups derivatives are in designated cash ow hedges.
With all other factors remaining constant and based on the composition of net derivative financial assets at 31 March 2012, a 1% change in interest rates across each of the ratings categories within which these derivative financial assets are classied would change their carrying values and impact equity, before tax, as follows: Change in interest rates 1% 1% m m Reduce Reduce At 31 March 2012 Increase Increase Moodys S&P credit rating Aa3 AA 21 11 A1 A 56 62 A2 A 169 156 Baa1 BBB 131 156 377 385 Operational management policy The groups credit policy for trading related financial assets is applied and managed by each of the lines of business to ensure compliance.
The policy requires that the creditworthiness and financial strength of customers is assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis.
Payment terms are set in accordance with industry standards.
The group will also enhance credit protection, when appropriate, taking into consideration the groups exposure to the customer, by applying processes which include netting and offsetting, and requesting securities such as deposits, guarantees and letters of credit.
The group takes proactive steps including constantly reviewing credit ratings of relationship banks to minimise the impact of adverse market conditions on trading-related financial assets.

Financial instruments and risk management continued Capital management policy The objective of the groups capital management policy is to reduce net debt over time whilst investing in the business, supporting the pension scheme and paying progressive dividends.
In order to meet this objective, the group may issue or repay debt, issue new shares, repurchase shares, or adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders.
The group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the group.
The Board regularly reviews the capital structure.
No changes were made to these objectives and processes during 2012 and 2011.
The groups capital structure consists of net debt and shareholders equity.
The following analysis summarises the components which the group manages as capital: 2012 2011 At 31 March m m Net debt 9,082 8,816 a Total parent shareholders equity 1,297 1,925 10,379 10,741 a See page 100.
Net debt Net debt consists of loans and other borrowings both current and non-current, less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents.
Loans and other borrowings are measured at the net proceeds raised, adjusted to amortise any discount over the term of the debt.
For the purpose of this measure, current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Currency denominated balances within net debt are translated to Sterling at swapped rates where hedged.
Net debt is considered to be an alternative performance measure as it is not dened in IFRS.
The most directly comparable IFRS measure is the aggregate of loans and other borrowings current and non-current, current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents.
A reconciliation from this measure, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to net debt is given below.
2012 2011 At 31 March m m Loans and other borrowings 10,486 9,856 Less: Cash and cash equivalents 331 351 Current asset investments 513 19 9,642 9,486 Adjustments: To retranslate debt balances at swap rates where hedged by currency swaps 228 408 To remove accrued interest applied to reect the effective interest method and fair value adjustments 332 262 Net debt 9,082 8,816 Liquidity risk management Management policy The group ensures its liquidity is maintained by entering into short, medium and long-term financial instruments to support operational and other funding requirements.
The group determines its liquidity requirements by the use of both short and long-term cash forecasts.
These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom analysis which is used to assess funding adequacy for at least a 12-month period.
On at least an annual basis the Board reviews and approves the maximum long-term funding of the group and on an ongoing basis considers any related matters.
Short and medium-term requirements are regularly reviewed and managed by the treasury operation within the parameters of the policies set by the Board.
Renancing risk is managed by limiting the amount of borrowing that matures within any specified period and having appropriate strategies in place to manage renancing needs as they arise.
The maturity prole of the groups term debt at 31 March 2012 is disclosed in note 24.
The group has term debt maturities of 1.7bn in 2013.
During 2012 and 2011 the group issued commercial paper and held cash, cash equivalents and current investments in order to manage shortterm liquidity requirements.
At 31 March 2012 the group has undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 1.5bn 2011: 1.5bn maturing in March 2016.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Maturity analysis The groups remaining contractually agreed cash ows, including interest, associated with non-derivative and derivative financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis, which therefore differs from both the carrying value and fair value, is as follows: Interest on Loans loans Trade and and other and other other Non-derivative financial liabilities borrowings borrowings payables Provisions Total At 31 March 2012 m m m m m Due within one year 2,632 630 4,180 48 7,490 Between one and two years 10 533 39 582 Between two and three years 1,132 534 24 1,690 Between three and four years 845 471 16 1,332 Between four and five years 695 416 11 1,122 After five years 4,839 3,875 259 8,973 10,153 6,459 4,180 397 21,189 Effect of interest 255 255 Fair value adjustment for hedged risk 78 78 a Total 10,486 6,459 4,180 397 21,522 Interest on Loans loans Trade and and other and other other borrowings borrowings payables Provisions Total At 31 March 2011 m m m m m Due within one year 221 639 4,285 57 5,202 Between one and two years 1,747 639 38 2,424 Between two and three years 10 548 38 596 Between three and four years 1,209 548 18 1,775 Between four and five years 901 482 16 1,399 After five years 5,507 4,358 223 10,088 9,595 7,214 4,285 390 21,484 Effect of interest 264 264 Fair value adjustment for hedged risk 3 3 a Total 9,856 7,214 4,285 390 21,745 a Foreign currency related cash ows were translated at closing rates as at the relevant reporting date.

The carrying amounts are included in the group balance sheet under the indicated headings.
The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of financial assets and liabilities are as follows: the fair values of listed investments were estimated using quoted market prices for those investments at the balance sheet date the carrying amount of short-term deposits and investments equates to fair value due to the short maturity of the investments held the carrying amount of trade receivables and payables approximated to fair values due to the short maturity of amounts payable and receivable the fair value of the groups bonds and other long-term borrowings has been estimated on the basis of quoted market prices for the same or similar issues with the same maturities where they existed and on calculations of the value of future cash ows using approximate discount rates in effect at the balance sheet date where market prices of similar issues did not exist the fair value of the groups outstanding swaps and foreign exchange contracts were estimated using discounted cash ow models and market rates of interest and foreign exchange at the balance sheet date.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Fair value hierarchy The table below shows financial assets and financial liabilities that have been measured at fair value, analysed by the level of valuation method.
The three levels of valuation methodology used are: Level 1 uses quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 uses inputs for the asset or liability other than quoted prices, that are observable either directly or indirectly Level 3 uses inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data, such as internal models or other valuation methods.

Hedging activities Our hedging policies use derivative financial instruments to manage financial risk.
Derivatives that are held as hedging instruments are formally designated as hedges as dened in IAS 39.
Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes if they meet the criteria for designation as fair value hedges or cash ow hedges in accordance with IAS 39.
Fair value hedges Fair value hedges principally consist of interest rate and cross-currency swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair value of xedrate, long-term financial instruments due to movements in market interest rates.
For qualifying fair value hedges, all changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the hedged item in relation to the risk being hedged are recognised in the income statement.
If the hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the fair value adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the item and is amortised to the income statement as a yield adjustment over the remainder of the life of the hedged item.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Gains and losses arising on fair value hedges at 31 March were as follows: 2012 2011 Gains losses m m On hedging instruments 81 3 On hedged items attributable to hedged risk 81 3 Cash ow hedges Exposure arises from the variability in future interest and currency cash ows on assets and liabilities which bear interest at variable rates and or are in a foreign currency.
Interest rate and cross-currency swaps are transacted, and where they qualify, designated as cash ow hedges, to manage this exposure.
Fair value changes on derivatives designated as cash ow hedges are initially recognised directly in the cash ow hedge reserve, as gains or losses recognised in equity.
Amounts are transferred from equity and recognised in the income statement as the income or expense is recognised on the hedged asset or liability.
Forward foreign currency contracts are used to hedge anticipated and committed future currency cash ows.
Where these contracts qualify for hedge accounting they are designated as cash ow hedges.
On recognition of the underlying transaction in the financial statements, the associated hedge gains and losses, deferred in equity, are transferred and included with the recognition of the underlying transaction.
The gains and losses on ineffective portions of such derivatives are recognised immediately in the income statement.
See note 27 for details of movements in the cash ow hedge reserve.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement or on the balance sheet.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.

Other derivatives The groups policy is not to use derivatives for trading purposes.
However, due to the complex nature of hedge accounting under IAS 39 some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specically not designated as a hedge where natural offset is more appropriate.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.
At 31 March 2012 the group held certain foreign currency forward and interest rate swap contracts which were not in hedging relationships in accordance with IAS 39.
Foreign currency forward contracts were economically hedging operational purchases and sales.
The interest rate swap contracts became ineffective on first time adoption of IFRS.
The volatility arising from these swaps is recognised through the income statement but is limited due to a natural offset in their fair value movements.
