Share-based payments share options The fair value of employee services received as consideration for share options equity settled of the company was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Options vested after two, three and four years and lapsed after a maximum term of ten years.
No new options were granted during the year, therefore no inputs to the option model, etc is provided for the current year.
Refer to the remuneration report on pages 131 to 149 of this annual report for the following details in respect of the options: Q the weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year: and Q a reconciliation of option movements in the year.
Employment cost continued Moto options Equity settled options over 774 163 ordinary shares were issued in relation to Moto options during the year ending 31 December 2009, as part of the acquisition of the joint venture interest in Moto.
The weighted average exercise price of these options at 15 October 2009 the date of completion of the Moto acquisition was US$56.39 per option.
The fair value of these share options was calculated as US$20.2 million.
The Black Scholes valuation model was used to determine the fair value of these options.
All of these options have vested.
No options were granted during the year, therefore no inputs to an option model are provided for the current year.
All the remaining options were exercised or lapsed during 2012.

Restricted shares issued to executive directors in 2009 and 2010 The restricted shares issued to executive directors in 2009 and 2010 were subject to directors remaining employed, as well as being subject to a market performance condition, being the companys relative TSR performance over three years against the HSBC Global Gold Index.
This has been assessed and had a minimal impact on the fair value estimate at the grant date.
The fair value of the restricted shares is based on the share price on the grant date and the share-based payment charge is charged to profit evenly between the grant and vesting dates.
The restriction on the shares no dividends received during the vesting period had a minimal impact on the fair value estimate at the grant date.
The restricted shares have an exercise price of nil.
Details of the awards that vested and lapsed in the year are shown on pages 145 and 149 of the directors remuneration report in this annual report, together with details of the award dates and market prices at award and vesting periods.
Restricted shares issued to management Restricted shares issued to management are subject to a satisfactory performance level being achieved during the 12 month period prior to the exercise date of each tranche of shares.
The minimum performance level to be achieved is dened as level 3 on the companys performance management system.
All employees to whom restricted shares have been granted are expected to meet this level of performance.
The performance period is typically up to five years where the employee must remain in employment for the shares to vest.
There are no market based vesting conditions on the restricted share awards.
The fair value of the restricted shares issued in 2011 and 2012 are detailed below and the share-based payment charge is charged to profit evenly between the grant and vesting dates.
An amount of US$1.1 million 2011: US$1.6 million was capitalised to development projects during the year, as it related to share-based payment shares for employees involved in these projects.
The restriction on the shares no dividends received during the vesting period has a minimal impact on the fair value estimate at the grant date.

Employment cost continued The fair value of the restricted shares issued to management in 2012 was calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model.
The key assumptions used in this model for shares granted during the year ending 31 December 2012 were as follows: Group January 2012 August 2012 Note Quantity of shares awarded 120 000 106 200 Fair value of shares awarded US$13.4 million US$9.5 million Performance period 3,4 & 5 years 3,4 & 5 years Volatility 18.1 39.0%, 54.3% & 50.9% 37.4%, 48.8% & 49.3% Risk-free interest rate 0.4%, 0.8% & 0.8% 0.3%, 0.7% & 0.7% Dividend yield 0.4% 0.4% Weighted average share price on grant and valuation date 18.2 US$113.42 US$90.63 Weighted average exercise price - - 18.1 Volatility is based on the three year historical volatility of the companys shares on each grant date.
18.2 Weighted average share price for the valuation is calculated taking into account the market price on all grant dates.
In 2011, there were two awards: 360 000 awards in January 2011 and 127 200 awards in August 2011.
The market price at the award dates were US$76.49 and US$103.9 respectively and vested over three, four and five years in equal tranches.
The volatility, risk free rate and dividend yield had no significant impact on fair value but were consistent with those above.
The total fair value of the awards was US$40.8 million over the vesting periods.
Restricted share awards granted to executive directors in 2011 and 2012 The Restricted Share Scheme operates with conditional share awards, where the awards shall vest in three equal one-third instalments.
If the performance conditions are met, awards vest to participants at the end of each performance period.
The whole award is subject to four mutually exclusive performance conditions, ie absolute TSR market based, EPS growth, additional reserves and absolute reserves.
Grant date fair value was calculated using the market-based measure.
No dividends are attributable during the vesting period.
Refer to the remuneration report on pages 131 to 149 of this annual report for more detail.
The fair value of the restricted shares issued to executive directors in 2012 and 2011 was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
