The differences are explained as follows: 2012 2011 Group M M profit before taxation 90.3 100.5 profit before taxation multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 24.5% 2011: 26.5% 22.1 26.6 Effects of: adjustment in respect of prior years 7.9 0.7 adjustment in respect of foreign tax rates 0.9 4.2 expenses not deductible for tax purposes 1.9 5.9 impact of rate change on deferred tax asset 1.0 3.6 Total tax expense 16.2 24.0 In 2012 the adjustment in respect of prior years of 7.9 million includes a credit of 8.4 million resulting from a reduction in provisions for uncertain tax positions.
This arises as a result of the Group rening its method to reect the latest best estimate of probable future outows of economic benets.
Excluding this credit and the credit of 1.1 million on the exceptional item, the total tax expense for 2012 is 25.7 million which represents an effective tax rate on pre-exceptional profit of 27.0%.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share EPS from continuing operations is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to shareholders of 74.1 million 2011: 76.5 million by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period of 251.9 million 2011: 253.6 million which has been adjusted to exclude the weighted average number of shares held by the employee trust.
For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of IPF plc ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary share options relating to employees of the Group.
The weighted average number of shares used in the basic and diluted EPS calculations can be reconciled as follows: 2012 2011 Group M M Used in basic EPS calculation 253.6 251.9 Dilutive effect of awards 5.1 6.9 258.7 Used in diluted EPS calculation 258.8 Basic and diluted EPS are presented below: 2012 2011 Group pence pence Basic EPS 29.42 30.17 Dilutive effect of awards 0.60 0.79 29.57 Diluted EPS 28.63 The adjusted earnings per share of 27.6 pence, shown in the financial review, has been presented at a constant 27.0% tax rate and before exceptional items in 2012 in order to better present the performance of the Group.
As explained in note 5, the effective tax rate in 2012 was impacted by a one-off adjustment to the tax charge arising from rening the method for providing for uncertain tax provisions and the underlying rate was 27.0%.

Deferred tax has not been provided on unremitted earnings of the Groups overseas subsidiaries as it is considered that any future distribution will fall within the UKs dividend exemption, and hence no exposure to UK tax is expected to arise.

Risks arising from financial instruments Risk management Treasury related risks The Board approves treasury policies and the treasury function manages the day-to-day operations.
The Board delegates certain responsibilities to the Treasury Committee.
The Treasury Committee, which is chaired by the Finance Director, is empowered to take decisions within that delegated authority.
Treasury activities and compliance with the treasury policies are reported to the Board on a regular basis and are subject to periodic independent reviews and audits, both internal and external.
Treasury policies are designed to manage the main financial risks faced by the Group in relation to funding and liquidity risk: interest rate risk: currency risk: and counterparty risk.
This is to ensure that the Group is properly funded: that interest rate and currency risk is managed within set limits: and that financial counterparties are of appropriate credit quality.
Policies also set out the specic instruments that can be used for risk management.
The treasury function enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups underlying business operations.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken and written options may only be used when matched by purchased options.
Liquidity risk The Group is subject to the risk that it will not have sufficient borrowing facilities to fund its existing business and its future plans for growth.
The short-term nature of the Groups business means that the majority of amounts receivable from customers are receivable within 12 months with an average period to maturity of less than six months.
The risk of not having sufficient liquid resources is therefore low.
The treasury policy adopted by the Group serves to reduce this risk further by setting a specic policy parameter that there are sufficient committed debt facilities to cover forecast borrowings plus operational headroom plus appropriate stress-testing for the next 18 months on a rolling basis.
Further, the aim is to ensure that there is a balanced renancing prole with phased maturity dates: that there is diversication of debt funding sources: that there is no over-reliance on a single or small group of lenders: and that the debt facilities are sufficient for the currency requirements of each country.
At 31 December 2012, the Groups bonds and committed borrowing facilities had an average period to maturity of 2.2 years 2011: 2.8 years.
As shown in note 19, total undrawn facilities as at 31 December 2012 were 159.5 million 2011: 171.4 million.
A maturity analysis of gross borrowings included in the balance sheet is presented in note 19.
A maturity analysis of bonds, bank borrowings and overdrafts outstanding at the balance sheet date by non-discounted contractual cash ow, including expected interest payments, is shown below: Group Company 2012 2011 2012 2011 M M M M Not later than six months 16.1 5.0 11.6 1.2 Later than six months and not later than one year 35.6 33.5 16.9 25.5 Later than one year and not later than two years 42.7 70.0 29.1 42.3 Later than two years and not later than five years 299.8 285.1 215.0 238.5 394.2 393.6 272.6 307.5 The analysis above includes the contractual cash ow for borrowings and the total amount of interest payable over the life of the loan.
Where borrowings are subject to a oating interest rate, an estimate of interest payable is taken.
The rate is derived from interest rate yield curves at the balance sheet date.

A maturity analysis of the Groups receivables and borrowing facilities as at 31 December is presented below: Percentage Borrowing Percentage Receivables of total facilities of total Group M % M % 2011 Less than one year 555.3 99.1 17.2 3.8 Later than one year 5.1 0.9 430.7 96.2 560.4 100.0 447.9 100.0 2012 Less than one year 627.2 96.4 76.2 16.2 Later than one year 23.1 3.6 394.1 83.8 650.3 100.0 470.3 100.0 This demonstrates the short-term nature of the amounts receivable from customers which contrasts with the longer-term nature of the Groups committed funding facilities.
Amounts receivable from customers Risk management policies in respect of amounts receivable from customers are discussed in the credit risk section within this note.
Interest rate risk The Group has an exposure to interest rate risk arising on changes in interest rates in each of its countries of operation and, therefore, seeks to limit this net exposure.
This is achieved by the use of techniques to x interest costs, including xed rate funding, predominantly longer-term bond funding : forward currency contracts used for non-functional currency funding: bank borrowing loan draw-down periods: and interest rate hedging instruments.
These techniques are used to hedge the interest costs on a proportion of borrowings over a certain period of time, up to five years, although most hedging is for up to two years.

Risks arising from financial instruments continued Interest costs are a relatively low proportion of the Groups revenue 6.4% in 2012: 6.6% in 2011 and therefore the risk of a material variance arising from a change in interest rates is low.
If interest rates across all markets increased by 200 basis points this would have the following impact: 2012 2011 Group M M Increase in fair value of derivatives taken to equity 1.2 1.7 Reduction in profit before taxation 0.4 0.8 This sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: s THE CHANGE IN THE MARKET INTEREST RATE OCCURS IN ALL COUNTRIES WHERE THE 'ROUP HAS BORROWINGS AND OR DERIVATIVE financial instruments: s WHERE lNANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE SUBJECT TO lXED INTEREST RATES OR HAVE THEIR INTEREST RATE lXED BY HEDGING INSTRUMENTS it is assumed that there is no impact from a change in interest rates: and s CHANGES IN MARKET INTEREST RATE AFFECT THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE lNANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Currency risk The Group is subject to three types of currency risk: net asset exposure: cash ow exposure: and income statement exposure.
Net asset exposure The majority of the Groups net assets are denominated in currencies other than sterling.
The balance sheet is reported in sterling and this means that there is a risk that a uctuation in foreign exchange rates will have a material impact on the net assets of the Group.
The impact in 2012 is an increase in net assets of 11.7 million 2011: reduction of 40.2 million.
The Group aims to minimise the value of net assets denominated in each foreign currency by funding overseas receivables with borrowings in local currency, where possible.
Cash ow exposure The Group is subject to currency risk in respect of future cash ows which are denominated in foreign currency.
The policy of the Group is to hedge a large proportion of this currency risk in respect of cash ows which are expected to arise in the following 12 months.
Where forward foreign exchange contracts have been entered into, they are designated as cash ow hedges on specic future transactions.
Income statement exposure As with net assets, the majority of the Groups profit is denominated in currencies other than sterling but translated into sterling for reporting purposes.
The result for the period is translated into sterling at the average exchange rate.
A risk therefore arises that a uctuation in the exchange rates in the countries in which the Group operates will have a material impact on the consolidated result for the period.
The following sensitivity analysis demonstrates the impact on equity of a 5% strengthening or weakening of sterling against all exchange rates for the countries in which the Group operates: 2012 2011 Group M M Change in reserves 0.8 1.4 Change in profit before taxation 0.9 1.5 This sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: s THERE IS A STRENGTHENING WEAKENING OF STERLING AGAINST ALL CURRENCIES IN WHICH THE 'ROUP OPERATES 0OLISH ZLOTY Czech crown, euro Slovakia, Hungarian forint, Mexican peso and Romanian leu : and s THERE IS NO IMPACT ON RETAINED EARNINGS OR EQUITY ARISING FROM THOSE ITEMS WHICH ARE NATURALLY HEDGED where the currency asset is exactly equal to the currency liability.
Counterparty risk The Group is subject to counterparty risk in respect of the cash and cash equivalents held on deposit with banks: and foreign currency and derivative financial instruments.
The Group only deposits cash, and only undertakes currency and derivative transactions, generally with highly rated banks and sets strict limits in respect of the amount of exposure to any one institution.
Institutions with lower credit ratings can only be used with Board approval.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 93 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 20.
Risks arising from financial instruments continued No collateral or credit enhancements are held in respect of any financial assets.
The maximum exposure to counterparty risk is as follows: 2012 2011 Group M M 17.9 Cash and cash equivalents 24.2 Derivative financial assets 10.0 Total 24.2 27.9 The above table represents a worst case scenario of the counterparty risk that the Group is exposed to at the year end.
An analysis of the cash and cash equivalents by geographical segment is presented in note 16.
Cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments are neither past due nor impaired.
Credit quality of these assets is good and the cash and cash equivalents are spread over a number of banks, each of which meets the criteria set out in our treasury policies, to ensure the risk of loss is minimised.
Credit risk The Group is subject to credit risk in respect of amounts receivable from customers.
Amounts receivable from customers The Group lends small amounts over short-term periods to a large and diverse group of customers across the countries in which it operates.
Nevertheless, the Group is subject to a risk of material unexpected credit losses in respect of amounts receivable from customers.
This risk is minimised by the use of credit scoring techniques which are designed to ensure the Group only lends to those customers who we believe can afford the repayments.
The amount lent to each customer and the repayment period agreed are dependent upon the risk category the customer is assigned to as part of the credit scoring process.
The level of expected future losses is generated on a weekly basis by geographical segment.
These outputs are reviewed by management to ensure that appropriate action can be taken if results differ from management expectations.
2012 2011 Group M M Amounts receivable from customers 650.3 560.4 The table above represents a worst case scenario of the credit risk that the Group is exposed to at the year end.
An analysis of the amounts receivable from customers by geographical segment is presented in note 15.
Amounts receivable from customers are stated at amortised cost and calculated in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
Those amounts receivable from customers that are neither past due nor impaired represent loans where no customer payments have been missed and there is, therefore, no evidence to suggest that the credit quality is anything other than adequate.
The Groups accounting policy in respect of amounts receivable from customers requires that as soon as a customer misses any portion of a contractual payment the account is reviewed for impairment and the amount receivable is reduced to reect the revised expected future cash ows.
The result of this is that any loan which is past due where any portion of a payment has been missed will attract a deduction for impairment.
Therefore, amounts receivable from customers include no amounts that are past due but not impaired.

Risks arising from financial instruments continued An analysis of the amounts receivable from customers that are individually determined to be impaired is set out by geographical segment below: Not impaired Impaired 2012 2011 2012 2011 Group M M M M Poland 71.4 61.3 192.6 161.0 Czech-Slovakia 48.2 45.8 106.4 104.9 Hungary 36.7 27.9 52.4 40.2 Mexico 19.9 16.0 67.2 50.2 Romania 20.1 20.6 35.4 32.5 196.3 171.6 454.0 388.8 This analysis includes all loans that have been subject to impairment.
The impairment charge is based on the average expected loss for each arrears stage of customer receivables and this average expected loss is applied to the entire arrears stage.
This results in a significant proportion of the amounts receivable from customers attracting an impairment charge.
For each market the amount by which an asset is impaired depends on the type of product, the recent payment performance and the number of weeks since the loan was issued.
There will, therefore, be a large amount of receivables which are classed as impaired but where the carrying value is still a large proportion of the contractual amount recoverable.
Annualised impairment as a percentage of revenue for each geographical segment is shown below: 2012 2011 Group % % Poland 29.6 30.5 Czech-Slovakia 25.6 20.9 Hungary 15.2 12.1 Mexico 28.3 30.2 Romania 32.0 26.1 The carrying value of amounts receivable from customers that would have been impaired had their terms not been renegotiated is nil 2011: nil.
Capital risk The Group is subject to the risk that its capital structure will not be sufficient to support the growth of the business.
The Group is not required to hold regulatory capital.
The Group aims to maintain appropriate capital to ensure that it has a strong balance sheet but at the same time is providing a good return on equity to its shareholders.
The Groups long-term aim is to ensure that the capital structure results in an optimal ratio of debt and equity finance.
Capital is monitored by considering the ratio of equity to receivables and the gearing ratio.
The equity of the Group and these ratios are shown below: 2012 2011 Group M M Receivables 560.4 650.3 Borrowings 310.8 276.5 Other net assets 36.3 43.8 Equity 375.8 327.7 Equity as % of receivables 57.8% 58.5% Gearing 0.8 0.8 Equity as a percentage of receivables was above the internal minimum requirement set by the Group.
Gearing, which is equal to borrowings divided by equity, at a ratio of 0.8 times 2011: 0.8 times, is well within covenant limits of 3.75 times.

Derivative financial instruments Fair value estimation IFRS 7 requires disclosure of fair value measurements of derivative financial instruments by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy: s QUOTED PRICES UNADJUSTED IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES LEVEL s INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES INCLUDED WITHIN LEVEL THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY EITHER DIRECTLY that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices level 2 : and s INPUTS FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY THAT ARE NOT BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA THAT IS UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS LEVEL The fair value of other Group assets and liabilities is included in note 23.
All of the Groups financial instruments fall into hierarchy level 2.
The Groups derivative assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value at 31 December are as follows: 2012 2011 Group M M Assets Foreign currency contracts 10.0 10.0 Total 2012 2011 Group M M Liabilities Interest rate swaps 0.3 0.8 Foreign currency contracts 0.6 0.3 Total 1.4 The fair value of derivative financial instruments has been calculated by discounting expected future cash ows using interest rate yield curves and forward foreign exchange rates prevailing at 31 December.
The Company has no derivative financial instruments.
Cash ow hedges The Group uses foreign currency contracts cash ow hedges to hedge those foreign currency cash ows that are highly probable to occur within 12 months of the balance sheet date and interest rate swaps cash ow hedges to hedge those interest cash ows that are expected to occur within two years of the balance sheet date.
The effect on the income statement will also be within these periods.
An amount of 2.1 million has been credited to equity for the Group in the period in respect of cash ow hedges 2011: credit of 0.4 million, Company: nil 2011: nil.
Foreign currency contracts The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency contracts that the Group is committed to at 31 December 2012 is 229.9 million 2011: 270.2 million.
These comprise: s FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO BUY OR SELL OPERATIONAL CURRENCIES AGAINST THE EURO FOR A TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF 222.1 million 2011: 266.0 million.
These contracts have various maturity dates up to January 2015 2011: November 2013.
These contracts have been designated and are effective as cash ow hedges under IAS 39 and, accordingly, the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity: s FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO BUY OR SELL VARIOUS CURRENCIES FOR A TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF a MILLION a MILLION These contracts have various maturity dates up to December 2013 2011: November 2012.
These contracts have been designated and are effective as cash ow hedges under IAS 39 and, accordingly, the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity: and s FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO BUY OR SELL STERLING FOR A TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF a MILLION a MILLION 4HESE contracts have various maturity dates up to March 2013 2011: February 2012.
These contracts have been designated and are effective as cash ow hedges under IAS 39 and, accordingly, the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity.
The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency contracts that the Company is committed to at 31 December 2012 is 4.7 million 2011: 3.2 million.
All of these contracts are held with external providers to buy and sell currency and all have equal and offsetting contracts with other Group companies to buy and sell the same amounts of currency.
This leaves the Company with no residual risk and ensures the relevant subsidiary company has an effective foreign currency contract in its books.
96 International Personal Finance plc Financial Statements 21.
Derivative financial instruments continued In 2012 the Group also entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to economically hedge against forecast profits denominated in foreign currency.
These foreign exchange contracts do not hedge against a specic future cash ow so do not qualify for hedge accounting: changes in their fair value are, therefore, taken to the income statement.
None of these contracts were outstanding at the balance sheet date.
The Group discontinued its policy of hedging foreign currency profits from 2013.
Interest rate swaps The total notional principal of outstanding interest rate swaps that the Group is committed to is 130.9 million 2011: 86.4 million.
In 2012, these interest rate swaps cover a proportion of current borrowings relating to the oating rate Polish bond and a proportion of oating rate bank borrowings.
Interest rate swaps in place at the balance sheet date are designated, and are effective under IAS 39, as cash ow hedges, and the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity within the hedging reserve.
A charge of nil 2011: nil has been made to the income statement in the year representing the movement in the fair value of the ineffective portion of the interest rate swaps and the income statement charge relating to the closure of interest rate swaps.
The weighted average interest rate and period to maturity of the Group interest rate swaps were as follows: 2012 2011 Weighted Weighted Weighted Range of average Weighted Range of average average interest period to average interest period to interest rate rates maturity interest rate rates maturity Group % % Years % % Years Polish zloty 5.3 4.7-5.8 0.7 4.9 3.9-5.8 0.8 Mexican peso 5.9 5.9 1.0 5.4 5.0-5.9 1.0 The Company did not hold any interest rate swaps at 31 December 2012 31 December 2011: nil.

The carrying value of bank borrowings is deemed to be a good approximation of their fair value.
Bank borrowings can be repaid within six months if the Group decides not to roll over for further periods up to the contractual repayment date.
The impact of discounting would therefore be negligible.
The fair value of the bonds has been calculated by reference to their market value.
Derivative financial instruments are held at fair value which is equal to the expected future cash ows arising as a result of the derivative transaction.
For other financial assets and liabilities, which are all short-term in nature, the carrying value is a reasonable approximation of the fair value.

Retirement benefit obligations Pension schemes dened benefit With effect from 1 March 2010, the Groups dened benefit pension scheme was closed to further accrual of dened benefit obligations, with all members being offered the opportunity to join a money purchase scheme.
Scheme assets are stated at fair value at 31 December 2012.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 2012 2011 Group and Company % % Price ination CPI 2.5 2.4 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.0 2.9 Discount rate 4.7 4.5 Long-term rate of return: equities n a 6.6 bonds n a 4.7 index-linked gilts n a 3.1 overall weighted average n a 5.3 The expected return on plan assets is determined by considering the expected returns available on the assets underlying the current investment policy.
Expected yields on xed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields as at the balance sheet date.
Expected returns on equity investments reect long-term real rates of return experienced in the respective markets.
The expected return on assets for 2012 has been derived using the long-term rate of return from 2011 in the table above.
Upon transitioning to IAS 19 revised Employee benets effective 1 January 2013, the income statement charge does not make any allowance for the expected return on assets, and instead uses the discount rate.
Therefore, the long-term rate of return as at 31 December 2012 will not have any impact on the income statement.
The mortality assumptions are based on standard tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
Different assumptions are used for different groups of members.
Most members have not yet retired.
On average, we expect a male retiring in the future at age 65 to live for a further 28 years.
On average, we expect a female retiring in the future at age 65 to live for a further 29 years.
If life expectancies had been assumed to be one year greater for all members, the charge to the income statement would have increased by nil and the present value of dened benefit obligations would have increased by approximately 0.9 million.

Pension schemes dened contribution The dened benefit pension scheme is no longer open to further accrual.
All eligible UK employees are invited to join stakeholder pension plans into which the Group contributes between 8% and 20% of members pensionable earnings, provided the employee contributes a minimum of 5%.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
The pension charge in the income statement represents contributions payable by the Group in respect of the plan and amounted to 0.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2012 2011: 0.8 million.
nil of contributions were payable to the plan at the year end 2011: nil.
In addition, an amount of 0.1 million 2011: 0.1 million has been charged to the income statement in respect of contributions into personal pension arrangements for certain directors and employees.
Share-based payments The Group currently operates four categories of share schemes: The International Personal Finance plc Performance Share Plan the Performance Share Plan : The International Personal Finance plc Approved Company Share Option Plan the CSOP : The International Personal Finance plc Employee Savings-Related Share Option Scheme the SAYE scheme : and The International Personal Finance plc Deferred Share Plan the Deferred Share Plan.
A number of awards have been granted under these schemes during the period under review.
The income statement charge in respect of the Performance Share Plan and the CSOP has been calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model as these schemes are subject to a total shareholder return TSR performance target.
The income statement charge in respect of the SAYE scheme is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model, however no TSR targets are assigned.
As there are no additional performance criteria attaching to the Deferred Share Plan the income statement charge is calculated using the actual share price at the date the award is granted.
The total income statement charge in respect of these share-based payments is 2.0 million 2011: 1.9 million.
