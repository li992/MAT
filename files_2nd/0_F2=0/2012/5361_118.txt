23 Retirement benefit obligations The Group has a number of contributory and non-contributory post retirement benefit plans providing retirement benets for the majority of employees and executive directors.
The main schemes in the UK, US and the Netherlands are of the dened benefit type, the benefit being based on number of years of service and either the employees final remuneration or the employees average remuneration during a period of years before retirement.
The assets of these schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds or are unfunded but provided for on the Group balance sheet.
In addition the Group operates an unfunded post-retirement medical benefit PRMB scheme in the US.
The entitlement to these benets is usually based on the employee remaining in service until retirement age and completion of a minimum service period.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out on 30 September 2011 for the UK scheme and at 31 December 2012 for the US and Netherlands schemes.

Options may be exercised typically within three months following the end of the savings period.
Options were valued as shown in the table below using the binomial option pricing model.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculations are as follows: 2012 2011 Fair value per option pence 114.3 93.5 Expected volatility per cent 46.4 53.0 Risk free rate per cent 0.5 2.1 Expected dividend yield per cent 2.3 2.0 Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous 5 years.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of $4.0 million 2011: $2.5 million related to share based payment transactions during the year which includes awards made under the Long Term Incentive Plan as amended in 2010 as shown in the table opposite.
The table opposite also shows all outstanding options granted under the 2010 LTIP and the executive and savings related share option schemes.
These shadow options had not until 2011 been previously disclosed in the table above due to materiality, but were included in the calculation of the total expenses recognised by the Group related to share based payments.
