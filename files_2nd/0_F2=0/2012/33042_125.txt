Retirement benefit plans Background The group has both dened benefit and dened contribution retirement benefit plans.
The groups main plans are in the UK and the largest by membership is the BT Pension Scheme BTPS which is a dened benefit plan that has been closed to new entrants since 31 March 2001.
Subsequent to that date new entrants have been able to join a dened contribution plan, currently the BT Retirement Saving Scheme BTRSS, a contract based dened contribution arrangement.
Dened contribution plans A dened contribution plan is a pension arrangement under which both the company and participating members pay xed contributions into an independently administered fund.
Pension benets for members of the plan are linked to contributions paid, the performance of each individuals chosen investments and the annuity rates at retirement.
The income statement charge in respect of dened contribution plans represents the contribution payable by the group based upon a xed percentage of employees pay.
The company has no exposure to investment and other experience risks.
Dened benefit plans A dened benefit plan is a pension arrangement under which participating members receive a pension benefit at retirement dependent on factors such as age, years of service and pensionable pay.
Benets are determined by the scheme rules and are not dependent upon actual contributions made by the company or members.
The plan is administered by an independent trustee who is responsible for ensuring that the scheme is sufciently funded to meet current and future benefit payments and who must therefore agree with the sponsoring company a funding plan for additional company contributions where it is estimated that the benets will not be met from regular contributions and expected investment returns.
The income statement service cost in respect of dened benefit plans represents the increase in the dened benefit liability arising from pension benets earned by active employees in the current period.
The company is exposed to investment and other experience risks.
BTPS At 31 March 2012 there were 325,000 members of the BTPS.
Members belong to one of three sections depending upon the date they first joined the scheme.
Section A is for members who joined before 1 December 1971, Section B is for members who joined the scheme between 1 December 1971 and 31 March 1986 and Section C is for members who joined the scheme on or after 1 April 1986 but before the scheme closed to new entrants on 31 March 2001.
The membership is analysed below: Number of Number of active deferred Number of Total At 31 March 2012 members members pensioners membership a Sections A and B 20,500 42,000 177,500 240,000 Section C 26,000 42,000 17,000 85,000 Total at 31 March 2012 46,500 84,000 194,500 325,000 At 31 March 2011 a Sections A and B 23,500 46,000 173,000 242,500 Section C 27,500 42,500 15,000 85,000 Total at 31 March 2011 51,000 88,500 188,000 327,500 a Section A and Section B memberships have been aggregated in this table as Section A members have typically elected to take Section B benets at retirement.
Since 1 April 2009, when changes to member benets and contribution rates were introduced, BTPS members have accrued benets based upon a career average re-valued earnings CARE basis and a normal pensionable age of 65.
On a CARE basis benets are built up based upon earnings in each year and the benefit accrued for each year is increased by the lower of ination or the individuals actual pay increase in each year to retirement.
Benets earned for pensionable service prior to that date are based upon a members final salary and a normal pensionable age of 60.
Under the scheme rules the bases for determining the rate of ination for statutory minimum rates of revaluation and indexation of benets are based upon either the Retail Prices Index RPI or the Consumer Prices Index CPI which apply to each category of member as shown below: Active members Deferred members Pensioners Section B Benets accrue on a CARE Preserved benets are revalued Increases in pensions in basis increasing at the lower before retirement based payment are based upon CPI of RPI or the individuals upon CPI Section C actual pay increase Increases in pensions in payment are based upon RPI up to a maximum of 5% Additional information Additional information Financial statements Financial statements Governance Governance Performance Performance Strategy Strategy Business Business Overview Overview 128 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 20.
Retirement benefit plans continued Management of the scheme BT Pension Scheme Trustees Limited the Trustee has been appointed by BT to administer and manage the scheme on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed of the scheme and relevant legislation.
Under the terms of the BTPS Trust Deed there are nine Trustee directors all of whom are appointed by BT.
The chairman of the Trustee is appointed after consultation with and with the agreement of the relevant trade unions who are also responsible for nominating four directors to act as representatives of the members.
Of the remaining four directors, two will normally hold senior positions within the group, and two will normally hold or have held senior positions in commerce or industry.
Subject to there being an appropriately qualied candidate at least one of the Trustee directors should be a current pensioner or deferred pensioner of the BTPS.
Trustee directors are appointed for a three-year term, but are then eligible for re-appointment.
Further details of the governance of the BTPS, its financial position, performance of its investments and a summary of member benets are available in the BTPS Annual Report typically published by the Trustee in May or June each year.
Accounting under IAS 19 Group income statement The expense or income arising from all group pension arrangements recognised in the group income statement is shown below: 2012 2011 2010 Year ended 31 March m m m Recognised in the income statement before specic items Current service cost: dened benefit plans 267 297 206 dened contribution plans 126 119 98 Total operating expense 393 416 304 Specic items note 9 Interest expense on pension plan liabilities 2,092 2,323 2,211 Expected return on pension plan assets 2,289 2,244 1,932 Net interest income expense included in specic items 197 79 279 Total recognised in the income statement 196 495 583 The service cost that will be recognised in the income statement in 2013 relating to dened benefit plans is estimated to be around 30m lower than in 2012.
The net pension interest within specic items is expected to be a credit of around 30m for 2013, a decrease of around 165m, mainly due to lower expected returns on assets more than offsetting the higher asset values.
Group statement of comprehensive income Actuarial gains and losses arise on both dened benefit liabilities and plan assets due to changes in assumptions compared with the start of the year and actual experience being different from those assumptions.
These are recognised in full in the group statement of comprehensive income in the year in which they arise.

This includes both financial assumptions, which are based on market conditions at the year end, and demographic assumptions such as life expectancy.
b The actuarial loss or gain arising from experience adjustments on dened benefit liabilities represents the impact on the liabilities of differences between actual experience during the year compared with the assumptions made.
Such differences might arise, for example, from members choosing different benefit options at retirement, actual salary increases being different from those assumed or actual pension increases being higher than the long-term ination assumption.
c The actuarial loss or gain arising from experience adjustments on plan assets represents the difference between actual investment performance in the year and the expected rate of return on assets assumed at the start of the year.

Retirement benefit plans continued BTPS assets Asset allocation The target allocation of assets between different classes of investment is reviewed regularly and is a key factor in the Trustees investment policy.
The targets set reect the Trustees views on the appropriate balance to be struck between seeking returns and incurring risk, and on the extent to which the assets should be distributed to match liabilities.
Current market conditions and trends are continuously assessed and short-term tactical shifts in asset allocation may be made around the long-term target.
The BTPS also uses financial instruments to balance the asset allocation and to manage interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
In the light of uncertainty in global economic conditions the Trustee has held a more defensive asset allocation during the year.
This has included a short-term tactical decision to hold a lower equity allocation.
The lump sum deficit payment of 2.0bn made in late March 2012 is included in cash and other.
In April 2012 the Scheme invested around 2.0bn of cash in a portfolio of global corporate bonds.
Under IAS 19 plan assets must be valued at the bid market value at the balance sheet date.
For the main asset categories: securities listed on recognised stock exchanges are valued at closing bid prices properties are valued on the basis of open market value unlisted equities are valued in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital IPEVC guidelines.
Unlisted xed interest and index-linked instruments are valued using the latest market price or using discounted cash ow models that consider credit risk.
The fair values of the assets of the BTPS analysed by asset category and the assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on assets at 31 March were: 2012 2011 Expected Expected long-term long-term rate of return rate of return b b per year Asset fair value Target per year Asset fair value Target At 31 March % bn%%% bn%% UK equities 7.10 1.9 5 9 7.90 3.2 8 9 Non-UK equities 7.10 5.9 16 22 7.90 8.2 22 22 Fixed-interest securities 3.70 7.4 19 22 5.00 4.4 12 22 Index-linked securities 2.90 7.4 19 15 4.10 5.9 16 15 Property 6.50 4.1 11 11 7.00 3.9 11 11 a Alternative assets 6.00 8.1 21 21 6.70 7.3 20 21 Cash and other 2.20 3.5 9 3.60 4.1 11 5.40 38.3 100 100 6.35 37.0 100 100 a Alternative asset classes include commodities, hedge funds, private equity, infrastructure and credit opportunities.
b At 31 March 2012 and 31 March 2011, the schemes assets did not include any ordinary shares of the company.
However, the scheme held 8m 2011: 7m of index-linked bonds and nil 2011: 10m of bonds issued by the group.
The expected returns on xed-interest and index-linked securities are based on the gross redemption yields at the start of the year which assume that the security is held to maturity.
Expected returns on equities, property and alternative asset classes are based on a combination of an estimate of the risk premium above yields on government bonds, consensus economic forecasts of future returns and historical returns.
The overall expected long-term rate of return on assets at the end of the year is derived using the expected long-term rates of return for each category of asset weighted by the target asset allocation.
The resulting percentage is used to calculate the expected return on plan assets reported in the income statement in the following year as a specic item.
The Trustee reports on investment performance against a target benchmark which is based on the target asset mix and the market returns for each asset class.
BTPS performance against the benchmark for the periods to 31 December 2011 was as follows: Over Target Actual under benchmark BTPS performance Period ending 31 December 2011 %%% 1 year 3.7 1.7 2.0 3 years 8.6 8.4 0.2 10 years 5.4 6.2 0.8 Further commentary on investment performance is provided by the Trustee in the BTPS Annual Report.

Retirement benefit plans continued BTPS liabilities under IAS 19 Valuation methodology The liabilities of the BTPS are measured as the present value of the best estimate of future cash ows to be paid out by the scheme using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of scheme liabilities is calculated by estimating future benefit payments and discounting the resulting cash ows.
These calculations are performed for the company by a professionally qualied independent actuary.
The expected future benefit payments are based on a number of assumptions including future ination, retirement ages, benefit options chosen and life expectancy and are therefore inherently uncertain.
Actual benefit payments in a given year may be higher or lower, for example if members retire sooner or later than assumed, or take more or less cash lump sum at retirement.
The estimated duration of BTPS liabilities, which is an indicator of the weighted average term of the liabilities, is 15 years 2011: 15 years although the benets payable by the BTPS are expected to be paid over more than 80 years as shown in the following graph: Forecast benets payable by the BTPS at 31 March 2012 m 3,000 2,500 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 0 2013 2033 2063 2073 2093 Key assumptions IAS 19 The key financial assumptions used to measure the liabilities of the BTPS under IAS 19 are as follows: a b Nominal rates per year Real rates per year 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2010 At 31 March %%%%%% Rate used to discount liabilities 4.95 5.50 5.50 1.84 2.03 1.83 Ination increase in RPI 3.05 3.40 3.60 c d c d Ination increase in CPI 2.30 2.40 n a 0.75 1.0 n a Average future increases in wages and salaries 3.05 3.40 3.60 a The nominal rate is used to discount the future expected benefit payments.
b The real rate is calculated relative to RPI ination and is shown as a comparator.
c Assumed to reduce by 0.45% per year after the third year.
d Assumed to be 0.50% per year lower for the first year.
Rate used to discount liabilities IAS 19 requires that the discount rate is determined by reference to market yields at the reporting date on high quality corporate bonds.
The currency and term of these should be consistent with the currency and estimated term of the pension obligations.
In line with developing best practice and reecting a more sophisticated methodology, the discount rate at 31 March 2012 is based on a market-based AA corporate bond yield curve that matches the duration of the BTPS liabilities.
This improved approach will be applied consistently going forward.
At 31 March 2011 and 2010 the discount rate was based on a published index yield for a basket of corporate bonds and had this approach continued to be applied at 31 March 2012 the discount rate would have been around 30 basis points lower and the net pension deficit around 1.4bn higher net of tax.
Retirement benefit plans continued Ination increases in RPI and CPI Salary increases are assumed to be aligned with RPI ination whilst benets are assumed to increase by either RPI or CPI ination as prescribed by the rules of the BTPS and summarised above.
The assumption for RPI has been assessed by reference to yields on long-term xed and index-linked Government bonds and Bank of England published inationary expectations.
CPI is assessed at a margin below RPI taking into account market forecasts and independent estimates of the long-run difference, such as the Ofce of Budgetary Responsibilitys projection of a long-term difference of between 1.3% to 1.5%.
Longevity The average life expectancy assumptions, after retirement at 60 years of age, are as follows: 2012 2011 Number of Number of At 31 March years years Male in lower pay bracket 25.8 25.3 Male in higher pay bracket 27.5 27.6 Female 28.3 28.2 Average improvement for a member retiring at age 60 in 10 years time 1.0 1.1 The assumptions about life expectancy have regard to information published by the UK actuarial professions Continuous Mortality Investigation.
However, due to the size of the membership of the BTPS it is considered appropriate for the adopted life expectancy assumptions to take into account the actual membership experience of the scheme.
Allowance is also made for future improvements in mortality.
The BTPS actuary undertakes formal reviews of the membership experience at every triennial valuation.
Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure BTPS liabilities The assumptions on the discount rate, ination, salary increases and life expectancy all have a significant effect on the measurement of scheme liabilities.
The following table provides an indication of the sensitivity of the IAS 19 pension liability at 31 March 2012, and of the income statement charge for 2013, to changes in these assumptions: Decrease Decrease Decrease increase in increase in increase in net finance liability service cost income bn m m 0.25 percentage point increase to: discount rate 1.4 10 5 ination rate assuming RPI, CPI and salary increases all move by 0.25 percentage points 1.2 10 15 salary increases assuming RPI and CPI are unchanged 0.2 5 10 Additional one year increase to life expectancy 0.9 5 45 0.1 percentage point increase in expected return on assets 35 BTPS funding Triennial funding valuation The triennial valuation is carried out for the Trustee by a professionally qualied independent actuary, using the projected unit credit method.
The purpose of the valuation is to design a funding plan to ensure that the scheme has sufficient funds available to meet future benefit payments.
The latest funding valuation was performed as at 30 June 2011 rather than at 31 December 2011, the latest allowable date, which enabled the valuation to be largely completed and a lump sum deficit payment of 2.0bn to be made before 31 March 2012.
The next funding valuation will have an effective date of no later than 30 June 2014.
The valuation basis for funding purposes, which is based on prudent assumptions, is broadly as follows: assets are valued at market value at the valuation date: and liabilities are measured on an actuarial funding basis using a projected unit credit method and discounted to their present value.

Retirement benefit plans continued The results of the two most recent triennial valuations which have been performed using the same methodology were: June December 2011 2008 valuation valuation bn bn BTPS liabilities 40.8 40.2 Market value of BTPS assets 36.9 31.2 Funding deficit 3.9 9.0 Percentage of accrued benets covered by BTPS assets at valuation date 90.4% 77.6% Percentage of accrued benets on a solvency basis covered by the BTPS assets at the valuation date 66.0% 57.0% The reduction of the funding deficit in the period from 31 December 2008 to 30 June 2011 reects an increase in scheme assets due to deficit contribution payments totalling 1.6bn and strong investment performance of 10.1% per year.
The liabilities have increased due to a lower discount rate which was partly offset by the impact of the announcement in July 2010 by the Government that CPI, rather than RPI, will be used as the basis for determining the rate of ination for the statutory minimum rate of revaluation and indexation of occupational pension rights.
Key assumptions funding valuation These valuations were determined using the following prudent long-term assumptions: a Nominal rates per year Real rates per year June December June December 2011 2008 2011 2008 valuation valuation valuation valuation %%%% Discount rate Pre-retirement liabilities 6.35 6.76 3.05 3.65 Post retirement liabilities 4.90 5.21 1.65 2.15 Average long-term increase in RPI 3.20 3.00 Average long-term increase in CPI 2.20 n a 1.0 n a Average future increases in wages and salaries 3.20 3.00 Average increase in pensions linked to RPI 3.20 3.00 Average increase in pensions linked to CPI 2.20 n a 1.0 n a a The real rate is calculated relative to RPI ination and is shown as a comparator.
The average life expectancy assumptions, after retirement at 60 years of age, are as follows: June December 2011 2008 valuation valuation Number of Number of At date of valuation years years Male in lower pay bracket 26.0 25.5 Male in higher pay bracket 27.8 27.7 Female 28.5 28.3 Average improvement for a member retiring at age 60 in 10 years time 1.2 1.1 Payments made to the BTPS 2012 2011 Year ended 31 March m m Ordinary contributions 171 266 deficit contributions 2,000 1,030 Total contributions in the year 2,171 1,296 The group expects to contribute approximately 550m to the BTPS in 2013, comprising ordinary contributions of 225m and deficit contributions of 325m.
In 2012 ordinary contributions were lower compared with 2011 due to a deduction to recover overpayments made in an earlier year.
Retirement benefit plans continued Future funding obligations and recovery plan Under the terms of the Trust Deed, the group is required to have a funding plan, determined at the conclusion of the triennial funding valuation, which is a legal agreement between BT and the independent trustee and should address the deficit over a maximum period of 20 years.
In May 2012, the 2011 triennial funding valuation was nalised, agreed with the Trustee and certied by the Scheme Actuary.
The funding deficit at 30 June 2011 was 3.9bn.
Under the associated recovery plan BT made a payment of 2.0bn in March 2012 and will make deficit payments of 325m in March 2013 and 2014 followed by seven annual payments of 295m in each year from 2015 to 2021.
The valuation in addition determined that the ordinary contributions rate required to meet the benets of current employed members reduce to 13.5% of pensionable salaries including employee contributions from 13.6% with effect from 1 June 2012.
The valuation documentation will now be submitted to the Pensions Regulator for review.
The final Court decision in the Crown Guarantee case, after any appeals, will give greater clarity as to the extent to which the liabilities of the BTPS are covered by the Crown Guarantee.
This will inform the Pensions Regulators next steps with regard to the valuation of the scheme.
Under the 2008 recovery plan, the group made payments of 525m in December 2009 and 2010, and 505m in March 2011.
The next payment would have been 583m in December 2012 and subsequent annual payments over the next 13 years would have increased by 3% per year to 856m in 2025.
Other protections The 2011 funding agreement with the Trustee included additional features for BT to provide support to the scheme: In the event that net cumulative shareholder distributions exceed cumulative pension deficit contributions over the period from 1 March 2012 to 30 June 2015 then BT will make additional matching contributions to the scheme.
Shareholder distributions include dividends and the cost of share buybacks excluding any possible buybacks associated with existing employee share plans after deducting any proceeds from the issue of shares.
BT will consult with the Trustee if it considers making a special dividend or embarking on a share buyback programme excluding any possible buybacks associated with existing employee share plans.
These provisions apply until the nalisation of the next valuation or 30 June 2015 at the latest.
In the event that BT generates net cash proceeds greater than 1bn from disposals and acquisitions in any year to 30 June then BT will make additional contributions to the scheme equal to one third of those net cash proceeds.
BT will consult with the Trustee if it considers making acquisitions with a total cost of more than 1bn in any 12-month period.
These provisions apply until the nalisation of the next valuation or 30 September 2015 at the latest.
A negative pledge that provides protection that future creditors will not be granted superior security to the scheme in excess of a 1.5bn threshold.
This provision applies until the deficit reduces below 2.0bn at any subsequent funding valuation.
In addition, in order to provide greater certainty, BT has committed to a schedule of future potential payments based upon a range of deficits at the next triennial valuations at 2014 and 2017.
These payments would be in addition to the remaining deficit payments of 295m per year under the 2011 recovery plan and would have a maximum value of around 3.6bn in 2014 and 3.0bn in 2017 based on 2011 discount rates.
At the 2014 valuation, the remaining 2011 recovery plan will be worth about 1.7bn based on 2011 discount rates.
If the deficit agreed at the 2014 valuation exceeds this level, BT will provide extra payments in addition to the remaining 295m annual deficit payments under the 2011 recovery plan.
The amounts payable are dependent on the level of the deficit as shown in the table below: Additional contributions payable 2015 2016 2017 m m m deficit above remaining 2011 recovery plan present value nil 1.0bn 199 205 211 2.0bn 273 282 289 2.9bn or above 360 371 381 At deficit levels between these values the level of additional contributions is scaled accordingly.
At a level of 2.9bn or above these are the maximum additional contributions under the terms of this agreement.
A new agreement would cover additional contributions if these are required.
