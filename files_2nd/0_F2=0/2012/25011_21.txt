Operating expenses continued Contractual arrangements The Group places reliance on a number of key suppliers to carry out its business and has procedures to ensure that purchasing decisions balance cost against other factors including service quality, global reach and resilience.
The success of ICAPs voice business is reliant on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees.
Employee costs represent approximately 65% of total costs.
A number of legal arrangements, including rolling-term contracts and non-compete arrangements, are used to mitigate the risk of key employees being lost to competitors.
Information technology costs which represent approximately 11% of total costs are key to the delivery of voice, electronic and post trade risk and information products and services.
The Group seeks to ensure that its systems have full redundancy and are capable of operating from business continuity sites.
The balance of costs represent premises, governance, clearing and other costs.
These represent 24% of total costs.
The settlement of matched principal and exchange-traded businesses requires access to clearing houses either directly or through third party providers of clearing and settlement services.
In North America the Group is a member of the FICC and NSCC through which it clears US Treasury products, agency, mortgage and equity trades for its customer base.
In Europe and Asia Pacific, with the exception of base metal clearing on LCH.
Clearnet Group Ltd, the majority of the Groups clearing activities are outsourced to third parties where ICAP seeks to partner with one of the leading clearing providers in each market.
Intangible assets arising on consolidation Intangible assets arising on consolidation include goodwill and other separately identifiable assets such as customer relationships, brands and customer contracts that arose on business combinations since 1 April 2004.
The amortisation and any impairment or reversal of impairment is included in the consolidated income statement within the column acquisition and disposal costs.
The Group reviews the performance of the businesses and reassesses the likely period over which the acquired intangible asset is likely to continue to generate cash flows that exceed the carrying value.
As a result some businesses will have no impairment in a particular year while others will.
i Goodwill Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates and represents the cost of the acquisition in excess of the fair value of the Groups share of the net assets acquired.
Fair values are determined based on an assessment of the value of the individual assets and liabilities acquired, including reference to market prices, discounted expected future cash flows to present value or replacement cost as appropriate.
Where the Group makes an acquisition and the balances are reported as provisional at the year end, the Group has a measurement period of up to 12 months from the date of acquisition to finalise the provisional amounts.
The value of goodwill and intangible assets arising on consolidation can be amended where new information becomes available about facts and circumstances that existed at the balance sheet date.
The measurement period ends as soon as the information required is received.
Goodwill is initially recognised at cost and is subsequently held at cost less any provision for impairment.
Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested annually for impairment or whenever there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
Goodwill acquired since 2004 is held in the currency of the underlying assets of the business and is revalued at the closing rate at each reporting period end.
Goodwill acquired before 2004 is held in pound sterling and is not revalued.
Goodwill acquired prior to 1998 was immediately eliminated against reserves and was not reinstated on transition to IFRS.
Goodwill held on the consolidated balance sheet on transition to IFRS in 2004 has been recognised at its book value at the date of transition and is no longer amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
86 Notes to the financial statements continued 5.
Intangible assets arising on consolidation continued i Goodwill continued Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries and joint ventures is shown within non-current assets.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates is included within their carrying value.
On disposal of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the attributable goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal, with the exception of goodwill written off to reserves prior to 1998, which remains eliminated.
ii Separately identifiable intangible assets The Group has recognised separately identified intangible assets on acquisitions where appropriate.
These assets generally include customer contracts and relationships.
Intangible assets acquired by the Group are initially stated at fair value and subsequently adjusted for amortisation and any impairment.
All intangible assets have a finite life.
Amortisation of separately identifiable intangible assets is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Customer relationships 2 10 years Customer contracts Period of contract Other intangible assets Period of contract A deferred tax liability is recognised against the asset where the amortisation is non-tax deductible.
The liability unwinds over the same period as the asset is amortised.
iii Impairment Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually.
Goodwill and other intangible assets arising on consolidation are allocated to a cash generating unit CGU at acquisition.
A CGU is the smallest segment on which it is practicable to report a Group business.
Where the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment charge is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement, and the asset is impaired to its recoverable amount.
For goodwill, impairment charges previously recognised are not reversed and impaired intangible assets are reviewed annually for reversal of previously recognised impairments.
This process requires the exercise of significant judgement by management: if the estimates made prove to be incorrect or performance does not meet expectations which affect the amount and timing of future cash flows, goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired in future periods.

Intangible assets arising on consolidation continued b Impairment testing of intangible assets arising on consolidation continued Key assumptions The key assumptions used for impairment testing are as follows: Pre-tax discount rate Long-term growth rates % % 2012 2011 2012 2011 Key budget assumptions EBS Macro economic outlook New products and markets Technology 11 12 3 1 BrokerTec Macro economic outlook Regulation 11 12 3 2 Traiana Volume growth New products and markets 11 14 3 5 Reset New products Market share 11 12 2 2 TriOptima Customer base Regulation 11 12 3 3 Link Market size Regulation 11 12 3 3 ICAP Shipping Macro economic outlook Rate assumptions Volume assumptions 13 14 3 3 The Groups long-term pre-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC decreased from 12% to 11%.
This change was attributable to a fall in ICAPs share price, which reduced the weighting of equity in the WACC calculation, which outweighed the impact of an increase in the market risk premium.
For voice businesses in Brazil and Asia Pacific and businesses outside the core interdealer broker franchise, such as ICAP Shipping, management has added a premium to reflect local country risk based on the differential between local sovereign debt rates and the prevailing rates in the UK or the risk associated with the smaller scale of these businesses.
The premiums added to the Group WACC for each business are reviewed annually and, where these are deemed to be no longer necessary as businesses grow and integrate further into the Group, as is the case with Traiana in the current year, these will be removed.
The long-term growth rates have been reviewed and the rates applied do not exceed the expected growth in the local economy after the fifth year, or for businesses which operate on a global scale, the global Gross Domestic Product GDP.
Impairment testing The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
The Group uses a five-year impairment model as required under IAS36 Impairment of assets unless a different period is justified.
With the exception of ICAP Shipping which uses a ten-year model due to its cyclical nature, all the Groups models are over five years.
The model uses pre-tax cash flow projections which extend forward to perpetuity using a terminal value calculation and which take account of the approved budget for the coming year and the following two-year approved strategy.
The strategy takes into account both the strategic actions of the business and impacts associated with its external environment, such as regulatory reform.
Cash flows for years four and five rely on estimates of growth factors determined by the business.
The Group applies a suitable discount factor to the future cash flows based on its pre-tax WACC.
Growth rates are applied conservatively and do not exceed the expected growth in the local economy after the fifth year, or for businesses which operate on a global scale, the global GDP.
As part of the impairment review, management considers current year performance, against the budget and assumptions used in the prior year model.
Where results have varied management has prepared an analysis to validate resulting differences.
Where applicable, management has looked to external support in the form of market activity reports to validate assumptions used in the models.

Intangible assets arising on consolidation continued b Impairment testing of intangible assets arising on consolidation continued Impairment testing continued The value-in-use calculations are sensitive to changes in assumptions used in cash flow projections and, in particular, long-term growth rates.
Sensitivity analysis specific to each business has been performed on each of the base case models, considering possible changes to key assumptions used in the model.
While the models for BrokerTec, EBS, Reset and TriOptima showed no risk of impairment under the sensitivities performed, the headroom on the Traiana, ICAP Shipping and Link models were either lower or more sensitive to changes in assumptions and are discussed further below.
Link The Group acquired Link, a global equity derivatives broker, at the beginning of April 2008.
At the time of acquisition, Link held a strong market position as the leading global equity derivatives broker, in a market which had expanded significantly over the previous five to seven years.
Since acquisition, the business has performed in line with the market, maintained its market-leading position and remained profitable.
However, since the global financial crisis broke, the equity derivatives market has contracted, with industry data showing no sign of a return to the levels of volumes traded and growth levels anticipated on acquisition.
Management expects to see a consolidation within the equity derivatives broking market and a push towards hybrid trading due to increased regulation, with both expected to improve margins: however, the impact of these factors is not currently quantifiable.
Although Link has not seen its market share contract, market conditions have led to the impairment of goodwill by 58m.
The business remains sensitive to future changes in market conditions, with a 10% worsening of modelled cash flows based on industry forecasts causing a further 12m impairment to goodwill.
Arkhe Arkhe, a Brazilian voice broker, was acquired in 2009 for an initial consideration of 12m.
On acquisition the fair value of the net liabilities acquired was 17m.
Included within the 17m net liabilities acquired were provisions booked as fair value adjustments of 38m, which led to the bulk of the initial goodwill of 30m to be generated.
33m of these provisions were released during 2011 12 as the risk of the exposure was no longer expected to occur.
The release of the provision and insufficiently probable forecast profits were the main driver in causing a full impairment to goodwill 30m and other intangible assets recognised on acquisition 5m.
The business remains loss making to date: it is however expected to move into profit in the next twelve months.
ICAP Shipping ICAP Shippings model remains cyclical and is linked to the Baltic indices and growth in world GDP which drives the cash flows of the dry chartering dry and tanker wet businesses.
The growth assumptions used in the prior year base case model predicted rates of growth in both dry and wet that were in excess of those seen in 2011 12.
The current year base case model predicts a positive outlook for the wet business, with the prospects of dry remaining subdued until the later part of 2013.
The latter has led to an impairment of 4m.
The overall impairment model remains sensitive to changes in its key assumptions, being volumes and rates.
A 5% fall in either the rates or volumes assumptions over the ten-year model would cause a further 7m impairment to goodwill.
Traiana Traiana remains on track to achieve its growth strategy, achieving a profit for 2011 12 in line with budgeted expectations.
Post 2011 12 Traiana anticipates to generate significant profit growth year-on-year by increasing volumes through new products and markets.
The key assumption in the model continues to be volumes, which drive the cash flow of the business.
A 15% fall in the base case cash flows over the five-year model, caused by decreased volumes, would put the business in a breakeven position.
Traiana also remains sensitive to changes in discount rates, with a 1% increase in the discount rate reducing headroom by 22m.
Other Over recent years the Group has taken a number of impairments relating to First Brokers as the business is dependent on a number of key brokers whose contracts are moving towards renewal.
No impairment has been identified in the current year based on a range of probability weighted scenarios relating to the contract renewals of key brokers 2011 4m.
A further 6m of impairments has been recognised due to deterioration in market conditions relating to the operations of ICAP Korea 4m and Ocean Tomo 2m.

Borrowings Long-term borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, being their issue proceeds net of transaction costs incurred.
At subsequent reporting dates long-term borrowings are held at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, with changes in value recognised through the consolidated income statement.
Transaction costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.

Interest payments are made quarterly.
The Group also has in issue 300m of five-year senior notes the Notes repayable in July 2014 with a coupon of 7.5%.
The Notes were issued at a price of 99.496, and are shown net of both this discount and fees of 1m 2011 1m directly attributable to the issue.
The carrying value of the Notes of 255m 2011 263m includes a fair value hedging adjustment to increase the carrying value by 5m 2011 2m decrease relating to the mark-to-market of the interest portion of the Notes.
To enable the Group to manage the translational exposure which arises as a result of the Notes being denominated in euros and to meet its risk management objective of minimising both interest cost and the impact of interest volatility on its consolidated income statement, the Group entered into a number of cross-currency swaps to convert its obligations over the life of the Notes from euros to pound sterling at 1.16.
100m of the Notes have been swapped from a fixed euro-denominated coupon of 7.5% to a fixed pound sterling denominated coupon of 8.58% and the remaining 200m from a fixed euro-denominated coupon of 7.5% to a floating pound sterling denominated coupon of six month LIBOR plus 4.92%.
The interest payments are made annually on the fixed pound sterling swaps and semi-annually on the floating pound sterling swaps.
The fixed to fixed swaps have been accounted for as a cash flow hedge and at 31 March 2012 have a fair market value of 4m liability 2011 1m liability.
These swaps offset the effect of FX on the Notes, which resulted in a nil charge 2011 nil being recognised in the consolidated income statement and a 2m credit 2011 2m charge in other comprehensive income during the year.
The fixed to floating swaps have been treated as a fair value hedge, have a fair market value of 3m 2011 5m at 31 March 2012 and resulted in a 2m charge 2011 6m charge being recognised in the consolidated income statement during the year.
The impact on the consolidated income statement relating to the fair value movement on the Notes is a 3m credit 2011 6m credit.
The fair value of the long-term borrowings is not materially different from their book values.
There are no long-term external borrowings in the Company.

The drawings under the RCF as at 31 March 2012 of 225m 2011 183m are net of capitalised fees of 2m 2011 4m.
To take advantage of lower short-term interest rates, the amounts drawn as at 31 March 2012 were for a one-week period and have been included within short-term borrowings.
The facility carries a floating interest rate at LIBOR plus 2% with an additional 0.5% payable dependent on the debt to earnings ratio.
The weighted average effective interest rate for the year was 2.2% 2011 2.2%.
The Group continues to issue commercial paper under its 500m European Commercial Paper programme, providing a diverse source of finance for the Groups working capital and margin requirements.

The weighted average effective interest rate was 1.4% 2011 0.9%.
Bank overdrafts and other loans are for short-term funding and are repayable on demand, and are generally repaid within a very short time period.
The Groups bank facilities contain a number of customary financial and operational covenants.
The Group remained in compliance with the terms of these covenants throughout the year ended 31 March 2012.
Under the terms of the Groups bank financings, the Company is required to remain as the ultimate holding company in the Group.
A change of the ultimate holding company of the Group could result in the Groups three-year unsecured revolving credit facility becoming repayable.
The fair value of the short-term borrowings is not materially different from their book values.
c Liquidity risk management Group The Group always ensures that it has sufficient and appropriate financial resources to enable it to meet its financial obligations as they fall due under stress-tested scenarios.
Under the terms of the investment firm consolidation waiver granted to ICAP by the FSA, ICAP is precluded from undertaking proprietary trading, and consequently has limited exposure to liquidity risk when compared to a bank or other market risk-taking financial institutions.
ICAPs liquidity risk is restricted to margin and collateral requirements of clearing houses or financial institutions which provide ICAP with access to clearing houses.
The most significant margin requirements arise in the US where, as part of its broking business, ICAP provides clearing services to customers and is required to deposit margin with the FICC and NSCC.
During the year to 31 March 2012, these deposits averaged $43m.
Cash held at clearing houses, or a financial institution providing ICAP with access to a CCP, is disclosed as restricted funds in the financial statements see note 7.
The Group has no other material margin requirements on a routine basis.
Trading entities of the Group use locally held highly liquid assets together with committed and uncommitted credit facilities to meet their forecast financial obligations as they fall due.
92 Notes to the financial statements continued 6.
Borrowings continued c Liquidity risk management continued Group continued The Group has a centralised approach to the provision of contingency funding for its trading entities.
On behalf of the board, the GRACC regularly reviews the liquidity demands of the Group and the financial resources available to meet these demands.
The GRACC ensures that the Group, in totality, has sufficient liquidity available in order to provide constant access, even in periods of market turmoil, to an appropriate level of cash, other forms of marketable securities and committed funding lines to enable it to finance its ongoing operations, proposed acquisitions and other reasonable unanticipated events on cost-effective and attractive terms.
One metric used in determining adequacy of resources is to ensure that the Group always has 156m $250m of centrally available cash and other financial resources.
At 31 March 2012, the Group had gross debt of 629m 2011 565m and cash and cash equivalents of 547m 2011 404m see note 7 b.
It is the Groups policy to hold only cash necessary to meet local regulatory, commercial, settlement and short-term working capital requirements and for excess cash to be used to reduce gross debt.
Cash has increased from 31 March 2011 as a result of cash received from non-controlling interests and additional funding of UK regulated entities.
The Group invests its cash balances in a range of capital protected instruments including money market deposits, AAA liquidity funds and government bonds with the objective of optimising the return, while having regard to security, liquidity and counterparty risk.
With the exception of some small, local cash management balances, surplus cash is invested with strong investment grade institutions which have an equivalent credit rating of A or better and are marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period.
Counterparty limits applied are reviewed by the GRACC in conjunction with the risk function.
To provide protection against unexpected events, the Group has traditionally maintained minimum core liquidity, in the form of cash and undrawn debt facilities, of 156m $250m.
The headroom remained undrawn throughout the year.
At 31 March 2012, the Group had committed headroom under its core credit facilities of 324m 2011 362m.

As at 31 March 2012, the Groups long-term issuer default rating on senior debt was BBB with a stable outlook by Fitch and Baa2 with a negative outlook by Moodys.
With the exception of a change in outlook by Moodys from stable to negative on 29 February 2012 there have been no other changes to ICAPs ratings since the ratings were initially issued in April 2008 Fitch and June 2008 Moodys.
Company The Companys policy is to ensure that it has constant access to an appropriate level of liquidity to enable it to finance its forecast ongoing operations, proposed acquisitions and other reasonable unanticipated events on cost-effective and attractive terms.
If the Company has any cash, it is loaned intra-group for further investment.
All of the Companys financial liabilities are payable within three months, with the exception of a subordinated loan owed to a subsidiary of 140m which has a maturity date of 26 March 2014.

Cash Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments which are subject to insignificant risk of change in fair value and are readily convertible into a known amount of cash with less than three months maturity.
The Group holds money, and occasionally financial instruments, on behalf of customers client monies in accordance with local regulatory rules.
Where the Group is not beneficially entitled to these amounts, they are excluded from the consolidated balance sheet along with the corresponding liabilities to customers.
Restricted funds are comprised of cash held with a CCP clearing house or a financial institution providing ICAP with access to a CCP, but excluding client money.

e Restricted funds Restricted funds comprise cash held at a CCP clearing house or a financial institution providing ICAP with access to a CCP.
The balance fluctuates based on business events around the year end and fell during the year by 23m to 50m.
Tax Tax on the profit for the year comprises both current and deferred tax as well as adjustments in respect of prior years.
Tax is charged or credited to the consolidated income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the tax is also included in other comprehensive income or directly within equity, respectively.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method, in respect of temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for reporting purposes and the amounts charged or credited for tax purposes.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rate of tax expected to apply when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and intangibles arising on consolidation, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
No provision is made in respect of any further tax liability that would arise on the distribution of retained earnings of overseas joint ventures and associates.
Deferred tax liabilities are offset against deferred tax assets within the same taxable entity or qualifying local tax group where there is both the legal right and the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Significant judgement is required in determining the Groups income tax liabilities.
In arriving at the current and deferred tax liability the Group has taken account of tax issues that are subject to ongoing discussions with the relevant tax authorities.
Calculations of these liabilities have been based on managements assessment of legal and professional advice, case law and other relevant guidance.
Where the expected tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were recorded initially, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax amounts in the period in which such determination is made.

Currency and interest rate risk management The Group uses various financial instruments as hedges to reduce exposure to FX and interest rate movements.
These can include forward FX contracts, currency options and cross currency swaps.
All derivative financial instruments are initially recognised on the balance sheet at their fair value, adjusted for transaction costs.
Where derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement, along with transaction costs.
Where they do qualify, gains and losses are recognised according to the nature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged.
Hedges are either classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
The fair values of the Groups derivative financial instruments are determined using appropriate valuation techniques from observable data, including discounted cash flow analysis, as no active markets with quoted prices exist for the instruments held by the Group.
The method of recognising the movements in the fair value of a derivative depends on whether an instrument has been designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the exposure being hedged.
To qualify for hedge accounting, the terms of the hedge must be documented clearly at inception and there must be an expectation that the derivative will be highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
Hedge effectiveness is tested throughout the life of the hedge and, if at any point it is concluded that the relationship can no longer be expected to remain highly effective in achieving its objective, the hedge relationship is terminated.
Fair value hedges: derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges when they hedge an exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability that is attributable to a particular risk that could affect the consolidated income statement.
The hedging instrument is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet, with changes in its fair value being taken through the consolidated income statement.
For periods in which the hedge is shown to be effective, the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item and is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Cash flow hedges: derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Groups exposure to changes in the cash flows attributable to a particular asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
Gains or losses on designated cash flow hedges are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, to the extent that they are determined to be effective.
Any remaining ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
On recognition of the hedged asset or liability, any gains or losses relating to the hedging instrument that had previously been recognised directly in other comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement of the fair value of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss in equity remains there and is recognised in the consolidated income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in other comprehensive income is transferred immediately to the consolidated income statement.
Net investment hedges: changes in the value of foreign denominated investments due to currency movements are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
The accounting treatment for a net investment hedging instrument, whether it is a derivative financial instrument or a recognised asset or liability on the balance sheet, is consistent with the aforementioned treatment for a cash flow hedge.
Gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are included in the consolidated income statement on the ultimate disposal of the foreign denominated investment.
The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised in the consolidated income statement.

Currency and interest rate risk management continued a Currency risk management Group The Group presents its consolidated financial statements in pound sterling and conducts business in a number of other currencies, principally the dollar and the euro.
Consequently the Group is exposed to FX risk due to exchange rate movements which affect the Groups transactional revenue and the translation of the earnings and net assets of its non-pound sterling operations.
i Transactional exposures The Groups policy is for subsidiaries with pound sterling functional currency to hedge their main transactional exposures, which are the dollar and the euro, through a combination of forward FX contracts and options for up to two years forward.
A maximum of 100% of the forecast exposure is hedged for the first 12 months, 75% for the following six months and 25% thereafter up to a maximum of two years.
The Groups other transactional exposures are monitored and, where deemed appropriate, hedged for a period of 12 months forward.
The Group has contracts in place, designated as cash flow hedges under IAS39 where appropriate, covering approximately 82% of its forecast dollar transactional exposure for the year to 31 March 2013 at $1.58.
Approximately 76% of the Groups euro exposure has been hedged for the year to 31 March 2013 at 1.14. ii Balance sheet translational exposures The Group is exposed to balance sheet translational exposures at the local entity level where the local consolidated balance sheet may contain monetary assets or liabilities denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency.
It is the Groups policy to hedge up to 100% of these exposures using a mix of foreign currency swaps and forward FX contracts and these are designated as hedges under IAS39 where appropriate.
Balance sheet translational exposures also arise on consolidation as a result of the retranslation of the balance sheet of the Groups non-pound sterling operations, principally dollar and euro, into pound sterling, the Groups presentational currency.
The Groups general policy is not to actively manage these exposures, as active management using instruments with a shorter tenor than the underlying net asset can give rise to a net cash outflow.
However, from time to time it will use forward FX contracts, cross currency swaps or non-pound sterling denominated borrowings to mitigate this exposure.
During the financial year ended 31 March 2012, the Group designated the subordinated loan notes, the dollar drawings on the revolving credit facility and an element of forward FX contracts swapping dollar receipts from drawing on the revolving credit facility into euros used to settle maturing European Commercial Paper issuances, as a hedging instrument against the underlying dollar exposure.
As at 31 March 2012 this exposure was $1.3bn 2011 $1.4bn including intangible assets arising on consolidation, but before $0.6bn of hedging 2011 $0.5bn.
In accordance with IAS21 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, the resulting translational exchange difference is included within the 31m exchange loss taken directly to equity, as disclosed in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The Group does not have foreign operations whose functional currency is considered hyperinflationary and would therefore require adjusting to state all items in the measuring unit current at the reporting date.
The table below shows the actual impact on the Groups 2012 results of the movement during the year of the dollar and euro exchange rates in terms of transactional and translational exposure.

Currency and interest rate risk management continued a Currency risk management continued Company Balance sheet translational exposures The Company is exposed to balance sheet translational exposures where the balance sheet contains assets or liabilities denominated in a currency other than pound sterling.
While it is the Groups policy to hedge up to 100% of these exposures at Group level, at Company level these exposures can affect the Companys profit after tax.
At 31 March 2012, the Company had net financial assets denominated in euros of nil 2011 nil.
b Interest rate risk management Group The Group has an exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on both its cash positions and borrowings which it manages through a combination of pound sterling and dollar debt drawn on fixed and floating rate terms.
The Groups objective is to minimise interest cost and the impact of interest volatility on the Groups consolidated income statement.
In addition to debt, the Groups treasury policies also permit the use of derivatives including interest rate swaps, interest rate options, forward rate agreements and cross currency swaps to meet these objectives.
At 31 March 2012, after taking into account cross currency and FX swaps of the euro denominated five-year senior notes, the Group had 224m of cash, 182m of floating rate debt and 86m of fixed rate debt denominated in pound sterling, 261m of cash and 348m of floating rate debt denominated in dollars or currencies closely related to the dollar and 112m of cash and 26m of floating rate debt denominated in other currencies.
A 100 basis-points parallel increase in pound sterling LIBOR and LIBID rates would decrease profit after tax and other comprehensive income by nil with a similar movement in dollar rates impacting profit after tax and other comprehensive income by 1m.
In the event that LIBOR and LIBID rates diverge, by each additional 100 basis-points in pound sterling and dollar rates, profit after tax and other comprehensive income would reduce by 4m and 6m respectively.
The details of the interest rate bearing financial liabilities are disclosed in note 6.
Company Interest rate profile The Company is exposed to interest rate movements as a result of issuance under its commercial paper programme 21m and loan from subsidiary 140m.
It is estimated that the impact of a 100 basis-point movement in interest rates would not have a significant impact on the profit after tax of the Company.
Financial assets The Company is owed 95m 2011 40m of non-interest bearing balances at the year end.
Financial liabilities The Company owes 68m 2011 84m of non-interest bearing loans to subsidiaries and a 140m subordinated loan to a subsidiary charging interest at three month GBP LIBOR plus 2%.
The European Commercial Paper liability of 21m 2011 nil is carried at a floating rate.
The accruals balance of nil 2011 5m is non-interest bearing.

Intangible assets arising from development expenditure Development expenditure on software is recognised as an intangible asset in accordance with the provisions of IAS38 Intangible assets.
Capitalised expenditure is recognised initially at fair value and is presented subsequently at cost less accumulated amortisation and provisions for impairment.
Amortisation of these assets is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic life of the asset of three to five years.
The Group reviews the useful economic lives of these assets on a regular basis.
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets arising from development expenditure is charged within operating expenses in profit before acquisition and disposal costs and exceptional items.
Amortisation is charged against assets from the date at which the asset becomes available for use.

Property and equipment Property and equipment is recognised initially at cost including the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its intended use.
Property and equipment is presented subsequently at initial cost less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment in its value.
It is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its expected useful economic life as follows: Short leasehold property improvements Period of lease Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 5 years The Group reviews its depreciation rates regularly to take account of any changes in circumstances.
These rates are determined on consideration of factors such as the expected rate of technological development and anticipated usage levels.
When a leasehold property becomes surplus to the Groups foreseeable business requirements, a provision is made on a discounted basis for the expected future net cost of the property.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the asset carrying amount and are included in the consolidated income statement.
