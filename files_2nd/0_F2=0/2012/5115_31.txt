easyJet plc 70 Annual report and accounts 2012 Accounts & other information Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies Statement of compliance easyJet plc the Company and its subsidiaries easyJet or the Group as applicable is a low cost airline carrier operating principally in Europe.
The Company is a public limited company whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol EZJ and is incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The address of its registered office is Hangar 89, London Luton Airport, Luton, Bedfordshire LU2 9PF.
The accounts are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union, taking into account International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Basis of preparation The accounts are prepared based on the historical cost convention except for certain financial assets and liabilities including derivative financial instruments that are measured at fair value.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all years presented in these accounts.
easyJets business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future development and performance, are described in the business review on pages 8 to 17.
Principal risks and uncertainties are described on pages 26 to 30.
Note 22 to the accounts sets out the Groups objectives, policies and procedures for managing its capital and gives details of the risks related to financial instruments held by the Group.
The Group holds cash and cash equivalents of 645 million as at 30 September 2012.
Total debt of 957 million is free from financial covenants, with 129 million due for repayment in the year to 30 September 2013.
The business is exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices and US dollar and euro exchange rates.
The Groups policy is to hedge between 65% and 85% of estimated exposures 12 months in advance, and 45% and 65% of estimated exposures from 13 up to 24 months in advance.
The Group was compliant with this policy at the date of this Annual report and accounts.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group will be able to operate within the level of available facilities and cash for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Significant judgements, estimates and critical accounting policies The preparation of accounts in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, events or actions may mean that actual results ultimately differ from those estimates, and these differences may be material.
The estimates and the underlying assumptions are reviewed regularly.
The following two accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies as they require a significant amount of management judgement and the results are material to easyJets accounts.
Goodwill and landing rights note 7 Goodwill and landing rights are tested for impairment at least annually.
easyJet has one cash-generating unit, being its route network.
In making this assessment, easyJet has considered the manner in which the business is managed including the centralised nature of its operations and the ability to open or close routes and redeploy aircraft and crew across the whole route network.
The value in use of the cash-generating unit is determined by discounting future cash flows to their present value.
When applying this method, easyJet relies on a number of estimates including its strategic plans, fuel prices, exchange rates, long-term economic growth rates for the principal countries in which it operates and its pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
Aircraft maintenance provisions note 16 easyJet incurs liabilities for maintenance costs in respect of aircraft leased under operating leases during the term of the lease.
These arise from legal and constructive contractual obligations relating to the condition of the aircraft when it is returned to the lessor.
To discharge these obligations, easyJet will also normally need to carry out one heavy maintenance check on each of the engines and the airframe during the lease term.
A charge is made in the income statement based on hours or cycles flown to provide for the cost of these obligations.
Estimates required include the likely utilisation of the aircraft, the expected cost of the heavy maintenance check at the time it is expected to occur, the condition of the aircraft and the lifespan of life-limited parts.
The bases of all estimates are reviewed annually, and also when information becomes available that is capable of causing a material change to an estimate, such as renegotiation of end of lease return conditions, increased or decreased utilisation, or changes in the cost of heavy maintenance services.
Accounts & other information easyJet plc 71 Annual report and accounts 2012 Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts incorporate those of easyJet plc and its subsidiaries for the years ended 30 September 2011 and 2012.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by easyJet.
Control exists when easyJet has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to benefit from its activities.
Intragroup balances, transactions and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated accounts.
Foreign currencies The primary economic environment in which a subsidiary operates determines its functional currency.
The consolidated accounts of easyJet are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional currency and the Groups presentation currency.
Certain subsidiaries have operations that are primarily influenced by a currency other than sterling.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of these foreign operations are taken to reserves until all or part of the interest is sold, when the relevant portion of the exchange gains or losses is recognised in the income statement.
Profits and losses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange during the year, since this approximates the rates on the dates of the transactions.
Transactions arising in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and except where the asset or liability is designated as a cash flow hedge the gains or losses on translation are included in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the transactions were effected.
Revenue recognition Revenue comprises seat revenue, being the value of airline services net of air passenger duty, VAT and discounts, and non-seat revenue.
Seat revenue arises from the sale of flight seats, including the provision of checked baggage, speedy priority boarding services, booking, credit card and change fees.
Seat revenue is recognised when the service is provided.
This is generally when the flight takes place, but in the following cases, this is at the time of booking: Booking and credit card fees as they are contractually non-refundable, Change fees as the service provided is that of allowing customers to change bookings.
"Amounts paid by ""no-show"" customers are recognised as seat revenue when the booked service is provided as such customers are not generally entitled to change flights or seek refunds once a flight has departed."
Unearned revenue represents flight seats, including the provision of checked baggage and speedy priority boarding services, sold but not yet flown and is included in trade and other payables until it is realised in the income statement when the service is provided.
Non seat revenue arises from commissions earned from services sold on behalf of partners.
Non seat revenue is recognised when the service is provided.
This is generally when the related flight takes place.
In the case of commission earned from travel insurance, revenue is recognised at the time of booking as easyJet acts solely as appointed representative of the insurance company.
During the year, the classification between seat and non-seat revenue has been revised and the comparative data has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
Business combinations Business combinations in prior years were accounted for by applying the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identifiable assets and liabilities are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
There have been no business combinations since the effective date of IFRS 3 Business Combinations Revised.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over easyJets interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
easyJet plc 72 Annual report and accounts 2012 Accounts & other information Notes to the accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
It has an indefinite expected useful life and is tested for impairment at least annually or where there is any indication of impairment.
Landing rights are stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
They are considered to have an indefinite useful life as they will remain available for use for the foreseeable future provided minimum utilisation requirements are observed, and are tested for impairment at least annually or where there is any indication of impairment.
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation, which is calculated to write-off their cost, less estimated residual value, on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives.
Expected useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually.
Expected useful life Computer software 3 years Contractual rights Over the length of the related contracts Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated to write-off the cost, less estimated residual value of assets, on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives.
Expected useful lives are reviewed annually.
Expected useful life Aircraft 23 years Aircraft spares 14 years Aircraft improvements 37 years Aircraft prepaid maintenance 310 years Leasehold improvements 510 years or the length of lease if shorter Fixtures, fittings and equipment 3 years or length of lease of property where equipment is used if shorter Computer hardware 5 years Items held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their expected useful lives, as shown above.
Residual values, where applicable, are reviewed annually against prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date for equivalently aged assets and depreciation rates adjusted accordingly on a prospective basis.
The carrying value is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
An element of the cost of a new aircraft is attributed on acquisition to prepaid maintenance and is depreciated over a period ranging from three to ten years from the date of manufacture.
Subsequent costs incurred which lend enhancement to future periods, such as long-term scheduled maintenance and major overhaul of aircraft and engines, are capitalised and depreciated over the length of period benefiting from these enhancements.
All other maintenance costs are charged to the income statement as incurred.
The cost of new aircraft comprises the invoiced price of the aircraft from the supplier less the estimated value of other assets received by easyJet for nil consideration.
These other assets principally comprise cash recognised as an asset and aircraft spares and service credits.
Pre-delivery and option payments made in respect of aircraft are recorded in property, plant and equipment at cost.
These amounts are not amortised.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the net proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment of non-current assets An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the higher of the assets fair value less cost to sell and its value in use.
Impairment losses recognised on assets other than goodwill are only reversed where changes in the estimates used result in an increase in recoverable amount.
Impairment losses recognised on goodwill are not reversed.
Accounts & other information easyJet plc 73 Annual report and accounts 2012 Leases Non-contingent operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
A number of operating leases require easyJet to make contingent rental payments based on variable interest rates: these are expensed as incurred.
easyJet enters into sale and leaseback transactions whereby it sells to a third-party rights to acquire aircraft.
On delivery of the aircraft, easyJet subsequently leases the aircraft back, by way of an operating lease.
Surpluses arising on disposal, where the price that the aircraft is sold for is above fair value, are recognised in deferred income and amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term of the asset.
Finance leases, which transfer to easyJet substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are recognised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset, or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Any directly attributable costs of entering into financing sale and leasebacks are included in the value of the asset recognised.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and the reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are included in interest payable and other financing charges.
Financial instruments Financial instruments are recognised when easyJet becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument and derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions.
Where market values are not available, the fair value of financial instruments is calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
Non-derivative financial assets Non-derivative financial assets are recorded at amortised cost and include loan notes, trade receivables, cash and money market deposits.
Investments in equity instruments are carried at cost where fair value cannot be reliably measured due to significant variability in the range of reasonable fair value estimates.
Restricted cash comprises cash deposits which have restrictions governing their use and is classified as a current or non-current asset based on the estimated remaining length of the restriction.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held in bank accounts with no access restrictions and bank or money market deposits repayable on demand or maturing within three months of inception.
Interest income on cash and money market deposits is recognised using the effective interest method.
Impairment losses are recognised on financial assets carried at amortised cost where there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred.
The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
If, subsequently, the amount of the impairment loss decreases, and the decrease can be related objectively to an event that occurred after the impairment was recognised, the appropriate portion of the loss is reversed.
Both impairment losses and reversals are recognised in the income statement as components of net finance charges.
Non-derivative financial liabilities Non-derivative financial liabilities are initially recorded at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs, and subsequently at amortised cost.
Interest expense on borrowings is recognised using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless there is an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.
Derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are used to mitigate operating and investing transaction exposures to movements in jet fuel prices and currency exchange rates.
Hedge accounting is applied to these instruments.
Changes in intrinsic fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the cash flow hedges are determined to be effective.
All other changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where the hedged item results in a non-financial asset or liability the accumulated gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income form part of the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability.
Otherwise accumulated gains and losses are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged items affect the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when a hedging instrument is derecognised e. g. through expiry or disposal, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Where the hedged item is a highly probable forecast transaction, the related gains and losses remain in shareholders equity until the transaction takes place.
When a hedged future transaction is no longer expected to occur, any related gains and losses previously recognised in shareholders equity are immediately recognised in the income statement.
easyJet plc 74 Annual report and accounts 2012 Accounts & other information Notes to the accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Financial guarantees If a claim on a financial guarantee given to a third-party becomes probable, the obligation is recognised at fair value.
For subsequent measurement, the carrying amount is the higher of initial measurement and best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation on the statement of financial position date.
Tax Tax expense in the income statement consists of current and deferred tax.
The charge for current tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted for income that is exempt and expenses that are not deductible using tax rates that are applicable to the taxable income.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences relating to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, where it is probable that the recovery or settlement will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future, with the following exceptions: where the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither taxable income nor accounting profit.
deferred tax arising on investments in subsidiaries is not recognised where easyJet is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which recovery of assets and settlement of liabilities are expected to take place, based on tax rates or laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets represent amounts recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, losses and tax credits carried forward.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be suitable taxable profits from which they can be deducted.
Deferred tax liabilities represent the amount of income taxes payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and it is the intention to settle these on a net basis.
Aircraft maintenance provisions The accounting for the cost of providing major airframe and certain engine maintenance checks for owned and finance leased aircraft is described in the accounting policy for property, plant and equipment.
easyJet has contractual obligations to maintain aircraft held under operating leases.
Provisions are created over the term of the lease based on the estimated future costs of major airframe checks, engine shop visits and end of lease liabilities.
These costs are discounted to present value where the amount of the discount is considered material.
A number of leases also require easyJet to pay supplemental rent to the lessor.
Payments may be either a fixed monthly sum up to a cap or are based on usage.
The purpose of these payments is to provide the lessor with collateral should an aircraft be returned in a condition that does not meet the requirements of the lease.
Supplemental rent is either refunded when qualifying maintenance is performed, or is offset against end of lease liabilities.
Where the amount of supplemental rent paid exceeds the estimated amount recoverable from the lessor, provision is made for the non-recoverable amount.
Employee benefits easyJet contributes to defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of employees.
easyJet has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of easyJet in independently administered funds.
easyJets contributions are charged to the income statement in the year in which they are incurred.
The expected cost of compensated holidays is recognised at the time that the related employees services are provided.
Share capital and dividend distribution Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity shares treasury shares the consideration paid and any directly attributable incremental costs are deducted from equity until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Accounts & other information easyJet plc 75 Annual report and accounts 2012 Share-based payments easyJet has a number of equity-settled share incentive schemes.
The fair value of share options is measured at the date of grant using the Binomial Lattice option pricing model.
The fair value of awards under the Long term Incentive Plan and Share Incentive Plan is the share price at the date of grant.
The fair value of the estimated number of options and awards that are expected to vest is expensed to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period that employees services are rendered, with a corresponding increase in shareholders equity.
Where performance criteria attached to the share options and awards are not met, any cumulative expense previously recognised is reversed.
The social security obligations payable in connection with grant of the share options is an integral part of the grant itself and the charge is treated as a cash-settled transaction.
easyJet settles share awards under the Long Term Incentive and Share Incentive Plans by purchasing its own shares on the market through employee share trusts.
The cost of such purchases is deducted from retained earnings in the period that the transaction occurs.
Segmental disclosures easyJet has one operating segment, being its route network, based on management information provided to the Executive Management Team: which is easyJets Chief Operating Decision Maker.
Resource allocation decisions are made for the benefit of the route network as a whole, rather than for individual routes within the network.
Performance of the network is assessed based on the consolidated profit or loss before tax for the year.
Revenue is allocated to geographic segments on the following basis: Revenue earned from passengers is allocated according to the location of the first departure airport on each booking: Commission revenue earned from partners is allocated according to the domicile of each partner.
Assets held for sale Where assets are available for sale in their current condition, and their disposal is highly probable, they are reclassified as held for sale and are measured at the lower of their carrying value less costs to sell.
Depreciation ceases at the point of their reclassification from non-current assets.

This has resulted in the net credits to the prior year current tax, and debits to prior year deferred tax referred to above.
Current tax liabilities at 30 September 2012 amounted to 29 million 2011: 9 million, of which 12 million relates to years prior to 2012 which remain open with the relevant tax authorities.
During the year ended 30 September 2012, net cash tax paid amounted to 28 million 2011: 2 million.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset where they relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority.
As a result the net UK deferred tax liability is 212 million 2011: 190 million.
The net overseas deferred tax asset is 14 million 2011: 11 million.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as no tax is expected to be payable in the foreseeable future based on the current repatriation policy of easyJet.
easyJet plc 80 Annual report and accounts 2012 Accounts & other information Notes to the accounts continued 6 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit for the year by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year after adjusting for shares held in employee share trusts.
To calculate diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential shares.
Share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year are considered to be dilutive potential shares.
Where share options are exercisable based on performance criteria and those performance criteria have been met during the year, these options are included in the calculation of dilutive potential shares.
Earnings per share is based on: 2012 2011 million million Profit for the year 255 225 2012 2011 million million Weighted average number of ordinary shares used to calculate basic earnings per share 408 429 Weighted average number of dilutive share options 5 4 Weighted average number of ordinary shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share 413 433 2012 2011 Earnings per share pence pence Basic 62.5 52.5 Diluted 61.7 52.0 An ordinary dividend in respect of the year ended 30 September 2012 of 85 million 21.5 pence per share is to be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting 2011: ordinary dividend 46 million, special dividend 150 million.
These accounts do not reflect this dividend payable.
On 5 March 2012, the shares of easyJet plc were consolidated on an 11 for 12 basis.
The impact of the share consolidation on the weighted average number of shares used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share is 21 million.
Further details in respect of the share consolidation are given in note 17.

The recoverable amount of goodwill and other assets with indefinite expected useful lives has been determined based on value in use calculations of the route network.
Pre-tax cash flow projections have been derived from the strategic plan approved by the Board for the period up to 2017, using the following key assumptions: Pre-tax discount rate derived from weighted average cost of capital 910% Fuel price US dollars per metric tonne 1,100 Exchange rates: US dollar 1.58 Euro 1.27 Swiss franc 1.50 Both fuel price and exchange rates are volatile in nature, and the assumptions used represent managements view of reasonable average rates.
Operating margins are sensitive to significant changes in these rates.
Cash flow projections beyond the forecast period have been extrapolated using growth rate scenarios ranging from zero up to an estimated average of long-term economic growth rates for the principal countries in which easyJet operates.
No impairment resulted from any of these scenarios.
No reasonably possible combination of changes to the key assumptions above would result in the carrying value of the cash-generating unit exceeding its recoverable amount.

At the end of the savings period, a tax free bonus is applied to the savings and the option becomes exercisable for a period of six months.
Employees who are not paid through the UK payroll may save under similar terms and conditions, albeit without tax benefits.
Share incentive plan The share incentive plan is open to all employees on the UK payroll.
Participants may invest up to 1,500 of their pre-tax salary each year to purchase partnership shares in easyJet.
For each partnership share acquired easyJet purchases a matching share.
Employees must remain with easyJet for three years from the date of purchase of each partnership share in order to qualify for the matching share, and for five years for the shares to be transferred to them tax free.
The employee is entitled to dividends and to vote at shareholder meetings.
Employees on the Swiss payroll may save under similar terms and conditions, albeit without tax benefits.
easyJet plc 88 Annual report and accounts 2012 Accounts & other information Notes to the accounts continued 18 Share incentive schemes continued The fair value of grants under the discretionary and sharesave is estimated by applying the Binomial Lattice option pricing model using the following key assumptions.
The fair value of grants under all other schemes is the share price on the date of grant.
Exercise price for the discretionary schemes was determined using a five-day weighted average price.
For the Sharesave scheme, exercise price is set at a 20% discount from share price.
Expected volatility is based on historical volatility over a period comparable to the expected life of each type of option.
Levels of early exercises and forfeitures are estimated using historical averages.
The weighted average fair value of matching shares granted under the share incentive plan during the year was 4.96 2011: 3.81 For grants under the Sharesave scheme after 30 September 2011, the dividend yield assumption is calculated based on the actual yield at the date the options are granted.
For the options granted on 1 July 2012, the dividend yield assumption was 2%.

They are disclosed to facilitate reconciliation of the carrying values of financial instruments to line items presented in the statement of financial position.
Fair value calculation methodology Derivative financial instruments are forward contracts that are valued based on market rates and market-accepted models.
Fair value for financial instruments held at amortised cost has been estimated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.

For jet fuel contracts, quantity represents contracted metric tonnes.
All derivative financial instruments are in level 2 of the IFRS 7 fair value hierarchy.
Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges All derivatives to which hedge accounting is applied are designated as cash flow hedges.
Changes in fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, to the extent that they are effective, with the ineffective portion being recognised in the income statement.
Where the hedged item is a non-financial asset or liability, the accumulated gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the carrying value of that asset or liability.
Otherwise accumulated gains and losses are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects the income statement.
easyJet uses forward contracts to hedge US dollar transaction currency risk comprising fuel, leasing and maintenance payments, jet fuel price risk and euro and Swiss franc revenues.
Where these hedges are assessed as highly effective, gains and losses are deferred in other comprehensive income and transferred to the income statement or cost of property, plant and equipment when the related cash flow occurs.

Financial risk management aims to limit these market risks with selected derivative hedging instruments being used for this purpose.
easyJet policy is not to trade in derivatives but to use the instruments to hedge anticipated exposure.
As such, easyJet is not exposed to market risk by using derivatives as any gains and losses arising are offset by the outcome of the underlying exposure being hedged.
In addition to market risks, easyJet is exposed to credit and liquidity risk.
The Board is responsible for setting financial risk and capital management policies and objectives which are implemented by the treasury function on a day-to-day basis.
The policy outlines the approach to risk management and also states the instruments and time periods which the treasury function is authorised to use in managing financial risks.
The policy is regularly reviewed to ensure best practice, however there have been no significant changes during the current year.
Capital employed Capital employed comprises shareholders equity, borrowings, cash and money market deposits excluding restricted cash and an adjustment for the capital implicit in aircraft operating lease arrangements.
The adjustment is calculated by multiplying the annual charge for aircraft dry leasing by a factor of seven, in line with accepted practice for the airline industry.
Normalised operating profit is adjusted for the implied interest incorporated in the charge for aircraft dry leasing.
Consequently, the capital employed and normalised operating profit after tax both excluding and including the adjustment for operating leases at the end of the current and prior year and the return earned during those years were as follows: 2012 2011 million million Shareholders equity 1,794 1,705 Borrowings 957 1,300 Cash and money market deposits excluding restricted cash 883 1,400 Reported capital employed 1,868 1,605 Operating leases adjustment 665 763 Capital employed including operating leases adjustment 2,533 2,368 Operating profit reported 331 269 Implied interest in operating lease costs 32 36 Operating profit adjusted 363 305 Normalised operating profit after tax reported 252 199 Normalised operating profit after tax adjusted 276 226 Return on capital employed excluding leases adjustment 14.5% 12.7% Return on capital employed including leases adjustment 11.3% 9.8% Return on capital employed was introduced as a key performance indicator in 2010.
The decision was taken at the time not to adjust the calculation for aircraft held under operating leases, in the expectation that the IASBs leasing project would complete in a relatively short time frame, resulting in all leases being shown on the statement of financial position.
As the accounting position is now not expected to change before easyJets 2016 financial year at the earliest, it has been decided to amend the ROCE calculation to reflect appropriately the impact on return on capital of aircraft held under operating leases.
The above table shows both the return on capital employed excluding and including operating leases adjustment.
easyJet plc 94 Annual report and accounts 2012 Accounts & other information Notes to the accounts continued 22 Financial risk and capital management continued The percentage of operating leased aircrafts at 30 September 2012 was 26% 2011: 30%.
Board policy is to hold around 30% of the fleet under operating lease arrangements to provide an appropriate degree of flexibility in fleet size and partially mitigate the residual value risk associated with a single fleet type.
Capital management The objective of capital management is to ensure that easyJet is able to continue as a going concern whilst delivering shareholder expectations of a strong capital base as well as returning benefits for other stakeholders and optimising the cost of capital.
easyJet manages its capital structure in response to changes in both economic conditions and strategic objectives.
The cash and net debt position, together with the maturity profile of existing debt, is monitored to ensure the continuity of funding.
The principal measure used by easyJet to manage capital risk is the gearing ratio of debt defined as debt plus seven times aircraft operating lease payments less cash, including money market deposits and restricted cash to shareholders equity.
Liquidity risk management The objective of easyJets liquidity risk management is to ensure sufficient cash resources and the availability of funding as required.
easyJet holds financial assets either for which there is a liquid market or which are expected to generate cash inflows that are available to meet liquidity needs.
easyJet continues to hold significant cash and liquid funds to mitigate the impact of potential business disruption events with Board approved policy stating a target level of liquidity of 4 million per aircraft in the fleet.
Total cash excluding restricted cash and money market deposits at 30 September 2012 was 883 million 2011: 1,400 million.
Surplus funds are invested in high quality short-term liquid instruments, usually money market funds or bank deposits.
The maturity profile of financial liabilities based on undiscounted gross cash flows and contractual maturities is as follows: Within Over 1 year 12 years 25 years 5 years At 30 September 2012 million million million million Borrowings 146 140 467 288 Trade and other payables 454 Derivative contracts receipts 2,943 1,821 Derivative contracts payments 2,874 1,790 Within Over 1 year 12 years 25 years 5 years At 30 September 2011 million million million million Borrowings 177 169 584 493 Trade and other payables 375 Derivative contracts receipts 2,887 1,041 Derivative contracts payments 2,843 1,031 The maturity profile has been calculated based on spot rates for the US dollar, euro, Swiss franc and jet fuel at close of business on 30 September each year.
Credit risk management easyJet is exposed to credit risk arising from cash and money market deposits, derivative financial instruments and trade and other receivables.
Credit risk management aims to reduce the risk of default by setting limits on credit exposure to counterparties based on their respective credit ratings.
Credit ratings also determine the maximum period of investment when placing funds on deposit.
Credit risk is limited to the carrying amount in the statement of financial position at each year end.
Counterparties for cash investments, currency forward contracts and jet fuel forward contracts are required to have a credit rating of A or better at contract inception and credit limits differentiate between A, AA and AAA rated counterparties.
Exposures to those counterparties are regularly reviewed and, when the market view of a counterpartys credit quality changes, adjusted as considered appropriate.
Accordingly in normal market conditions, the probability of material loss due to non-performance by counterparties is considered to be low.
Disclosure relating to the credit quality of trade and other receivables is given in note 11 to the accounts.
Foreign currency risk management The principal exposure to currency exchange rates arises from fluctuations in both the US dollar and euro rates which impact operating, financing and investing activities.
The aim of foreign currency risk management is to reduce the impact of exchange rate volatility on the results of easyJet.
Foreign exchange exposure arising from transactions in various currencies is reduced through a policy of Accounts & other information easyJet plc 95 Annual report and accounts 2012 matching, as far as possible, receipts and payments in each individual currency.
Any remaining significant anticipated exposure is managed through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
In addition, easyJet has substantial US dollar balance sheet liabilities, partly offset by holding US dollar cash: any residual net liability is managed through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Financing and interest rate risk management Interest rate cash flow risk arises on floating rate borrowings and cash investments.
Interest rate risk management policy aims to provide certainty in a proportion of financing while retaining the opportunity to benefit from interest rate reductions.
Interest rate policy is used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt.
All borrowings are at floating interest rates repricing every three to six months.
A significant proportion of US dollar loans by value are matched with US dollar cash, with the cash being invested to coincide with the repricing of the debt.
Operating leases are a mix of fixed and floating rates.
Of the 55 operating leases in place at 30 September 2012, 75% were based on fixed interest rates and 25% were based on floating interest rates 2011: 69% fixed, 31% floating.
All debt is asset related, reflecting the capital intensive nature of the airline industry and the attractiveness of aircraft as security to lenders.
These factors are also reflected in the medium term profile of easyJets borrowings and operating leases.
During the year nineteen aircraft were cash acquired 2011: 11 aircraft.
Fuel price risk management easyJet is exposed to fuel price risk.
The objective of the fuel price risk management policy is to provide protection against sudden and significant increases in jet fuel prices, thus mitigating volatility in the income statement in the short term.
In order to manage the risk exposure, forward contracts are used in line with Board approved policy to hedge between 65% and 85% 2011: between 65% and 85% of estimated exposures up to 12 months in advance, and to hedge between 45% and 65% 2011: between 45% and 65% of estimated exposures from 13 up to 24 months in advance.
In exceptional market conditions, the Board may accelerate or limit the implementation of the hedging policy.
Market risk sensitivity analysis Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and derivative financial instruments.
The following analysis illustrates the sensitivity of such financial instruments to changes in relevant foreign exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices.
It should be noted that the analysis reflects the impact on profit or loss after tax for the year and other comprehensive income on financial instruments held at the reporting date.
It does not reflect changes in revenue or costs that may result from changing currency rates, interest rates or fuel prices.
Sensitivity is calculated based on all other variables remaining constant.
The analysis is considered representative of easyJets exposure over the 12 month period.
The currency sensitivity analysis is based on easyJets foreign currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date taking into account forward exchange contracts that offset effects from changes in currency exchange rates.
The increased sensitivity in the US dollar and euro rate represents sterling weakening against each variable currency with the 10% sensitivity reflecting stronger sterling.
The interest rate analysis assumes a 1% change in interest rates over the reporting year applied to end of year financial instruments.
The fuel price sensitivity analysis is based on easyJets fuel related derivative financial instruments held at the end of each reporting period.
The impact of a 1% increase in interest rates and a 10% increase in the fuel price is disclosed.
A corresponding decrease results in an equal and opposite impact on the income statement and other comprehensive income in both reporting periods.
Sensitivities are calculated based on a reasonably possible change in the rate applied to the value of financial instruments held at each balance sheet date.

24 Contingent liabilities easyJet is involved in various disputes or litigation in the normal course of business.
Whilst the results of such disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, management considers that the ultimate resolution of these disputes will not have a material effect on easyJets financial position, results or cash flows.
At 30 September 2012 easyJet had outstanding letters of credit and performance bonds totalling 37 million 2011: 44 million, of which 34 million 2011: 41 million expires within one year.
The fair value of these instruments at each year end was negligible.
No amount is recognised on the statement of financial position in respect of any of these financial instruments as it is not probable that there will be an outflow of resources.

easyJets non-current assets principally comprise its fleet of 159 owned and finance leased aircraft.
A further 55 aircraft are held under operating leases, giving a total fleet of 214 at 30 September 2012.
All of these aircraft are registered in the United Kingdom except for 21 registered in Switzerland.
These assets are used flexibly across the entire route network, and accordingly there is no suitable basis for allocating them to geographic segments.
