The group has considered the impact of the current economic climate in determining the appropriate discount rate to use in impairment testing.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to pre-tax cash ow projections is: At 30 Sep 2012 At 2 Oct 2011 Britvic GB 11% 11% Britvic Ireland 11% 11% Britvic France 12% 12% Cash ows beyond a one year period are extrapolated based on senior management forecasts for the following four years.
Beyond this, a terminal multiplier is applied to the year five cash ows based on growth and discount rates as described below.
Senior management expectations are formed in line with performance to date and experience, as well as available external market data.
