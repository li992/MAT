The Mansfield production site included a distribution operation.
A third party distribution company had taken over the distribution operations and as there was an element of dual running over the period of the Mansfield closure, these dual running costs have been classified as exceptional.
In house distribution operations at Mansfield ceased in April 2011 ahead of the sale of the site which was completed in June 2011.
A further 929,000 of additional costs were incurred for the manufacture of goods at third parties following operational difficulties in the commissioning of production plant at Cumbernauld during the closure of Mansfield and shortly thereafter.
Dual running costs of 331,000 and 103,000 were incurred in the year to 29 January 2011 within cost of sales and distribution costs.
63,000 of the environmental provision relating to the closure of Mansfield was released during the year as it was not utilised as expected in the period before the sale of the site.
Originally a provision of 66,000 had been made in the year to 30 January 2010.
Redundancy costs for the closure of Mansfield of 109,000 were recognised in the year to 28 January 2012 as the actual redundancy costs for the closure of Mansfield were paid at a level in excess of that provided in prior years.
A provision had initially been recognised in 2010, with 157,000 being released in the year to 29 January 2011.
As a result of the closure of the Mansfield site, a curtailment in the Group retirement pension plan has arisen.
This has resulted in an exceptional credit arising from the reduction in the retirement benefit obligation following a reduction in the number of employees remaining with the scheme.
A pension increase exchange exercise was undertaken during the year resulting in an improvement in the risk profile of the defined benefit scheme.
An associated pension credit of 2,582,000 has been recognised as an exceptional item in the year to 28 January 2012.
Consultancy costs of 94,000 were incurred in relation to the exercise and these have also been treated as exceptional in the year.
A gain on disposal of Mansfield assets of 49,000 was recognised during the year, with 13,000 costs associated with the closure of the site also being incurred.
In the year to 29 January 2011 the Vitsmart brand and goodwill, Taut goodwill and water rights were all impaired.
The impairment charge was recognised as an exceptional charge in that year.
