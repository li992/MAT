Capital management Investor confidence is an important element in the sustainability of our business.
That confidence comes, in part, from the strength of our capital base.
Man has maintained significant surplus capital and available liquidity throughout the recent periods of financial crisis.
This capital has given Man flexibility to support our investors, intermediaries and financial partners and to allow them to make informed decisions regarding their investment exposures.
This confidence gives our business credibility and sustainability.
We have a conservative capital and liquidity framework which allows us to invest in the growth of the business.
We utilise capital to support the operation of the investment management process and the launch of new fund products.
We view this as a competitive advantage which allows us to align directly our interests with those of investors and intermediaries.
Man monitors its capital requirements through continuous review of its regulatory capital and economic capital, including monthly reporting to Finance Committee and the Board.
The Board approach to the use or distribution of available capital surpluses is discussed in the Chairmans review.
