27 Financial Risk Management continued Other market risk exposures The portfolio of investments, valued at 2,374,431,000 at 31 December 2012 2011: 2,228,118,000 is therefore exposed to market price changes.
The Manager assesses these exposures at the time of making each investment decision.
The Board reviews overall exposures at each meeting against indices and other relevant information.
An analysis of the portfolio by country and major industrial sector is set out in note 16 on the accounts.
Derivative contracts entered into during the year comprise options written in the expectation that they will not be exercised.
Based on the portfolio of investments held at each Balance Sheet date, and assuming other factors remain constant, a decrease or increase in the fair values of the portfolio by 20% would have had the following approximate effects on the net capital return attributable to equity shareholders and on the NAV:: 2012 2011 Increase Decrease Increase Decrease in value in value in value in value 000s 000s 000s 000s Income statement capital return 474,886 474,886 445,624 445,624 NAV per share pence 82.28 82.28 75.49 75.49 b Liquidity risk exposure The Company is required to raise funds to meet commitments associated with financial instruments, private equity investments and share buybacks.
These funds may be raised either through the realisation of assets or through increased borrowing.
The risk of the Company not having sufficient liquidity at any time is not considered by the Board to be significant, given: the large number of quoted investments held in the Companys portfolio 504 at 31 December 2012 : the liquid nature of the portfolio of investments: the industrial and geographical diversity of the portfolio see note 16 and the existence of ongoing overdraft and loan facility agreements.
Cash balances are held with approved banks, usually on overnight deposit.
The Manager reviews liquidity at the time of making each investment decision.
The Board reviews liquidity exposure at each meeting.
The Company has loan facilities of 225m as set out in notes 14 and 17 on the accounts.
The facilities limit the amount which the Company may borrow at any one time as a proportion of the relevant portfolio of investments and cash.
The most onerous financial covenant limits total borrowings to 33.3% of the Companys adjusted net asset value, which at 31 December 2012 was 2,080m.
Actual borrowings at market value at 31 December 2012 were 211m in loans see notes 14 and 17 and 126m debentures at market value see note 18.
The 11.25% debenture stock is governed by a trust deed and is redeemable in 2014 or at an earlier date or dates at the Companys behest.
The perpetual debenture stock is also governed by a trust deed and is redeemable at par only on the security becoming enforceable.
The Board does not therefore consider the repayment of these debenture stocks as a likely short-term liquidity issue.
At 31 December 2012 the Company had 102 million outstanding commitments to private equity investments, payable over more than one year see note 25.
The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at each balance sheet date, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, were as follows: More than three Three months months but less More than or less than one year one year Total 000s 000s 000s 000s 2012 Current liabilities Overdrafts Other borrowings 115,000 115,000 Other creditors 3,515 3,515 Long-term liabilities 96,175 96,175 Debentures 110,575 110,575 118,515 206,750 325,265 Interest payable on debentures 12,399 12,399 24,798 118,515 12,399 219,149 350,063 Report and Accounts 2012 59
