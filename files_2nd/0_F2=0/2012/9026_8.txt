Regulatory Financial Review Kingston Wholesale Market : Call Termination on Fixed Public Narrowband Networks in the Hull Area The call termination market includes the termination of calls originated locally, nationally, via IN number dialling, payphones and directory enquiries.
Call termination volumes have declined 6% p. a. over the past 5 years, reflecting the same issues as call origination with mobile and DSL based communication services diminishing the volume and proportions of call traffic carried over the KC network.
Internal revenue is derived from the mean capital employed and increased 17%.
Cost apportionment, as with call origination, is partially dependent on the movement in underlying asset values used in the delivery of the service.
Maintenance costs have reduced by 10%, based on underlying fixed asset value reduction of 18% of which the 41% reduction in exchange equipment is the most significant.
The derived minute termination rate has declined by 1% year on year.
