Italian Earthquakes The Emilia Romagna region in the north of Italy was struck by two earthquakes in May 2012, both with a magnitude of 6.
These were the strongest recorded earthquakes in the region in over 500 years.
A number of historical and cultural buildings were damaged and the region is also the heartland of Italys manufacturing sector.
Our response was focused on our customers and intermediaries, and within 24 hours, we had appointed loss adjusters to some of the largest and most important property claims, and set up a dedicated claims handling team.
