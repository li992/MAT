Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2012 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued iii Fixed interest rate loans and borrowings The treatment of fixed rate debt at fair value through profit and loss reflects the Groups overall management, on a fair value basis, of its investment property portfolio together with the large majority of the debt which finances it.
This treatment also is in order to provide consistency of accounting measurement between fixed rate debt and floating rate debt which has been fixed through the use of interest rate swaps: these two categories of debt comprise the large majority of the Groups total loans and borrowings.
iv Valuation of hedging instruments The fair value of hedging instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques.
Management, based on independent advice, uses its judgement to select appropriate methods and assumptions which are based mainly on market conditions existing at the balance sheet date.
v Trade receivables Management uses details of the age of trade receivables and the status of any disputes together with external evidence of the credit status of the counterparty in making judgements concerning any need to impair the carrying values.
