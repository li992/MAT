SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA UNAUDITED Our revenues from the sale of passenger tickets are seasonal.
Historically, demand for cruises has been greatest during our third quarter, which includes the Northern Hemisphere summer months.
This higher demand during the third quarter results in higher ticket prices and occupancy levels and, accordingly, the largest share of our operating income is earned during this period.
The seasonality of our results also increases due to ships being taken out-of-service for maintenance, which we schedule during non-peak demand periods.
In addition, substantially all of Holland America Princess Alaska Tours revenue and net income is generated from May through September in conjunction with the Alaska cruise season.
b Excludes unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives, net of $21 million, $ 145 million, $136 million and $ 5 million for the February, May, August and November quarter-ends, respectively.
c For further discussion of the reconciliation to U. S. GAAP, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
d Includes a special dividend of $0.50 per share.
