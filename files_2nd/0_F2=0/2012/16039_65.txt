Accordingly for Toolstation and certain product related brands the Directors have decided it is appropriate to amortise their cost over their estimated useful lives.
The Directors consider that the other brands, which are also all leading brands in their sectors with significant histories and significant growth prospects have an indefinite useful life.
They are reviewed annually for impairment: details of impairment testing are shown in note 13, but no impairment was identified in either year.
Acquired customer relationships are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which range from 5 to 15 years.
The Company has no intangible assets.
