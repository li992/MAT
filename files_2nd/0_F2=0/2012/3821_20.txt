2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which generally have 3090 day terms, are recognised and carried at their original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Current asset investments Current asset investments comprise deposits held for a term of greater than three months from the date of deposit and which is not available to the Group on demand.
Subsequent to initial measurement, current asset investments are measured at fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are initially recognised at their fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as described in each category below.
Interest-bearing borrowings All borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets A financial asset or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is derecognised where: t the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: or t the Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a pass-through arrangement: or t the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either a has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Financial liabilities A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Cash flow hedges that meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows: the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in other comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement in other operating expenses.
The Group uses forward currency contracts as hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecasted transactions and firm commitments.
The ineffective portion is recognised in other operating income.
Amounts recognised as other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when the hedged financial expense is recognised.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 65 Financial statements Governance Business review Overview Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.
Forward contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date that the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value at each reporting date.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
Forward contracts are recorded as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when hedging the exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction or the foreign currency risk in an unrecognised firm commitment.
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.
The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the effectiveness of changes in the hedging instruments fair value in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged items fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in cash flows and are addressed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they are designated.
If the forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income remains in other comprehensive income until after the forecast transaction or firm commitment affects profit or loss.
Any other gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on forward contracts are taken directly to the income statement.
Foreign currency translation The Groups presentation currency is Pounds Sterling.
Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the consolidated income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of initial transaction.
The functional currencies of the overseas subsidiaries are Euro, US dollar US$, South African rand ZAR and Swiss franc CHF.
As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of these overseas subsidiaries are translated into the presentation currency of the Group at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and their income statements are translated attheaverage exchange rates for the year.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation are recognised in the  of comprehensive income.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised inthe consolidated statement of comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the incomestatement.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost.
Taxation Current tax Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
66 Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Deferred tax Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions: t where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: t in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and t deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses, can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to the statement of comprehensive income if it relates to items that are credited or charged to the statement of comprehensive income.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement.
Sales tax Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except: t where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable: and t trade receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax included.
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet.
Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts and rebates given to customers, VAT and other sales tax or duty.
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Supply Chain Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on dispatch of goods.
Professional Services Revenue is recognised when receivable under a contract following delivery of a service or in line with the stage of work completed.
The stage of completion is determined by reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the contract and unbilled revenue is recognised within accrued income.
If the total estimated costs and revenues of a contract cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is recognised only to the extent that costs have been incurred.
A provision is made as soon as a loss is foreseen.
Contractual Services Contractual Services revenue includes revenue from Support Services and Managed Services contracts, and is recognised as services are delivered.
Unrecognised contracted revenue is included as deferred income in the balance sheet.
Amounts invoiced relating to more than one period are deferred and recognised over their relevant life.
On a limited number of Contractual Services contracts revenue is recognised on a percentage of completion basis which is determined by reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the contract.
Unbilled revenue is recognised within accrued income.
If a contract cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is restricted to the extent that costs have been incurred.
Where a contract contains several elements, the individual elements are accounted for separately where appropriate and revenue thereon is measured at the fair value of the consideration received.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 67 Financial statements Governance Business review Overview Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Finance income Income is recognised as interest accrues.
Dividends Dividend income is recognised when the Groups right to receive payment is established.
Operating leases Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits The Group operates a defined contribution scheme available to all UK employees.
Contributions are recognised as an expense in the income statement as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme.
There are no material pension schemes within the Groups overseas operations.
Exceptional items The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement, those material items of income and expense which, because of the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess better trends in financial performance.
Share-based payment transactions Employees including Executive Directors of the Group can receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the award at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined by utilising an appropriate valuation model, further details of which are given in note 28.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions as none of the conditions set are market-related ones.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date, until the vesting date, reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Directors best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
As the schemes do not include any market-related performance conditions, no expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share seenote 10.
The Group has an employee share trust for the granting of non-transferable options to executives and senior employees.
Shares in the Group held by the employee share trust are treated as investment in own shares and are recorded at cost as a deduction from equity see note 27.
Own shares held Computacenter plc shares held by the Group are classified in shareholders equity as own shares held and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
68 Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 3 Segmental analysis For management purposes, the Group is organised into geographical segments, with each segment determined by the location of the Groups assets and operations.
The Groups business in each geography is managed separately and held in separate statutory entities.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the below reportable operating segments.
Management monitor the operating results of its geographical segments separately for the purposes of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
Segment performance is evaluated based on adjusted operating profit or loss which is measured differently from operating profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements.
At a Group level however management measure performance on adjusted profit before tax.
Adjusted operating profit or loss takes account of the interest paid on customer specific financing CSF which management consider to be a cost of sale for management reporting purposes.
Excluded from adjusted operating profit is the amortisation of acquired intangibles and exceptional items as management do not consider these items when reviewing the underlying performance of a segment.
Restatement and classification of costs Following our ERP implementation in the UK and Germany, the Group has been able to further align its structure and therefore how it classifies departmental costs between cost of sales and administrative expenses.
The Group estimates that the net impact of these changes, principally related to pre-sales costs, has resulted in approximately 2.9 million of costs being reported in cost of sales in 2012 that were reported in administrative expenses previously.
This represents the Groups best estimate of the impact of the changes made in the 2012 reported results.
The results for 2011 have not been restated to reflect this change.

InJanuary 2012, RDC relocated to new premises in Braintree.
The one-off costs in relation to the relocation of these premises of 2.4 million that have been disclosed as an exceptional item relate principally to: t operating lease rental expense charged on new properties during the fit-out period and prior to occupation: t redundancy costs paid as a result of the relocation: and t rental expense related to legacy properties once they had been vacated.
In the second half of 2012, Computacenter Germany undertook a programme to reduce its net operating expenses by approximately 1.2 million annually.

74 Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 9 Income tax continued e Impact of rate change The main rate of UK Corporation tax was reduced to 25 per cent from 1 April 2012.
Finance Act 2012 further reduced the main rate of UK Corporation tax to 24 per cent from 1 April 2013.
Deferred tax has been restated accordingly in these financial statements.
Additional changes to the main rate of UK Corporation Tax are proposed, to reduce the rate by 1 per cent per annum to 23 per cent by 1 April 2014.
These changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and consequently are not included in these financial statements.
The effect of these proposed reductions would be to reduce the UK net deferred tax asset by 0.1 million.
10 Earnings per ordinary share Earnings per share EPS amounts are calculated by dividing profit attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year excluding own shares held.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing profit attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year excluding own shares held adjusted for the effect of dilutive options.

Belgium IS is managed and therefore reported as part of the Belgium segment, however as it retains its own identifiable cash flows, it is considered as a cash-generating unit itself.
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations The recoverable amounts of all six cash-generating units have been determined based on a value-in-use calculation.
To calculate this, cash flow projections are based on financial budgets approved by senior management covering a three-year period and on long-term market growth rates of between 1.5 and 2.5 per cent 2011: between 1.5 and 2.5 per cent thereafter.
Key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation for all cash-generating units for 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011 are: t budgeted revenue, which is based on long-run market growth forecasts: t budgeted gross margins, which are based on average gross margins achieved in the year immediately before the budgeted year, adjusted for expected long-run market pricing trends: and t the discount rate applied to cash flow projections ranges from 11.0 to 15.0 per cent 2011: 11.0 to 12.0 per cent which represents the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risk profiles of the individual CGUs.
Except in France, each cash-generating unit generates value substantially in excess of the carrying value of goodwill attributed to each of them.
Management therefore believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the unit to materially exceed its recoverable amount.
In France, adverse changes in the assumptions, such as a 0.5 per cent reduction in market growth rate or an increase in the discount rate of 0.5 per cent would cause the carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount.
No impairment provision on goodwill has been required at either 31 December 2012 or at 31 December 2011.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets consist of customer contracts, customer relationships and tools and technology.
The expected useful lives are shown in note 2.

80 Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 16 Business combinations NEWIS SA and Informatic Services IS SA together Belgium IS On 28 December 2012 the Group acquired 100 per cent of the voting shares of NEWIS SA and its subsidiary, Informatic Services IS SA together Belgium IS for an initial consideration of 2.3 million and a contingent consideration of 0.6 million dependent on future performance.
The net book value of the assets acquired included 0.1 million of net cash and bank loans.
The costs of acquisition amounted to 71,000 and are included in the income statement.
Belgium IS is based in Belgium and is a provider of infrastructure services including end-user support and system administration.
The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
The 2012 consolidated financial statements include the results of Belgium IS for the period from the acquisition date.
The book and provisional fair values of the net assets acquired were as follows: 2012 Provisional 2012 fair value Book value to Group 000 000 Intangible assets Comprising: Existing customer relationships 850 Software 33 Total intangible assets 3 853 Property, plant and equipment 96 96 Trade and other receivables 1,299 1,299 Cash and short-term deposits 225 225 Trade and other payables 860 860 Bank loans 144 144 Deferred tax liabilities 255 Net assets 619 1,214 Goodwill arising on acquisition 1,080 2,294 Discharged by: Cash paid 1,835 Deferred consideration 459 2,294 Cash and cash equivalents acquired Cash and short-term deposits 225 Bank loans 144 Cash outflow on acquisition 2,213 The fair value of the trade receivables amounts to 1,299,000.
The gross amount of trade receivables is 1,299,000.
None of the trade receivables have been impaired and it is expected that the full contractual amounts can be collected.
There were no differences between the provisional fair values and the book values at acquisition other than the recognition of intangible assets at acquisition and the related contingent tax liabilities.
Included in the 1,080,000 of goodwill that arose on acquisition are certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured from the acquiree due to their nature.
These items include the expected value of an assembled workforce.
None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2012, Belgium IS contributed nil to the Groups revenue and nil to the Groups profit after tax.
If the acquisition of Belgium IS had taken place at the beginning of 2012, Group revenues for the period ended 31 December 2012 would have been 2,919,467,418 and profit after tax would have been 50,059,082.
Contingent consideration This is based on the gross margin performance of the business for the next financial year after acquisition.
Managements assessment is that it is highly probable that the maximum contingent consideration will become payable and accordingly it has been included in the provisional fair value to the Group.
The range of contingent consideration is between 0 and 459,000.

Financial assets and liabilities through profit or loss are those foreign exchange contracts that are not designated in hedge relationships as they are intended to reduce the level of foreign currency risk for expected sales and purchases.
The Group also enters into other foreign exchange forward contracts with the intention to reduce the foreign exchange risk of expected sales and purchases.
When these other contracts are not designated in hedge relationships they are measured at fair value through profit and loss.
The foreign exchange forward contract balances vary with the level of expected foreign currency costs and changes in the foreign exchange forward rates.
The terms of the foreign currency forward contracts have been negotiated for the expected highly probable forecast transactions to which hedge accounting has been applied.
No significant element of hedge ineffectiveness required recognition in the incomestatement.
The cash flow hedges of the forecasted costs were assessed to be highly effective and a net unrealised gain of 494,000 2011: loss of 464,000 with a deferred tax liability of 120,000 2011: 116,000 deferred tax asset relating to the hedging instruments is included in the other comprehensive income.

Those in respect of the European operations are discounted at a rate based on Euribor.
25 Financial instruments An explanation of the Groups financial instrument risk management objectives, policies and strategies are set out in the Finance Directors Review on pages 18 to 23. Credit risk The Group principally manages credit risk through management of customer credit limits.
The credit limits are set for each customer based on the creditworthiness of the customer and the anticipated levels of business activity.
These limits are initially determined when the customer account is first set up and are regularly monitored thereafter.
The balance of trade receivables relates to customers for whom there is no recent history of default.
In determining the recoverability of the trade receivables, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivables from the date the credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The maximum exposure on trade receivables, as at the reporting date, is their carrying value.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, current asset investment and forward currency contracts, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 87 Financial statements Governance Business review Overview Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 25 Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, bank borrowings, cash and short-term deposits, invoice factoring in the UK and finance leases and loans for certain customer contracts.
The Groups bank borrowings, other facilities and deposits are at floating rates.
No interest rate derivative contracts have been entered into.
When long-term borrowings are utilised, the Groups policy is to maintain these borrowings at fixed rates to limit the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Interest rate sensitivity The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
There is no impact on the Groupsequity.
Effect Change on profit in basis before tax points 000 2012 Sterling 25 203 Euro 25 13 2011 Sterling 25 132 Euro 25 104 The impact of a reasonably possible decrease to the same range shown in the table would result in an opposite impact on the profit before tax of the same magnitude.
Fair values The carrying value of the Groups short-term receivables and payables is a reasonable approximation of their fair values.
The fair value of all other financial instruments carried within the Groups financial statements is not materially different from their carrying amount.
Forward currency contracts At 31 December 2012 the Group held foreign exchange contracts as hedges of an inter-company loan and future expected payments to suppliers.
The exchange contracts are being used to reduce the exposure to foreign exchange risk.
The terms of these contracts are detailed below: 31 December 2012 Buy Sell Value of Maturity Contract currency currency contracts dates rates UK Euro Sterling 4,506,533 JanMar 13 1.22551.2325 Sterling Swiss Franc 342,505 Apr 13 1.4598 Sterling Euro 1,707,911 Jan 13 1.22551.2327 Sterling Norwegian Kroner 21,214 Jan 13 9.0034 US Dollar Sterling $14,360,237 JanApr 13 1.58381.6206 Danish Kroner Sterling DKK304,922 Jan 13 9.1066 SA Rand Sterling ZAR148,641,912 Jan 13Jun 14 13.610415.1952 Germany US Dollar Euro $49,625,000 JanMay 13 1.26231.3310 31 December 2011 Buy Sell Value of Maturity Contract currency currency contracts dates rates UK Sterling Euro 500,000 Jan-12 0.8557 US Dollar Sterling $13,656,870 JanApr 12 1.54001.6098 US Dollar Euro $1,695,465 Mar-12 1.3988 SA Rand Sterling ZAR88,992,000 JanDec 12 11.432512.5270 Germany Dollar Euro $61,300,000 JanJun 12 1.2941.444 The gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the above contracts are detailed in note 22.
88 Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 25 Financial instruments continued Exchange rate sensitivity The majority of the transactions in each of the Groups geographical segments are denominated in the functional currency of that segment.
There are, however, a limited number of transactions where foreign currency exchange risk exists.
In these instances the Group enters into forward currency contracts, as shown in the above table, in order to mitigate such risk.
At the end of the year the fair value of the outstanding contracts was a liability of 554,000 2011: 168,000.
Other than differences arising from the translation of results of operations outside of the Groups functional currency, reasonably foreseeable movements in the exchange rates of 10 per cent or -10 per cent would not have a material impact on the Groups profit before tax or equity.
Liquidity risk The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities as at 31 December based on contractual undiscounted payments: On demand 3 months 312 months 15 years 5 years Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Year ended 31 December 2012 Financial liabilities 1,135 2,676 5,737 11,033 20,581 Provisions 1,976 2,674 7,199 375 12,224 Trade and other payables 527,539 527,539 1,135 532,191 8,411 18,232 375 560,344 On demand 3 months 312 months 15 years 5 years Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Year ended 31 December 2011 Financial liabilities 2,141 3,005 8,084 13,091 436 26,757 Property provisions 384 2,347 8,741 746 12,218 Trade and other payables 530,953 530,953 2,141 534,342 10,431 21,832 1,182 569,928 Fair value measurements recognised in the consolidated balance sheet Financial instruments which are recognised at fair value subsequent to initial recognition are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
The three levels are defined as follows: t Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: t Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and t Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
At 31 December 2012 the Group had a current asset investment, which was measured at Level 2 fair value subsequent to initial recognition, to the value of 10.0 million 31 December 2011: 10.0 million.
At 31 December 2012 the Group had forward currency contracts, which were measured at Level 2 fair value subsequent to initial recognition, to the value of a liability of 554,000 31 December 2011: 168,000.
The realised losses from forward currency contracts in the period to 31 December 2012 of 386,000 2011: 730,000, are offset by broadly equivalent realised gains on the related underlying transactions.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 89 Financial statements Governance Business review Overview Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 26 Capital management Computacenters approach to capital management is to ensure that the Group has a strong capital base to support the development of the business and to maintain a strong credit rating, whilst aiming to maximise shareholder value.
Consistent with the Groups aim to maximise return to shareholders, the dividend policy is to maintain a dividend cover of between 22.5 times.
In 2012 the cover was 2.3 times, on a pre-exceptional basis 2011: 2.5 times.
The Groups capital base is primarily utilised to finance its fixed assets and working capital requirements.
The Group seeks to optimise the use of working capital and improve its cash flow.
As a consequence, the UK has sourced an increasing proportion of its product business via distributors in order to reduce the working capital requirements of the business.
Capital is allocated across the Group in order to minimise the Groups exposure to exchange rates.
Each country finances its own working capital requirements, typically resulting in borrowings in France with cash on deposit in the UK and Germany.
During 2012, a notional cash pooling arrangement was introduced, which Group companies can access and allows the Group to pool its funds.
In certain circumstances, the Group enters into customer contracts that are financed by leases, which are secured only on the assets that they finance, or loans.
Whilst the outstanding amounts of this customer specific financing CSF are included within net funds for statutory reporting purposes, the Group excludes this customer specific financing when managing the net funds of the business as this outstanding financing is matched by committed future revenues.
These financing facilities, which are committed, are thus outside of the normal working capital requirements of the Groups product resale and services activities.
In certain circumstances, the Group deposits its funds in short-term investments that do not fulfill the criteria to be classified as cash and cash equivalents.
The Group considers these deposits when managing the net funds of the business, and accordingly includes these deposits within net funds excluding CSF.
The measures of net funds that the Group monitors are: 2012 2011 000 000 Net funds excluding CSF 147,237 136,784 Customer specific financing 18,701 23,148 Net funds 128,626 113,636 The Group continued to benefit from the extension of an improvement in credit terms with a significant vendor, equivalent to 34 million at 31 December 2012, a reduction of approximately 11 million over the course of the year.
Each operating country manages working capital in line with Group policies.
The key components of working capital, i. e. trade receivables, inventory and trade payables, are managed in accordance with an agreed number of days targeted in the budget process, in order to ensure efficient capital usage.
An important element of the process of managing capital efficiently is to ensure that each operating country rewards behaviour at an Account Manager and Account Director level to minimise working capital, at a transactional level.
This is achieved by increasing commission payments for early payment by customers and reduced commission payments for late payment by customers, which encourages appropriate behaviour.
The Group regularly reviews the adequacy of its facilities against any foreseeable peak borrowing requirement, and as a result of the strong cash position, has allowed certain bank and factoring facilities to expire during 2012.
At 31 December 2012, the Group had available 20.3 million of uncommitted overdraft facilities 2011: 15.9 million of uncommitted overdraft and factoringfacilities.

There are two primary differences to this presentation compared to the statutory cash flow statement, as follows: 1 Factor financing is not included within the statutory definition of cash and cash equivalents, but when the Group has had factor facilities, operationally they have been managed within the total net funds borrowings of the businesses: and 2 Items relating to customer specific financing are adjusted for as follows: a.
Interest paid on customer specific financing is reclassified from interest paid to adjusted operating profit: and b.
Where customer specific assets are financed by finance leases and the liabilities are matched by future amounts receivable under customer operating lease rentals, the depreciation of leased assets and the repayment of the capital element of finance leases are offset within net working capital: and c. Where assets are financed by loans and the liabilities are matched by amounts receivable under customer operating lease rentals, the movement on loans within financing activities is offset within working capital.
