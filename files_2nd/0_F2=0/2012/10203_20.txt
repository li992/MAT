A Basis of preparation The Company fi financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and all applicable UK accounting standards.
B Foreign currency translation The functional currency of the Company is US Dollars.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the profi t and loss account.
C Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
D Called up share capital, share premium and dividend distribution Ordinary shares are classifi ed as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Companys fi financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
E Taxation Corporation tax is payable on taxable profi ts at amounts expected to be paid, or recovered, under the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised to take account of timing differences between the treatment of transactions for fi financial reporting purposes and their treatment for tax purposes.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised when it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be a suitable taxable profi t from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse based on the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.

No expense is recognised in respect of share options granted before 7 November 2002 and vested before 1 January 2005.
For shares or share options granted after 7 November 2002 and vested after 1 January 2005 the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the shares or options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares or options granted.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the profi t and loss account, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital contribution.
The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity in the parent entity accounts.
The social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of the share options is considered an integral part of the grant itself, and the charge is treated as a cash-settled transaction.
The shares are recognised when the options are exercised and the proceeds received allocated between called up share capital and share premium account.

Straight-line vesting will apply between these points.
Awards granted on or after 18 April 2011 are subject to either Absolute Shareholder Returns ASR over a three year period or a combination of cumulative EPS growth and ASR.
For the latter, the cumulative EPS growth over a three year period must be at least equal to RPI plus 3% per annum at which 25% of awards will vest and full vesting the cumulative EPS growth will be required to be RPI plus 9% per annum.
Straight line vesting will apply between these points.
