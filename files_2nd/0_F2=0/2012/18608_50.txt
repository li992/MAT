Distributions received of 1.9m in 2012 relate to dividends received from the Sovereign joint venture.
The provision for impairment write-back of loans receivable in 2011 of 1.9m comprises the release of 3.3m of the provision made against the groups mezzanine loan to Grainger GenInvest No.
2 2006 LLP prior to the groups acquisition of the remaining 50% equity in that company and a further provision of 5.2m against the groups investments in its Czech Republic joint ventures.
These amounts were included within the provision for impairment on loans receivable net of write backs on the face of the consolidated income statement.
The net assets disposed of through transfer to a subsidiary of 88.4m in 2011 represented the groups share of net assets and its loans to the two Grainger GenInvest LLPs which became subsidiaries of Grainger on 22 March 2011.
Of the loans advanced in 2011 of 3.3m only 2.1m was advanced in cash.
The remaining 1.2m relates to interest income earned from the Grainger Invest LLPs that was not received in cash.
117 A White Paper on the proposed High Speed Rail Network from London to Birmingham HS2, was presented to Parliament on 11 March 2010 by the Secretary of State for Transport.
This indicated that the potential route would cover at least part of our development site held in joint venture with Development Securities plc at Curzon Park in Birmingham.
In January 2012, the Government confirmed their intention to proceed with HS2.
The group, in conjunction with our joint venture partner, are liaising with HS2 and the Department of Transport to discuss the impact on, and a revised plan for, the site.
A provision of 4.9m was made in our 2010 year end accounts against the carrying value of our joint venture investment to write down its value to nil and this provision is still being held.
In view of the continuing uncertainty relating to the future of the Curzon Park site, it is difficult to estimate the net realisable value of the site.
However the directors believe no further impairment provision is required at the statement of financial position date.
Should the value of the site, together with any compensation received, be insufficient to repay the bank loan in the joint venture entity, the group may incur further charges in respect of its obligations to the joint venture and the bank.
