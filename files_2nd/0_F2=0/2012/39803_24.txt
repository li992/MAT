NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2012 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES BASIS OF PREPARATION The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with EU Endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, IFRIC Interpretations, and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore the Groups financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations.
In addition, the Group has also followed best practice recommendations issued by the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA as appropriate.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
This is discussed in the Financial Review on page 38.
The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption offered by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present a separate income statement and statement of comprehensive income for the Company.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modied by the revaluation of properties, available-for-sale investments and certain financial assets and liabilities including derivatives.
These financial statements are presented in sterling since that is the currency in which the majority of the Groups transactions are denominated.
Management believes that the judgements, estimates and associated assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are reasonable, however actual results may differ from these estimates.
Critical judgements, where made, are disclosed within the relevant section of the financial statements in which such judgements have been applied.
The critical estimate and assumption relates to the property valuations applied by the Groups property valuers.
Other judgements and sources of estimation relate to provisioning, accounting for significant transactions, financial instrument valuations and the actuarial assumptions used in calculating the Groups retirement benefit obligations.
These are described in more detail in the accounting policy notes below, or the applicable note to the financial statements.
In the current year, the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted by the Group, none of which had a material impact on the current or prior year reported results: Amendments to IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures Oct 2010 Disclosures Transfers of Financial Assets: and Amendments to IAS 12, Income Taxes Dec 2010 Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities: IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement: IAS 19 revised June 2011 Employee Benets: IAS 27 revised May 2011 Separate Financial Statements: IAS 28 revised May 2011 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine: Annual Improvements May 2012 to IFRSs 2009 2011 Cycle: Amendments to IFRS 1 First-time adoption of IFRSs March 2012 Government Loans, December 2010 First-time Adoption of IFRSs after a period of Severe Hyperination and Removal of Fixed Dates for First-time Adopters: Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements June 2011 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income: Amendments to IAS 32 and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures December 2011 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities: and Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities and IAS 27 revised May 2011 Separate Financial Statements October 2012 Investment Entities.
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards listed above will have a significant impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods, except as follows: The interest cost and expected return on scheme assets used in the previous version of IAS 19 are being replaced with a net-interest amount under IAS 19 revised June 2011, which is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net dened benefit liability or asset.
IFRS 9 will likely impact both the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these new and amended Standards including the potential effect of the amendment to IAS 28 and introduction of IFRS 11 until a detailed review has been completed.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and the Group, plus the Groups share of the results and net assets of the joint ventures.
The Company holds investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
A joint venture is a contract under which the Group and other parties undertake an activity or invest in an entity, under joint control.
The Group uses equity accounting for such entities, carrying its investment at cost plus the movement in the Groups share of net assets after acquisition, less impairment.
074 SEGRO ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2012 OVERVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BUSINESS COMBINATIONS The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
The acquirees identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classied as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The interest of non-controlling interest shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at their proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS Foreign currency transactions are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling on the transaction date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from settling these, or from retranslating monetary assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies, are booked in the Group income statement.
The exception is for foreign currency loans and derivatives that hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries, where exchange differences are booked in equity until the investment is realised.
CONSOLIDATION OF FOREIGN ENTITIES Assets and liabilities of foreign entities are translated into sterling at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Their income, expenses and cash ows are translated at the average rate for the period or at spot rate for significant items.
Resultant exchange differences are booked in reserves and recognised in the income statement when the operation is sold.
The principal exchange rates used to translate foreign currency denominated amounts in 2012 are: Balance sheet: 1 1.23 31 December 2011: 1 1.20 Income statement: 1 1.23 2011: 1 1.15 INVESTMENT PROPERTIES These properties include completed properties that are generating rent or are available for rent and development properties that are under development or available for development.
Investment properties comprise freehold and leasehold properties and are first measured at cost including transaction costs, then revalued to market value at each reporting date by professional valuers.
Leasehold properties are shown gross of the leasehold payables which are accounted for as finance lease obligations.
Valuation gains and losses in a period are taken to the income statement.
As the Group uses the fair value model as per IAS 40 Investment Properties, no depreciation is provided.
TRADING PROPERTIES These are properties being developed for sale or being held for sale after development is complete, and are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes direct expenditure and capitalised interest.
Trading properties are transferred to investment properties when there is a change in use evidenced by the commencement of an operating lease to another party, together with the intention to hold the property to generate rent, or for capital appreciation, or for both.
PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS Properties are treated as acquired at the point when the Group assumes the significant risks and rewards of ownership and as disposed when these are transferred to the buyer.
Generally this would occur on completion of contract.
LEASES Leases where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee are classied as finance leases.
All others are deemed operating leases.
Under operating leases, properties leased to tenants are accounted for as investment properties.
In cases where only the buildings part of a property lease qualies as a finance lease, the land is shown as an investment property.
REVENUE Revenue includes gross rental income, joint venture management fee income, income from service charges and proceeds from the sale of trading properties.
Joint venture management fee income is recognised as income when earned.
RENTAL INCOME Rental income from properties let as operating leases are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lease incentives and initial costs to arrange leases are capitalised, then amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term rent averaging.
For properties let as finance leases, minimum lease receipts are apportioned between finance income and principal repayment, but receipts that were not xed at lease inception e. g. rent review rises, are recognised as income when earned.
Surrender premiums received in the period are included in rental income.
com 075 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2012 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED SERVICE CHARGES AND OTHER RECOVERIES FROM TENANTS These include income in relation to service charges, directly recoverable expenditure and management fees.
Revenue from services is recognised by reference to the state of completion of the relevant services provided at the reporting date.
Service charge income is netted against property operating expenses.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest rate method.
Gross borrowing costs relating to direct expenditure on properties under development or undergoing major refurbishment are capitalised.
The interest capitalised is calculated using the Groups weighted average cost of borrowing for the relevant currency.
Interest is capitalised as from the commencement of the development work until the date of practical completion.
The capitalisation of finance costs is suspended if there are prolonged periods when development activity is interrupted.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivatives principally interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts in managing interest rate risk and currency risk, and does not use them for trading.
They are recorded, and subsequently revalued, at fair value, with revaluation gains or losses being immediately taken to the income statement.
The exception is for derivatives qualifying as hedges, when the treatment of the gain loss depends upon the item being hedged.
Derivatives with a maturity of less than twelve months or that expect to be settled within twelve months of the balance sheet date are presented as current assets or liabilities.
Other derivatives are presented as non-current assets or liabilities.
Trade and other receivables and payables Trade and other receivables are booked at fair value.
An impairment provision is created where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect in full.
Trade and other payables are stated at cost, since cost is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Available-for-sale AFS investments AFS investments are initially measured at cost, and then revalued to fair value based on quarterly reports received from the fund manager, or other market evidence where publicly traded.
Gains and losses arising from valuation are taken to equity, and then recycled through the income statement on realisation.
If there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, any cumulative loss recognised in equity is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement within other investment income.
PENSIONS DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEMES The schemes assets are measured at fair value, their obligations are calculated at discounted present value, and any net surplus or deficit is recognised in the balance sheet.
Operating and nancing costs are charged to the income statement, with service costs spread systematically over employees working lives, and nancing costs expensed in the period in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Where the actuarial valuation of the scheme demonstrates that the scheme is in surplus, the recognisable asset is limited to that for which the Group can benefit in the future.
Professional actuaries are used in relation to dened benefit schemes and the assumptions made are outlined in note 22.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The cost of granting share options and other share-based remuneration is recognised in the income statement at their fair value at grant date.
They are expensed straight-line over the vesting period, based on estimates of the shares or options that will eventually vest.
Charges are reversed if it appears that non-market based performance conditions will not be met.
INCOME TAX Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.
No provision is made for temporary differences i arising on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities, other than a business combination, that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and ii relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that suitable taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.

12 iv Factors that may affect future tax charges No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries and joint ventures.
In the event of their remittance to the UK, no net UK tax is expected to be payable.
The standard rate of UK corporation tax is due to fall in stages to 21 per cent by April 2014.
This is unlikely to signicantly impact the Groups tax charge.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUES CATEGORIES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Financial assets in the Group comprise interest rate swaps, foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swap contracts which are categorised as derivatives designated as fair value through the income statement non-hedge.
Financial assets also include trade and other receivables, finance lease receivables, available-for-sale investments and cash and cash equivalents, which are all classied as other financial assets.
Financial liabilities in the Group comprise interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts, and cross currency swap contracts which are categorised as fair value through the income statement non-hedge and forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swap contracts designated as net investment hedges.
Financial liabilities also include secured bank loans, unsecured bond issues, bank loans and overdrafts, all of which are categorised as debt and initially recognised at fair value less costs and subsequently at amortised cost: and trade and other payables, provisions and current tax liabilities, which are classied as other financial liabilities.
The carrying values of these financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair value, with the exception of unsecured bond issues and secured bank loans.
At 31 December 2012 the fair value of 1,689.1 million of unsecured bonds issued was 1,992.0 million 2011: 1,796.9 million compared with 1,980.0 million fair value and the fair value of 41.0 million of secured bank loans was 41.1 million 2011: 52.4 million compared with 52.2 million fair value.
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: Forward foreign exchange contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
Interest rate swaps and currency swap contracts are measured at the present value of future cash ows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates and the appropriate exchange rate at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities traded on active liquid markets is determined with reference to the quoted market prices.
Unlisted investments, such as those classied as available-for-sale investments, are typically valued by the Fund Manager based on the amount at which the asset would be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arms length transaction.
The methodology used to estimate fair value will depend on the nature and facts and circumstances of the investment but use one of the following bases: transaction value, earnings multiple, net assets, price of recent investment and sale price, where appropriate a marketability discount will be applied.
Financial guarantees are issued by the Company to support bank borrowings of 100 per cent owned subsidiary companies domiciled overseas.
The face value of these borrowings is already included in the Group balance sheet.
As the borrowing entity will have unencumbered directly owned property assets exceeding the value of the guaranteed borrowings, the probability of the Parent entity having to recognise any loss in respect to these guarantees is considered to be highly unlikely.
Hence no fair value liability has been ascribed to these guarantees in the accounts of the Parent entity.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS RECOGNISED IN THE BALANCE SHEET The Group and Company financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are available-for-sale investments, forward exchange and currency swap contracts and interest rate swaps as detailed in notes 17, 18 and 19.
All of these financial instruments would be classied as Level 2 fair value measurements, as dened by IFRS 7, being those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
There were no transfers between categories in the current or prior year.
CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern and as such it aims to maintain a prudent mix between debt and equity nancing.
The current capital structure of the Group consists of a mix of equity and debt.
Equity comprises issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the statement of changes in equity and notes 23 to 25.
Debt primarily comprises long-term debt issues and drawings against medium-term committed revolving credit facilities from banks as disclosed in note 20.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT The Group does not have any regular transactional foreign currency exposures as it does not have any regular business involving cross border currency ows.
However, it does have operations in Continental Europe which transact business denominated mostly in euros.
Hence there is currency exposure caused by translating the local trading performance and local net assets into sterling for each financial period and at each balance sheet date.
The Groups approach to managing balance sheet translation exposure is described in the Foreign Currency Translation Exposure section in the Financial Review on pages 38 to 39. www.
com 091 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2012 21.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUES CONTINUED The Groups balance sheet translation exposure including the impact of derivative financial instruments is summarised below: 2012 2011 EUROS US DOLLARS TOTAL EUROS US DOLLARS TOTAL m m m m m m GROUP Gross currency assets 1,651.6 27.4 1,679.0 1,670.0 26.6 1,696.6 Gross currency liabilities 1,387.9 17.7 1,405.6 1,418.2 12.5 1,430.7 NET EXPOSURE 263.7 9.7 273.4 251.8 14.1 265.9 COMPANY Gross currency assets 1,242.8 13.2 1,256.0 1,127.3 9.9 1,137.2 Gross currency liabilities 1,268.6 30.9 1,299.5 1,333.3 22.3 1,355.6 NET EXPOSURE 25.8 17.7 43.5 206.0 12.4 218.4 2012 gross currency liabilities include EUR31.8 million 25.9 million and USD28.6 million 17.7 million designated as net investment hedges.
2011 gross currency liabilities include EUR247.2 million 206.0 million and USD19.3 million 12.5 million designated as net investment hedges.
The remaining gross currency liabilities of the Group shown in the table above that are not designated as net investment hedges are either held directly in a euro or US dollar functional currency entity or passed down to such an entity from a sterling functional currency company through inter-company funding arrangements.
FOREIGN CURRENCY SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The Groups main currency exposure is the euro.
The blended sensitivity of the net assets of the Group to a 5 per cent change in the value of sterling against the relevant currencies is 13.6 million 2011: 12.7 million, with a sensitivity of 12.6 million against the euro 2011: 12.0 million and 1.0 million against the US dollar 2011: 0.7 million.
For the Company, the blended sensitivity is 2.0 million 2011: 10.4 million with a sensitivity of 1.2 million against the euro 2011: 9.8 million and 0.8 million against the US dollar 2011: 0.6 million.
FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CURRENCY SWAP CONTRACTS Some of the forward foreign exchange and currency swap contracts held by the Group are designated as net investment hedges of euro and US dollar denominated subsidiaries, where exchange differences are booked in reserves and recognised in the income statement when the operation is sold.
The remaining forward foreign exchange and currency swap contracts are effectively economic cash ow hedges, using the surplus cash in one currency to fund paying off debt in another currency.

The risk is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix between xed and oating rate borrowings.
The current Group policy states that 50 to 100 per cent of net borrowings should be at xed rate provided by long-term debt issues attracting a xed coupon or from oating rate bank borrowings converted into xed rate or hedged via interest rate swaps, forwards, caps, collars or oors or options on these products.
Hedging activities require the approval of the Treasury Committee and are evaluated and reported on regularly to ensure that the policy is being adhered to.
The Board reviews the policy on interest rate exposure annually with a view to establishing that it is still relevant in the prevailing and forecast economic environment.
INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
For oating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 1 per cent increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 1 per cent higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 31 December 2012 would decrease increase by 6.0 million 2011: decrease increase by 4.9 million.
This is attributable to the Groups exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings and cash deposits.
Fixed rate debt issues are held at amortised cost and are not re-valued in the balance sheet to reect interest rate movements.
INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between xed and oating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to manage the interest rate risk of the Groups borrowings.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash ows using the yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
The following tables detail the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts, based on their contractual maturities, outstanding as at the reporting date: PAY FIXED, RECEIVE FLOATING CONTRACTS: AVERAGE CONTRACT NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL FIXED INTEREST RATE AMOUNT FAIR VALUE 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 % % m m m m GROUP In one year or less 2.97 122.0 1.6 In more than one year but less than two 3.06 2.97 101.6 125.0 4.8 3.4 In more than two years but less than five 2.35 2.45 593.5 712.5 36.2 30.0 In more than five years TOTAL 817.1 837.5 42.6 33.4 COMPANY In one year or less In more than one year but less than two 2.62 40.7 1.3 In more than two years but less than five 2.35 2.37 593.5 650.0 36.2 26.1 In more than five years TOTAL 634.2 650.0 37.5 26.1 RECEIVE FIXED, PAY FLOATING CONTRACTS: GROUP In one year or less In more than one year but less than two 6.75 250.0 48.5 In more than two years but less than five 5.70 5.67 898.0 239.0 87.7 9.4 In more than five years 6.75 6.18 50.0 709.0 9.7 105.1 TOTAL 1,198.0 948.0 145.9 114.5 COMPANY In one year or less In more than one year but less than two 6.75 250.0 48.5 In more than two years but less than five 5.70 5.67 898.0 239.0 87.7 9.4 In more than five years 6.75 6.18 50.0 709.0 9.7 105.1 TOTAL 1,198.0 948.0 145.9 114.5 www.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUES CONTINUED The above are effective economic hedges although the Group has not elected to adopt hedge accounting for them, hence their change in fair value is taken direct to the income statement.
The interest rate swaps settle on either a three-month or six-month basis with the oating rate side based on the EURIBOR or sterling LIBOR rate for the relevant period.
The Group will settle or receive the difference between the xed and oating interest rate on a net basis.
CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Potential customers are evaluated for creditworthiness and where necessary collateral is secured.
There is no concentration of credit risk within the lease portfolio to either business sector or individual company as the Group has a diverse customer base with no one customer accounting for more than 5 per cent of rental income.
Trade receivables which include unpaid rent and amounts receivable in respect of property disposals were approximately 1 per cent of total assets at 31 December 2012 and at 31 December 2011.
The Directors are of the opinion that the credit risk associated with unpaid rent is low.
In excess of 95 per cent of rent due is generally collected within 21 days of the due date.
2012 2011 AGEING OF PAST DUE BUT NOT IMPAIRED RECEIVABLES WERE AS FOLLOWS: m m 0-30 days 9.0 7.1 30-60 days 2.6 0.3 60-90 days 2.1 0.3 90-180 days 0.4 0.1 180 days 1.0 1.9 Past due but not impaired 15.1 9.7 Not due 26.3 21.2 TOTAL TRADE RECEIVABLES 41.4 30.9 No other receivables were considered impaired or overdue.
Investment in financial instruments is restricted to banks and short-term liquidity funds with a good credit rating.
Derivative financial instruments are transacted via International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA agreements with counterparties with a good investment grade credit rating.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread among approved counterparties.
LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by having a policy that requires that adequate cash and committed bank facilities remain available to cover and match all debt maturities, development spend, trade related and corporate cash ows forward over a rolling 18-month period.
This is achieved by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash ows and matching the maturity proles of financial assets and liabilities.
Liquidity risk management is discussed in more detail in the Liquidity Position and Going Concern sections in the Financial Review on pages 37 to 38.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES BACKGROUND The Group has four dened benefit schemes in the UK, the SEGRO Pension Scheme the SEGRO scheme, the Bilton Group Pension Scheme the Bilton scheme and two additional schemes following the acquisition of Brixton Ltd, the Brixton plc Pension Plan the Brixton scheme and the J Saville Gordon Group plc and Subsidiary Companies Retirement and Death benefit Scheme the JSG scheme.
The assets of the schemes are held by Trustees separately from the assets of the employer.
The Group also has a number of dened contribution schemes for which 1.3 million has been recognised as an expense 2011: 1.2 million.
All four dened benefit schemes are closed to new members.
Valuation of the schemes has been based on the most recent actuarial valuations: 31 March 2010 for the SEGRO scheme, 5 April 2010 for the Bilton scheme, 31 December 2011 for the Brixton scheme and 30 June 2010 for the JSG scheme and updated by the independent actuaries in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31 December 2012.

Future improvements to the life expectancy are in line with CMI 2009 projections with an assumed long-term rate of improvement of one per cent p. a.
The expected return on plan assets is a blended average of projected long-term returns for the various asset classes.
Asset class returns are based on a forward looking building block approach.
Equity returns are developed based on the selection of an equity risk premium above the risk free rate which is measured in accordance with the yields on government bonds.
Bond and gilt returns are selected by reference to the yields on government and corporate debt as appropriate to the schemes holdings of these instruments.

23 i DSBP The DSBP is for senior employees whereby 25 per cent of any payment under the Bonus Scheme is deferred to shares.
For 2013, the percentage subject to deferral for Executive Directors will be 50 per cent of any Bonus payment.
The scheme is described on page 60.
2012 2011 NUMBER NUMBER AT 1 JANUARY 270,246 Shares granted DSBP 317,231 270,246 Shares expired lapsed 15,018 AT 31 DECEMBER 572,459 270,246 The 2011 DSBP grant was made on 2 April 2012, based on a 30 March 2012 closing share price of 234.8p.
23 ii LTIP The LTIP is a discretionary employee share scheme.
Shares are conditionally awarded based on individual performance.
Vesting of awards is subject to threeor four-year performance conditions and is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The performance conditions of the LTIP are detailed in the Remuneration Report on pages 57 to 65.
UK participants will have an 18-month period from the release date in which to elect to receive their shares, subject to Remuneration Committee approval.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Group, the award will lapse, unless the participant is deemed to be entitled to the award, in which case the award will be pro-rated on length of employment in relation to the award date.
In 2012, the LTIP performance period was extended from three to four years.
To avoid the position where there would be no potential vesting in 2015, transitionary arrangements were put in place: a Transitionary LTIP award based on three-year performance conditions was made in addition to the 2012 LTIP award which was based on a four-year performance period.
For both awards, the grant size was reduced by 25 per cent.
It is anticipated that subsequent awards will vest on four-year performance.
The same performance targets will apply to both awards.
The calculation of the award was based on a share price of 221.1p, the closing mid-market share price on 30 April 2012.
No consideration was paid for the grant of any award.
The Black-Scholes model has been used to fair value the shares granted currently under award, apart from the 2012 TSR element of the award which uses the Monte Carlo model.
The assumptions used are as follows: DATE OF GRANT 28-APR-10 29-MAR-11 1 MAY-12 Market price used for award 314.7p 331.3p 221.1p Risk-free interest rate 1.8% 1.8% 1.8% Dividend yield 4.4% 4.5% 6.6% Volatility 57.0% 54.0% 54.0% Term of option 3 years 3 years 3 years 4 years Fair value per share 275.7p 289.0p 183.0p 171.0p 098 SEGRO ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2012 OVERVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 23 iii SIP The SIP is an HMRC approved all-employee share plan.
UK employees, who have been employed by the Group since 1 October of the preceding year, may be awarded shares in relation to the Companys prior year performance and their salary.
Participating employees may be awarded shares annually up to a maximum of seven per cent of their salary or 3,000, whichever is lower.
The 2012 award was seven per cent of salary.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Group within three years from date of award the shares will be forfeited, unless the employee is entitled to the shares due to certain leaver circumstances, in which case the shares will be transferred out of the trust to the participant.
23 iv GSIP The GSIP was launched in 2008 as an all-employee share scheme for non-UK based employees.
It is not HMRC approved but the eligibility and performance conditions of the award are designed to replicate the SIP.
Employees are granted awards which are released by the Trustees at conclusion of a three-year holding period.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Group by the end of the three-year period then the award will lapse unless the participant is entitled to the award due to the terms of leaving.
Shares in respect of the GSIP are held in the SEGRO plc Employees benefit Trust.

Brixton shares in the Brixton SIP were converted to SEGRO shares under the scheme of arrangement.
As at 31 December 2012, 4,743 shares 2011: 5,673 shares were held in trust for the Brixton SIP.
23 vi Sharesave The Group operates an HMRC approved all-employee savings related share option plan.
For 2012, a three-year period was offered to employees and if they remain in employment, employees can purchase shares in the Company at a price which is xed at the start of the saving period.
The price is usually set at a 20 per cent discount to the market price.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Group, in certain circumstances the participant may be able to exercise their options within a xed period from the date of leaving.
During 2012, the movements in Sharesave options were as follows: 2012 2011 WEIGHTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE AVERAGE NUMBER OF EXERCISE NUMBER OF EXERCISE OPTIONS PRICE OPTIONS PRICE AT 1 JANUARY 405,930 205.6p 429,900 202.8p Options granted 220,577 188.2p 50,825 257.4p Options exercised 211,890 182.0p 27,850 182.0p Options expired lapsed 98,784 224.3p 46,945 250.6p AT 31 DECEMBER 315,833 203.4p 405,930 205.6p The consideration received by the Company from options exercised during the year was 385,739 2011: 50,687.

If the performance conditions were not met by the third anniversary of the date of grant, the options lapsed.
Participants were able to exercise their options after a three-year holding period subject to continuous employment.
Options expire ten years after grant.
In certain circumstances a participant may exercise their options up to a year after leaving the Group.
