Financial risk management The Groups international operations and debt financing expose it to financial risks that include the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risks and liquidity risks.
Treasury and risk management policies, which are set by the Board, specify guidelines on financial risks and the use of financial instruments to manage risk.
The instruments and techniques used to manage exposures include foreign currency derivatives and interest rate derivatives.
Group treasury monitors financial risks and compliance with risk management policies.
A Fair values of financial instruments The fair value hierarchy is as follows: Level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices including those within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly as prices or indirectly derived from prices : and Level 3 Inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The following table presents the Groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 31 March 2012: all figures in million Note Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets Current other investments 1.1 1.1 19 Current derivative financial instruments 24 0.1 0.1 Non-current other investments 4.8 4.8 16 Non-current derivative financial instruments 24 0.1 0.1 Liabilities Current derivative financial instruments 0.1 0.1 24 Total 1.1 0.1 4.8 6.0 For cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and bank and current borrowings, the fair value of the financial instruments approximate to their carrying value as a result of the short maturity periods of these financial instruments.
For trade and other receivables, allowances are made within the carrying value for credit risk.
For other financial instruments, the fair value is based on market value, where available.
Where market values are not available, the fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows to net present value using prevailing market-based interest rates translated at the year-end rates, except for unlisted fixed asset investments where fair value equals carrying value.

Financial risk management continued B Interest rate risk The Group operates an interest rate policy designed to optimise interest costs and to reduce volatility in reported earnings.
The Groups current policy is to require rates to be fixed for 30-80% of the level of borrowings, which is achieved primarily through fixed-rate borrowings, and through the use of interest rate swaps.
Where there are significant changes in the level and or structure of debt, policy permits borrowings to be 100% fixed, with regular Board reviews of the appropriateness of this fixed percentage.
At 31 March 2012 100% 2011: 99% of the Groups borrowings were at fixed rates with no adjustment for interest rate swaps.

Trade and other receivables payables and deferred finance costs are excluded from this analysis.
For the fixed or capped-rate financial assets and liabilities, the average interest rates including the relevant marginal cost of borrowing and the average period for which the rates are fixed are: 2012 2011 Weighted Weighted Fixed or average Weighted Fixed or average Weighted capped interest rate average years capped interest rate average years m % to maturity m % to maturity Financial assets: Sterling 9.1 13.4 3.5 11.2 13.4 4.5 Financial liabilities: Sterling 8.6 12.1 3.5 10.7 12.1 4.5 US dollar 242.2 7.2 4.3 365.5 6.6 5.2 Total financial liabilities 250.8 6.7 4.3 376.2 6.7 5.1 Sterling assets and liabilities consist primarily of finance leases with the weighted average interest rate reflecting the internal rate of return of those leases.
Interest rate risk management The Group private placement borrowings are fixed-rate, while the revolving credit facility is floating-rate and undrawn as at 31 March 2012.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 March 2012 was nil.
88 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Business review Corporate governance Financial statements C Currency risk Transactional currency exposure The Group is exposed to foreign currency risks arising from sales or purchases by businesses in currencies other than their functional currency.
It is Group policy that when such a sale or purchase is certain, the net foreign exchange exposure is hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Hedge accounting documentation and effectiveness testing are undertaken for all the Groups transactional hedge contracts.
The table below shows the Groups currency exposures, being exposures on currency transactions that give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating company involved.
Functional currency of the operating company Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities all figures in millions US$ Euro AUS$ Other Total 31 March 2012 sterling 13.4 1.7 6.6 2.2 23.9 31 March 2011 sterling 15.5 2.7 6.4 1.1 20.3 The amounts shown in the table take into account the effect of the forward contracts entered into to manage these currency exposures.
The Group enters into forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the currency exposures that arise on sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies, as the transaction occurs.
The principal contract amounts of the outstanding forward currency contracts as at 31 March 2012 against sterling are net US Dollars sold 6.5m US$10.4m and net Euros sold 10.0m 12m.
Translational currency exposure The Group has significant investments in overseas operations, particularly in the United States.
As a result, the sterling value of the Groups balance sheet can be significantly affected by movement in exchange rates.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of these translational exposures by matching the net investment in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in their functional currencies unless the cost of such hedging activity is uneconomic.
This is achieved by borrowing in the local currency or, in some cases, indirectly through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
D Financial credit risk The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not currently expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
Credit risk is mitigated by Board-approved policy of only selecting counterparties with a strong investment grade long-term credit rating for cash deposits, normally at least AAor equivalent.
In the normal course of business, the Group operates notional cash pooling systems, where a legal right of set-off applies.
The maximum credit-risk exposure in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations under financial assets, excluding trade and other receivables, totals 133.0m 2011: 121.9m.
The Group held cash and cash equivalents of 117.8m at 31 March 2012 2011: 102.5m, which represents the maximum credit exposure on these assets.
The cash and cash equivalents were held with different financial institutions which were rated AAor better.

Financial risk management continued H Sensitivity analysis The Groups sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates on financial assets and liabilities as at 31 March 2012 is set out in the table below.
The impact of a weakening in sterling on the Groups financial assets and liabilities would be more than offset in equity and income by its impact on the Groups overseas net assets and earnings respectively.
Sensitivity on Group assets other than financial assets and liabilities is not included in this analysis.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming that certain market conditions occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected as a result of developments in the global financial markets that may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the table below, which should not, therefore, be considered to be a projection of likely future events and losses.
The estimated changes for interest rate movements are based on an instantaneous decrease or increase of 1% 100 basis points in the specific rate of interest applicable to each class of financial instruments from the levels effective at 31 March 2012, with all other variables remaining constant.
The estimated changes for foreign exchange rates are based on an instantaneous 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all other currencies from the levels applicable at 31 March 2012, with all other variables remaining constant.
Such analysis is for illustrative purposes only in practice market rates rarely change in isolation.
The figures shown below relate primarily to the translational impact on the Groups US$ debt.
This debt is held in the US so there is no transactional impact.
The impact of transactional risk on the Groups monetary assets liabilities that are not held in the functional currency of the entity holding those assets liabilities is minimal.
A 10% weakening in sterling would result in a 1.7m increase in profit before tax.
