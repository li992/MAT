The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these calculations are long-term growth rates, and pre-tax discount rates, and use cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and forecasts approved by management covering a five-year period.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates based on local expected economic conditions and do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for that country.
The pre-tax discount rates are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks relating to the country in which the CGU operates.
