SVG Capital plc Business Corporate Financial Company Annual report Overview review information information information 2012 57 1 Accounting policies continued Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the Companys contractual right to the cash ow from the asset expires or substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the contractual obligation is discharged, with gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
Investments Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value.
As the Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to proting from their total return in the form of income or capital gains, such financial assets are designated as fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition.
Incidental costs on acquisition of such assets are expensed.
Financial assets designated as fair value through profit or loss are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value, which for investment funds is at their net asset value based on the fair value of the underlying investments.
Quoted instruments are valued at either the bid price or the last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted.
In respect of unquoted instruments, or where the market for a financial instrument is not active, fair value is established by using recognised valuation methodologies, in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital IPEV Valuation Guidelines.
Fair value is the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants at the reporting date.
Gains and losses arising from investments, designated as investments held at fair value through profit or loss, are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on fair value through profit or loss investments are included within the changes in its fair value.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its risks associated with interest rate uctuations and foreign exchange movements.
It is not the Groups policy to trade in derivative instruments.
Derivative instruments are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value.
Fair value is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
Unless designated as cash ow hedges all changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are taken to the income statement.
Cash ow hedges For cash ow hedges, the effective portion of the unrealised gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in equity and recorded in the statement of comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs.
Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred tothe initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain inequity untilthe forecast transaction occurs and are transferred to the income statement or to the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above.
If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to the income statement.
A hedging relationship qualies for hedge accounting if all of the following conditions are met.

Investments in subsidiaries In its separate financial statements the Company recognises its investment in subsidiaries at cost, unless they are investment vehicles, inwhich case they are included at fair value.
Subsidiaries recognised at cost are subject to an annual impairment review.
SVG Capital plc Annual report 58 2012 Notes to the accounts continued continued Investments in associates In accordance with IAS 28 Investments in Associates, the standard does not apply to investments held in associates by private equity organisations that are designated as fair value through profit or loss.
Such investments are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they occur.
A An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant inuence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
Convertible loan notes Convertible loan notes are regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity component.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible loan notes and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in equity.
Issue costs are allocated proportionately to the liability and equity components.
The liability component is accounted for as a borrowing.
Bank borrowings and loan notes Interest-bearing bank loans and loan notes issued are recorded at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement account using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Own shares Own shares represent SVG Capital plc shares held in Employee benefit Trusts to meet the future requirements of the employee share-based payment plans.
The EBTs are accounted for as extensions of the parent company.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has beenapplied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The cost of equity-settled share-based payments with employees of the Group are measured at fair value at the date of grant and recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the employees become unconditionally entitled tothe award.
Fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate valuation model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any non-market vesting conditions.
A At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period hasexpired and managements best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the consolidated income statement, with a corresponding entry inequity.
The cost of equity awards to employees of subsidiaries is added to the Companys investment in subsidiaries.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for services provided in the normal course of business.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is therate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Interest income is classied within operating activities in the cash ow statement.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment has been established andisclassied within operating activities in the cash ow statement.
Investment management and advisory fees are accrued over the period for which the service is provided.
Revenue that has been earned, but the receipt of which is contingent on the occurrence of a future event, such as investors receiving a return of capital, is only recognised when Management judges the realisation of that income to be virtually certain.
The Groups revenue and realised capital gains are derived primarily from distributions in respect of its holdings in fund investments.
Realised gains on capital distributions which arise from the realisation of investments within the funds, and on sale of investments are credited to the income statement and taken to the capital reserve.
Income distributions are credited to the income statement and taken to the revenue reserve.

All other leases are classied as operating leases.
The Group as lessee Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benets received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to dened contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
The costs relating to dened benefit schemes are accounted for in the same way as for dened contribution schemes where the Group is unable to identify its share ofthe underlying performance and financial position of the plan with sufficient reliability for accounting purposes.
Such situations arise where the contributions payable by the Group are set in terms of the scheme as a whole and, as such, there is no consistent and reliable basis for allocating the Groups obligations, plan assets, or costs.
Foreign currencies The functional currency of the Company is pounds sterling, as this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of thetransactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated atthe rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement and are allocated either to revenue or capital, as appropriate.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted orsubstantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Investment trusts which have approval under Section 1158 Income and Corporation Tax Act 2010 are not liable for taxation on capitalgains.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities inthe financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using thebalance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred taxassets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from theinitial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, andinterests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable thatthe temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
SVG Capital plc Annual report 60 2012 Notes to the accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost, including direct acquisition costs, less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost less estimated residual value of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Telecommunications and ofce equipment t 10%20% Leasehold improvements s 10% Computer equipment t 20%33% The Group does not ordinarily provide for depreciation against art.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments rather than for investment purposes.
A Assets are classied as cash equivalents if they are readily convertible to cash and are not subject to significant changes in value.
The Company has classied short-term bank deposits, investments in money market funds and short-dated treasury bills as cash equivalents.
Deferred consideration This deferred consideration that is not contingent on future events is recognised as a receivable on the Companys balance sheet.
A Amounts due within 12 months are recorded as current assets.
Amounts due in greater than 12 months are recorded as non-currentassets.
2 significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the Groups consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates andassumptions that affect the reported amounts of profits and net assets at the end of the reporting period.
However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that have a material impact on net assets in future periods.
The key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to net assets within the next financial year are discussed below.
Other areas of uncertainty and risk are discussed in note 28.
Fair value of financial instruments The Group primarily invests in private equity limited partnerships Funds that in turn invest in companies that are typically unquoted.
V Valuing unquoted investments involves a significant degree of judgement.
Fair values of the Funds in which the Group invests are typically provided by the general partner of such funds and are reviewed and, ifconsidered appropriate, approved by the Board.
The fair value of a Funds investment in an investee company is generally obtained by calculating the Enterprise Value EV of the company and then deducting financial instruments, such as external debt, ranking ahead of the Funds highest ranking instrument in the company.
The Groups participation in the remaining instruments is then calculated to assess the fair value of the Groups investment.
A A common method of determining the EV is to apply a market-based multiple e. g. an average multiple based on a selection ofcomparable quoted companies to the maintainable earnings of the investee company.
This market-based approach presumes thatthe comparator companies are correctly valued by the market.
A discount is sometimes applied to market based multiples toadjustfor points of difference between the comparators and the company being valued.
W Where the fair value of financial assets recorded in the Groups balance sheet cannot be derived from active markets, they are determined using valuation techniques, in accordance with IPEV Valuation Guidelines, including the methodology briey outlined above.
The valuation techniques recommended by the IPEV Board are industry standard.
However, amounts ultimately realised ondisposal of an investee company can differ materially from the previous carrying value and therefore have a significant impact ontheGroups profits and net assets.

significant deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of brought-forward tax losses that the Company can utilise to offset future taxable profits.
Management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and thelevelof future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.
The Company expects to derive returns primarily in the form of capital gains on its investment portfolio.
As an investment trust, theCompany is exempt from corporation tax on capital gains.
Recovery of contingent fees Uncertainty exists with respect to the recoverability of certain investment advisory fees that are contingent on future events, such asinvestors receiving a return of capital.
Management judgement is required to determine the probability that fees are recoverable.
Income in respect of fees that are contingent on future events is only recognised when the realisation of that income is deemed to bevirtually certain.
No amounts in respect of contingent fees has been recognised in the year 2011: Nil.

Costs in respect of dened benefit schemes relate to payments due tothe Schroders Retirement Benets Scheme the Scheme in respect of four former employees of SVG Advisers Limited SVGA, awholly owned subsidiary of the Company, that were seconded from Schroder Investment Management Limited.
SVGA and the Schemes trustees, taking advice from the independent actuaries, agree the contributions.
In accordance with IAS 19, the Groups contributions to the Scheme are accounted for as a dened contribution scheme on the basis that the Group is unable to readily identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the Scheme at the balance sheet date as there is no consistent and reliable basis for allocating the obligations, plan assets and costs to the Group.
Further details of the Scheme can be f found in the Annual Report and Accounts of Schroders plc.
In particular, the Scheme had no active members in the dened benefit scheme at 31 December 2011 and is closed to new entrants.
The accounts of Schroders plc disclosed a net pension surplus in respect of the Scheme of 55.7 million at 31 December 2011, calculated under IAS 19.

All funds in the management buy-out portfolio are unlisted.
However, some of the underlying companies held within those funds arelisted.
Included in the value of total management buy-out fund portfolio are gross valuations of listed investments amounting to386.9million 31December 2011: 238.7 million.
The Group and Company investment portfolios include Permira IV at a value of592.4 million, which is net of a 25% provision against future distributions on the realisation of investments held by Permira IV, inaccordance with the terms of the Permira IV re-organisation in December 2008.
It should also be noted that the value of the PermiraIVinvestments attributed to follow-ons that were made after 2008 are not subject to a provision, as distributions in respect ofsuch investments will be received infull.
SVG Capital plc Annual report 70 2012 Notes to the accounts continued 13 Investments continued During the year, the Company sold its direct holding in Permira Europe III.
However, it retained 50% of its exposure through Permira III toone of the underlying investments, the iglo Group iglo.
A A contract is in place giving the Company the rights to 50% of all future distributions received by the acquirer in relation to its holding in Permira Europe III.
The contract has been valued at 19.9 million.
The Board considers that the best indication of the fair value of the right to future distributions from iglo is the current valuation of iglo as calculated in accordance with the Companys accounting policies.
significant interests in investment funds Details of investments in which the Company or Group has an interest of 10% or more of any class of share units are detailed in the list of investments on pages 26 and 27.
In addition, SVG Capital has a 20.2% interest in the I Class units of the SVG UK Focus Fund, which forms part of SVG Investment Funds Dublin plc, a Dublin-listed OEIC and comprises an aggregate interest of 17.6%.
SVG Investment Managers Limited provides services to that company under an investment management agreement.
It also has a 20.0% interest in Strategic Equity Capital plc, a UK-listed investment trust to which SVG Investment Managers Limited provides services under an investment management agreement and a 17.0 million commitment to co-invest alongside the Strategic Recovery Fund II.
Furthermore the Company has a 35.5% interest in SVG Diamond, a 35.6% interest in SVG Diamond II, and a 23.4% interest in SVG Diamond III, for all of which SVG Advisers Limited provides services under an investment advisory contract.
The Companys holdings in these entities do not represent controlling interests as the Company owns less than 50% of the voting rights, each entity has an independent Board of Directors, and the management and or advisory agreements can be terminated at the request of the investors or by order of the relevant Board of Directors.
The Company, therefore, does not have the power to govern the financial and operating policies of these entities so as to obtain benets from their activities.
The Company also has a 100% interest in SVG India LP.
SVG India LP does qualify as a subsidiary as the Company owns 100% of the voting rights and is therefore consolidated into the Group financial statements.

In 2007 the Company advanced a loan of 624,000 to SVG Investment Managers Limited, for regulatory capital purposes, which remains outstanding.
Interest of 5% per annum is payable on the loan.
During the year the Company repaid a loan from SVGA of 10.0 million that was outstanding as at 31 December 2011.
The loan accrued interest at a rate of5% per annum.
During the year the Company received dividends of 6.0 million from SVGA 2011: 5.9 million, 0.2million from SVGIM 2011: 0.5million, and 0.1 million from SVGM 2011: 0.2 million.
In addition, SVGA paid 11.0 million asareturn of capital during the year.
There were no other distributions paid by subsidiaries during the year.
During the year SVGA received 1.6 million of SVG Diamond I Loan Notes and 0.8 million of SVG Diamond II Loan Notes, as part of its ongoing investment advisory fee arrangements.
These Notes were purchased from SVGA by SVG Capital plc at par value on the date of issue, as the holding of investments is the main activity of the parent company.
In addition, the Company received a further 0.4 million of SVG Diamond II Loan Notes in lieu of interest.
A As previously disclosed, the Diamond Investment Scheme enabled staff to purchase shares in SVG Diamond II from SVG Capital.
Until they have been transferred, shares remain in the name of SVG Capital but are held on trust for the beneciaries.
At 31 December 2012, the total amounts receivable by the Company under the Scheme was 0.4 million 2011: 0.4 million.
Related party transactions during the year were made on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arms-length transactions.
28 Risk Financial instruments and risk prole The Companys primary investment objective is to achieve capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio of private equity and private equity-related assets.
These investments are typically illiquid.
In addition, the Company holds money market instruments, cash and short-term deposits and various items such as debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations.
These financial instruments held by the Company are generally liquid.
The holding of securities, investing activities and associated nancing undertaken pursuant to this objective involves certain inherent risks.
Events may occur that would result in either a reduction in the Groups net assets or a reduction of revenue profits available fordividend.
A As an investment trust, the Company invests in securities for the long term.
The Company has not taken out any derivatives contracts to date, other than the interest rate swap and currency swap agreements referred to in note 19, which were executed to hedge against uctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates with respect to the Senior Notes in issue.
SVG Advisers Limited has entered into f forward currency contracts, referred to in notes 17 and 19, which are used to hedge against uctuations in foreign exchange rates, since the majority of its fee income is euro-denominated but its ongoing costs are primarily sterling-denominated.
Floating rate financial assets consist of cash at bank, short-term deposits and AAA-rated money market funds.
Allnancial assets are included at fair value.
b Financial liabilities The Company had 150.3 million nominal 2011: 162.0 million nominal of Senior Notes outstanding at the year end.
The Company had in place a loan facility of 250.0 million with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, Lloyds Banking Group plc and Unicredit Bank AG at 31 December 2012, which was undrawn 2011: undrawn at the balance sheet date.
During the year, the loan facility was renegotiated, 100.0 million matured in January 2013 and 150 million matures in December 2015.
The Company had 92.8 million nominal 2011: 90.9 million nominal of subordinated convertible loan notes in issue at the balance sheet date.
The level of borrowing will impact on the Groups performance by amplifying the effect of movements in the valuation of the investment portfolio.
In addition to financial liabilities note 19, the Company also has uncalled fund commitments note 20 as at 31 December 2012 of 91.7million 2011: 170.2 million, which are discussed below as part of commitment liquidity risk.
It should also be noted that fund investments and underlying investee companies may also utilise borrowings to varying degrees.
This is particularly the case with respect to CLO funds and structured private equity funds of funds, which are highly leveraged vehicles.

Gross settled derivatives are calculated based on the spot prices at the year end.
Financial liabilities maturity The maturity groupings are based on the remaining period from the end of the reporting period to the contractual maturity date.
When a counterparty has a choice of when the amount is paid, the liability is allocated to the earliest period in which the Group can be required to pay.
For loan facility drawdowns this will be within three months, although the amounts will be available to be re-drawn, subject to compliance with loan covenants.
For the purposes of this analysis it is assumed that outstanding loan amounts, if any, will remain drawn until the quarter-end prior to the expiry date of the facility, i. e. 31 September 2015.
Financial assets maturity A Analysis of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss into maturity groupings is based on the long-term nature of these assets and, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is assumed that no distributions or realisations will occur within 12 months of the balance sheet date, although it is clearly possible that realisations will occur within that period.
Beyond that it is extremely difficult to judge the precise size or timing of such cash ows.
It is, however, a requirement under IFRS 7 to disclose such an analysis and therefore abreakdown is provided in the following table for illustrative purposes only.
It is emphasised that the analysis is provided purely to comply with accounting standards.
It is not a forecast and should not be construed as such.
It is based on broad assumptions, further details of which are provided below the table.
For other assets, the analysis into maturity groupings is based on the remaining period from the end of the reporting period to the contractual maturity date or if earlier, the expected date the assets will be realised.

In particular, it is very difficult to predict the quantum and timing of returns on the Groups long-term investment portfolio.
As already mentioned, it is important to note that the maturity analysis in respect of financial assets at fair value i. e. the investment portfolio is highly subjective and is not a forecast ofthe expected cash ows.
For the purposes of the maturity analysis it has been simply assumed that all financial assets will be realised at their y year end carrying value.
The amounts receivable within three months are based on actual cash ows.
The residual balance has been allocated 85:15 between less than and more than five years.
This is considered to be a reasonable and prudent estimate, but is no more than that.
The Groups undrawn loan facility amounted to 202.8 million at 31 December 2012 121.7 million f following the maturity of 100 million in January 2013, and is subject to financial covenants as discussed in note 19.
Uncalled fund commitments A At 31 December 2012, the Group had uncalled fund commitments of 91.7 million, which are expected to be drawn over a number of y years.
It should be noted that when these commitments are funded they will typically be used to make investments and therefore create an asset that would be expected to be realised for cash over the longer term.
The Groups uncalled commitments are more than covered by the year end cash balance of 269.4 million, and the 121.7 million tranche of the loan facility maturing in December 2015.
Risks The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are considered to be commitment risk and valuation risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policy for managing these and other risks as summarised below.
The Directors consider that the risks faced by the Group are primarily those faced by the Company.
Borrowing and funding risks The nature of investing in buy-out and development capital funds entails making significant financial commitments, as shown in note 20.
A At 31 December 2012, the Group had uncalled commitments of 91.7 million 2011: 170.2 million, compared to cash balances of 269.4million 2011: 121.0 million and shareholders funds of 1,073.0 million 2011: 1,038.7 million.
The Company is a closed-ended investment trust and is therefore not subject to redemption requests from its investors.
TheCompanys shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
It is anticipated that over the longer term, and in normal circumstances, the Companys commitments to private equity funds and other financial liabilities will be nanced by available cash resources and distributions received on the realisation of underlying investments within the fund portfolio, although in the current market environment it is not anticipated that there will be significant realisations f fromthe investment portfolio in the short term.
In addition, the Group had a 250 million loan facility, which was undrawn at31December 2012, that could be drawn on, subject to financial covenants as described in note 19, to meet fund commitments as theyfall due.
That facility was reduced to 150 million in January 2013.
The Board monitors liquidity risk and, if considered appropriate, could renegotiate its lending arrangements or issue new securities.
The Groups investments are mainly illiquid but, in extremis, the Board could consider selective disposals of long-term investments, if required to meet commitments as they fall due.
In these circumstances it is possible, dependent on prevailing market conditions, that the realisation value of such assets could be at a significant discount to their previous carrying value.
The Company is in a relatively strong financial position but a residual risk remains that the Group could be unable to meet its future commitments in full.
If as a consequence of a failure to pay a call, the Company is treated as a defaulting investor to the relevant Fund, itwill suffer a resultant dilution in interest and possibly the compulsory sale of its interest.
A default on a fund commitment would alsoresult in a cross-default on the Companys senior debt.
In December 2008 the Company agreed to reduce its commitment toPermira IV.
The total direct commitment by the Company to Permira IV was 2.4 billion, of which 56.8% has been called as at 31December 2012.
The Company elected to cap its commitment at 60% of the total.
At 31 December 2012 the Company had anuncalled commitment to Permira IV of 77.0 million 2011: 84.4 million, which will only be called to finance follow-on investments and fees.
The terms of these arrangements require that future distributions from the realisation of portfolio companies receivable by those investors in Permira IV that elected to cap their commitments will be reduced by 25%, such benefit to accrue totheLimited Partners that did not elect to cap their uncalled commitments.
The Companys loan facility part expired in January 2013 100.0 million with the remainder expiring in December 2015 150.0 million.
The Senior Notes in issue mature between July 2013 to July 2015 see note 19.
Theconvertible loan notes are repayable in 2016.
The Board manages liquidity risk by regularly and rigorously reviewing cash ow forecasts and available funding options.
Commitments to fund investments are reviewed by the Board.
Valuation market price risk The Companys exposure to valuation risk comprises mainly movements in the value of its underlying investments.
A breakdown of the Fund portfolio is given on pages 26 and 27 and a detailed analysis of the 10 largest underlying companies is given on pages 6 to 7.
Inaccordance with the Companys accounting policies, set out on pages 56 to 60, all underlying investments are valued at fair value bythe Directors in accordance with the current International Private Equity and Venture Capital IPEV Valuation Guidelines.
The IPEV Guidelines contain detailed methodology setting out best practice with respect to valuing unquoted investments.
It should be noted thata large proportion of the Companys underlying investee companies are expected to be unquoted and therefore the valuation SVG Capital plc B Busine usines ss s Co Cor rp po or ra at te e F Fiinancial financial Co Com mp pa an ny y Annual report Ov Ove er rv viie ew w rev reviiew ew inf info or rm ma at tion ion inf info or rm ma at tion ion inf info or rm ma at tion ion 2012 89 28 Risk continued ofsuch companies involves exercising judgement.
The Company does not ordinarily hedge against movements in the value of these investments.
Uncertainty arises as a result of future changes in the valuation of the Companys underlying investments, the majority of which are unquoted, and the effect changes in exchange rates may have in the sterling value of these investments.
Development-stage equity investments and early-stage equity investments, by their nature, involve uncertainty as to the ultimate value likely to be realised onthe disposal of those investments, particularly as their unquoted nature means that a ready market may not exist for them.
As an indication of the valuation risk facing the Company, in 2012 the Group benefited from gains on its investment portfolio totalling 146.3million 2011: gains of 138.5 million.
The Companys sensitivity to valuation risk will be affected by changes in the Companys levels of borrowing see note 19 and liquidity, asapproved by the Board.
It will also be affected by leverage in the funds in which we invest and the local currency denomination of such funds, which is considered separately under currency risk.
At 31 December 2012, a 10% movement in the valuation of the Groups aggregate investments designated as fair value through profit and loss would result in a 9.5% 2011: 11.3% change in Shareholders funds.
Valuation risk will be affected by leverage in the underlying investee companies.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the valuations of the 10 largest underlying investee companies, which had an aggregate valuation before providing for carried interest of791.2 million or 94.1% of the gross management buyout fund portfolio valuation 2011: 917.7 million or 90.9%, the results ofwhich are set out in the table below.
Hypothetical Hypothetical fair value fair value 10% writeFair value 10% uplift down million million million 31 December 2012 Gross valuation of 10 largest investee companies 791.2 947.0 635.2 Change in valuation effect on income 19.7% 19.7% 31 December 2011 Gross valuation of 10 largest investee companies 917.7 1,113.5 751.6 Change in valuation effect on income 21.3% 18.1% All investments are included in the balance sheet at fair value.
Quoted companies are valued based on market prices.
For such investments, a 10% movement in the valuation basis will have a 10% impact on fair value.
For unquoted investments valued on a different basis, such as earnings-related, a 10% movement in the earnings oftheinvestee company will not necessarily result in a 10% change in fair value, because of other factors such as the level of debt utilised by the investee companies The Board manages valuation risk by reviewing and approving the valuation of the private equity fund portfolio.
Holdings risk In certain circumstances, the Company may wish to transfer its holdings in particular funds.
In a majority of the funds in which the Company will invest, the general partner, trustee or manager has the ultimate right, similar to that exercisable by a board of a private company, to refuse to register the transfer of an interest.
While the Company has no reason to believe that any request for the transfer of an interest would be refused, it is of course conceivable that the general partners, trustees or managers overriding duciary duty could result in it refusing to register a particular transfer proposed by the Company.
Concentration risk Atpresent, the Company holds a significant proportion of its investments in private equity funds that are managed or advised by Permira.
At 31 December 2012, the value of the Top 10 largest underlying holdings represented 91.4% of the gross management buyout portfolio 31 December 2011: 90.9%.
The future performance of the Group in the short term will therefore be largely dependent on the future performance of the Permirafunds in which weinvest see note 29 for an indication of the Groups exposures.
Investors should also be aware that greater concentration of the investment portfolio presents a risk.
The performance of Permira funds depends to a significant extent upon the skills and experience of Permira and its personnel.
The continued service of these individuals is not guaranteed and there can be no assurance that key individuals can be replaced with equally skilled and experienced professionals by Permira.
Therefore, the departure ofone or several key investment professionals or partners at Permira may have an adverse effect on the performance of the Company and the value and trading price of the Ordinary Shares.
Each fund investment proposition is considered by the Board in accordance witha structured investment process.
This includes presentations from the manager of the proposed fund, extensive due diligence, consideration of the terms and conditions for investment in the fund, consideration of the Groups own cash ows and future commitments and a review of the effect of any such investment on portfolio concentration.
During the year the Companys shareholders passed a resolution to change the Companys Investment Objective to achieve wider assetdiversity and better exibility in the management of the Companys cash ows.
Over time, the Company will evolve from aconcentrated, single manager investor to one that is more diversied, and will look to build on our Permira portfolio through commitments to a limited number of other leading private equity funds.
In time, the Company may also make co-investments alongsidefunds.
SVG Capital plc Annual report 90 2012 Notes to the accounts continued 28 Risk continued Interest rate risk The Groups revenue will be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates since a large portion of its income ordinarily derives from money market instruments and bank deposit interest.
It also pays interest on its Senior Notes and drawings on the loan facility that may be taken out from time to time.
The Companys primary objective is to achieve capital returns from its investments and, as such, the main exposure to interest rate riskisindirect, through its impact on the valuation of the private equity funds, although it is not possible to quantify such effects.
Interestrates are one of the key determinants of economic growth.
At a more specic level, interest rates and credit spreads also have animportant role in the ability of private equity funds to secure profitable deals, as many transactions are partly nanced by debt.
Theeffect of interest rate changes on the valuation of investments and debt forms part of valuation risk, which is considered separately.
A At 31 December 2012, the Group held investments in AAA-rated money market funds valued at 179.8 million 2011: 112.0 million, earning interest at market rates.
The money market funds are redeemable on less than 24 hours notice.
Other oating rate financial assets comprised cash at bank or short-term deposits.
A At 31 December 2012, the Group had 150.3 million 2011: 162.0 million of Senior Notes in issue and 92.8 million 2011: 90.9million of convertible loan notes see note 19.
Interest rate risk on the Senior Notes and the Bonds is mitigated as the Bonds and most of the Notespay xed rates of interest.
The weighted average interest rate payable on the Notes and the swaps amounted to 8.8% at 31December 2012. Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group unless otherwise disclosed.
The Group is subject to credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to cash and cash equivalents is represented by carrying value as at the balance sheet date.
The Groups cash and deposits are held with a variety of counterparties.
Cash equivalents at the year end comprised money market funds with a variety of counterparties, each fund having a credit rating ofAAA.
Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk directly since the majority of its assets and liabilities are denominated in foreign currency and their sterling value can be signicantly affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
The Company does not normally hedge against f foreign currency movements affecting the value of its investments, but takes account of this risk when making investment decisions.
TheGroup has a 250 million loan facility which, if drawn, would also act as a hedge against the currency risk on the value of its euro-denominated assets.
The Group also has issued Senior Notes of US$184.0 million.
As described in note 19 the Company has taken out a currency swap to effectively convert $180.0 million of Senior Notes into a euro exposure, which acts as a partial hedge against the currency risk on the value of its euro-denominated assets.
A fair value asset of 2.4 million 2011: 4.4 million has been recognised in respect of this.
The Group has also entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate against movements in exchange rates.
These contracts are primarily to provide a cash ow hedge against euro-denominated investment management and advisory fees receivable by subsidiary companies in 2012 and 2013.
The total outstanding under such contracts at 31 December 2012 amounted to a sale of 33.5million 2011: 33.9 million in exchange for 28.0 million 2011: 28.4 million.
A fair value loss of 0.9 million 2011: gain of 0.7million was taken to equity in respect of these contracts as a result of the appreciation of euro against sterling since the contracts were entered into.
Contracts have maturities of between 3 and 21 months.
A A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the effect of exchange rate uctuations on the value of shareholders funds, the results of which are set out in the table below.
Hypothetical Hypothetical Equity value value shareholders 10% 10% funds depreciation appreciation million million million 31 December 2012 Equity shareholders funds 1,073.0 1,161.5 984.4 Change in shareholders funds effect on income 8.2% -8.3% 31 December 2011 Equity shareholders funds 1,038.7 1,131.8 945.7 Change in shareholders funds effect on income 9.0% 9.0% Capital risk management The objective of the Company is to provide shareholders with long-term growth in capital.
In pursuing this long-term objective, the Board has a responsibility for ensuring the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.
It must therefore maintain an appropriate capital structure through varying market conditions.
This involves the ability to: issue and buy-back share capital within limits set by the shareholders in general: and borrow monies in the short and long term.
Changes to ordinary share capital are set out in note 21.
Borrowings are set out in notes 18 and 19.
SVG Capital plc B Busine usines ss s Co Cor rp po or ra at te e F Fiinancial financial Co Com mp pa an ny y Annual report Ov Ove er rv viie ew w rev reviiew ew inf info or rm ma at tion ion inf info or rm ma at tion ion inf info or rm ma at tion ion 2012 91 28 Risk continued General risks associated with investment in private equity Investment in private equity involves a high degree of risk.
The Group invests in private equity through its exposure to buy-out and development capital funds.
Such investments are illiquid and as such may be difficult to realise, particularly within a short timeframe.
TheDirectors seek to maintain a diversied portfolio of investments to mitigate these risks, although the portfolio does remain concentrated with respect to private equity fund managers and also to vintage as explained in concentration risk on page 89.
Default risk A funds documentation generally provides for certain penalties in the event that an investor in the fund fails to meet a call.
There istypically a grace period during which interest accrues on the unpaid amount.
If the default continues, the investor may become subject to various sanctions, including termination of the investors right to participate in future investments, loss of its entitlement to distributions or income but not its liability for losses or expenses, mandatory transfer or sale of its interest, continuing liability for the principal and interest in respect of the defaulted amount and partial or total forfeiture of the investors interest.
In addition, the general partner or manager may have other rights and remedies including legal remedies.
The investor may also remain liable for future calls in respect of the relevant fund as and when they are made.
There can be no assurance as to the price which may be achieved in any mandatory transfer or sale following a default on a call.
Certain funds give the general partner or manager the right to proceed directly to forfeiture proceedings following notice and continuation of default by an investor.
In the case of a forfeiture, the share of the fund held by the defaulting investor would generally be allocated among the general partner or manager and the remaining investors.
Inaddition, the investor may remain liable for the defaulted amount.
Consequently, any failure by SVG Capital to meet any call may have a material adverse effect on the value of SVG Capitals interest in a fund and or on the net asset value of SVG Capital and or on SVG Capitals ability to generate returns for its Shareholders.
In addition, a failure to meet a call may result in a cross-default under the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility which could result in a substantial loss.
If another investor or limited partner in a fund in which the Company holds an interest were to default on a call, this may result in the other investors including the Company in the fund in question becoming subject to individual calls of a larger amount but subject to each investors original capital commitment and, in addition, the fund in question may make fewer or smaller or more highly leveraged investments.
Any such occurrence may lead to a reduction in the diversication of the Companys interests in underlying portfolio companies, increase volatility, increase the Companys nancing requirements and may have an adverse effect on the Companys business and prospects.
Investment holding risk period Investment in private equity requires a long-term commitment with no certainty of return.
Many of the investments made by the Group are illiquid holdings in buy-out and development capital funds and, in some cases, may not be capable of being realised in atimely manner or at all.
The timing of cash distributions, if any, made by the buy-out and development capital funds is uncertain andunpredictable.
Recent market conditions have made it more difficult for general partners or other managers of private equity funds to dispose of investments at attractive prices and otherwise on favourable terms.
The Company considers that, although signs of improvement are present, it is likely that these difficult circumstances will ease but continue in the short to medium term and, while they do continue, itmay be that the returns of the Company from its investments will be reduced and or delayed.
Any further material change in the economic environment, including a continued slow-down in economic growth and or changes in interest rates or foreign exchange rates, could have a negative impact on the performance and or valuation of the underlying portfolio companies.
SVG Capitals performance may be affected by prolonged weakness or further deterioration in public markets and by market events, which may impact on not only its quoted portfolio companies but also the public company comparable earnings multiples used to value unquoted portfolio companies.
A further consequence of the subdued market for portfolio companies exits in that the general partners, or other managers, of the private equity funds in which the Company holds interests are more likely to delay disposing of portfolio companies until market conditions improve.
As a result, the Company is likely to receive distributions in respect of its investments at a slower rate than may have otherwise been the case in a more favourable economic environment.
In addition to this, a fund managers ability to realise its interest incertain portfolio companies in whole or in part may be subject to contractual restrictions such as shareholder lock-up arrangements.
Itmay therefore be the case that the Company decides to pay calls with debt finance rather than relying upon receiving distributions from investments which it has made which may therefore increase the Companys borrowings and risk and volatility for shareholders.
There can therefore be no assurance as to whether, and if so how much, the value of the Companys assets will grow or the timing ofreturn if any.
Investments in buy-out and development capital funds may be difficult to value and dispositions may require a lengthy time period since there is only a limited market for secondary sales of private equity investments.
Further, sales or other transfers of interests in buy-out anddevelopment capital funds sometimes require the written consent of the general partner of the fund, the granting of which is at its discretion.
Accordingly, the Group may not be able to sell its investments in buy-out and development capital funds attheir net asset value.
The Companys portfolio is concentrated with respect to private equity fund managers as explained below and this may impact the ability to place a large holding of a single fund on the secondary market at any one time.

The value of the portfolio companies held by the funds in which the Company holds interests may be affected by uncertainties, such aspolitical developments, changes in government policies, regulations, laws, taxation, currency uctuations, currency repatriation and other restrictions, in some of the countries in which the funds may invest.
The Company, directly or indirectly through the funds in which the Company holds interests, may also be exposed to these risks.
Passive investor with limited recourse The Company is generally a passive investor and has limited powers under the governing documents of the funds in which it holds interests.
The funds concerned are, within certain broad parameters, generally authorised to follow broad investment guidelines and, TVCKFDU UIFSFUP BSF BCMF UP JOWFTU JO HFPHSBQIJFT JOEVTUSJFT BOE JOWFTUNFOU PQQPSUVOJUJFT BU UIFJS EJTDSFUJPO 5IF $PNQBOZ EPFT OPU SFWJFX FBDI QSPQPTFE JOWFTUNFOU BOE JT TVCKFDU UP DFSUBJO MJNJUFE FYDFQUJPOT VOBCMF UP SFGVTF UP NFFU B $BMM XJUIPVU TVGGFSJOH UIF consequences of a default.

The Companys recourse in the event of poor performance of the funds concerned is highly restricted.
Removal of the general partner or manager of a fund generally requires a high level of investor participation and consent with the relevant threshold often being set so as to require the consent of holders of 75% of the capital committed to the fund in question.
The Company is unlikely tobeable to procure such participation and consent on its own and it may therefore be very difficult to remove a general partner or manager of a fund in which the Company invests such that the Company may potentially nd itself locked into an under-performing fund.
The fund documentation relating to Permira IV contains no provision for the removal of the general partner or manager by vote of the limited partners save in circumstances involving severe culpability.
Even if those circumstances were to arise, which the Company considers to be unlikely, the consent of a special majority of limited partners would be required which the Company is unlikely to beable to procure on its own.
Once the Company has made a capital commitment to a fund, it may be difficult to terminate its participation or reduce its capital commitment even if the investment returns arising from that fund are poor or not competitive.
Regulatory risks The regulatory environment in which the Group operates is increasingly complex and the Group faces a number of regulatory risks.
Breaches of regulations such as the UK Listing Authoritys Listing Rules could lead to a number of detrimental outcomes and damage theGroups reputation.
Breaches of controls by service providers could also lead to reputational damage or loss.
Key regulatory risks havebeen identied and appropriate monitoring of such risks is undertaken regularly on behalf of the Board.
Three of the Companys subsidiaries: SVG Advisers Limited, SVG Investment Managers Limited and SVG Managers Limited areauthorised and regulated by the Financial Services Authority.
Certain other subsidiaries are regulated by foreign regulators.
There are a number of legislative initiatives to increase regulation of the alternative investments sector including private equity.
Suchlegislation has not been nalised, however there is a risk that such legislation, when enacted, could materially affect the business ofthe Company or its subsidiaries.
Taxation risk Any change in the taxation legislation or practice could affect the value of the Groups investments and as a result, its performance.
Abreach of Section 1158 of the United Kingdom Corporation Tax Act 2010 could result in the Group being subject to corporation tax on realised gains on the sale of portfolio investments which would have a material adverse effect on the net returns earned by SVG Capital.
However, the Group has strict controls in place to ensure that it complies with the requirements of Section 1158 and contracts with specialist tax advisers to provide advice on changes to tax regulation and practice.
However, there can be no guarantee in advance that the Company will satisfy the conditions for approval by HMRC as an investment trust under Section 1158 or that the Company will not become a close company, which would result in its being unable to qualify as an investment trust for tax purposes.
