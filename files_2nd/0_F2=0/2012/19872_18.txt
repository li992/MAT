Taxation UK Commercial Property Trust Limited owns four Guernsey tax exempt subsidiaries, UK Commercial Property GP Limited GP, UK Commercial Property Holdings Limited UKCPH, UK Commercial Property Estates Limited UKCPEL and UK Commercial Property Estates Holdings Limited UKCPEH formerly SCP Group Limited SCP.
GP and UKCPH are partners in a Guernsey Limited Partnership the Partnership and own six Jersey Property Unit Trusts.
UKCPEL owns three Jersey Property Unit Trusts.
The Partnership, UKCPH and UCKPEL own a portfolio of UK properties and derived rental income from those properties.
As the Partnership, GP, UKCPH, UKCPEL and UKCPEH are considered tax transparent in the UK, their taxable results are liable to UK income tax at the rate of 20 per cent on their respective net rental income.

Although this payment relates to the year ended 31 December 2012, under International Financial Reporting Standards it will be accounted for in the year ending 31 December 2013.
Basic and diluted Earnings per Share The earnings per share EPS are based on the net loss for the year of 4,954,000 2011: profit 53,045,000 and on 1,197,348,858 2011: 1,197,348,858 Ordinary Shares, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year excluding Treasury Shares.
As there are no dilutive instruments outstanding, basic and diluted earnings per share are identical.
The EPRA EPS for the year ended 31 December 2012 is 4.47p per share 2011: 4.32p.

Market value is determined by reference to market based evidence, which is the amount for which each asset could be exchanged between a knowledgeable, willing buyer and a knowledgeable, willing seller in an arms length transaction as at the valuation date.
The market value of these investment properties amounted to 1,021,170,000 2011 1,016,450,000.
The difference between the market value and the fair value at 31 December 2012 consists of accrued income relating to the pre-payment for rent-free periods recognised over the life of the lease totalling 5,638,000 2011 4,675,000 which is separately recorded in the accounts as a current asset.
The Group has entered into leases on its property portfolio as lessor See note 18 for further information.
No one property accounts for more than 15 per cent of the gross assets of the Group.
All leasehold properties have more than 60 years remaining on the lease term.
There are no restrictions on the realisability of the Groups investment properties or on the remittance of income or proceeds of disposal.
However, the Groups investments comprise UK commercial property, which may be difficult to realise.
Property and property related assets are inherently difficult to value due to the individual nature of such property.
As a result, valuations are subject to substantial uncertainty.
There is no assurance that the estimates resulting from the valuation process will reflect the actual sales price even where the actual sales occur shortly after the valuation date.
In addition to the above, the property portfolio fair value as at 31 December 2012 is based on the following: The Estimated Net Annual Rent for each property, which is based on the current rental value of each of the properties, which reflects the terms of the leases where the property, or part of the property, are let at the date of valuation.
If the property, or parts thereof, are vacant at the date of valuation, the rental value reflects the rent the valuer considers would be obtainable on an open market letting as at the date of valuation.
The valuer has assumed that all rent reviews are to be assessed by reference to full current rents.
Also there is an assumption that all tenants will meet their obligations under their leases, and are responsible for insurance, payment of business rates, and all repairs, whether directly or by means of a service charge.
The valuer has not made any adjustments to reflect any liability to taxation that may arise on disposal, nor any costs associated with disposals incurred by the owner.
The valuer assumes an initial yield in the region of 5 to 7 per cent for the majority of the properties, with the reversionary yield being in the region of 5 to 8 per cent.
The property valuer takes account of deleterious materials included in the construction of the investment properties in arriving at its estimate of open market valuation when the Investment Manager advises of the presence of such materials.
The majority of the leases are on a full repairing basis and as such the Group is not liable for costs in respect of repairs or maintenance to its investment properties.
Sensitivity analysis The table below presents the sensitivity of the valuation to changes in the most significant assumptions underlying the valuation of investment property.

The bank loan is secured on a proportion of the property portfolio of the Group.
Under bank covenants related to the loan the Company is to ensure that at all times: The loan to value percentage does not exceed 50 per cent this is defined as the ratio of the loan compared to the aggregate of the open market property valuations plus any cash deposits : 40 UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED The qualifying adjusted net rental income for any calculation period any 3 month period is not less than 175 per cent of the projected finance costs for that period: No single tenant accounts for more than 30 per cent of the total net rental income: The five largest tenants do not account for more than 50 per cent of total net rental income: No single property accounts for more than 25 per cent of the gross secured asset value this is defined as the sum of the value of the properties as stated in the latest valuations plus any cash deposits : The Company met all the covenant tests during the year.
Interest rate exposure has been hedged by the purchase of two interest rate swap contracts.
The hedge has been achieved by matching the notional amount of the swaps with the loan principal and matching the swap term to the loan term.
Interest on the swaps is receivable at a variable rate calculated on the same LIBOR basis as for the bank loan as detailed below but excluding margins and payable at a fixed rate of 3.0 per cent per annum on 42.1 million and 2.215 per cent per annum on 37.9 million respectively.
The fair value of the liability in respect of the two interest rate swap contracts at 31 December 2012 is 4 million 2011: 4 million which is based on the marked to market value.
Both swaps are deemed effective for accounting purposes.
Interest is payable by the Company at a rate equal to the aggregate of LIBOR, mandatory costs of the Bank and a margin.
The applicable margin depends on the ratio of all loans made available to the Company under the Bank Facility or otherwise to the Gross Assets Value, expressed as a percentage the LTV Percentage.
Gross Assets Value takes into account the value of the properties and any other assets held by the Company and the Guarantors currently UK Commercial Property Holdings Limited, UK Commercial Property GP Limited and UKCPT Limited Partnership as well as unsecured cash.
If the LTV percentage is greater than 5 per cent and does not exceed 10 per cent, the margin is 0.55 per cent per annum.
If the LTV percentage is greater than 10 per cent and does not exceed 40 per cent, the margin is 0.60 per cent per annum.
If the LTV percentage is greater than 40 per cent and does not exceed 50 per cent, the margin is 0.70 per cent per annum.
As at 31 December 2012 the applicable margin was 0.60 per cent.
ii Barclays Facility The Group also has a seven year 150 million facility, maturing in May 2018, with Barclays Bank plc taken out in May 2011.
As at 31 December 2012 this entire loan was drawn down.
The bank loan is secured on the property portfolio held by UKCPEL.
Under bank covenants related to the loan UKCPEL is to ensure that at all times: The loan to value percentage does not exceed 60 per cent Interest cover at the relevant payment date is not less than 160 per cent UKPCEL met all covenant tests during the year.
Interest rate exposure has been hedged by the purchase of three interest rate swap contracts.
As at 31 December 2012 the Group had in place interest rate swaps totalling 150 million with Barclays Bank plc 2011: 100 million.
All of these interest rate swaps effectively hedged the current drawn down loan with Barclays Bank plc 2011: 60 million.
The remainder of the interest rate swap in 2011 was deemed as an ineffective swap under International Financial Reporting Standards.
Interest on the swaps is receivable at a variable rate calculated on the same LIBOR basis as for the bank loan as detailed below but excluding margins and payable at a fixed rate of 2.9925 per cent per annum on the 100 million swap, 1.2 per cent per annum on the 30 million swap and 1.893 per cent per annum on the 20 million swap.
The fair value of the liability in respect of the interest rate swap contracts at 31 December 2012 is 12.6 million 2011: 9.3 million which is based on the marked to market value.
Interest is payable by UKPCEL at a rate equal to the aggregate of LIBOR, mandatory costs of the Bank and a margin.
The applicable margin depends on the ratio of all loans made available to the Company under the Bank Facility or otherwise to the market value of the property portfolio in UKCPEL expressed as a percentage the LTV Percentage as well as any cash generated from the sale of one of these properties.
If the LTV percentage is equal to or less than 25 per cent, the margin is 1.60 per cent per annum.
If the LTV Percentage is greater than 25 per cent and does not exceed 35 per cent, the margin is 1.70 per cent per annum.
If the LTV Percentage is greater than 35 per cent and does not exceed 40 per cent, the margin is 1.85 per cent per annum.
If the LTV Percentage is greater than 40 per cent and does not exceed 45 per cent, the margin is 1.95 per cent per annum.
If the LTV Percentage is greater than 45 per cent and does not exceed 60 per cent, the margin is 2.0 per cent per annum.
As at 31 December 2012 the applicable margin was 1.70 per cent.
iii Total Facilities As at 31 December 2012 the Group therefore had in place aggregate interest rate swap instruments totalling 230 million all of which were deemed to be effective hedges.
The revaluation of these swaps at the year end resulted in a loss arising on interest rate swaps of 3.3 million 2011: 12 million.
Of the total loss arising on interest rate swaps, 3.3 million related to effective hedge instruments 2011: 8.3 million and none of this UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 41 Notes to the Accounts continued 2011: 3.7 million related to ineffective hedge instruments.
The ineffective portion of the loss is recognised in the profit and loss and the effective portion is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps as at 31 December 2012 amounted to 16.6 million 2011: 13.4 million.
Based on current yield curves 4.6 million of this value relates to the next 12 months and is therefore classified as a current liability.
The remainder is classified as a long term liability.

Financial Instruments and Investment Properties The Groups investment objective is to provide Ordinary Shareholders with an attractive level of income together with the potential for income and capital growth from investing in a diversified UK commercial property portfolio.
Consistent with that objective, the Group holds UK commercial property investments.
The Groups financial instruments consist of cash, receivables and payables that arise directly from its operations and loan facilities and swap instruments.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and interest rate risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing its risk exposure.
These policies are summarised below and remained unchanged during the year.
42 UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED Fair values The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is not materially different from the carrying value in the financial statements.
Fair value hierarchy The following table shows an analysis of the fair values of financial instruments recognised in the balance sheet by level of the fair value hierarchy: 31 December 2012 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total fair value 000 000 000 000 Interest rate swap - 16,634 - 16,634 31 December 2011 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total fair value 000 000 000 000 Interest rate swap - 13,362 - 13,362 Explanation of the fair value hierarchy: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 Use of a model with inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable market data.
Level 3 Use of a model with inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The fair value of the derivative interest rate swap contract is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using current market interest rates and yield curves over the remaining term of the instrument.
Real Estate Risk The Group has identified the following risks associated with the real estate portfolio: The cost of any development schemes may increase if there are delays in the planning process.
The Group uses advisers who are experts in the specific planning requirements in the schemes location in order to reduce the risks that may arise in the planning process: A major tenant may become insolvent causing a significant loss of rental income and a reduction in the value of the associated property see also credit risk below.
To reduce this risk, the Group reviews the financial status of all prospective tenants and decides on the appropriate level of security required via rental deposits or guarantees: The exposure of the fair values of the portfolio to market and occupier fundamentals.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that the market value of properties and financial instruments will change.
A 10 per cent increase in the fair value of the investment properties held as at 31 December 2012 would have increased net assets available to shareholders and increased the net profit by 101.6 million 2011: 101.2 million.
A 10 per cent decrease in the fair value would have reduced net assets available to shareholders and net profit by 101.6 million 2011: 101.2 million.
The calculations above are based on investment property valuations at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole, nor reflective of future market conditions.
UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 43 Notes to the Accounts continued Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or counterparty will be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the Group.
At the reporting date, the maturity of the Groups financial assets was: Financial Assets 2012 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Cash and Cash equivalents 77,062 - - 77,062 Rent receivable 1,240 - - 1,240 Other debtors 200 63 827 1,090 78,502 63 827 79,392 Financial Assets 2011 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Cash and Cash equivalents 60,945 - - 60,945 Rent receivable 513 - - 513 Other debtors - 145 561 706 61,458 145 561 62,164 In the event of default by a tenant, the Group will suffer a rental shortfall and incur additional costs, including legal expenses, in maintaining, insuring and re-letting the property until it is re-let.
The Board receives regular reports on concentrations of risk and any tenants in arrears.
The Investment Manager monitors such reports in order to anticipate and minimise the impact of defaults by tenants.
The Company has a diversified tenant portfolio.
The maximum credit risk from the rent receivables of the Group at 31 December 2012 is 1,240,000 2011: 513,000.
The Group holds rental deposits of 827,000 2011: 561,000 as collateral against tenant arrears defaults.
There is no credit risk associated with the financial liabilities of the Group.
All of the cash is placed with financial institutions with a credit rating of A or above.
A sum of 14.9 million 2011: 12.7 million of the year end cash balance is held in the Ignis Liquidity Fund, which is a money market fund and has a triple A rating.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of a financial institution may cause the Groups ability to access cash placed on deposit to be delayed or limited.
Should the credit quality or the financial position of the banks currently employed significantly deteriorate, the Investment Manager would move the cash holdings to another financial institution subject to restrictions under the loan facility.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in realising assets or otherwise raising funds to meet financial commitments.
While commercial properties are not immediately realisable, the Group has sufficient cash resources to meet liabilities.
The Groups liquidity risk is managed on an ongoing basis by the Investment Manager and monitored on a quarterly basis by the Board.
In certain circumstances, the terms of the Groups bank loan entitles the lender to require early repayment, and in such circumstances the Groups ability to maintain dividend levels and the net asset value attributable to the ordinary shares could be adversely affected.
44 UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED At the reporting date, the maturity of the Groups liabilities was: Financial Liabilities 2012 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Bank loan and interest rate swap 2,252 6,755 264,389 273,396 Other creditors 18,678 - 827 19,505 20,930 6,755 265,216 292,901 Financial Liabilities 2011 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Bank loan 1,546 4,639 176,395 182,580 Other creditors 21,152 - 561 21,713 22,698 4,639 176,956 204,293 Interest rate risk The cash balance as shown in the Balance Sheet, is its carrying amount and has a maturity of less than one year.
Interest is receivable on cash at a variable rate ranging from 0.2 per cent to 0.9 per cent at the year end and deposits are re-priced at intervals of less than one year.
An increase of 1 per cent in interest rates as at the reporting date would have increased the reported profit by 771,000 2011: increased the reported profit by 1,009,000.
A decrease of 1 per cent would have reduced the reported profit by 771,000 2011: decreased the reported profit by 1,009,000.
The effect on equity is nil excluding the impact of a charge in retained earnings as a result of a change in net profit.
As the Companys bank loans have been hedged by interest rate swaps, these loans are not subject to interest rate cashflow risk.
As at 31 December 2012 the Company had in place a total of 230 million of interest rate swap instruments 2011: 180 million.
The values of these instruments are marked to market and will change if interest rates change.
It is estimated that an increase of 1 per cent in interest rates would result in the swap liability falling by 9.2 million 2011: 8.7 million which would increase the reported profit by the same amount.
A decrease of 1 per cent in interest rates would result in the swap liability increasing by 9.2 million 2011: 9.8 million which would decrease the reported profit by the same amount.
The other financial assets and liabilities of Group are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate cashflow risk.
Foreign Currency Risk There was no foreign currency risk as at 31 December 2012 or 31 December 2011 as assets and liabilities of the Group are maintained in pounds Sterling.
Capital Management Policies The Group considers that capital comprises issued ordinary shares, net of shares held in Treasury, and long-term borrowings.

Gearing is defined as gross borrowings divided by total assets less current liabilities.
The Groups gearing policy is set out in the Investment Policy section of the Report of the Directors.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed regulatory capital requirements but does have banking covenants on which it monitors and reports on a quarterly basis.
Included in these covenants are requirements to monitor loan to value ratios which is calculated as the amount of outstanding debt divided by the market value of the properties secured.
The Groups Loan to value ratio is shown below.
