b Refer to note 1 d c Rio Tinto gained control of the non Oyu Tolgoi LLC OT assets of Ivanhoe Mines Limited Ivanhoe on 24 January 2012 when its share reached 51 per cent.
The Group had gained control of OT in December 2010 by virtue of contractual rights which permit the exercise of control over certain policies and activities of OT.
On 2 August 2012, Ivanhoe was renamed Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. Turquoise Hill.
Within newly consolidated operations, US$2,678 million represents non-controlling interests in the non OT assets, of which US$1,439 million relates to the 49 per cent non-controlling interests portion of net loans receivable from Rio Tinto Group companies.
Refer to note 38. d Rio Tinto acquired a controlling interest in Richards Bay Minerals RBM, with consolidation effective from 3 September 2012 the acquisition date.
US$224 million within newly consolidated operations relates to the provisional fair value of non-controlling interests at acquisition date.
Refer to note 38. e The majority of the adjustments to equity held by Rio Tinto arise from Chalcos acquisitions of shares in Simfer Jersey Limited, a Rio Tinto subsidiary, as set out in the Simandou Joint Development Agreement SJDA.
The Chalco consortium made a payment of US$1.35 billion on 24 April 2012 in exchange for an equity interest of 47 per cent in Simfer Jersey Limited, reimbursing Rio Tinto for historic project costs.
The transfer on 24 April 2012 resulted in an adjustment to retained earnings attributable to owners of Rio Tinto of US$1.05 billion, relating to the amount received over the carrying value of Rio Tintos interest transferred.
f Equity issued to holders of non-controlling interests include US$0.9 billion of proceeds from a rights offering by Turquoise Hill, and cash calls of US$480 million following the transfer described in e, which resulted in the Chalco consortium being issued with additional equity interest in proportion to its interest.
g The purchase of Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique RTCM, formerly Riversdale Mining Limited Riversdale, in 2011 was treated as a step acquisition.
Non-controlling interests of US$1,498 million arose at the acquisition date, when Rio Tintos share in Riversdale reached 52.6 per cent.
These non-controlling interests reversed as Rio Tinto increased its interests in Riversdale to 100 per cent.
An amount of US$479 million has been recognised directly in equity in relation to Rio Tintos interests purchased after the acquisition date, representing the excess of consideration paid to acquire these additional shareholdings, over non-controlling interests acquired.
Refer to note 38. h A reduction of US$339 million in non-controlling interests arose as Rio Tinto increased its economic share in OT through the acquisition of additional interests in Ivanhoe.
Adjustments to retained earnings attributable to owners of Rio Tinto of US$129 million related to the aggregate excess of consideration paid for the additional investments in Ivanhoe, over the value of the additional economic share acquired in OT.
Refer to note 38. i In relation to the Groups purchase of an additional stake in Coal & Allied, adjustments to retained earnings of US$185 million were made for the excess of consideration paid to acquire shareholdings of US$45 million from non-controlling interests.
j Rio Tinto consolidated Oyu Tolgoi LLC on 15 December 2010 following the signing of a new agreement with Turquoise Hill formerly Ivanhoe Mines Limited.
