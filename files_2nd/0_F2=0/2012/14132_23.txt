5 Segmental analysis The group has two reportable segments: Severn Trent Water and Severn Trent Services.
The key factor determining the identication of reportable segments is the regulatory environment in which the businesses operate.
Severn Trent Water is subject to economic regulation by Ofwat and operates under a licence to provide water and sewerage services within a dened geographical region in England and Wales.
Severn Trent Services is not subject to economic regulation and operates in markets in the USA, Europe and Asia.
The Severn Trent Executive Committee STEC is considered to be the groups chief operating decision maker.
The reports provided to STEC include segmental information prepared on the basis described above.
Details of Severn Trent Waters operations are described on pages 8 to 21 of the Business Review and those of Severn Trent Services on pages 24 to 30.
Transactions between reportable segments are included within segmental results, assets and liabilities in accordance with group accounting policies.
These are eliminated on consolidation.
The group has a large and diverse customer base and there is no significant reliance on any single customer.

Overview Business review Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Other information Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 95 Notes to the group financial statements 15 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the Severn Trent Employee Share Ownership Trust whichare treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the companys shares during the year.
Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations are calculated on the basis of profit from continuing operations attributable to the equity holders of the company.
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data: Earnings 2012 2011 m m Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share from operations profit for the period attributable to the equity holders of the company 171.8 272.6 Number of shares 2012 2011 m m Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic earnings per share 237.0 236.7 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares share options and LTIPs 1.2 1.1 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted earnings per share 238.2 237.8 Adjusted earnings per share 2012 2011 pence pence Adjusted basic earnings per share 88.9 105.6 Adjusted diluted earnings per share 88.5 105.1 Adjusted earnings per share gures are presented for continuing operations.
These exclude the effects of deferred tax, losses on financial instruments and exceptional items in both 2012 and 2011.
The directors consider that the adjusted gures provide a useful additional indicator of performance.
The denominators used in the calculations of adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share are the same as those used in the unadjusted gures set out above.
Adjustments to earnings The adjustments to earnings that are made in calculating adjusted earnings per share are as follows: 2012 2011 m m Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 171.8 272.6 Adjustments for exceptional items 50.9 21.4 current tax related to exceptional items at 26% 2011: 28% 1.5 4.7 losses on financial instruments 67.7 14.2 deferred tax 78.2 53.6 Earnings for the purpose of adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share 210.7 249.9 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 96 Notes to the group financial statements 16 Goodwill 2012 2011 m m Cost At 1 April 68.3 70.6 Exchange adjustments 0.5 2.3 At 31 March 67.8 68.3 Impairment At 1 April Amounts written off 22.9 At 31 March 22.9 Net book value At 31 March 44.9 68.3 Goodwill impairment tests Goodwill is allocated to the groups cash-generating units CGUs identied according to country of operation and business segment.
A summary of the goodwill allocation by CGU is presented below: 2012 2011 m m Severn Trent Services Water Purication US 26.3 26.2 Contract Operations 11.7 11.6 UK Laboratories 12.0 Services Italy 2.2 8.2 Services Spain formerly Apliclor 4.7 10.3 44.9 68.3 The group has reviewed the carrying value of goodwill for impairment in accordance with the policy stated in note 2m.
The value in use calculations use cash ow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period.
The key assumption underlying these budgets is revenue growth.
Management of each CGU determines assumptions based on past experience, current market trends and expectations of future developments.
Cash ows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using an estimated nominal growth rate stated below.
The growth rate does not exceed the long term average growth rate for the economy in which the CGU operates.
The assumptions used in relation to growth rates beyond the five year period and discount rates were: Nominal growth rate Discount rate 2012 2011 2012 2011 % % % % Water Purication US 3.5 3.0 5.8 7.3 Contract Operations 3.5 3.0 5.9 7.7 UK Laboratories 3.0 8.0 7.3 Services Italy 3.0 3.0 11.0 11.0 Services Spain 3.1 3.0 8.9 11.6 The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.
The discount rates used are pre-tax and reect specic risks relating to the CGU.
As a result of the impairment review, the group has recorded the following impairment losses in the Severn Trent Services segment.
In each case the recoverable amount has been determined by calculating the value in use of the asset using the assumptions described above.
Overview Business review Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Other information Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 97 Notes to the group financial statements 16 Goodwill continued In UK Laboratories, towards the end of the year, and early in the new financial year, management was informed that certain contracts from utilities companies would not be renewed.
Management is developing a plan to reduce the scale of this business accordingly.
The businesss cash ow projections have been amended to take these changes into account and as a result an impairment loss of 12.0 million has been recognised in these financial statements.
The group has discontinued any further investment in resources to support future market growth in Italy and continues to take a cautious view as to the medium term business opportunities in that country.
As a result an impairment loss of 5.7 million has been recognised in these financial statements in respect of Services Italy.
In Services Spain the group has taken a cautious view of the prospects for growth both in the short and medium term.
As a result an impairment loss of 5.2 million has been recognised in these financial statements.
Changes in the growth rate outside the five year period or in the discount rate applied to the cash ows may cause a CGUs carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount.
However, in the opinion of the directors, the changes in growth rate or discount rate that would be required to reduce the recoverable amounts of Water Purication US and Contract Operations below their carrying value are not reasonably possible and therefore no sensitivity analysis has been provided.

iii Background The group operates a number of dened benefit pension schemes in the UK, covering the majority of UK employees.
The dened benefit pension schemes are funded to cover future salary and pension increases and their assets are held in separate funds administered by trustees.
The trustees are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneciaries.
A formal actuarial valuation of each scheme is carried out on behalf of the trustees at triennial intervals by an independent professionally qualied actuary.
Under the dened benefit pension schemes, members are entitled to retirement benets calculated as a proportion varying between 1 30 and 1 80 for each year of service of their salary for the final year of employment with the group or, if higher, the average of the highest three consecutive years salary in the last ten years of employment.
On 11 May 2011, Severn Trent announced that it was consulting with its 6,000 plus UK employees on proposed changes to its pension arrangements, which would see all existing pensions replaced by one new dened contribution pension scheme.
Following the period of consultation and after discussion with the schemes trustees, final proposals have been accepted by the employees representatives and the trustees.
A new dened contribution pension scheme has been established and from 1 April 2012 new employees have been auto enrolled into this scheme.
The dened benefit pension schemes will close to future accrual on 31 March 2015 and members of the dened benefit pension scheme will then become members of the new dened contribution pension scheme.
This resulted in an exceptional net curtailment gain of 23.1 million being recognised in the income statement.
The existing dened contribution pension scheme will also be replaced by the new pension arrangements with effect from 1 April 2015 and it is proposed to automatically enrol those employees who are not currently members of a Severn Trent scheme from 1 April 2013.
The final salary sections of the pension schemes listed below are closed to new entrants and the age prole of scheme participants is expected to rise and hence service costs are also expected to rise until the schemes are closed to future accrual.
The UK dened benefit pension schemes and the date of their last formal actuarial valuation are as follows: Date of last formal actuarial valuation Severn Trent Pension scheme STPS 31 March 2010 Severn Trent Mirror Image Pension Scheme 31 March 2009 The STPS is by far the largest of the groups UK dened benefit schemes.
The group has an obligation to pay pensions to a number of former employees, whose benets would otherwise have been restricted by the Finance Act 1989 earnings cap.
Provision for such benets amounting to 8.6 million 2011: 8.1 million is included as an unfunded scheme within the retirement benefit obligation.

The discount rate is set by reference to AA rated sterling 17 year corporate bonds.
iv Actuarial assumptions continued The expected rate of return on scheme assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the period for returns over the life of the benefit obligation.
For gilts and corporate bonds the expected rates of return are based on market yields.
For equities, property and hedge funds, a risk premium has been added to the gilt rate.
The mortality assumptions adopted are based on mortality tables applicable to the sex and year of birth of individual members, with allowance for the CMI 2010 future improvements and a 0.5% trend.
For men the assumptions are based on 110% of the SAPS S1NMA L tables and for women on 78% of the S1NFA L tables.
These have been based on a mortality investigation carried out in conjunction with the valuation of the STPS as at 31 March 2010 on behalf of the trustees.
The life expectancies implied by the mortality assumptions adopted at each year end are as follows: 2012 2011 Years Years Age to which current pensioners aged 65 are expected to live men 87.5 87.4 women 91.1 91.0 Age to which future pensioners aged 45 at the balance sheet date are expected to live men 88.0 88.0 women 91.9 91.8 The calculation of the scheme liabilities is sensitive to the actuarial assumptions and in particular to the assumptions relating to discount rate, price ination and mortality.
The following table summarises the estimated impact on scheme liabilities and service cost resulting from changes to key actuarial assumptions whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decrease increase by 35 million Price ination Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 30 million Mortality Increase in life expectancy by 1 year Increase by 45 million Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 106 Notes to the group financial statements 27 Retirement benefit schemes continued a Dened benefit pension schemes continued v Contributions to the schemes Contribution rates are set in consultation with the trustees for each scheme and each participating employer.
It is anticipated thatnormal contributions to the scheme in the year ended 31 March 2013 will be unchanged and agreed lump sum deficit contributions include a payment of 10 million per annum in cash and a further 8 million per annum through an asset backed funding arrangement.

Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 108 Notes to the group financial statements 32 Financial instruments a Capital management The groups principal objectives in managing capital are: to access a broad range of sources of finance to obtain both the quantum required and lowest cost compatible with the need for continued availability: to maintain an investment grade credit rating: and to maintain a exible and sustainable balance sheet structure.
The group seeks to achieve a balance of long term funding or commitment of funds across a range of funding sources at the best possible economic cost.
The group does not have a specic gearing target but seeks to maintain gearing at a level consistent with its capital management objectives described above.
The groups dividend policy is a key tool in achieving its capital management objectives.
This policy is reviewed and updated in line with Severn Trent Waters five year price control cycle and takes into account, inter alia: the planned investment programme: the appropriate gearing level achieving a balance between an efficient cost of capital: and retaining an investment grade credit rating and delivering an attractive and sustainable return to shareholders.
The directors have reviewed the groups capital structure, taking into account the funding requirements over the remainder of AMP5, the proportion of index linked debt in issue and historical and forecast RPI, and concluded that there is an opportunity to deliver additional returns to shareholders.
The board has therefore proposed a return to shareholders of 150 million, which equates to 63.00 pence per share.
The group monitors future funding requirements and credit market conditions to ensure continued availability of funds.
On 24 January 2012, the group issued a 250 million bond with a coupon of 4.875% and a maturity of 30 years.
On 27 January 2012, the group purchased 150.6 million of a 200 million bond maturing in 2014 through a tender offer launched simultaneously with the bond issue.
The costs of the tender offer gave rise to an exceptional finance charge of 16.5 million, representing the difference between the purchase price and the carrying value of the bond.
A new five year 500 million Revolving Credit Facility was agreed in October 2011.
This replaced the existing 500 million Revolving Credit Facility.
A new 10 year 100 million bilateral bank facility was agreed in March 2012.
This facility was drawn on 18 April 2012.

Discount rates are derived from yield curves based on quoted interest rates and are adjusted for the groups credit risk.
Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet In 2012 and 2011, all the fair values of financial instruments that were measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, were based on observable inputs other than quoted prices for identical instruments, dened as Level 2 in IFRS 7.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash ows estimated and discounted based on the application of yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
Cross currency swaps and forward exchange contracts are valued by reference to quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the contracts.
e Financial risk factors The groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency and interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and ination risk.
The groups overall risk management programme addresses the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce potential adverse effects on the groups financial performance or position.
Financial risks are managed by a central treasury department Group Treasury under policies approved by the board of directors.
Group Treasury identies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the groups operating units.
The board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specic areas such as exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to changes in exchange rates and interest rates.
The groups policy is that derivative financial instruments are not held for trading.
i Market risk The principal market risk that the group is exposed to is uctuations in interest rates.
Interest rate risk The groups income and operating cash ows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The groups interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to cash ow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at xed rates expose the group to fair value interest rate risk.
The groups policy is to maintain 45% to 90% of its net debt in xed rate instruments.
At 31 March 2012 74.0% of the groups net debt was at xed rates 2011:75.9%.
The group manages its cash ow interest rate risk by using oating to xed interest rate swaps.
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from oating rates to xed rates.
Under the terms of the interest rate swaps, the group agrees with other parties to exchange, mainly semi-annually, the difference between xed contract and oating rate interest rates calculated by reference to the agreed notional principal amounts.
The group has entered into a series of long dated interest rate swaps to hedge future debt.
Economically these act to x the interest cost of debt within the group which is denominated as oating rate, but do not achieve hedge accounting under the strict criteria of IAS 39.
This has led to an 80.3 million charge 2011:charge of 15.7 million in the income statement.
Some of the groups debt is index-linked, that is its cost is linked to changes in the Retail Price Index RPI.
This debt provides an economic hedge for Severn Trent Waters revenues and Regulatory Capital Value that are also RPI linked under its regulatory regime.

However, since substantially all of the groups profits and net assets arise from Severn Trent Water which has very limited and indirect exposure to changes in exchange rates, the sensitivity of the groups results to changes in exchange rates is not material.
The groups net debt includes foreign currency borrowings, primarily denominated in yen and euros.
The groups policy is to managethe exchange risk arising from foreign currency borrowings by entering into cross currency swaps or forward contracts withexternal parties.
The groups gross and net currency exposures arising from currency borrowings are summarised below: Japanese Czech Sterling Euro US Dollar Yen Krona 2012 m m $m Bn CZKm Borrowings by currency 3,473.5 720.6 50.0 30.0 1,970.0 Cross currency swaps hedge accounted 184.0 19.9 50.0 20.0 1,970.0 Cross currency swaps not hedge accounted 617.6 700.0 10.0 4,275.1 0.7 Cash 276.9 5.3 22.1 Net currency exposure 3,998.2 4.6 22.1 Japanese Czech Sterling Euro US Dollar Yen Krona 2011 m m $m Bn CZKm Borrowings by currency 3,536.5 721.4 50.0 31.0 1,970.0 Cross currency swaps hedge accounted 188.9 19.9 50.0 21.0 1,970.0 Cross currency swaps not hedge accounted 617.7 700.0 10.0 4,343.1 1.5 Cash 284.9 12.1 31.6 Net currency exposure 4,058.2 10.6 31.6 The euro and US dollar net cash balances relate to operations in which the euro or US dollar is the functional currency.

Exchange risks relating to such operations are not material but are managed centrally by Group Treasury through forward exchange contracts to buy or sell currency.
ii Credit risk Operationally the group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
It has policies in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history, other than in Severn Trent Water Limited, whose operating licence obliges itto supply domestic customers even in cases where bills are not paid.
Amounts provided against accounts receivable and movements on the provision during the year are disclosed in note 22.
For nancing purposes, derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high credit quality financial institutions.
Thegroup has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
Credit risk analysis At 31 March the aggregate credit limits of authorised counterparties and the amounts held on short term deposits were as follows: Credit limit Amount deposited 2012 2011 2012 2011 m m m m AAA 20.0 300.0 0.1 54.8 Double A range 150.0 450.0 111.1 81.2 Single A range 450.0 525.0 146.5 112.6 620.0 1,275.0 257.7 248.6 The fair values of derivative assets analysed by credit ratings of counterparties were as follows: Derivative assets 2012 2011 Rating m m Double A range 44.6 100.9 Single A range 118.0 91.5 162.6 192.4 iii Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity management implies maintaining sufficient cash balances and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Group Treasury manages liquidity and exibility in funding by monitoring forecast and actual cash ows and the maturity prole of financial assets and liabilities, and by keeping committed credit lines available.
At the balance sheet date the group had committed undrawn borrowing facilities expiring as follows: 2012 2011 m m Within 1 year 41.7 12 years 458.3 25 years 500.0 After more than 5 years 100.0 600.0 500.0 Overview Business review Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Other information Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 115 Notes to the group financial statements 32 Financial instruments continued e Financial risk factors continued iii Liquidity risk continued Non-derivative financial instruments analysed by maturity date The following tables detail the groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative net financial liabilities.
The information presented is based on the earliest date on which the group can be required to pay and represents the undiscounted cash ows including principal and interest.
The principal is revalued at xed intervals and is linked to movements in the retail price index.
Interest payments are made biannually based on the revalued principal.
The principal repayment equals the revalued amount at maturity.
The calculations above are based on forward ination rates at the balance sheet date.

Hedge accounting is adopted for such instruments where the criteria set out in IAS 39 are met.
i Fair value hedges The group raises debt denominated in currencies other than sterling principally yen and euro.
Cross currency swaps are entered into at the time that the debt is drawn down to swap the proceeds into sterling debt bearing interest based on LIBOR in order to mitigate the groups exposure to exchange rate uctuations.
The terms of the receivable leg of the swap closely match the terms ofthe underlying debt hence the swaps are expected to be effective hedges.
At the year end the amounts of cross currency swaps designated as fair value hedges were as follows: Notional principal amount Fair value 2012 2011 2012 2011 m m m m US dollar 27.0 27.0 7.6 6.6 Euro 11.4 11.4 7.8 6.0 Yen 98.4 103.3 59.0 60.8 Czech krona 47.2 47.2 20.8 24.7 184.0 188.9 95.2 98.1 ii Cash ow hedges The group has entered into interest rate swaps under which it has agreed to exchange the difference between xed and oating interest rate amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on future cash ow exposures arising from issued variable rate debt.
The group also entered into a number of interest rate contracts with future start dates during the AMP5 regulatory period.
Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on debt which is highly probable to be issued over the AMP5 period to fund Severn Trent Waters capital programme and have been accounted for as cash ow hedges.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the balance sheet date is determined by discounting the future cash ows using the yield curve prevailing at the balance sheet date and the credit risk inherent in the contract.
The interest rate swaps primarily settle net on a biannual basis.
The oating rate on the interest rate swaps is six months LIBOR.
Details of interest rate swaps that have been accounted for as cash ow hedges are summarised below: Average Notional contract xed principal interest rate amount Fair value 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 Period to maturity % % m m m m Less than 10 years 10-20 years 5.07% 5.07% 492.3 493.0 91.6 17.8 More than 20 years 5.07% 5.07% 492.3 493.0 91.6 17.8 The group has entered into a series of energy swaps under which it has agreed to exchange the difference between xed and market prices of electricity at six-monthly intervals up to March 2015.

The vesting period commences before the grant date.
Performance in the vesting period prior to the grant date is taken into account in determining the fair value of the award.
The fair value of the LTIP awards made during the year was calculated using the Black-Scholes method using the principal assumptions set out below: Assumptions 2012 Expected volatility Severn Trent Plc 27% Expected dividend yield 4.7% Risk free rate 1.57% Expected volatility is based on historical weekly volatility over a three year period.
Weekly volatility in the observed data was between 25% and 31%.
The risk free rate is derived from yields at the grant date of gilts of similar duration to the LTIP awards.
The dividend yield is calculated using the expected dividend for the year divided by the share price at the date of grant.
The fair value of the LTIP awards made during the previous year was calculated using the Monte Carlo method using the principal assumptions set out below: Assumptions 2011 Expected volatility Severn Trent Plc 27% Comparator group 47% Correlation between Severn Trent Plc and comparator group 32% Expected volatility is based on historical weekly volatility over a three year period.
For the July 2010 LTIP award the comparator group is the group of companies ranked 51150 in the FTSE index excluding investment trusts.
The volatility of the comparator companies, the correlation between Severn Trent Plc and the comparator companies, and performance over the portion of the performance period that had elapsed at the date of grant was taken into account when modelling the TSR performance condition.
Dividends paid on shares during the vesting period are accumulated during the vesting period and released subject to achievement of the performance condition in the same manner as the underlying shares.
As a result a dividend yield assumption is not required.
Details of the basis of the LTIP schemes are set out in the remuneration report on page 59 and 60.

Matching shares may be awarded at a maximum ratio of one matching share for every one deferred share and are subject to a three year vesting period.
During the year matching shares were awarded at a ratio of 0.5 to 1.
Matching shares are subject to total shareholder return over three years measured relative to the companies ranked 51150 bymarket capitalisation in the FTSE Index excluding investment trusts.
This replicates the LTIP performance condition for the July2010 award.
The number of shares subject to an award will increase to reect dividends paid through the performance period on the basis of such notional dividends being reinvested at the then prevailing share price.
Awards will normally vest as soon as the Remuneration Committee determines that the performance conditions have been met provided that the participant remains in employment at the end of the performance period.

Following a hearing in the Commercial Court in Belgium in February 2010 in relation to a claim from Veolia Proprete S. A. Veolia arising from the sale of Biffa Belgium to Veolia in 2006, the Court rendered judgment in favour of the group on 1 April 2010 and declared all of Veolias claims to be unfounded.
Veolia has led an appeal against this decision, however, the group considers that Veolias case remains unfounded and no provision has been recorded in respect of this matter.
The group is not aware of any other liability that is likely to result from these guarantees and indemnities that has not been provided for in these financial statements.
