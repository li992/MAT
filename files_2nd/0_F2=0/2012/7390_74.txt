DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Currency derivatives The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash ows.
The Group is party to a variety of foreign currency forward contracts and options in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The instruments purchased are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Groups principal markets.
At the balance sheet date, the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group was committed to have been translated at 31 December exchange rates as below.

At 31 December 2012, the fair value of the Groups currency derivatives, some of which were designated as effective cash ow hedges, was a liability of $7,000 2011: a liability of $187,000.
The movement in fair value in the year resulted in a gain of $180,000 2011: loss of $270,000 : which has been reected in other comprehensive income.
These amounts are based on market values of equivalent instruments at thebalance sheet date.
The fair value of currency derivatives designated as ineffective cash ow hedges was $Nil 2011: $Nil held at fair value through profit and loss.
The movement in fair value in the year has not resulted in any profit or loss being recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2012 2011: loss of $8,000 in respect of such derivatives.
