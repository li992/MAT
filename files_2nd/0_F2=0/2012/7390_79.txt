CONTINGENT LIABILITIES A contingent liability existed at the balance sheet date in respect of guarantees and letters of credit totalling $120,554,000 2011: $82,494,000.
The integrated nature of the Groups worldwide operations, involving significant investment in research and strategic manufacturing at a limited number of locations, with consequential cross-border supply routes into numerous end-markets, gives rise to complexity and delay in negotiations with revenue authorities as to the profits on which individual Group companies are liable to tax.
Disagreements with, and between, revenue authorities as to intra-Group transactions, in particular the price at which goods and services should be transferred between Group companies in different tax jurisdictions, has the potential to produce conicting claims from revenue authorities as to the profits to be taxed in individual territories.
In common with many other companies in the pharmaceutical industry, the Group is involved in various legal proceedings considered typical to its business, including litigation relating to employment, product liability and other commercial disputes.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS Equity settled share option scheme During the year ended 31 December 2012, the Company had one stock option compensation scheme settled by equity instruments, with four separate grant dates.
The options over these instruments are settled in equity once exercised.
Details of the grants under the scheme are shown below: The estimated fair value of each The share share option price at Exercise Expected Number granted grant date price Expected Expected average Risk-free Date of grants granted $ $ $ volatility dividend yield contractual life interestrate 4-Nov-2008 85,000 1.14 5.45 5.45 34.90% 1.21% 4.0 years 4.11% 29-Apr-2008 1,041,500 2.61 9.19 9.19 31.50% 0.08% 3.8 years 4.54% 13-Oct-2005 1,600,000 0.74 4.50 4.50 26.20% 6.67% 7.5 years 4.54% 12-Oct-2004 9,520,000 0.35 0.91 0.91 44.80% 3.85% 7.5 years 4.22% All of the general employees share option plans have a ten-year contractual life and vesting conditions of 20% per year for five years beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date.
The estimated fair value of each share option granted in the general employee share option plans was calculated by applying a binomial option pricing model.
It was assumed that each option tranche will be exercised immediately after the vesting date.
Further details of the general employee share option plan are as follows: 2012 2011 Weighted Weighted Number of average exercise Number of average exercise share options price in $ share options price in $ Outstanding at 1 January 743,200 7.24 2,382,618 3.33 Exercised during the year 179,800 6.74 1,634,318 1.55 Expired during the year 23,700 9.18 5,100 5.45 Outstanding at 31 December 539,700 7.33 743,200 7.24 Exercisable at 31 December 378,600 6.85 433,000 6.06 The cost of the equity settled share option scheme of $104,000 2011: $296,000 has been recorded in the consolidated income statement as part of general and administrative expenses.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was $11.25.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2012 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of less than one year.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three to four years.
Long-term incentive plan During the year ended 31 December 2012, the Company had a long-term incentive plan LTIP settled by equity instruments, with nine separate grant dates.
Under the LTIP, conditional awards and nil cost options are granted which vest after three years subject to a total shareholder return TSR performance condition.
This condition measures the Groups TSR relative to a comparator group of other pharmaceutical companies.
In this case, the vesting schedule dictates that 20% of awards vest for median performance and 100% for upper quartile performance, with pro-rata vesting in between these points.
No awards vest for performance which is below the median.
For awards made from 2010, the TSR condition applies in respect of 50% of the award and financial metrics apply in respect of the remaining 50%.
For further details see the Remuneration Committee Report.
152 HIKMA PHARMACEUTICALS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2012 35.
Forfurther details see the Remuneration Committee Report.
The estimated fair value of each share option granted in the LTIP was calculated by applying the Monte Carlo simulation methodology.
For awards made from 2010, 50% of the award is subject to a TSR performance condition which was valued by applying the Monte Carlo simulation methodology, the remaining 50% of the award is subject to financial metrics which are valued by applying the Black-Scholes model.
The exercise price of the share award is nil.
