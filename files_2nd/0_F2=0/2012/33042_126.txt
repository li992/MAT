Retirement benefit plans continued A similar mechanism applies based on the deficit agreed at the 2017 valuation.
If this exceeds the outstanding recovery plan with the remaining 2011 recovery plan worth about 1.1bn in 2017, based on 2011 discount rates, BT will provide extra payments dependent on the level of the deficit as shown in the table below: Additional contributions payable 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 m m m m m m m deficit above remaining 2014 recovery plan present value nil 1.0bn 197 203 209 215 207 213 2.0bn 341 351 362 373 358 369 381 2.9bn or above 393 404 416 429 670 670 670 A new agreement would cover additional contributions if these are required.
If the deficit at 2014 is below the value of the remaining 2011 recovery plan, no additional deficit contributions are necessary and the remaining recovery plan will be revised.
Likewise, if the deficit at 2017 is below the remaining recovery plan at that time.
Other protection of BTPS member benets In the unlikely event that the group were to become insolvent there are additional protections available to members: the Crown Guarantee which was granted when the group was privatised in 1984 and which applies upon the winding up of BT.
The scope and extent of the Crown Guarantee is being claried by the Trustee through the courts.
The decision of the High Court issued in October 2010 was that the Crown Guarantee can cover members who joined before and after privatisation.
The Court confirmed that any payments to be made by the Government must be measured on an annuity basis.
In a further High Court decision issued in December 2011, it was decided that the Crown Guarantee does not cover the benets of members accrued while in service with companies that participate in the BTPS other than BT nor does it cover benefit augmentations granted by BT.
The judgments may still be subject to appeal.
the Pension Protection Fund PPF may take over the scheme and pay benets to members not covered by the Crown Guarantee.
There are limits on the amounts paid by the PPF and this would not give exactly the same benets as those provided by the scheme.
Share-based payments The company has savings-related share option plans for its employees and those of participating subsidiaries, further share option plans for selected employees and a stock purchase plan for employees in the US.
It also has several share plans for executives.
All share-based payment plans are equity settled and details of these plans and an analysis of the total charge by type of award is set out below.

This price is usually set at a 20% discount to the market price for fiveyear plans and 10% for three-year plans.
The options must be exercised within six months of maturity of the savings contract, otherwise they lapse.
Similar plans operate for BTs overseas employees.

Share-based payments continued Incentive Share Plan Under the Incentive Share Plan, participants are only entitled to these shares in full at the end of a three-year period if the company has met the relevant pre-determined corporate performance measures and if the participants are still employed by the group.
In 2012 the corporate performance measures for the ISP were amended: 40% of each share award is linked to a total shareholder return target TSR for a comparator group of companies from the beginning of the relevant performance period: 40% is linked to a three-year cumulative free cash ow measure, and 20% to growth in underlying revenue excluding transit.
For ISP awards made in 2011 and 2010, 50% of each share award was linked to a TSR target for a comparator group of companies from the beginning of the relevant performance period and 50% was linked to a three-year cumulative free cash ow measure.
Deferred Bonus Plan Under the Deferred Bonus Plan, awards are granted annually to selected employees of the group.
Shares in the company are transferred to participants at the end of three years if they continue to be employed by the group throughout that period.
In accordance with the terms of the ISP and DBP, dividends or dividend equivalents earned on shares during the conditional periods are reinvested in company shares for the potential benefit of the participants.
