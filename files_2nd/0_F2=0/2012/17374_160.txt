WPP ANNUAL REPORT 2012 233 About the artist Erica Hestu Wahyuni he artist Erica Hestu Wahyuni isknown in her native Indonesia as Arts most playful child.
Its T an epithet which neatly sums up herwork, with its nave, colourful scenes which have evolved directly from the styleshe first developed as a child.
Today shehasbecome one of Indonesias most recognizable and collectable artists, with her work increasingly appearing ininternational art sales.
