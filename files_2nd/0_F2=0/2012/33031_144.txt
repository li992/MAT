Financial statements Operational and statistical information The following tables present operational and statistical information related to production, drilling, productive wells and acreage.
Figures include amounts attributable to assets held for sale.
 The following table shows crude oil and natural gas production for the years ended 31 December 2012, 2011 and 2010. a Productionfortheyear Europe North South Africa Asia Australasia Total America America Rest of Rest of North Rest of UK Europe US America Russia Asia Subsidiaries b Crude oil thousand barrels per day 2012 86 23 390 1 28 202 139 27 896 2011 113 32 453 2 39 190 138 25 992 2010 137 40 594 7 54 246 119 32 1,229 c Natural gas million cubic feet per day 2012 414 8 1,651 13 2,097 590 633 787 6,193 2011 355 13 1,843 14 2,197 558 618 795 6,393 2010 472 15 2,184 202 2,544 556 574 785 7,332 Equity-accounted entities BP share b Crude oil thousand barrels per day 2012 80 863 217 1,160 2011 90 865 210 1,165 2010 98 856 191 1,145 c Natural gas million cubic feet per day 2012 394 734 72 1,200 2011 392 699 34 1,125 2010 399 640 30 1,069 a Production excludes royalties due to others, whether payable in cash or in kind, where the royalty owner has a direct interest in the underlying production and the option and ability to make lifting and sales arrangements independently.
b Crude oil includes natural gas liquids and condensate.
c Natural gas production excludes gas consumed in operations.
 The following tables show the number of gross and net productive oil and natural gas wells and total gross and net developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas acreage in which the group and its equity-accounted entities had interests as at 31 December 2012.
A gross well or acre is one in which a whole or fractional working interest is owned, while the number of net wells or acres is the sum of the whole or fractional working interests in gross wells or acres.
Productive wells are producing wells and wells capable of production.
Developed acreage is the acreage within the boundary of a field, on which development wells have been drilled, which could produce the reserves: while undeveloped acres are those on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities, whether or not such acres contain proved reserves.
b Includes approximately 2,557 gross 1,549 net multiple completion wells.
If one of the multiple completions in a well is an oil completion, the well is classified as an oil well.
c Undeveloped acreage includes leases and concessions.
Supplementary information on oil and natural gas unaudited 285 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2012 Operational and statistical information continued  The following table shows the number of net productive and dry exploratory and development oil and natural gas wells completed or abandoned in the years indicated by the group and its equity-accounted entities.
Productive wells include wells in which hydrocarbons were encountered and the drilling or completion of which, in the case of exploratory wells, has been suspended pending further drilling or evaluation.
A dry well is one found to be incapable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities to justify completion.
Suspended development wells and long-term suspended exploratory wells are also included in the table.
