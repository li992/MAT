IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was reissued in October 2010.
The Group is required to adopt this standard for the year ended 31 December 2015.
IFRS 9 addresses the classification and measurement of financial instruments.
The key requirements of IFRS 9 are that at initial recognition, all financial instruments are measured at fair value with different requirements for subsequent measurement for debt and equity instruments.
The standard provides relief from the requirement to restate comparative financial statements for the effect of applying IFRS 9.
The International Accounting Standards Boards Annual Improvements Project published in May 2012 made minor amendments to a number of standards, primarily with a view to removing inconsistencies and clarifying wording.
The amendments to these standards are effective from 1 January 2013.
The Group has decided not to early adopt the above standards, and is currently assessing their impact on its financial statements.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRICs in issue but not yet effective that are expected to have a significant impact on the Group.

2 Spain issued online gaming licences for all products except slots effective from 1 June 2012.
The Spanish tax authority has required that online operators with customers in Spain pay taxes retrospectively under two historic laws that previously were not applied to offshore online gaming.
Having completed a self-assessment in accordance with the Spanish tax authoritys requirements, the Group has incurred costs of 2.2 million including surcharges, interest and related professional fees in relation to these retrospective taxes.
These costs have been recorded in the Digital segment.
3 In 2011, the impairment loss related to Ireland shops.
4 Business restructuring costs in the prior year related mainly to the reorganisation of the Group to a new cross-channel, centralised structure.

Included within adjustments in respect of prior periods is a tax credit of 21.7 million and associated interest credit of 8.1 million, in respect of the settlement.
In the year ended 31 December 2011, the Group made progress in the resolution of historic tax matters and as a result reduced the level of the tax creditor required.
The Group also reassessed the availability of suitable profits of its subsidiaries against which agreed losses can be offset in the foreseeable future and reduced the level of deferred tax asset recognised.
The impact of these was a net 10.9 million reduction in the income tax charge for the year.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as there is insufficient certainty that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of temporary differences may be deducted.
There are no significant taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associated undertakings and joint ventures.
The Chancellor, in the Autumn Statement on 5 December 2012, announced a further 1% reduction in the main rate of corporation tax, with effect from 1 April 2014.
This is in addition to the 2% reduction announced in the Budget on 21 March 2012.
The standard rate of Corporation Tax was reduced from 26% to 24% from 1 April 2012, and there will be progressive annual reductions to 23% and 21% with effect from 1 April 2013 and April 2014, respectively.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are calculated at the substantively enacted rate of 23%.
The reduction to 23%, effective 1 April 2013, was substantively enacted on 3 July 2012.
Whilst detailed calculations have not been prepared at this stage, it is estimated that the impact of the remaining annual corporation tax rate reductions would be to reduce the value of the groups deferred tax liabilities at the balance sheet date by approximately 6.5 million, and to reduce the value of the Groups deferred tax assets at the balance sheet date by approximately 2.1 million.

2 The 2011 impairment of 10.2 million related to European Retail.
Goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill relates to the consideration exceeding the fair value of net assets of business combinations including the deferred tax liability arising on statutory licence acquisitions.
Licences comprises the cost of acquired betting shop licences.
The acquired betting shop licences are not amortised as they are considered to have an indefinite life for a combination of reasons: Ladbrokes is a leading operator in well-established markets: there is a proven, sustained demand for bookmaking services: existing law acts to restrict entry: and Ladbrokes has a very strong track record of renewing its betting permits and licences at minimal cost.
Software relates to the cost of software acquisition and the capitalised costs in respect of internally generated software.
The customer relationships intangible asset relates to the Groups acquisition of its former partner in the Nordic region.
Ladbrokes plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financial statements Financial statements 81 14 Impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are tested annually for impairment at each reporting date by comparing the carrying amounts of these assets with their recoverable amounts being the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment by allocating its carrying amount to groups of cash generating units CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
If the recoverable amount of a group of CGUs exceeds its carrying amount, the group and any goodwill allocated to that group would be regarded as not impaired.
The carrying amounts of goodwill by segment are as follows: 2012 2011 m m Goodwill UK Retail 35.4 35.4 European Retail 12.7 13.0 Digital 1.7 49.8 48.4 No impairments were identified in both years.
Licences Licences have been allocated to the individual UK and European Retail CGUs that are expected to benefit from the assets.
Each CGU represents the lowest level within the Group at which the licences are monitored for internal management purposes which in the majority of instances is an individual shop.
The carrying value of licences at 31 December 2012 was 488.5 million 2011: 487.9 million allocated as 324.1 million to UK Retail 2011: 323.4 million and 164.4 million to European Retail 2011: 164.5 million.
Basis on which recoverable amount has been determined The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
These are based on budgets approved by management for the next three years extrapolated thereafter using a 2.5% growth rate 2011: 2.5%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations The key assumptions taken into account by management are the amounts staked, the gross win margin and the discount rate applied.
The estimated amounts staked and gross win margin are based upon historic experience, managements best estimate of future trends and performance taking account of industry sources.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections for CGUs in UK Retail is 11.4% 2011: 11.2% and in European Retail is between 10.3% and 11.4% 2011: between 10.0% and 11.5%.
The recoverable amounts of certain individual European Retail CGUs were below their carrying amounts at 31 December 2011 and accordingly an impairment loss of 10.2 million was recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31December 2011, within the Depreciation and amounts written off non-current assets line, as an exceptional item.
The recoverable amount of individual CGUs is sensitive to changes in cash flows or discount rate.
Change in the cash flow projections or the discount rate would trigger a further impairment loss.
For example, an increase of 0.5% in the pre-tax discount rate would have resulted in an impairment loss of approximately 1.2 million 2011: 0.7 million for UK Retail and 4.8 million 2011: 3.1 million for European Retail, or a reduction in projected cash flows of 5% would have resulted in an impairment loss of approximately 0.9 million 2011: 0.5 million for UK Retail and 3.4 million 2011: 2.4 million for European Retail.

Ladbrokes plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financial statements Financial statements 87 23 Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups treasury function provides a centralised service for the provision of finance and the management and control of liquidity, foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The function operates as a cost centre and manages the Groups treasury exposures to reduce risk in accordance with policies approved by the Board.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, overdrafts, loan notes, bonds, financial guarantee contracts, and cash and short-term deposits, together with certain derivative financial instruments.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables, trade payables and accruals that arise directly from its operations.
The Group enters into derivative transactions, such as forward foreign exchange contracts, currency swaps and interest rate swaps.
The purpose of these transactions is to assist in the management of the Groups financial risk and to generate the desired effective currency and interest rate profile.
At 31 December 2011, the Group had an interest rate swap with a nominal value of 131.3 million and a fair value of 0.1 million.
This swap was settled on 11 July 2012, and at 31 December 2012 the Group had no significant derivatives.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken other than betting and gaming transactions.
The Groups exposure to ante post betting and gaming transactions is not significant.
On 11 July 2012, the Group repaid the remaining balance on the 7.125% bond of 131.4 million using existing facilities.
The Group has a 225 million 7.625% sterling bond due in 2017.
The main financial risks for the Group are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
The Group also monitors the market price risk arising from all financial instruments.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on interest bearing loans and borrowings and on cash and cash equivalents.
The Groups policy for the year ended 31 December 2012 was to maintain a minimum of 25% 2011: 25% of total borrowings at fixed interest rates to reduce its sensitivity to movements in variable short-term interest rates.
At 31 December 2012, 222.4 million or 54.8% 2011: 222.3 million or 46.3%, after taking account of interest rate swaps of the Groups gross borrowings were at fixed rates.
Interest on financial instruments at floating rates is re-priced at intervals of less than six months.
Interest on financial instruments at fixed rates is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
Interest rate sensitivity The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in interest rates on income and equity for the year when this movement is applied to the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities.
Profit before tax Equity 2012 2011 2012 2011 Effect on: m m m m 100 basis points increase 0.9 1.7 200 basis points increase 2.0 3.5 The sensitivity has been estimated by applying the basis points movement to the carrying value of the financial assets and liabilities, subject to interest at floating rates, held by the Group at the year end.
Due to current low interest rates, any further decline would not have a material impact on income and equity for the year.
As such, sensitivity to a decrease in interest rates has not been presented.
Foreign currency risk Other than the translation of foreign currency subsidiaries, there is no significant foreign currency exposure.
The Group had no foreign currency borrowings at 31 December 2012 2011: nil.
Credit risk The Group is not subject to significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread across a large number of counterparties and customers.
It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis.
Any changes to credit terms are assessed and authorised by senior management on an individual basis.
The Groups High Rollers division consists of individuals who place sizeable stakes.
The Group manages this activity and the associated risk exposure by utilising senior management expertise to manage the levels of stakes placed.
Of the 3.3 million 2011: 4.5 million trade receivables balance, 2.8 million 2011: 4.0 million relates to the Groups Core Telephone Betting and High Rollers divisions.
com ar2012 Financial statements 88 Statutory reports and financial statements continued Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 23 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents and a loan to a joint venture, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
Credit risk in respect of cash and cash equivalents is managed by restricting those transactions to banks that have a defined minimum credit rating and by setting an exposure ceiling per bank.
The Group also has exposure to credit risk arising from the financial guarantee contracts provided by the Group.
This risk is partly mitigated by the indemnity received from Hilton Hotels Corporation for any loss incurred in connection with these guarantees.
For further detail of these guarantees refer to note 24.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of borrowings with a range of maturities.
The Groups policy on liquidity is to ensure that there are sufficient medium-term and long-term committed borrowing facilities to meet the medium-term funding requirements.
At 31 December 2012, there were undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 348.5 million 2011: 405.4 million.
Total committed facilities had an average maturity of 3.9 years 2011: 4.9 years.
The total gross contractual undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities, including interest payments, fall due as follows.
Cash flows in respect of financial guarantee contracts reflect the probability weighted cash flows.
The maximum exposure is described in note 24.

Cash flow hedges In the prior year, 0.5 million of losses, which had been deferred in equity, were reclassified to the consolidated income statement as an exceptional finance expense.
The Group no longer has any cash flow hedges.
Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments The Group previously used interest rate swaps to manage its fair value exposure to interest rate movements by swapping borrowings from fixed to floating rates in accordance with the policy of the Group.
At 31 December 2012, the Group had no interest rate swaps.
At 31 December 2011, the Group had contracts for interest rate swaps with nominal values of 131.0 million and a fair value of 0.1 million.
These swaps were not designated as fair value hedges under IAS 39 but were economic hedges of the Groups borrowings.
Capital risk management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains a credit rating that enables the Group to raise funds at an economic interest rate and to maintain healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Group monitors capital using a net debt to EBITDA ratio.
The target range is less than 2.0 2011: less than 3.0 times net debt to EBITDA ratio.
The ratio at 31 December 2012 was 1.3 1.5 adjusted to remove profit from High Rollers and at 31 December 2011 was 1.9 1.9 adjusted to remove loss from High Rollers.

Included in trade and other payables are 5.2 million of ante post liabilities 2011: 8.6 million.
Other current financial liabilities are deferred revenues associated with the fair value of reward points issued: both are classified as level 3 financial instruments as their fair value is measured using techniques where the significant inputs are not based on observable market data.
Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in the consolidated income statement.
Financial guarantee contracts, included within other non-current financial liabilities, are classified as level 3 financial instruments, as their fair value is measured using techniques where the significant inputs are not based on observable market data.
Further information about financial guarantee contracts, including sensitivities, and a reconciliation of changes in fair value in the year, is included below.
Financial guarantee contracts The Group has given guarantees to third parties in respect of lease liabilities of former subsidiaries within the disposed hotels division.
The Group received an indemnity from Hilton Hotels Corporation HHC, at the time of the hotels disposal, in relation to any loss the Group may subsequently incur under these third party guarantees.
The guarantees expire between 2017 and 2042 and the lease liabilities comprise a combination of minimum contractual and turnover based elements.
The undiscounted maximum liability exposure in respect of the guarantees for all periods up to 2042 is 827.9 million 2011: 860.6 million, with a maximum indemnity receivable of the same amount.
Included in the maximum liability exposure is 475.5million 2011: 490.7 million in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and 352.4 million 2011: 369.9 million in relation to the minimum contractual based element.
The undiscounted maximum liability represents the total of all guaranteed rentals under the non-cancellable agreements into which the Group has entered.
The net present value of the maximum exposure at 31 December 2012 is 351.6 million 2011: 357.1 million.
Included in the net present value of the maximum exposure is 182.1 million 2011: 183.3 million in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and 169.5 million 2011: 173.8 million in relation to the minimum contractual based element.
The Group monitors its exposure under these guarantees on a regular basis and seeks, where appropriate, to novate its obligations.
The financial guarantees liability has been valued using a probability based model to estimate the net present value of the liabilities payable in the event of a default by the hotels covered by the guarantees, and the probability of such a default and new tenants being identified.
At 31 December 2012 the Group has recognised a financial liability of 7.7 million 2011: 7.7 million in respect of these guarantees.
No asset has been recognised in respect of the indemnity in both years.
The key assumption in the probability model is the hotels default rate.
A 0.5 percentage point increase in the default rate would increase the financial liability by 1.3 million.

Defined benefit plans The Groups only significant defined benefit retirement plan is the Ladbrokes Pension Plan, which is a final salary pension plan for UK employees.
This was closed to new employees on 1 August 2007.
Assets are held separately from those of the Group.
Although the Group is responsible for the operation of this arrangement, professional advisers are appointed to assist the trustees in running it.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan was carried out with an effective date of 30 June 2010.
The latest actuarial valuation was updated to 31 December 2012 by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The value of the defined benefit obligation and current service cost have been measured using the projected unit credit method, as required by IAS 19.

com ar2012 Financial statements 96 Statutory reports and financial statements continued Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 29 Retirement benefit schemes continued The post-retirement mortality assumed for most members is based on the standard SAPS mortality table with the CMI 2009 projections, which takes into account future improvements, adjusted to reflect plan specific experience.
The assumption used implies that the expected future lifetime of members aged 65 in 2012 is 86.7 years for males and 88.4 years for females.
For members with large pensions a longer lifetime is assumed 90.0 for males and 90.4 for females.
These are the same mortality assumptions as adopted for 31 December 2011.
Changes to the assumptions will impact the amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated income statement in respect of the plan.
For the significant assumptions, the following sensitivity analysis provides an indication of the impact for the year ended 31 December 2012, excluding the impact on the associated deferred tax items: 2012 2011 m m 0.5% pa decrease in the discount rate would have the following approximate effect: Increaseinthecurrent service cost excluding employee element 0.5 0.5 Decrease in the balance sheet asset at 31 December 21.8 19.7 This ignores the potential positive impact that a general fall in bond yields may have on the value of the bond assets held by the plan.
