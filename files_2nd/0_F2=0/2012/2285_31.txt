After recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2012 2011 m m ADE: Western Europe 26.7 26.7 North America 44.9 37.1 AGI: Western Europe 17.4 17.6 North America 36.6 15.2 Emerging Markets 6.2 6.0 131.8 102.6 The Group tests goodwill at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for those calculations are the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs in respect of future cash flows.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash generating units.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for cash generating units is 11.3% 2011: 9.5%.
This rate is risk adjusted, for specific countries, where the Group perceives a risk premium is appropriate.
The recoverable amount is the sum of the discounted cash flows over a fifteen year period, being managements expectation of the useful life of the existing asset base.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts based on management estimates for the next five years.
The expected sales reflect managements expectation of how sales will develop at this point in the economic cycle.
The expected profit margin reflects managements experience of each cash generating units profitability at the forecast level of sales.
Cash flows after five years are based on an estimated growth rate of 3.2% 2011: 3.2%, being the historical weighted average growth in GDP in the markets that the Group operates in.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions applied to the value in use calculations for each cash generating unit.
A decline in sales of 26.2% per annum would result in the recoverable amount of goodwill for the Group being reduced to its carrying value.
The Board has concluded that no impairment charge is required in 2012.
The charge for impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible fixed assets in 2011 related to the Groups South American operations, where trading activity has previously lagged expectations, which together with an increase in the perceived risk adjusted discount rate, led to an impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible fixed assets.
No goodwill nor intangible fixed assets remain on the Groups balance sheet in respect of the South American businesses.

78 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2012 15.
Other financial assets continued Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high creditratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Further disclosure of the Groups financial instrument risk management activities is set out in note 18.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 20.6m 2011: 17.7m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are individually impaired trade receivables with a gross balance of 8.9m 2011: 8.9m.
The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of the expected proceeds.

This unsecured facility commenced on 27 July 2011 and matures on 31 August 2016.
The multi currency drawings under this facility carry an interest rate of between 1.15% and 2.00% above LIBOR the margin at 31 December 2012 was 1.15%.
b Drawings of 33.5m 2011: 6.0m under a Revolving Credit Facility of 125m.
This unsecured facility commenced on 31 July 2006 for a period of seven years.
The multi currency drawings under this facility carry an interest rate of between 0.80% and 1.10% above LIBOR the margin at 31 December 2012 was 0.80%.
At 31 December 2012 the Group had available 192.9m 2011: 223.9m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
All borrowings are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.

The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The contracts are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Groups principal markets.
The unrecognised gains and losses were not significant in either 2012 or 2011.
In accordance with IFRS 7 Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments, the Groups financial instruments are considered to be classified as level 2 instruments.
Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liabilities, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Fair value is determined using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
The Groups interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its fixed rate borrowings fair value risk and floating rate borrowings cash flow risk.
From time to time the Group will use interest rate derivative contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate movements within Group policy.
However at the balance sheet date the Group had no interest rate derivative contracts.

Treasury activities have the objective of minimising risk and treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines reviewed and authorised by the Board.
The Group uses a number of derivative instruments that are transacted, for risk management purposes only, by specialist treasury personnel.
The use of financial instruments, including derivatives, is permitted when approved by the Board, where the effect is to minimise risk for the Group.
Speculative trading of derivatives or other financial instruments is not permitted.
There has been no significant change during the financial year, or since the end of the year, to the types or scope of financial risks faced by the Group.
82 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2012 18.
Derivative financial instruments continued Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group might not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price.
Liquidity risk arises as a result of mismatches between cash inflows and outflows from the business.
This risk is monitored on a centralised basis through regular cash flow forecasting, a three-year rolling strategic plan, an annual budget agreed by the Board each December and a quarterly re-forecast undertaken during the financial year.
To mitigate the risk, the resulting forecast net debt cash is measured against the liquidity headroom policy which, at the current net debt cash levels, requires committed facilities plus term loans in excess of one year to exceed net debt by 50% minimum facilities of 100m.
As at 31 December 2012, the Group had revolving credit committed borrowing facilities of 226.4m 2011: 229.9m which exceeded net debt of 34.2m 2011: net cash of 0.1m by 192.2m 2011: 230.0m.
The Group also uses uncommitted short-term bank facilities to manage short-term liquidity but these facilities are excluded from the liquidity headroom policy.
The Group manages longer-term liquidity through committed bank facilities and will, if appropriate, raise funds on capital markets.
As at 31 December 2012 the Groups principal committed bank facilities have the following maturity dates: 125m Revolving Credit Facility 31 July 2013 0.6 years 125m Revolving Credit Facility 31 August 2016 3.7 years $10m Letter of Credit Facility 31 August 2016 3.7 years On 18 February 2013, the 125m Revolving Credit Facility maturing on 31 July 2013, was refinanced for the same amount, extending the maturity to 1 March 2018, increasing the weighted average life of the committed facilities at that date to 4.2 years.
In addition, cash management pooling, netting and concentration techniques are used to minimise borrowings.
As at 31 December 2012, the Group had gross cash of 10.0m 2011: 18.1m.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises on borrowings and cash balances and derivative liabilities and assets which are at floating interest rates.
Changes in interest rates could have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the Groups net profit.
Under the Groups interest rate management policy, the interest rates on each of the Groups major currency monetary assets and liabilities are managed to achieve the desired mix of fixed and variable rates for each major net currency exposure.
The major interest rate risk is to UK rates but exposures also exist to rates in the USA, Europe and Sweden.
Measurement of this interest rate risk and its potential volatility to the Groups reported financial performance is undertaken on a monthly basis and the Board uses this information to determine, from time to time, an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rates.
As at 31 December 2012, 2% of gross debt and 0% of gross cash were at fixed rates 2011: 8% of gross debt, 0% of gross cash.
The average tenure of the fixed rate debt was 3.5 years 2011: 3.6 years.
Currency risk Bodycote has operations in 26 countries and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange translation risk when the profits and net assets of these entities are consolidated into the Group accounts.
Over 89% of the Groups sales are in currencies other than sterling EUR 36%, USD 33% and SEK 7%.
Cumulatively over the year, sterling rates moved such that the sales for the year were 19.6m worse than if sales had been translated at the rates prevailing in 2011.
It is Group policy not to hedge exposure for the translation of reported profits.
The Groups balance sheet translation policy is not to actively hedge currency net assets.
However, where appropriate, the Group will still match centrally held currency borrowings to the net assets.
The Group principally borrows in sterling but also maintains debt in US Dollar, Euro and Swedish Krona, consistent with the location of the Groups assets.
The Group recognises foreign exchange movements in equity for the translation of net investment hedging instruments and balances.
Transaction foreign exchange exposures arise when entities within the Group enter into contracts to pay or receive funds in a currency different from the functional currency of the entity concerned.
It is Group policy to hedge exposure to cash transactions in foreign currencies when a commitment arises, usually through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts.
Even though approximately 89% of the Groups sales are generated outside the UK, the nature of the business is such that cross border sales and purchases are limited and, other than interest, such exposures are immaterial for the Group.
Market risk sensitivity analysis The Group has measured the estimated charge to the income statement and equity of either an instantaneous increase or decrease of 1% 100 basis points in market interest rates or a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling against all other currencies from the applicable rates as at 31 December 2012, for all financial instruments with all other variables remaining constant.
This analysis is for illustrative purposes only.
The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of market risks on net post employment benefit obligations.
Derivative financial instruments continued Interest rate sensitivity The interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or expense of variable interest financial instruments: changes in market interest rates only affect the income statement in relation to financial instruments with fixed interest if these are recognised at their fair value: and changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments.
Under these assumptions, a one percentage point fall or rise in market interest rates for all currencies in which the Group has variable net cash or net borrowings at 31 December 2012 would reduce or increase profit before tax by approximately 0.4m 2011: 0.1m.
There is no significant impact on equity.
Currency sensitivity Taking the 2012 sales by currency, a 10% weakening strengthening in the 2012 cumulative average rates for all currencies versus sterling would have given rise to a 58.2m -47.6m movement in sales respectively.
The impact on headline operating profit is affected by the mix of losses and profits in the various currencies.
However, taking the 2012 operating profit mix, a 10% weakening strengthening in 2012 cumulative average rates for all currencies would have given rise to a 11.1m -9.1m movement in headline operating profit.
Counterparty risk Counterparty risk encompasses settlement risk on derivative financial instruments and money market contracts and credit risk on cash, time deposits and money market funds.
The Group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties via their credit ratings where applicable and through its policy, thereby limiting its exposure to any one party to ensure there is no significant concentration of credit risk.
Group policy is to enter into such transactions only with counterparties with a long-term credit rating of AA3 or better.
However, acquired businesses occasionally have dealings with banks with lower credit ratings.
Business with such banks is moved as soon as practicable.

This provision is reviewed annually and is separated into Restructuring Environmental and Environmental to separately identify environmental provisions relating to the restructuring programme from those arising in the ordinary course of business.
The increase in restructuring provisions is due to the ongoing implementation of the global restructuring initiatives.
In addition 2.4m of reorganisation and redundancy costs have been recognised in relation to the establishment of an accounting Shared Service Centre in Prague.
The majority of cash outflows in respect of these liabilities are expected to occur within 5 years.

Acquisition of businesses and subsidiaries The Group made a number of acquisitions in the year, the most significant of which were as follows: On 31 March 2012 the Group acquired the trade and assets of the heat treatment business of Curtiss-Wright Corporation for a cash consideration of 32.4m.
The acquisition was made to provide additional capacity and a broader customer base in key regions of North America.
The acquisition gives the Group a major presence in the strategically important aerospace industry hub in Wichita, Kansas: Louisiana provides access to the oil & gas market, and the northern plants fit well with the Groups automotive and general industrial network, enhancing service to existing customers and extending the geographic coverage.
On 16 October 2012 the Group acquired the trade and assets of Carolina Commercial Heat Treating, together with an additional facility in Southern Indiana, for a cash consideration of 41.4m.
This acquisition was completed to develop a footprint in the south eastern USA, which continues to be amongst the highest recipients of inward investment in North America, with many domestic and overseas corporations establishing businesses and supply chains in the area.
All transactions have been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting and are summarised below.

Fair values of the acquired identifiable tangible and intangible assets are provisional, pending completion of the final valuations.
The gross contractual value of trade and other receivables was 8.0m.
The best estimate at the acquisition dates of the contractual cash flows not expected to be collected was 0.2m.
The goodwill arising on the acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated profitability of the Groups services in new markets and the anticipated future operating synergies from the combination with the Group of each of the acquired businesses.
Acquisition-related costs reported in exceptional items amounted to 2.5m.
The acquired businesses contributed 22.4m revenue and 5.1m to the Groups operating profit for the period between their dates of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
If the acquisition of all the businesses had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenue for the year would have been 620.9m and Group operating profit would have been 98.7m.

Bodycote Incentive Plan BIP The Company operates the BIP under which Executive Directors and senior executives received a conditional award of Bodycote shares up to a maximum of 175% of base salary.
Vestings of awards are based upon two performance measures, over a three year period.
Fifty per cent of the award is subject to a return on capital employed ROCE performance condition and fifty per cent of the award is subject to an earnings per share EPS performance condition.
In the event that threshold performance for both EPS and ROCE is not achieved none of the conditional awards will vest.
Bodycote Co-investment Plan CIP The CIP permits executives to invest in shares up to a value equivalent to 40% of net basic salary.
The CIP provides for the grant of awards of matching shares to participants on an annual basis in a maximum ratio of 1:1 to the gross investment made in deferred shares.
Deferred shares must be held for three years and matching shares are subject to an absolute Total Shareholder Return TSR target.
The threshold target for CIP matching awards is TSR growth of not less than 4% per annum compound in excess of growth in the Consumer Prices Index CPI for a threshold matching ratio of 1:2.
Ten per cent per annum compound growth in excess of growth in the CPI will be required for a vesting matching ratio of 1:1.
