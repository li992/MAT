9.1 Consolidated Financial Statements continued 28 Financial risk management The Group financial risk management strategy The financial risks arising from the Groups operations comprise market, liquidity and credit risk.
These risks arise in the normal course of business, and the Group manages its exposure to them in accordance with the Groups portfolio risk management strategy.
The objective of the strategy is to support the delivery of the Groups financial targets while protecting its future financial security and flexibility by taking advantage of the natural diversification provided by the scale, diversity and flexibility of the Groups operations and activities.
A Cash Flow at Risk CFaR framework is used to measure the aggregate and diversified impact of financial risks upon the Groups financial targets.
The principal measurement of risk is CFaR measured on a portfolio basis which is defined as the worst expected loss relative to projected business plan cash flows over a one-year horizon under normal market conditions at a confidence level of 95 per cent.
Market risk The Groups activities expose it to market risks associated with movements in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodity prices.
Under the strategy outlined above, the Group seeks to achieve financing costs, currency impacts, input costs and commodity prices on a floating or index basis.
This strategy gives rise to a risk of variability in earnings which is measured under the CFaR framework.
In executing the strategy, financial instruments are potentially employed in three distinct but related activities.
The following table summarises these activities and the key risk management processes.

As part of this strategy swaptions are also used.
3 Strategic financial transactions Opportunistic transactions may be executed with financial instruments to capture value from Exposures managed within value at risk perceived market over under valuations.

Primary responsibility for identification and control of financial risks, including authorising and monitoring the use of financial instruments for the above activities and stipulating policy thereon, rests with the Financial Risk Management Committee under authority delegated by the Group Management Committee.
216 | BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2012 7 8 9 10 11 Directors Report Legal proceedings Financial Statements Glossary Shareholder information 28 Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its outstanding borrowings and investments from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair value of fixed interest rate financial instruments.
Interest rate risk is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.
The majority of the Groups debt is raised under central borrowing programs.
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps to convert most of the centrally managed debt into US dollar floating interest rate exposures.
As at 30 June 2012, the Group holds US$4,317 million 2011: US$827 million of centrally managed fixed interest rate borrowings as well as US$4,039 million 2011: US$650 million of other fixed interest rate borrowings that have not been swapped to floating interest rates, arising from debt raised during the financial year ended 30 June 2012, debt assumed as part of the acquisition of Petrohawk Energy Corporation and debt raised prior to the DLC merger.
The Groups earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on the floating interest rate component of the Groups net borrowings.
The fair value of interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward exchange contracts in hedge relationships used to hedge both interest rate and foreign currency risks are as follows: Fair value 2012 2011 US$M US$M Interest rate swaps US dollar swaps Pay floating receive fixed Not later than one year 51 49 Later than one year but not later than two years 66 109 Later than two years but not later than five years 428 248 Later than five years 297 172 US dollar swaps Pay fixed receive floating Later than five years 31 Cross currency interest rate swaps Euro to US dollar swaps Pay floating receive fixed Later than two years but not later than five years 17 134 Later than five years 108 Euro to US dollar swaps Pay fixed receive fixed Later than two years but not later than five years 117 42 Forward exchange contracts Euro to US dollar foreign exchange contract Pay US dollar receive Euro Not later than one year 53 Total fair value of derivatives 603 701 Based on the net debt position as at 30 June 2012, taking into account interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps, it is estimated that a one percentage point increase in the US LIBOR interest rate will decrease the Groups equity and profit after taxation by US$103 million 2011: decrease of US$25 million.
This assumes that the change in interest rates is effective from the beginning of the financial year and the fixed floating mix and balances are constant over the year.
However, interest rates and the net debt profile of the Group may not remain constant over the coming financial year and therefore such sensitivity analysis should be used with care.
BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2012 | 217 9.1 Consolidated Financial Statements continued 28 Financial risk management continued Currency risk The US dollar is the functional currency of most operations within the Group and as a result currency exposures arise from transactions and balances in currencies other than the US dollar.
The Groups potential currency exposures comprise: translational exposure in respect of non-functional currency monetary items: transactional exposure in respect of non-functional currency expenditure and revenues.
The Groups foreign currency risk is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.
Translational exposure in respect of non-functional currency monetary items Monetary items, including financial assets and liabilities, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of an operation are periodically restated to US dollar equivalents, and the associated gain or loss is taken to the income statement.
The exception is foreign exchange gains or losses on foreign currency provisions for closure and rehabilitation at operating sites which are capitalised in property, plant and equipment.
The following table shows the foreign currency risk arising from financial assets and liabilities which are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar.

Based on the Groups net financial assets and liabilities as at 30 June 2012, a weakening of the US dollar against these currencies as illustrated in the table below, with all other variables held constant, would increase decrease profit after taxation and equity as follows: 2012 2011 US$M US$M Profit after Profit after Currency movement taxation Equity taxation Equity 1 cent movement in Australian dollar 40 39 33 33 0.2 rand movement in South African rand 2 6 7 4 1 pence movement in UK pound sterling The Groups financial asset and liability profile may not remain constant, and therefore these sensitivities should be used with care.
Transactional exposure in respect of non-functional currency expenditure and revenues Certain operating and capital expenditure is incurred by some operations in currencies other than their functional currency.
To a lesser extent, certain sales revenue is earned in currencies other than the functional currency of operations, and certain exchange control restrictions may require that funds be maintained in currencies other than the functional currency of the operation.
These currency risks are managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.
When required under this strategy the Group enters into forward exchange contracts.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding to manage short-term foreign currency cash flows relating to operating activities is an asset of US$8 million 2011: an asset of US$23 million.
Commodity price risk Contracts for the sale and physical delivery of commodities are executed whenever possible on a pricing basis intended to achieve a relevant index target.
Where pricing terms deviate from the index, derivative commodity contracts may be used when available to return realised prices to the index.
Contracts for the physical delivery of commodities are not typically financial instruments and are carried in the balance sheet at cost typically at nil : they are therefore excluded from the fair value and sensitivity tables below.
Accordingly, the financial instrument exposures set out in the tables below do not represent all of the commodity price risks managed according to the Groups objectives.
Movements in the fair value of contracts included in the tables below are offset by movements in the fair value of the physical contracts, however only the former movement is recognised in the Groups income statement prior to settlement.
The risk associated with commodity prices is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.
Financial instruments with commodity price risk included in the following tables are those entered into for the following activities: economic hedging of prices realised on commodity contracts as described above: purchases and sales of physical contracts that can be cash-settled: derivatives embedded within other supply contracts.
All such instruments are carried in the balance sheet at fair value.

Provisional pricing mechanisms embedded within these sales arrangements have the character of a commodity derivative and are carried at fair value as part of trade receivables.
The Groups exposure at 30 June 2012 to the impact of movements in commodity prices upon provisionally invoiced sales volumes is set out in the following table.

The relationship between commodity prices and foreign currencies is complex and movements in foreign exchange can impact commodity prices.
The sensitivities should therefore be used with care.
Liquidity risk The Groups liquidity risk arises from the possibility that it may not be able to settle or meet its obligations as they fall due and is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.
Operational, capital and regulatory requirements are considered in the management of liquidity risk, in conjunction with shortand long-term forecast information.
Additional liquidity risk arises on debt related derivatives due to the possibility that a market for derivatives might not exist in some circumstances.
To counter this risk the Group only uses derivatives in highly liquid markets.
During the year ended 30 June 2012, Moodys Investors Service made no change to the Groups long-term credit rating of A1 the short-term credit rating is P-1.
Standard & Poors made no change to the Groups long-term credit rating of A the short-term credit rating is A-1.
The Groups strong credit profile, diversified funding sources and committed credit facilities ensure that sufficient liquid funds are maintained to meet its daily cash requirements.
The Groups policy on counterparty credit exposure ensures that only counterparties of a high credit standing are used for the investment of any excess cash.
There were no defaults on loans payable during the period.
Standby arrangements and unused credit facilities Details of major standby and support arrangements are as follows: Facility Facility available Used Unused available Used Unused 2012 2012 2012 2011 2011 2011 US$M US$M US$M US$M US$M US$M a Revolving credit facility 4,000 4,000 4,000 4,000 b Other facilities 60 60 61 61 Total financing facilities 4,060 4,060 4,061 4,061 a The multi-currency revolving credit facility is available for general corporate purposes and matures in December 2015.

The interest rates under this facility are based on an interbank rate plus a margin.
The applicable margin is typical for a credit facility extended to a company with the Groups credit rating.

BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2012 | 221 9.1 Consolidated Financial Statements continued 28 Financial risk management continued Credit risk Credit risk arises from the non-performance by counterparties of their contractual financial obligations towards the Group.
To manage credit risk the Group maintains Group-wide procedures covering the application for credit approvals, granting and renewal of counterparty limits and daily monitoring of exposures against these limits.
As part of these processes the financial viability of all counterparties is regularly monitored and assessed.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the total carrying value of relevant financial assets on the balance sheet as at the reporting date.
The Groups credit risk exposures are categorised under the following headings: Counterparties The Group conducts transactions with the following major types of counterparties: Receivables counterparties Approximately half of sales to the Groups customers are made on open terms.
Payment guarantee counterparties Approximately half of sales to Group customers occur via secured payment mechanisms.
Derivative counterparties Counterparties to derivative contracts consist of a diverse number of financial institutions and industrial counterparties in the relevant markets.
Cash investment counterparties As part of managing cash flow and liquidity, the Group holds short-term cash investments with a range of approved financial institutions.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk with any single counterparty or group of counterparties.
Geographic The Group trades in all major geographic regions.
Countries in which the Group has a significant credit risk exposure include South Africa, Australia, the US, Japan and China.
Where appropriate, secured payment mechanisms and other risk mitigation instruments are used to protect revenues from credit risk losses.
Industry In line with our asset portfolio, the Group sells into a diverse range of industries and customer sectors.
This diversity means that the Group is not materially exposed to any individual industry or customer.
The following table shows the Groups receivables at the reporting date that are exposed to credit risk and the ageing and impairment profile thereon.

These terms and conditions are determined on a case-by-case basis with reference to the customers credit quality and prevailing market conditions.
Receivables that are classified as past due in the above tables are those that have not been settled within the terms and conditions that have been agreed with that customer.
For an analysis of movements in impaired trade receivables, refer to note 10.
The credit quality of the Groups customers is monitored on an ongoing basis and assessed for impairment where indicators of such impairment exist.
The solvency of each debtor and their ability to repay the receivable is considered in assessing receivables for impairment.
In certain circumstances the Group may seek collateral as security for the receivable.
Where receivables have been impaired, the Group actively seeks to recover the amounts in question and enforce compliance with credit terms.
No other financial assets were past due or impaired at 30 June 2012 30 June 2011: nil.

Where no price information is available from a quoted market source, alternative market mechanisms or recent comparable transactions, fair value is estimated based on the Groups views on relevant future prices, net of valuation allowances to accommodate liquidity, modelling and other risks implicit in such estimates.
Movements in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities may be recognised through the income statement or in other comprehensive income.

BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2012 | 225 9.1 Consolidated Financial Statements continued 28 Financial risk management continued Sensitivity of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities The carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities that are valued using inputs other than observable market data are calculated using appropriate valuation models, including discounted cash flow modelling, with inputs such as commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and inflation.
The potential effect of using reasonably possible alternative assumptions in these models, based on a change in the most significant input by 10 per cent while holding all other variables constant, is shown in the following table.
Significant inputs are assessed individually for each financial asset and liability.

The Group will invest capital in assets where they fit our strategy.
The Groups priorities for cash flow are: reinvestment in projects that carry attractive rates of return regardless of the economic climate: commitment to a solid A credit rating: returning excess capital to shareholders firstly with its progressive dividends policy and thereafter via capital management initiatives for example share buy-backs.
Further information relevant to the actions and outcomes of the Groups capital management strategy is contained in section 9.1.

The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, being the ratio of net debt to net debt plus net assets.
