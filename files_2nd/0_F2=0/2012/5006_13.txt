Non-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use, are classified as held for sale.
Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets, or components of a disposal group, are remeasured in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
Thereafter, generally the assets, or disposal group, are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.

Significant accounting policies continued w IFRS standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective The International Accounting Standards Board IASB and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC have issued new standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements.
IAS 19 revised 2011 Employee Benefits is considered to be the most significant of the upcoming changes which is effective for the year ended 30 April 2014 and requires the replacement of the expected rate of return on assets and interest charge on pension scheme liabilities with a net financing cost based on the discount rate.
The Group does not anticipate that the adoption of the remaining standards and interpretations that are effective for the year ending 30 April 2014 will have a material effect on its financial statements on initial adoption.

Segment reporting Operating segments IFRS 8 Operating Segments, requires operating segments to be identified on the same basis as is used internally for the review of performance and allocation of resources by the Group Chief Executive who is the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined by IFRS 8.
Further details of these business segments are given in the Business Review.
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Central administration costs are allocated to the individual segments on a consistent basis year on year.
Assets and liabilities have been analysed by segment at a capital employed level, which excludes items of a financing nature, taxation balances, post-retirement benefit liabilities and non-current asset investments.
Debt and associated interest is managed at a Group level and therefore has not been allocated across the business areas.
The Office Products and Wholesaling division has been classified as a discontinued operation and was sold during the year ended 30 April 2012 note 29.

Due to the nature of these costs, they have been reported as exceptional costs.
The UK Packaging restructuring costs of 30.6m primarily relate to the restructuring of the UK Packaging business, and the exit costs from the closure and sale of two paper mills.
Continental European Corrugated Packaging costs of 6.3m relate to restructuring in France and Plastic Packaging costs of 5.4m primarily relate to restructuring in the UK and Germany.
Total intangible asset, tangible fixed asset and inventory impairment charges are 36.5m and primarily relate to property, plant and equipment within the UK, primarily relating to paper assets.
The exceptional gain of 10.0m relates to the Groups associate investment in OJSC Rubezhansk Paper and Packaging Mill Rubezhansk.
In 2008 09 an exceptional loss of 18.1m was incurred when the carrying value of the Groups investment was written down to nil due to the uncertainty in the financial position of the business, following a breach of its banking covenants caused by exchange rate movements.
In November 2011, revised facilities were agreed with the banks and hence it was considered appropriate to re-instate the investment in associate at fair value.
2010 11 The UK Packaging restructuring costs of 0.9m relate to two small packaging plants in the UK and Plastic Packaging costs of 0.5m relate to restructuring in France.
Following the acquisition of Otor in September 2010, a restructuring programme was put in place in France to facilitate Otors integration with the Group.
This resulted in restructuring costs of 2.3m within Continental European Corrugated Packaging.
The acquisition related costs relate to the acquisition of Otor.
The pension curtailment gain primarily relates to the closure of the UK Group Scheme to future accrual and is described in note 23.
Impairment charges relate to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment within the UK Packaging and the Plastic Packaging segments.
Disposal costs predominantly relate to the disposal of opikas, the Groups subsidiary in Turkey, and a small packaging business in the UK.

In the 2012 Budget, a reduction from 1 April 2012 to 24%, a reduction from 1 April 2013 to 23% and further changes to reduce the rate to 22% by April 2014 were announced.
The rate reduction to 24% was substantively enacted on 26 March 2012 and was effective from 1 April 2012.
Accordingly the rate applying to UK assets and liabilities has also been reduced from 26% to 24%, creating a rate adjustment, which is partly reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement, and partly in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or Equity.
The rate reduction from 24% to 22% has not yet been substantively enacted: had it been, the effect would have been to reduce the net deferred tax asset in the UK by 2.2m, of which it is estimated that 3.0m would have been credited to the Consolidated Income Statement and 5.2m would have been charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculation were: cash forecasts derived from the latest budgets and forecasts for the two years ending 30 April 2014 as approved by the Directors.
Cash flows beyond the forecast period were extrapolated assuming a growth rate of 3% 2010 11: 3% : and the pre-tax discount rate for the Group is 10.1% 2010 11: 11.0%.
The Group believes that the risk profiles across the significant markets in which it operates are not significantly different, hence the same discount rate is applied across all CGUs except for the Groups investment in associate.
The value in use is based upon anticipated discounted future cash flows.
The Directors believe the assumptions used are appropriate, but in addition have conducted sensitivity analysis to determine the changes in assumptions that would result.
Based on this analysis the Directors believe that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions detailed above would cause the carrying value of CGUs to exceed their recoverable amounts.
Therefore at 30 April 2012 no impairment charge is required against the carrying value of goodwill above those specific impairments detailed above.

The impairment charge for plant and equipment is recognised in profit and loss in exceptional items of which the majority relates to the UK Packaging segment.
The amounts above include land and buildings held under finance lease agreements.
At 30 April 2012, the carrying amount of land and buildings held under finance leases was 4.5m 30 April 2011: 16.9m.
Assets under construction mainly relate to production machines being built for various sites across the Group.

In 2008 09, the Group fully impaired the carrying value of its investment in Rubezhansk due to a breach in Rubezhansks banking covenants caused by foreign exchange losses following the significant decline in the Ukrainian Hryvnia against the US dollar.
Whilst the uncertainty of the financial position continued at Rubezhansk, the Group did not recognised any profits in respect of its investment in the associate.
In November 2011, revised facilities were agreed with the banks and hence it was considered appropriate to re-instate the investment in associate in the Group balance sheet at fair value of 10.0m and resume recognition of the Groups share of profit or loss from that date.
The Group accounts for its investment in Rubezhansk as an associate because the Group has the ability to exercise significant influence over the investment due to the Groups 49.6% equity holding.
The Group does not have control over Rubezhansk under IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements because it does not, by virtue of its shareholding or other agreement, have more than half the voting rights.

Interest rates on floatingrate borrowings are based on London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR, Euro Interbank Offered Rate EURIBOR or base rates.
Bank loan facilities In August 2010, the Group entered into a term loan facility of 81m with three banks, which would have matured on 29 August 2013.
This facility was repaid in full in September 2011.
In August 2008, the Group entered into a syndicated revolving credit facility of 287.5m, which would have expired on 29 August 2013.
In September 2011 this facility was increased to 610.0m with a new expiry date of 23 September 2016.

Financial instruments The Groups activities expose the Group to a number of key risks which have the potential to affect its ability to achieve its business objectives.
A summary of the Groups key financial risks and the policies and objectives in place to manage these risks is set out in the Financial Review and Risk Management sections of the Business Review.
The derivative financial instruments set out in this note have been entered into to help achieve the Groups risk management objectives.
The Groups treasury policy is not to engage in speculative transactions.
a Carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and liabilities Set out below is the accounting classification of the carrying amounts and fair values of all of the Groups financial assets and liabilities.
2012 2011 Carrying Carrying amount Fair value amount Fair value m m m m Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 664.5 664.5 114.3 114.3 Available-for-sale: Other investments 0.1 0.1 0.5 0.5 Loans and receivables: Trade and other receivables 294.1 294.1 454.2 454.2 Derivative financial instruments: Other financial assets in designated hedge accounting relationships 10.7 10.7 21.7 21.7 Total financial assets 969.4 969.4 590.7 590.7 Financial liabilities Financial liabilities at amortised cost: Trade and other payables 441.5 441.5 545.0 545.0 Bank and other loans 0.6 0.6 73.4 73.4 Note purchase agreements 316.3 345.7 327.1 346.1 Finance lease liabilities 4.1 4.1 11.8 11.8 Bank overdrafts 11.3 11.3 26.1 26.1 Derivative financial instruments: Other financial liabilities in designated hedge accounting relationships 23.6 23.6 43.4 43.4 Total financial liabilities 797.4 826.8 1,026.8 1,045.8 The fair value is the amount for which an asset or liability could be exchanged or settled on an arms-length basis.
For financial instruments carried at fair value, market prices or rates are used to determine fair value where an active market exists.
The Group uses forward prices for valuing forward foreign exchange and commodity contracts and uses valuation models with present value calculations based on market yield curves to value note purchase agreements, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps.
All derivative financial assets and liabilities are shown at fair value on the Statement of Financial Position.
Under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement hedge accounting rules, only portions of the note purchase agreements which form part of an effective fair value hedge are carried at fair value in the Statement of Financial Position.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities which bear floating rates of interest is estimated to be equivalent to book value.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures requires the classification of fair value measurements using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the assessments: Level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All of the Groups financial instruments are Level 2 financial instruments.
The Group does not hold any Level 1 or Level 3 financial instruments.

Financial instruments continued b Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate, currency and commodity swaps, to manage interest rate, currency and commodity risks associated with the Groups underlying business activities and the financing of these activities.
All derivatives have been designated as effective hedging instruments and are carried at their fair value.
The assets and liabilities of the Group at 30 April in respect of derivative financial instruments are as follows: Assets Liabilities Net 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 m m m m m m Derivatives held to: Manage the interest rate and currency exposures on borrowings and net investments 7.9 7.3 18.4 34.2 10.5 26.9 Derivative financial instruments included in net debt 7.9 7.3 18.4 34.2 10.5 26.9 Derivatives held to hedge future transactions Energy costs 1.8 14.1 3.8 7.9 2.0 6.2 Foreign exchange on purchases and sales of goods and services 1.0 0.3 1.4 1.3 0.4 1.0 Total derivative financial instruments 10.7 21.7 23.6 43.4 12.9 21.7 Current 3.1 8.5 20.2 7.2 17.2 1.3 Non-current 7.6 13.2 3.4 36.2 4.3 23.0 10.7 21.7 23.6 43.4 12.9 21.7 c Cash flow, fair value and net investment hedges i Cash flow hedging reserve movements The following table identifies the movements in the cash flow hedging reserve during the year.
2012 2011 m m At 1 May 3.0 7.4 Unrealised fair value loss gain on designated cash flow hedges Forward exchange contracts 0.5 0.6 Cross-currency and interest rate swaps 0.8 0.3 Commodity contracts 7.8 13.0 Loss gain in equity recycled to the income statement Forward exchange contracts 0.8 1.0 Cross-currency and interest rate swaps 1.9 Commodity contracts 1.8 3.2 At 30 April 1.9 3.0 2012 2011 m m Revenue 0.7 0.6 Cost of sales 4.1 3.7 Income tax 0.8 0.8 Total loss gain in equity recycled to the income statement during the year 2.6 2.3 ii Fair value hedges At 30 April 2012, the Group held interest rate and currency swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate and currency risk on fixed rate debt payable by the Group.
The receive leg of the swap contracts is largely identical in all critical aspects to the terms of the underlying debt and thus the hedging is highly effective.
The pre-tax loss on the hedging derivative instruments taken to the income statement in the year was 0.8m 2010 11: loss of 13.5m offset by a pre-tax gain on the fair value of the debt of 0.6m 2010 11: gain of 12.6m.
iii Hedges of net investments in foreign operations The Group holds currency swap contracts as hedges of long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries.
The pre-tax gain on the hedges recognised in equity in the year was 14.8m 2010 11: loss of 4.7m.
The gain is matched by a similar loss in equity on the retranslation of the hedged foreign subsidiarys net assets.
During the year, hedge ineffectiveness arising from hedges of net investments resulted in a loss of 0.1m recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement 2010 11: loss of 0.3m.
DS Smith Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 85 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 19.
Financial instruments continued d Risk identification and risk management i Capital risk The Group funds its operations from the following sources of cash: operating cash flow, borrowings, shareholders equity and disposals of peripheral businesses, where appropriate.
The Groups objective is to achieve a capital structure that results in an appropriate cost of capital whilst providing flexibility in immediate and medium-term funding so as to accommodate material investments or acquisitions.
The Group also aims to maintain a strong statement of financial position and to provide continuity of financing by having a range of maturities and borrowings from a variety of sources.
The Groups overall treasury objectives are to ensure sufficient funds are available to carry out its strategy and to manage financial risks.
The Groups treasury strategy is controlled through the Treasury Committee, which meets regularly and includes the Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director, the Group Financial Controller, the Group Treasurer and the Group Tax Manager.
The Group Treasury Function operates in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board and controlled by the Group Treasurer.
The function arranges funding for the Group, provides a service to operations and implements strategies for interest rate, foreign exchange rate and energy exposure management.
ii Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument fluctuate because of a change in market prices.
The Group is exposed to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings and by the use of interest rate swap contracts.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with expectations of changes in interest rates: ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the statement of financial position or protecting interest rate expense through interest rate cycles.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
At 30 April 2012, 63% 30 April 2011: 58% of the Groups interest-bearing loans and borrowings were fixed.
The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact on profit and total equity of a 100 basis points rise in market interest rates representing managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates in all currencies in which the Group had variable rate borrowings at 30 April.
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year, the interest rates on all external interest-bearing loans and cash deposits have been increased by 100 basis points, and the resulting increase in the net interest charge has been adjusted for the effect of the Groups interest rate derivatives.
The effect on equity includes the above impact on the income statement and the impact of a 100 basis points increase in interest rates on the market values of the Groups interest rate derivatives.
The results are presented before non-controlling interests and tax.
2012 2011 Impact on Impact on Impact on Impact on profit total equity profit total equity m m m m Increase in market interest rates by 100 basis points 5.3 0.8 Under interest rate swap contracts the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest rate amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
At 30 April 2012, losses of 0.1m 30 April 2011: losses of 0.9m net of tax are deferred in equity in respect of cash flow hedges of interest rate risk.
This will be recycled to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item also affects the income statement, which will occur over time to 2016.
Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk on investments The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from net investments in Group entities, the functional currencies of which differ from the Groups presentational currency.
The Group hedges this exposure through borrowings denominated in foreign currencies and through cross-currency swaps.
Gains and losses for hedges of net investments are recognised in reserves.
Foreign exchange risk on borrowings The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk on borrowings denominated in foreign currencies.
The Group hedges this exposure through cross-currency swaps designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges.
Foreign exchange risk on transactions Foreign currency transaction risk arises where a business unit makes product sales and material purchases in a currency other than its functional currency.
Part of this risk is hedged using foreign exchange contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges.
At 30 April 2012, losses of 0.3m 30 April 2011: losses of 0.6m net of tax are deferred in equity in respect of cash flow hedges.
This will be recycled to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item also affects the income statement, which occurs within two years.

Financial instruments continued d Risk identification and risk management continued ii Market risk continued Foreign exchange risk on transactions continued The Groups main currency exposures are from the Euro and US dollar.
The following significant exchange rates applied during the year: 2012 2011 Average Closing Average Closing US dollar 1.592 1.624 1.565 1.668 Euro 1.167 1.227 1.176 1.124 The following sensitivity analysis shows the impact on the Groups results of a 10% change in the year-end exchange rate of sterling against all other currencies.
10% represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The analysis is only on financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency and excludes the impact of financial instruments designated as net investment hedges.
Loans that are treated as net investment hedges are not recorded within the impact on the Groups profit as the impact of foreign exchange movements on these is offset by equal and opposite movements in the foreign assets that the instruments hedge.
2012 2011 Impact on Impact on Impact on Impact on profit total equity profit total equity m m m m 10% strengthening of sterling 0.4 0.4 0.5 0.5 10% weakening of sterling 0.5 0.4 0.6 0.7 Commodity risk The Groups main commodity exposures are to changes in UK gas and UK electricity prices.
Part of this commodity price risk is managed by a combination of physical supply agreements and derivative instruments.
At 30 April 2012, losses of 1.5m 30 April 2011: gains of 4.5m net of tax are deferred in equity in respect of cash flow hedges in accordance with IAS 39.
This will be recycled to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item also affects the income statement, which will occur within two years.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% increase in these prices, which is managements assessment of the reasonably possible approximation of how much markets can move on average, over any given year.
In some years prices will be less volatile and in others they may be more volatile.
A decrease of 10% in these prices would produce an opposite effect on equity.
As all of the Groups commodity financial instruments achieve hedge accounting under IAS 39, there is no impact on profit for either year.
2012 2011 Impact on Impact on Impact on Impact on profit total equity profit total equity m m m m 10% increase in UK electricity prices 0.3 1.7 10% increase in UK gas prices 2.9 6.8 iii Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to perform or fail to pay amounts due, causing financial loss to the Group.
In the current economic environment, the Group has placed increased emphasis on the management of credit risk.
The carrying amount of financial assets at 30 April 2012 was 969.4m 30 April 2011: 590.7m and is analysed in note 19 a.
This represents the maximum credit exposure.
The majority of the Groups trade receivables are due for maturity within 90 days.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Groups customer base being large and diverse.
Management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for bad and doubtful debts note 14.

iv Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group, although solvent, will have difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities as they fall due.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining adequate financial resources and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and by matching these to the maturity profile of financial assets and liabilities.

Share-based payment expense The Groups share-based payment arrangements are as follows: i A Performance Share Plan PSP.
Awards under the PSP normally become exercisable after three years subject to remaining in service and the satisfaction of performance conditions measured over the three financial years commencing with the year of grant.
Awards have been made under the PSP in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011.
The performance conditions are as detailed below.
The 2008 award is subject to three equally-weighted performance measures: i the Companys total shareholder return TSR compared to the constituents of the Industrial Goods and Services Supersector within the FTSE 250: ii average adjusted earnings per share EPS : and iii average adjusted return on average capital employed ROACE.
For those senior executives working in one of the three Business Segments, the three measures equally weighted are TSR as above, average adjusted operating profit and average adjusted ROACE for the relevant segment.
The 2009 award is subject to two performance measures: i 80% of each award based on a TSR component as per above: and ii 20% of each award based on average adjusted ROACE.
For those senior executives working in one of the three Business Segments, the two measures are TSR and ROACE for the relevant segment.
The 2010 and 2011 awards are subject to three performance measures: i 50% of each award based on a TSR component as per above: ii 25% of each award based on average adjusted EPS: and iii 25% of each award based on average adjusted ROACE.
ii Replacement 2007 and 2008 Long Term Incentive Plans for Mr M W Roberts.
The Replacement 2007 LTIP vested on 10 October 2010 and the Replacement 2008 LTIP became exercisable on 17 October 2011.
The Replacement 2008 LTIP vested in full on 17 October 2011 but has not yet been exercised.
The Replacement 2008 LTIP award was subject to a performance condition measuring the TSR of McBride Plc up to the date Mr Roberts joined the Company and thereafter the Companys TSR against a comparator group of companies comprising the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts constituted as at the date of grant of the award over a three-year performance period commencing on 1 July 2008. iii The Replacement Deferred Shares Award and the Substitute Share Bonus Award are subject to substantially the same terms as the Companys Deferred Share Bonus Plan, except that they will vest on 1 September 2012 and 1 September 2013 respectively.
Mr Roberts will be entitled to a cash payment on vesting, representing a value equivalent to the dividends which would have been paid on his vested shares while they were subject to his awards.
There are no performance conditions governing the vesting of the Replacement Deferred Shares Award and the Substitute Share Bonus Award because the awards they replicate had no performance conditions attaching to them.
iv The Recruitment Award is subject to substantially the same terms as the awards made under the Companys PSP in 2009.
The award is due to vest on 19 October 2012. v A Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP is operated for Executive Directors and, from 2012 13, for senior executives.
Shares awarded under the Plan will vest automatically if the Director or senior executive is still employed by the Company three years after the grant of the award.
vi A Share Matching Plan SMP is operated for Executive Directors and senior executives with the first award due to be made in 2012 13.
The award will normally vest after three years subject to remaining in service and the satisfaction of performance conditions measured over the three financial years commencing with the year of grant.
The performance conditions, which will be set on award, will be against EPS and ROACE.
vii An Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS.
This scheme ceased to be operated from September 2008.
In normal circumstances, the vesting of any options granted under the ESOS is subject to remaining in service and to the growth in the Companys normalised earnings per share equaling or exceeding the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index plus an average of 3% per annum over the three financial years commencing with the year of grant.
viii A Sharesave Plan was introduced in the UK in January 2011.
All UK employees of the Company and participating subsidiaries of the Group are eligible to participate in this Plan.
Under this HMRC approved Plan options are granted to participants who have contracted to save up to 250 per month over a period of three years at a discount of up to 20% to the average closing mid-market price of a DS Smith Plc ordinary share on the three dealing days prior to invitation.
Options cannot normally be exercised until a minimum of three years has elapsed.
In common with most plans of this type there are no performance conditions applicable to options granted under this Plan.
Full details of the awards described in i, ii, iii, iv and v and vi are set out in the Remuneration Report.
