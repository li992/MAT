Adopting the amendments to IAS 19 will require the Group to recognise a single net interest component in respect of its dened benefit pension scheme, calculated by applying the discount rate to the net dened benefit liability asset.
The impact of this change on the Groups reported income in the period of adoption will depend upon the asset prole of the plan at that date.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of any of the other above amendments will have a material impact on the Groups reported income or net assets in the period of adoption.
The Group continues to evaluate standards and interpretations and their impact on the financial statements.
