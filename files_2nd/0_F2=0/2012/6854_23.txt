58 Financial statements notes to tHe accounts For tHe 52 weeKs ended 29 aprIL 2012 1 Accounting policies Corporate information The consolidated financial statements of Greene King plc for the 52 weeks ended 29 April 2012 were authorised for issue by the board of directors on 27 June 2012.
Greene King plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The companys shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Statement of compliance The groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU as they apply to the financial statements of the group for the 52 weeks ended 29 April 2012 prior year 52 weeks ended 1 May 2011 and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companiesreporting under IFRS.
They are presented in pounds sterling, with values rounded to the nearest hundred thousand, except whereotherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Greene King plc, its subsidiaries and its related party, Greene King Finance plc.
Greene King Finance plc is a special purpose entity set up to raise bond finance for the group, which is consolidated as a quasi-subsidiary.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company with adjustments made to their financial statements to bring their accounting policies in line with those used by the group.
The results of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the group obtains control, and continue tobe consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated onconsolidation.
Changes in accounting policies The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
The following standards, interpretations and amendments are effective for this financial year but have not had a significant impact on the reported financial performance or position of the group.
IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures Revised The revised standard, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011, clarifies the definition of a related party tosimplify the identification of related party relationships, particularly in relation to significant influence and joint control.
IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement Amendment The amendment provides guidance on assessing the recoverable amounts of a net pension asset.
It permits the treatment of the prepayment of a minimum funding requirement as an asset.
IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments The interpretation clarifies that equity instruments issued to a creditor to extinguish a financial liability qualify as consideration paid.
Theequity instruments issued are measured at their fair value, unless this cannot be measured reliably, in which case they are measured atthe fair value of the liability extinguished.
Any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Improvements to International Financial Reporting Standards issued May 2010 In May 2010, the IASB issued its third omnibus of amendments to its standards, primarily with a view to removing inconsistencies and clarifying wording.
There are separate transitional provisions for each standard.
The adoption of the following amendments resulted innochanges to accounting policies but no impact on the financial position or performance of the group: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments Disclosures The amendment emphasises the interaction between quantitative and qualitative disclosures and the nature and extent of risks associated with financial instruments.
Financial instruments have been disclosed in note 24.
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements The amendment clarifies that an entity may present an analysis of each component of other comprehensive income maybe in the statement of changes in equity or in the notes to the financial statements.
The group provides this analysis in the statement of changes inequity.
Significant accounting policies Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost on transition to IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment invalue.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated to their estimated residual values over periods up to 50 years, and short leasehold improvements are depreciated to their estimated residual values over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease or useful life of the asset.
Residual value is reviewed at least at each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value.
Plant and equipment assets are depreciated over their estimated lives which range from three to20 years.
Residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed for all categories of property, plant and equipment and adjusted, ifappropriate, at each financial year end.
Greene King plc Annual report 2012 www.
co. uk 59 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment continued An item of property, plant and equipment is fide-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use.
Profit or loss on fide-recognition is calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, andisincluded in the income statement in the year of fide-recognition.
Business combinations and goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of theconsideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree.
Thechoice of measurement of non-controlling interest, either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable netassets is determined on a transaction by transaction basis.
Acquisition costs incurred are taken to the income statement.
When the group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation inaccordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.
This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts of the acquiree.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred to the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes tothe fair value of the contingent consideration which are deemed to be an asset or a liability will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in the income statement or in other comprehensive income.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it should not be remeasured until it is finally settled within equity.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest over the net identifiable amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in exchange for the business combination.
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in transactions separate to the business combinations, such asthe settlement of pre-existing relationships or post-acquisition remuneration arrangements are accounted for separately from the business combination in accordance with their nature and applicable IFRSs.
Identifiable intangible assets, meeting either the contractual-legal or separability criterion are recognised separately from goodwill.
Contingent liabilities representing a present obligation are recognised if the acquisition-date fair value can be measured reliably.
If the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest is lower than the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the fair value of any pre-existing interest held in the business acquired, the difference is recognised in the income statement.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment Property, plant and equipment Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash inflows independent of the cash inflows of other groups of assets.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is an indication of impairment.
If an indication exists, the group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount of each asset group.
An assets or cash generating units recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
An impairment loss is recognised where the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of assets.
If there is an indication that any previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased, a reversal of the loss may be made only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amounts since the last impairment loss was recognised.
The carrying amount ofthe asset is increased to its recoverable amount only up to the carrying amount that would have resulted, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Impairment losses and any subsequent reversals are recognised in the income statement.
Details of the impairment losses recognised in respect of property, plant and equipment are provided in note 14.
Goodwill Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value maybe impaired.
Impairment is determined by the recoverable amount of an operating segment.
Where this is less than the carrying value of the operating segment an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
This loss cannot be reversed in future periods.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the groups cash generating units or groups of cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Each unit or group of units to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and cannot be larger than an operating segment before aggregation.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, any goodwill associated with theoperation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash generating unit retained.
Goodwill amortised prior to the conversion to IFRS on 3 May 2004 has not been reinstated and the net book value of goodwill at that date has been carried forward as the carrying value.
Prior to May 1998, goodwill was written off to reserves.
Such goodwill has not been reinstated and is not included in determining profit or loss on disposal.
Financial statements 60 Financial statements notes to tHe accounts contInued 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting policies continued Financial instruments Financial instruments are recognised when the group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are fide-recognised when the group no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, normally through sale or when all cash flows attributable to the instrument are passed to an independent third party.
Financial assets Financial assets are classified as either financial assets at fair value through the income statement, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments or available-for-sale financial assets.
The group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and, where appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at each financial year end.
The group makes trade loans to publicans who purchase the groups beer.
Trade loans are non-derivative and are not quoted in an active market and have therefore been designated as Loans and receivables, carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains andlosses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are fide-recognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
The group assesses at each balance sheet date whether any individual trade loan is impaired.
If there is evidence that an impairment loss hasbeen incurred, the amount of loss is measured as the difference between the loans carrying amount and the expected future receipts, excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred, discounted at the loans original effective interest rate.
The loss is recognised inoperating profit.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recorded at their original invoiced amount less an allowance for any doubtful amounts when collection of the full amount is no longer considered probable.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Raw materials are valued at average cost.
Finished goods and work inprogress comprise materials, labour and attributable production overheads where applicable, and are valued at average cost.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Property, plant and equipment held for sale Property, plant and equipment is classified as held for sale only if it is available for sale in its current condition, management are committed tothe sale and a sale is highly probable and expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification.
Property, plant and equipment classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and is no longer depreciated or amortised.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Finance costs and income Finance costs are expensed to the income statement using the effective interest method.
Finance income is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The group uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate loans, notes and bonds.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value, if any, and carried on the balance sheet as an asset or liability.
Subsequent measurement is at fair value determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
If a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting the gain or loss arising on the movement in fair value is recognised in the income statement.
Hedge accounting To qualify for hedge accounting the hedge relationship must be designated and documented at inception.
Documentation must include the groups risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and formal allocation to the item or transaction being hedged.
Thegroup also documents how it will assess the effectiveness of the hedge and carries out assessments on a regular basis to determine whether it has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly effective.
Hedges can be classified as either fair value hedging exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability, or cash flow hedging the variability in cash flows attributable to an asset, liability, or forecast transaction.
The group uses its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.
Cash flow hedge accounting The effective portion of the gain or loss on an interest rate swap is recognised directly in equity, whilst any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period that the financial income or expense is recognised, unlessthe hedged transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability whereby the amounts are transferred to the initialcarrying amount of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, amounts previously recognised in equity are held there until the previously hedged transaction affects profit or loss.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Trade payables Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
co. uk 61 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting policies continued Provisions Provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, when it is probable that anoutflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted to present value, where the effect of the time value of money is material, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market estimates of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The amortisation of the discount is recognised as afinance cost.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits Defined benefit pension schemes The group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes which require contributions to be made into separately administered funds.
The cost of providing benefits under the schemes is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial method on an annual basis.
The current service cost is charged to operating profit.
Any actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the group statement ofcomprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Past service costs are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period or immediately if the benefits have vested.
When a settlement or curtailment occurs the obligation and related scheme assets are re-measured and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement in the same period.
The interest cost on scheme liabilities and the expected return on scheme assets are shown as a net amount in the group income statement.
The defined benefit asset or liability recognised on the balance sheet comprises the present value of the schemes obligations less the fair value of scheme assets.
Defined benefit assets are restricted to the extent that they are considered recoverable.
Defined contribution pension schemes The cost of the groups defined contribution pension schemes amounts to the value of contributions made.
Contributions are charged to the income statement as they become payable.
Post-employment healthcare benefit The group also provided certain additional post-employment healthcare benefits to employees which are unfunded.
The cost of providing these benefits is determined on an estimated accruals basis.
Share-based payments Certain employees and directors receive equity-settled remuneration, whereby they render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
The fair value of the shares and options granted are measured using a Black-Scholes model, at the date at which they were granted.
Noaccount is taken in the fair value calculation of any vesting conditions service and performance, other than market conditions performance linked to the price of the shares of the company.
Any other conditions that are required to be met in order for an employee tobecome fully entitled to an award are considered non-vesting conditions.
Like market performance conditions, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining the grant date fair value.
The fair value of shares and options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity spread over the period in which the vesting conditions are fulfilled ending on the relevant vesting date.
The cumulative amount recognised as an expense reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired, adjusted for the estimated number of shares and options that are ultimately expected to vest.
The periodic charge or credit is the movement in the cumulative position from beginning to end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest provided vesting is not conditional on market or non-vesting conditions.
Thedilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in calculating earnings per share figures.
In accordance with the exemption allowed under IFRS 1 for first time adopters, no expense is recorded in respect of grants made under the above schemes prior to 7 November 2002 which had not vested by the date of transition to IFRS.
However later modifications of such equity instruments are measured using IFRS 2.
Own shares Own shares consist of treasury shares and shares held within an employee benefit trust.
The group has an employee benefit trust for the granting of shares to applicable employees.
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from shareholders equity.
Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such shares isalso recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds from the original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
No gain orloss is recognised in the performance statements on transactions in treasury shares.
Revenue Generally, revenue represents external sales excluding taxes of goods and services, net of discounts.
Revenue is recognised to the extent thatit is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and is measured at the fair value of consideration receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes or duty relating to brewing and packaging of certain products.
Revenue principally consists of drink, food and accommodation sales, which are recognised at the point at which goods or services are provided, rental income, which is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term and machine income, where net takings are recognised as earned.
Operating leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership are classified as operating leases.
Lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease premiums paid on entering into or acquiring operating leases represent prepaid lease payments and are held on the balance sheet as current the portion relating to the next financial period or non-current prepayments.
These are amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Financial statements 62 Financial statements notes to tHe accounts contInued 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting policies continued Taxes Income tax The income tax charge comprises both the income tax payable based on profits for the year and the deferred income tax.
It is calculated using taxation rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
Income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided for using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets andliabilities and their carrying values in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is recognised for all temporary differences except where the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss or, in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and carry forward of unused tax losses only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax losses can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable thatsufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured, on an undiscounted basis, at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are defined as items of income or expense which, because of their nature, size or expected frequency, merit separate presentation to allow a better understanding of the financial performance in the period.
New standards and interpretations not applied As at 29 April 2012 there are a number of standards and interpretations issued by the IASB and IFRIC with an effective date after the date ofthese financial statements and which have not been early adopted by the group.
These are expected to be applied as follows: Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements The amended standard, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012, requires that items included within other comprehensive income are grouped on the basis of whether they are potentially reclassifiable to the group income statement subsequently reclassification adjustments.
The amendments do not address which items are presented in other comprehensive income.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits Revised The revisions eliminate the corridor approach and requires immediate recognition of all actuarial gains and losses in other comprehensive income, immediate recognition of all past service costs and the replacement of interest cost and expected return on plan assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability asset.
The amendments are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Amendment Disclosures of transfer of financial assets This amendment, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011, requires additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures relating to transfers of financial assets.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Amendment and IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation Amendment The amendment to IAS 32, which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, clarifies some of the requirements for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities on the group balance sheet.
The amendment to IFRS 7, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, will affect disclosure only and has no impact on the groups financial position or performance.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement The standard is the first phase in the IASBs work to replace IAS 39 and applies to the classification and measurement of financial instruments as defined in IAS 39.
This standard, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015, establishes two primary measurement categories for financial assets: i amortised cost and ii fair value.
The basis of classification depends on the entitys business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.
In relation to liabilities the change in the fair value of a liability that relate to credit risk must be presented in other comprehensive income.
The remainder of the change in fair value is presented in profit or loss, unless such presentation would create or enlarge the accounting mismatch in profit or loss.
In subsequent phases, the IASB will address, hedge accounting and derecognition.
The group will quantify the effect in conjunction with the other phases, when issued, to present a comprehensive picture.
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements The new standard, which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated financial statements of the parent company.
It also provides additional guidance to assist in the determination of control where this is difficult to assess.
co. uk 63 1 Accounting policies continued New standards and interpretations not applied continued IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements The new standard, which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, has reduced the types of joint arrangement to two: joint operations and joint ventures.
When classifying the type of joint arrangement more focus is given to ensure that it reflects the obligations of the arrangements rather than its legal form.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities The new standard, which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, sets out the required disclosures for entities reporting under IFRS 10 and IFRS 11.
The standard includes disclosure requirements for all forms of interest in other legal entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off balance sheet vehicles.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement The new standard, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, provides a precise definition of fair value and gives guidance on the measurement and enhanced disclosure of fair value where its use is required or permitted by other IFRSs.
IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements Revised The amended standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 and includes provisions on separate financial statements that are left after the control provision of IAS 27 have been included in the new IFRS 10.
IAS 28 Associates and Joint Ventures Amendment Following the issue of IFRS 11 the amendment, effective for accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2013, includes the requirement for joint ventures, as well as associates, to be equity accounted.
Significant accounting judgments and estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting policies that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.
The group bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors deemed reasonable under the circumstances, including any expectations of future events.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and assumptions considered to be significant are detailed below: Taxation Judgment is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot be finally determined until aformal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained.
Tax provisions are made if it is possible that a liability will arise.
The group reviews each significant tax liability or benefit to assess the appropriate accounting treatment.
Share-based payments Judgment is required when calculating the fair value of awards made under the groups share-based payment plans.
Note 8 describes the key assumptions and valuation model inputs used in the determination of these values.
In addition estimates are made of the number of awards that will ultimately vest, judgment is required in relation to the probability of meeting non-market based performance conditions and the continuing participation of employees in the plans.
Pension liabilities The present values of pension liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and depend on a number of actuarial assumptions which aredisclosed in note 9.
Any change in these assumptions will impact on the carrying amount of pension liabilities.
Note 9 describes the key assumptions used intheaccounting for retirement benefit obligations.
Impairment of goodwill The group determines whether goodwill is impaired on at least an annual basis.
Details of the tests and carrying value of the assets are shownin note 13.
This requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the cash generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.
Value-in-use calculations require assumptions to be made regarding the expected future cash flows from the cash generating unit and choice of a suitable discount ratein order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
If the actual cash flows are lower than estimated, future impairments may benecessary.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment The group determines whether property, plant and equipment is impaired where there are indicators of impairment.
This requires an estimation of the value-in-use at a site level.
Value-in-use calculations require assumptions to be made regarding the expected future cash flows from the cash generating unit and choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
Note 14 describes the assumptions used in the impairment testing of property, plant and equipment together with an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in key assumptions.
Residual values Residual values of property are determined with reference to current market property trends.
If residual values were lower than estimated, animpairment of asset value and reassessment of future depreciation charge may be required.
Useful lives are reassessed annually which may lead to an increase or reduction in depreciation accordingly.
Business combinations The group identifies separate assets and liabilities upon acquisition and recognises those assets at their fair value.
The assessment of fair value, particularly for property, plant and equipment acquired, is undertaken with reference to current market conditions.
Note 17 describes the business combinations in the current year and provides details of the fair value adjustments made in arriving at the fairvalue of assets and liabilities acquired.
Property provisions The group provides for its onerous obligations under operating leases where the property is closed or vacant and for properties where rentalexpense isin excess of income.
The estimated timings and amounts of cash flows are determined using the experience of internal andexternal property experts.
However, changes to the expected method of exiting from the obligation could lead to changes in the level ofprovision recorded.
Financial statements 64 Financial statements notes to tHe accounts contInued 2 Segment information The group has determined the following three reportable segments that are largely organised and managed separately according to the nature of products and services provided, brands, distribution channels and profile of customers: Retail: Managed houses and restaurants: Pub Partners: Tenanted and leased houses: and Brewing & Brands: Brewing beer, marketing and selling.
These are also considered to be the groups operating segments and are based on the information presented to the chief executive who isconsidered to be the chief operating decision maker.
Transfer prices between operating segments are set on an arms length basis.

Acquisition costs are items of one-off expenditure incurred in connection with acquisition of businesses in the year.
These costs include legal and professional fees incurred by the group and stamp duty which in accordance with IFRS 3 Revised can no longer be included within the consideration for the acquisition and amount to 3.3m 2011: 1.1m.
In addition, as detailed in note 17, acquisition costs include a charge of 2.5m 2011: 0.3m in respect of amounts payable, two years post acquisition and subject to the future profitability of the businesses, to the former owners of Cloverleaf Restaurants and Realpubs, respectively, who have remained employees of the group.
The credit of 4.4m in respect of post-employment liabilities is as a result of the curtailment of discretionary benefits provided to retired members of the main defined benefit pension scheme.
The 5.5m credit in the prior year resulted following curtailment to discretionary pension payments paid to members of the defined benefit pension scheme retiring early.
The net profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment of 0.2m 2011: 3.6m comprises a total profit on disposal of 7.6m 2011: 8.3m and a total loss on disposal of 7.4m 2011: 4.7m.
Exceptional tax The tax credit on indexation of properties represents the tax impact of movements in RPI during the period on the tax base cost of properties.
The Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968 reduced the rate of corporation tax from 26% to 24% from 1 April 2012.
The effect of the new rate is to reduce the deferred tax provision by a net 8.8m, comprising a credit to the group income statement of 12.2m, a debit to group statement of comprehensive income of 3.2m and a debit of 0.2m to the group statement of changes in equity.
The adjustment in respect of prior periods is in respect of 1.6m deferred taxation on revaluation and rolled over gains on land and buildings, and 4.7m reversal of tax relief previously taken on intra group transactions.
The 2.0m finance costs relate to the adjustment of prior period tax.

In prior periods executive share option plans ESOS were also operated.
The general terms of each plan are detailed in the directors remuneration report on pages 45 to 47.

Financial statements 68 Financial statements notes to tHe accounts contInued 8 Share-based payment plans continued The fair value of equity-settled options and LTIP contingently issued shares are estimated using a Black-Scholes model.
The fair value of the grants and model inputs used to calculate the fair values of grants during the period were as follows: 2012 LTIP SAYE Weighted average share price 455p 522p Exercise price 387p Expected dividend yield 4.9% 4.9% Risk-free rate of return 1.4% 0.6% Volatility 42.9% 33.2% Expected life years 3.0 3.3 Weighted average fair value of grants in the year 393p 133p 2011 LTIP SAYE Weighted average share price 413p 474p Exercise price 368p Expected dividend yield 4.5% 4.5% Risk-free rate of return 1.3% 1.9% Volatility 49.0% 47.1% Expected life years 3.0 3.3 Weighted average fair value of grants in the year 354p 158p Risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds with the same life as the expected option life.
Expected volatility isbased on historical volatility of the companys share price which assumes that the past trend in share price movement is indicative of future trends.
Expected life of options has been taken as the mid-point of the relevant exercise period.
This is not necessarily indicative of future exercise patterns.
No other feature of the equity instruments granted was incorporated into the fair value measurement.

The weighted average remaining contractual life was 2.6 years for the ESOS 2011: 5.7 years and 3.0 years for the SAYE scheme 2011: 2.7 years.
Deferred share bonus scheme Selected senior executives participate in a deferred share bonus scheme.
Awards made under this scheme are based on a percentage of salary and are paid in shares.
Awards are made to eligible employees on the achievement of corporate targets and vest once required service periods are completed.
During the year 0.1m shares were purchased to fulfil awards made in 2010 11 under this scheme.
9 Pensions The group maintains a defined contribution scheme, which is open to all new employees, and three defined benefit schemes.
The group also has a past service liability in relation to post-employment medical benefits offered to employees to cover any medical costs after employment.
The benefit is no longer given to new employees.
Defined contribution pension scheme Member funds for the defined contribution scheme are held and administered by the Prudential Assurance Company.
The total cost recognised in operating profit for the period was 1.9m 2011: 1.6m.
Defined benefit pension schemes and post-employment benefits The group maintains the following defined benefit schemes which are all closed to new entrants and have had full actuarial valuations inthelast three years: Greene King Pension Scheme closed 2 May 1997, last valued as at 5 April 2009, Belhaven Pension Scheme closed 31October 2005, last valued as at 4 May 2011, and the Hardys & Hansons Pension Scheme closed 1 July 2003, last valued as at 30 April 2009.
Member funds for the defined benefit schemes are held in separate funds independently of the groups finances and are administered by pension trustees.
Pension benefits are related to members final salary at retirement and their length of service.
The group has opted to recognise all actuarial gains and losses immediately via the statement of comprehensive income.
The total cost recognised in the income statement was: Pension schemes Post-employment benefits 2012 2011 2012 2011 m m m m Current service cost 4.2 4.6 Curtailments 5.5 4.4 Total recognised in operating profit 4.2 0.9 4.4 Expected return on pension scheme assets 17.6 15.7 Interest on scheme liabilities 15.0 15.6 0.3 0.3 Total finance income cost recognised 2.6 0.1 0.3 0.3 During the year there was a curtailment to discretionary post-employment benefits provided to retired members of the defined benefit pension scheme which resulted in an exceptional credit to the income statement of 4.4m see note 5.
The credit in the prior year of 5.5m resulted following a curtailment to discretionary pension payments paid to members of the defined benefit pension scheme who retired early.
The total charge recognised in the statement of comprehensive income was: Pension schemes Post-employment benefits 2012 2011 2012 2011 m m m m Actual return on scheme assets 1.9 26.1 Less: expected return on scheme assets 17.6 15.7 Experience gains and losses on scheme assets 19.5 10.4 Experience gains arising on scheme liabilities 2.4 0.7 Losses gains arising on scheme liabilities due to changes in actuarial assumptions 16.0 8.1 Actuarial loss gain recognised through equity 33.1 19.2 In July 2010 the government changed the statutory rate of inflation to which pension increases are linked from RPI to CPI.
The effect of this change on the groups pension schemes in the prior year was to reduce the total liability by 3.7m.
This adjustment was reflected within the actuarial gain on scheme liabilities arising from changes in actuarial assumptions.

The values of the schemes liabilities have been determined by a qualified actuary based on the results of the last actuarial valuation, updated to 29 April 2012 using the following principal actuarial assumptions: 2012 2011 Discount rate 4.7% 5.4% Expected rates of salary increases 4.0% 4.3% Expected pension payment increases 2.9% 3.2% Rate of inflation RPI 3.0% 3.3% Rate of inflation CPI 2.3% 2.8% Healthcare cost increase 9.0% 9.0% The mortality assumptions imply the following expectations of years of life from age 65: Man currently aged 40 23.6 23.0 Woman currently aged 40 26.2 25.7 Man currently aged 65 21.2 21.1 Woman currently aged 65 24.0 23.9 Mortality assumptions are based on standard tables adjusted for scheme experience and with an allowance for future improvement inlifeexpectancy.
Overall expected rate of return on assets is established by applying brokers forecasts to each category of scheme asset.

Factors that may affect future tax charges In addition to the reduction in the rate of corporation tax from 26% to 24% during the period it is proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 22% by 1 April 2014.
These further reductions had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and consequently are not included in these financial statements.
The effect of these proposals would be to reduce the deferred tax liability by a further 6.7m.

12 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of 102.4m 2011: 106.8m by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period excluding own shares held of 215.0m 2011: 214.8m.
Diluted earnings per share has been calculated on a similar basis taking account of 0.6m 2011: 0.6m dilutive potential shares under option, giving a weighted average number of ordinary shares adjusted for the effect of dilution of 215.6m 2011: 215.4m.
Share options granted over 0.5m shares 2011: 0.6m have not been included in the diluted earnings per share calculation because they are anti-dilutive at the year end.
The performance conditions for share options granted over 2.9m 2011: 1.9m shares have not been met in the current financial period and therefore the dilutive effect of the number of shares which would have been issued at the period end has not been included in the diluted earnings per share calculation.
Adjusted earnings per share excludes the effect of exceptional items and is presented to show the underlying performance of the group on both a basic and dilutive basis.

13 Goodwill m Cost At 2 May 2010 679.7 Acquired through business combinations note 17 26.1 At 1 May 2011 705.8 Acquired through business combinations note 17 23.5 At 29 April 2012 729.3 All goodwill was purchased as part of business combinations.
As from 3 May 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, goodwill is no longer amortised but is subject to annual impairment testing.
Goodwill has been allocated to operating segments, the lowest group of cash generating units in the group at which goodwill is monitored internally, based on the extent that the benefits of acquisitions flow to that segment.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated 354.0m 2011: 330.5m to Retail, 160.8m 2011: 160.8m to Pub Partners, and 214.5m 2011: 214.5m to Brewing & Brands.
The recoverable amount of each segment was determined on a value-in use basis, using cash flow projections based on one year budgets approved by the board, and in all cases exceeded the carrying amount.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are the pre-tax discount rate and the growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budgeted period.
Cash flows are discounted at 9.0% 2011: 9.0% which is used as an approximation for the risk-adjusted discount rate of the relevant operating segment.
A growth rate of 2.0% 2011: 2.0% has been used to extrapolate cash flows.
The growth rate is considered a conservative rate and is below the long-term average growth rate for the industry.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The calculation is most sensitive to changes in the assumptions used for budgeted cash flow, pre-tax discount rate and growth rate.
Management considers that reasonable possible changes in assumptions would be an increase in discount of 1% point, a reduction in growth rate of 1% point or a 10% reduction in budgeted cash flow.
As an indication of sensitivity, when applied to the value-in-use calculation none of these changes would have resulted in an impairment of goodwill in the period.

A representative sample of properties was also valued by external valuers, Gerald Eve Chartered Surveyors and Property Consultants, who confirmed that the values were consistent with their appraisal.
Frozen revaluation has been taken as deemed cost on the transition to IFRS, therefore no historic cost analysis is provided.
Up to 1999 the brewery and depots were valued at depreciated replacement cost and other properties at open market value.
These valuations have been retained but they have not been updated.

These are analysed between the groups principal reporting segments as shown below: 2012 2011 m m Retail 2.5 8.9 Pub Partners 19.6 20.5 22.1 29.4 The group considers that each of its individual pubs is a cash generating unit CGU.
Each CGU is reviewed annually for indicators ofimpairment.
When indicators of impairment are identified the carrying value of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount.
Therecoverable amount is the higher of the CGUs fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use.
The group estimates value-in-use using a discounted cash flow model.
The key assumptions used are the discount rate applied to cash flow projections of 9% 2011: 9% and the projected cash flows extrapolated using an average growth rate of 2% 2011: 2% which is below the long-term average growth rate for the industry.
Other commercial assumptions relating to individual CGUs have been made based on historic trends adjusted for managements estimates of medium-term trading prospects.
The impairment recognised in the Retail and Pub Partners estates are primarily the result of the reduced trading performance of a relatively small number of pubs due to a combination of site specific trading circumstances and the general weakening of the UK consumer environment seen in the year.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The level of impairment is predominantly dependent upon judgments used in arriving at fair values, future growth rates and the discount rate applied to cash flow projections.
The impact on the impairment charge of applying different assumptions to the growth rates used to calculate cash flow projections and in the pre-tax discount rates would be as follows: Increased impairment resulting from a 10% reduction in fair value: 2012 2011 m m Retail 0.4 1.9 Pub Partners 3.6 4.2 4.0 6.1 Increased impairment resulting from a 1% increase in discount rate: 2012 2011 m m Retail 0.8 1.7 Pub Partners 3.3 2.9 4.1 4.6 Increased impairment resulting from a 1% reduction in growth rate: 2012 2011 m m Retail 0.8 1.7 Pub Partners 3.3 2.9 4.1 4.6 Greene King plc Annual report 2012 www.

Goodwill has arisen primarily due to expected operating synergies and the difference between property portfolio value and value-in-use.
The fair value of properties acquired was established following a review of properties that was carried out by qualified surveyors employed bythe group.
Properties have been revalued at their existing use value.
The values of other current assets and liabilities have been adjusted to amounts to be realised or paid respectively.
Since 3 September 2011 The Capital Pub Company has contributed revenue of 20.6m and operating profits of 4.2m.

Any amounts drawn down bear interest at a margin above LIBOR, with commitment payments on the undrawn portions.
Interest is payable at each renewal date which vary in maturity.
Although any individual draw-downs are repayable within twelve months of the balance sheet date, the group expects to renew this funding.
Immediate renewal is available under the 400m facility until April 2016.
Final repayment of the total drawn-down balance is due as one payment on the agreement repayment date.
Securitised debt The group has issued various tranches of bonds totalling 1,500.0m, in connection with the securitisation of 2,035 of the groups pubs held in Greene King Retailing Limited at the date of the most recent tap.
The bonds are secured over the properties and their future income streams and were issued by Greene King Finance plc.
Includes the effect of interest rate swaps and future step-ups.
Carrying value is net of related deferred finance fees.
Repayment of nominal is made by quarterly instalments, in accordance with the repayment schedule, over the period shown above.
Payment of interest is made on quarterly dates for all classes of bond.
All of the floating rate bonds are fully hedged using interest rate swaps.
The Class A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5 bonds rank pari passu in point of security and as to payment of interest and principal, and have preferential interest payment and repayment rights over the Class AB1 and Class B bonds.
The Class B1 and B2 bonds rank pari passu in point of security, principal repayment and interest payment.
The Class AB1 bonds rank pari passu in point of security and as to payment of interest and principal, and have preferential interest payment and repayment rights over the Class B bonds.
The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Greene King Retailing Limited, a group company.
These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions on its ability to move cash to other group companies.
Loan notes unsecured The loan notes issued during 2006 in connection with the Hardys & Hansons acquisition matured in September 2011.
24 Financial instruments The primary treasury objectives of the group are to identify and manage the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business needs, and provide secure and competitively priced funding for the activities of the group.
If appropriate, the group uses financial instruments and derivatives to manage these risks.
The principal financial instruments held for the purpose of raising finance for operations are bank loans and overdraft, securitised bonds, loan notes, cash and short term deposits.
Other financial instruments arise directly from the operations of the group, such as trade receivables, payables, and trade loans.
Derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, are used to manage the interest rate risks related to the groups operations and financing sources.
No speculative trading in derivative financial instruments is undertaken.
The main risks from the groups financial instruments are cash flow risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The policy for managing each of these risks is set out overleaf.
Financial statements 82 Financial statements notes to tHe accounts contInued 24 Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk Exposure to changes in interest rates on the groups borrowings is reviewed with regard to the maturity profile and cash flows of the underlying debt.
The group uses a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate debt with exposure to market interest rate fluctuations primarily arising from the floating rate instruments.
The group operates a policy that no less than 95% of the overall interest exposure should be hedged.
The group enters into interest rate swaps to manage the exposure.
The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges at the date of contract included within the accounts, and tested for effectiveness every six months.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by changes in interestrates This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio of fixed to floating interest rates, and on the basis of the hedging instruments in place at 29 April 2012 and 1 May 2011.
The analysis relates only to balances at these dates and is not representative of the year as a whole.
The following assumptions were made: balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt and deposits does not change as interest rates move: gains and losses are recognised within equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies of the group: and cash flow hedges were assumed to be effective or ineffective on the same basis as those as at the year end.
An explanation for the split between those hedges that were effective at the year end and those that were ineffective is detailed within the cash flow hedging note.
Based on the groups net position at the year end, a 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would change the groups profit before tax by approximately 0.1m 2011: 0.3m and the groups equity by 101.9m 2011: 87.7m.
Liquidity risk The group mitigates liquidity risk by managing cash generated by its operations combined with bank borrowings and long-term debt.
The groups objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts and bank loans.
Thegroup also monitors the maturity of financial liabilities to avoid the risk of a shortage of funds.
The standard payment terms that the company has with its suppliers is 60 days following month end 2011: 60 days following month end.
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interest-bearing deposit with maturities fixed at no more than one month.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of short-term borrowing on the money markets.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the groups financial liabilities at 29 April 2012 and 1 May 2011 based on contractual undiscounted payments including interest.

Receivable balances are also monitored on an ongoing basis and provided against where deemed necessary to limit the exposure to bad debts to a non-significant level.
Other financial assets includes trade loans and cash.
Credit risk is the risk of default by the counterparty to discharge their obligation and the maximum exposure of the group is the carrying amount of these instruments.
There is no requirement for collateral and there are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the group.
co. uk 83 24 Financial instruments continued Cash flow hedging At 29 April 2012 the group held 4 2011: 1 interest rate swap contracts for a nominal value of 140m 2011: 40m, designated as a hedge of the cash flow interest rate risk of the 206.6m 2011: 110m draw-down from the variable credit facility in the year.
The interest rate swaps are held on the balance sheet as a fair value liability of 2.4m 2011: 0.3m.
The cash flows occur quarterly with the group receiving a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR and paying a weighted average fixed rate of 1.645% 2011: 2.618%.
The contract maturity dates are between December 2013 and May 2016.
At 29 April 2012 the group held 5 2011: 5 interest rate swap contracts for a nominal value of 695.7m 2011: 719.6m, entered into as part of the securitisation and subsequent securitisation taps.
A fair value net liability of 198.4m 2011: 116.0m has been recognised on the balance sheet in respect of these contracts which are designated cash flow hedges against 695.7m 2011: 719.6m of variable rate bonds, receiving a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR and paying a weighted average fixed rate of 5.106% 2011: 4.834%.
The contract maturity dates are December 2034 and March 2036.
The bonds and interest rate swaps have the same critical terms.
Changes in cash flow hedge fair values are recognised in the hedging reserve to the extent that the hedges are effective.
The percentage of debt that was fixed as at the year end was 97.4% 2011: 98.0% in line with the groups policy of fixing at least 95% of all debt.
Interest rate risk The following tables set out the groups exposure to interest rate risk and the maturity profile for each class of interest-bearing financial asset and financial liability.
The interest on fixed rate financial instruments isfixed until the maturity of the instrument.
Investments, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables are not included above asthey are non-interest bearing and are not subject to interest rate risk.
Fair values Set out in the table below is a comparison of carrying amounts and fair values of all of the groups financial instruments.
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation or sale.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: Cash and cash equivalents comprising cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits approximates to the carrying amount stated intheaccounts.
Financial assets these are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method and fair value is deemed to be the same as this.
Short-term loans and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Long-term loans based on quoted market prices in the case of the securitised debt: approximates to the carrying amount in the case ofthefloating rate bank loans and other variable rate borrowings.

Hierarchical classification of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value IFRS 7 requires that the classification of financial instruments at fair value be determined by reference to the source of inputs used to derive fair value.
The classification uses the following three-level hierarchy: Level 1 unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly orindirectly.
Level 3 techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.

Capital risk management The group aims to maximise shareholder value by maintaining a strong credit rating and a core level of debt which optimises the weighted average cost of capital WACC and shareholder value.
A number of mechanisms are used to manage debt and equity levels together referred to as capital, as appropriate in the light of economic and trading conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the period.
The group monitors capital using interest cover and several other measures including fixed charged cover, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and free cash flow debt service coverage.
Interest cover is calculated by dividing operating profit before exceptional items by net finance costs before exceptional items note 7.
For the period to 29 April 2012 interest cover was 2.7x 2011: 2.7x.
