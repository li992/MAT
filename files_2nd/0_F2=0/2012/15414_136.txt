Financial Statements 37 Acquisitions and disposals Acquisitions G. C. Hahn & Co 2012 During the year to 31 March 2008, the Group acquired 80% of the issued share capital of G. C. Hahn & Co. Hahn from Georg Hahn Familien GmbH.
As the Group effectively bore all the risks and rewards for 100% of this business, a non-controlling interest was not recognised in the financial statements at the date of acquisition.
The acquisition agreement allowed for the Group to acquire the remaining 20% of the issued share capital of Hahn through put and call options at various times.
During the financial year, following the exercise of a put option by Georg Hahn Familien GmbH, the Group acquired the final 5% of the issued share capital of the business for a total consideration of 7 million, and has now acquired 100% of the issued share capital.
Disposals International Sugar Trading 2012 On 12 October 2011, the Group completed the sale of its minority holdings in sugar refineries in Egypt and Saudi Arabia relating to the former International Sugar Trading business and received 18 million in cash consideration.
After recycling revaluation gains to the income statement, the Group has recorded an exceptional gain of 11 million Note 7.
EU Sugars and Molasses 2011 During the prior year the Group completed the disposal of its EU Sugars operations to American Sugar Holdings ASR, Inc.
The disposal comprised an asset sale of the Thames Sugar Refinery and its associated businesses in London and a share sale of Alcantara Empreendimentos SGPS, SA, Tate & Lyle Norge AS and Eridania Tate & Lyle SpA.
In May 2011, the Group announced that the process to agree completion statements on the sale of EU Sugars to ASR was ongoing and that items totalling 54 million were outstanding and were expected to be submitted for adjudication by an independent expert.
The experts decision, notified to the parties on 8 May 2012, strongly supported the Groups position and as a result, substantially all of the working capital adjustments proposed by ASR were reversed, and there is no further adjustment required to the loss on disposal recognised in the prior year.
The experts decision is final and binding on both parties and therefore finalises the completion statements.
The receivable outstanding at 31 March 2012 has been settled subsequent to the balance sheet date.
During the prior year the Group also completed the disposal of its Molasses business to W&R Barnett Ltd. Total consideration was 66 million.
During the current year, post-completion adjustments were agreed and the Group received a cash inflow of 1 million in respect of working capital settlements.
