I Notes to the Group Financial Statements II 1.
Authorisation of financial statements & statement of compliance III The consolidated financial statements of The Weir Group PLC the Company and its subsidiaries together, the Group for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2012 2012 were approved and authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 27 February 2013.
The comparative information is presented for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2011 2011.
For practical reasons, the Group prepares its financial statements to the week ending closest to the Company reference date of 31 December.
The results on this basis are IV unlikely to be materially different from those that would be presented for a period of one year.
The Weir Group PLC is a limited company incorporated in Scotland and is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The consolidated financial statements of The Weir Group PLC have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The principal activities of the Group are described in note 3.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation These financial statements are presented in sterling.
All values are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million pounds m except when otherwise indicated.
In order to provide the users of the financial statements with a more relevant presentation of the Groups underlying performance, profit for each financial year has been analysed between: i profit before exceptional items and intangibles amortisation: and ii the effect of exceptional items and intangibles amortisation.
Exceptional items are items of income and expense which, because of the nature, size and or infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow a better understanding of the elements of the Groups financial performance for the period and are presented on the face of the income statement to facilitate comparisons with prior periods and assessment of trends in financial performance.
Exceptional items may include but are not restricted to: profits or losses arising on disposal of businesses or on closure of businesses: the cost of significant business restructuring: significant impairments of intangible or tangible assets: adjustments to the fair value of acquisition related items such as contingent consideration and inventory: other items deemed exceptional due to their signicance, size or nature: and the related exceptional taxation.
b. Intangibles amortisation, including impairment, has been shown separately to provide visibility over the impact of increased acquisition activity on intangible assets.
Further analysis of the items included in the column Exceptional items & intangibles amortisation is provided in note 5 to the financial statements.
During the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2012, the provisional fair values attributed to the 2011 acquisitions of Weir International and Seaboard were nalised.
In accordance with IFRS3, the net impact of the adjustments to the provisional fair values has been recognised by means of a decrease to goodwill and the adjustments to the provisional amounts have been recognised as if the accounting for the business combinations had been completed at the relevant acquisition dates.
As such, all affected balances and amounts have been restated in the financial statements.
To this effect, the Consolidated Balance Sheet and affected notes present restated comparative information as at 30 December 2011.
The Consolidated Income Statement for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2011 has been restated to reect 0.7m amortisation of customer relationships.
Further details of the adjustments made to the provisional fair values can be found in note 13.
In addition, the provisional fair values attributed to the acquisition of Novatech in February 2012 were also nalised during the period and details can be found in note 13.
The accounting policies which follow are consistent with those of the previous periods except for the adoption of the following standards and interpretations which have not had a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
IFRS7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure Amendment IAS12 Income Taxes Amendment Deferred Taxes: Recovery of Underlying Assets Use of estimates & judgements The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
Details of the significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are described in the Financial Review on page 36 and in notes 14 and 24.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 89 Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements Continued 2.
Accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include results, cash ows and assets and liabilities of The Weir Group PLC and its subsidiaries, and the Groups share of its joint ventures results.
The financial statements of subsidiaries and joint ventures are prepared for the same reporting period as the Company using consistent accounting policies.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled, either directly or indirectly, by the Company, where control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefit from its activities.
The results of a subsidiary acquired during the period are included in the Groups results from the effective date on which control is transferred to the Group.
The results of a subsidiary sold during the period are included in the Groups results up to the effective date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
All intragroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that are not held by the Group and are presented within equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, separately from the Company shareholders equity.
Joint ventures The Group has a number of long-term contractual arrangements with other parties which represent joint ventures.
These all take the form of agreements to share control over other entities jointly controlled entities.
The Groups interests in the results and assets and liabilities of its jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method.
These investments are carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets less any impairment in value.
The income statement reects the share of results of operations of these investments after tax.
Where there has been a change recognised directly in the investees equity, the Group recognises its share of any changes and discloses this when applicable in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a joint venture, representing the excess of the cost of the investment over the Groups share of the net fair value of the joint ventures identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, is included in the carrying amount of the joint venture and is not amortised.
To the extent that the net fair value of the joint ventures identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the cost of the investment, a gain is recognised and added to the Groups share of the joint ventures profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.
Foreign currency translation The financial statements for each of the Groups subsidiaries and joint ventures are prepared using their functional currency.
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates.
At entity level, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the entitys functional currency at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Currency translation differences are recognised in the income statement except when hedge accounting is applied and for differences on monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the Groups net investment in a foreign operation.
These are recognised in other comprehensive income until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in profit or loss.
On consolidation, the results of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rate for the period and their assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Currency translation differences, including those on monetary items that form part of a net investment in a foreign operation, are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve.
In the event that a foreign operation is sold, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement is determined after taking into account the cumulative currency translation differences that are attributable to the operation.
As permitted by IFRS1, the Group elected to deem cumulative currency translation differences to be nil as at 27 December 2003.
Accordingly, the gain or loss on disposal of a foreign operation does not include currency translation differences arising before 27 December 2003.
In the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the cash ows of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rate for the period.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benets will ow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is shown net of sales taxes, discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on dispatch of the goods, and can be reliably measured.
Revenue from the sales of services and revenue from construction contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion where the outcome can be estimated reliably, otherwise it is recognised to the extent costs are incurred.
The stage of completion of a contract is determined either by reference to the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, or by reference to the completion of a physical proportion of the contract work.
The basis used is dependent upon the nature of the underlying contract and takes into account the degree to which the physical proportion of the work is subject to formal customer acceptance procedures.
Losses on contracts are recognised in the period when such losses become probable.
90 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 I II Property, plant & equipment III The Group elected to use previous UK GAAP revaluations of land and buildings, amounting to 10.5m, prior to 27 December 2003 as deemed cost at the date of the revaluation.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses.
Cost includes IV borrowing costs for qualifying assets for which the commencement date for capitalisation is on or after 1 January 2009.
Prior to this date, the Group recognised all borrowing costs as an expense immediately.
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land and assets under construction, is provided on a straight-line basis so as to charge the cost less residual value, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date, to the income statement over the expected useful life of the asset concerned, and is in the following ranges: Freehold buildings, long leasehold land & buildings 10 40 years Short leasehold land & buildings duration of lease Plant & equipment 3 20 years Investment property Until December 2011, the Group owned one property which was classied as investment property on the basis that it was being held to earn rentals and for capital appreciation rather than for use in the production or supply of goods and services.
This property was sold in December 2011.
Investment property was stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation was provided on a straight-line basis over 40 years.
Goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents any excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the Groups interest in the fair value of the entitys identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities determined at the date of acquisition.
Acquisition costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
Goodwill in respect of an acquired subsidiary is recognised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses.
Where the fair value of the interest acquired in an entitys assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the consideration paid, the excess is recognised immediately as a gain in the income statement.
Goodwill recognised as an asset as at 27 December 2003 is recorded at its carrying amount at that date and is not amortised.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the unit.
Goodwill that was written off directly to reserves under UK GAAP is not taken into account in determining the gain or loss on disposal of acquired businesses on or after 27 December 2003.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred is recognised at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration, which is deemed to be an asset or a liability, will be recognised in accordance with IAS39 in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any recognised impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured at cost on initial recognition.
An intangible resource acquired in a business combination is recognised as an intangible asset if it is separable from the acquired business or arises from contractual or legal rights, is expected to generate future economic benets and its fair value can be measured reliably.
An intangible asset with a nite life is amortised on a straightline basis so as to charge its cost, which in respect of an acquired intangible asset represents its fair value at the acquisition date, to the income statement over its expected useful life.
An intangible asset with an indefinite life is not amortised but is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses.
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset.
Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis so as to charge the cost of the software to the income statement over its expected useful life, not exceeding eight years.
The expected useful lives of the acquired intangible assets are as follows: Brand names indefinite life Customer relationships 5 25 years Purchased software 4 8 years Intellectual property & trade marks 6 15 years Other up to 6 years The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 91 Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements Continued 2.
Accounting policies continued Research & development costs All research expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Development expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred unless it relates to the development of a new product and it is incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the product has been proven, the development costs can be measured reliably, future economic benets are probable and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset.
Any such capitalised development expenditure is amortised on a straight-line basis so that it is charged to the income statement over the expected life of the resulting product.
Impairment of non-current assets All non-current assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values might be impaired.
Additionally, goodwill, intangible assets with an indefinite life and any capitalised development expenditure are subject to an annual impairment test.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that an assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount, which represents the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
An assets value in use represents the present value of the future cash ows expected to be derived from the asset.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is conducted for the cash-generating unit to which it belongs.
Similarly, the recoverable amount of goodwill is determined by reference to the discounted future cash ows of the cash-generating units to which it is allocated.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in previous periods for an asset other than goodwill are reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount.
The carrying amount of an asset shall not be increased above the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior periods.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill are not reversed.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, with due allowance for any obsolete or slow moving items.
Cost represents the expenditure incurred in bringing inventories to their existing location and condition and comprises the cost of raw materials, direct labour costs, other direct costs and related production overheads.
Raw material cost is generally determined on a first in, first out basis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell.
Financial assets & liabilities The Groups principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, short-term borrowings, loans and xed rate notes, cash and short-term deposits.
The Group also has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations.
A financial asset is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modied, such an exchange or modication is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
Trade receivables Trade receivables, which generally are of a short dated nature, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Cash & cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits available on demand and other short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity on acquisition of three months or less and bank overdrafts and short-term borrowings with a maturity on acquisition of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are presented as current liabilities to the extent that there is no right of offset with cash balances.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount.
Interest-bearing loans & borrowings Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Borrowings are classied as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
92 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 I II Provisions III A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, the obligation can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outow of economic benets will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ows at a pre-tax rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specic to the liability.
IV Derivative financial instruments & hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts and cross currency swaps, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate movements.
The Group also uses foreign currency borrowings as a hedge of its exposure to foreign exchange risk on its investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Additionally, the Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risk.
The Group does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash ows based on spot and forward foreign exchange rates.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash ows based on interest rate curves and spot foreign exchange rates.
Changes in their fair values have been recognised in the income statement, except where hedge accounting is used, provided the conditions specified by IAS39 are met.
Hedge accounting is applied in respect of hedge relationships where it is both permissible under IAS39 and practical to do so.
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships will be classied as fair value hedges, cash ow hedges or net investment hedges.
Where the hedging relationship is classied as a fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability will be adjusted by the increase or decrease in its fair value attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss will be recognised in the income statement where, to the extent that the hedge is effective, it will be offset by the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument.
Where the hedging relationship is classied as a cash ow hedge or as a net investment hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument will be recognised directly in other comprehensive income rather than in the income statement.
When the hedged item is recognised in the financial statements, the accumulated gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income will be either recycled to the income statement or, if the hedged item results in a non-financial asset, will be recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is kept in other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are recognised separately as derivative financial instruments when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not stated at its fair value with changes in its fair value recognised in the income statement.
Share-based payments Equity settled share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the Executive Bonus Scheme EBS and as a consequence of occasional one-off conditional awards made to senior executives.
The fair value of the LTIP at the date of the grant is calculated using appropriate option pricing models and the cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Adjustments are made to reect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service or performance conditions.
The EBS is determined as a percentage of the annual bonus.
This percentage is matched by the Group with a share award that will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date provided the individual continues to hold the original bonus shares awarded and continues to be employed by the company at the date of vesting.
The EBS includes a strategic bonus shares element for a limited number of senior employees.
The fair value of the matching and strategic elements of the EBS is determined at the date of grant of the bonus and the cost is recognised on a straight line basis over the vesting period.
The Group recognises a compensation cost in respect of this plan that is based on the fair value of the awards.
The fair value is determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently re-measured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modied.
As permitted by IFRS1, the Group has applied IFRS2 Share-based Payment retrospectively only to equity settled awards that were granted on or after 7 November 2002 and had not vested as at 1 January 2005.
Treasury shares The Weir Group PLC shares held by the Company are classied in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken directly to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in total comprehensive income on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 93 Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements Continued 2.
Accounting policies continued Post-employment benets Post-employment benets comprise pension benets provided to employees throughout the world and other benets, primarily postretirement healthcare, provided to certain employees in the United States.
For dened benefit plans, the cost is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is recognised over the average expected remaining service lives of participating employees, in accordance with the advice of qualied actuaries.
Past service costs resulting from enhanced benets are recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, or immediately if the benets have vested.
Actuarial gains and losses, which represent differences between the expected and actual returns on the plan assets and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
The dened benefit liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet comprises the net total for each plan of the present value of the benefit obligation, using a discount rate based on appropriate high quality corporate bonds, at the balance sheet date, minus any past service costs not yet recognised, minus the fair value of the plan assets, if any, at the balance sheet date.
Where a plan is in surplus, the asset recognised is limited to the amount of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any amount which the Group expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in future contributions.
For dened contribution plans, the costs represent the Groups contributions to the plans and these are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.
Leases Leases which transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classied as finance leases.
All other leases are classied as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are included within property, plant and equipment, initially measured at their fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments and a corresponding liability is recognised within obligations under finance leases.
Subsequently, the assets are depreciated on a basis consistent with similar owned assets or the lease term if shorter.
At the inception of the lease, the lease rentals are apportioned between an interest element and a capital element so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the outstanding liability.
Subsequently, the interest element is recognised as a charge to the income statement while the capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding liability.
Operating lease rentals and any incentives receivable are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Taxation Current tax is the amount of tax payable or recoverable in respect of the taxable profit or loss for the period.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base with the following exceptions: i Deferred tax arising from the initial recognition of goodwill, or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, is not recognised: ii Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future: iii A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets represent tax recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unutilised tax losses and the carry forward of unused tax credits.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except if it relates to an item recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised directly in equity.
94 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 I II New standards & interpretations III The International Accounting Standards Board and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee have issued the following standards and interpretations, which are considered relevant to the Group, with an effective date after the date of these financial statements.
International Accounting Standards IAS IFRS Effective date for periods commencing IV IAS1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income Amendments to IAS1 1 July 2012 IAS19 Employee Benets Revised 1 January 2013 IFRS13 Fair Value Measurement 1 January 2013 IFRS10, IFRS11 and IFRS12 Transition Guidance Amendments to IFRS10, IFRS11 and IFRS12 1 January 2013 IFRS10 Consolidated Financial Statements 1 January 2014 IFRS11 Joint Arrangements 1 January 2014 IFRS12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 1 January 2014 IAS32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Amendments to IAS32 1 January 2014 IFRS9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2015 not yet adopted for use in the European Union The above standards and interpretations will be adopted in accordance with their effective dates and have not been adopted in these financial statements.
The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application with the exception of IAS19 Revised.
Under IAS19 Revised, there will be no impact on the disclosed dened benefit obligation.
The net charge to the Income Statement will increase by approximately 3m following the introduction of the concept of recognising net interest on the net dened benefit obligation in place of the interest on the dened benefit obligation and the expected return on plan assets recognised under the current standard.
For the standards with a later effective date, the directors are in the process of assessing the likely impact and look to nalisation of the standards before formalising their view.
Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into three operating divisions: Minerals, Oil & Gas and Power & Industrial.
These three divisions are organised and managed separately based on the key markets served and each is treated as an operating segment and a reportable segment under IFRS8.
The operating and reportable segments were determined based on the reports reviewed by the Chief Executive which are used to make operational decisions.
The Minerals segment is the global leader in the provision of slurry handling equipment and associated aftermarket support for abrasive high wear applications used in the mining and oil sands markets.
The Oil & Gas segment provides products and service solutions to upstream, production, transportation, rening and related industries.
The Power & Industrial segment designs and manufactures valves, pumps and turbines as well as providing specialist support services to the global power generation, industrial and oil and gas sectors.
All other segments, which are disclosed as Group companies, include the results of LGE process which supplies equipment to the liqueed petroleum gas marine and onshore markets.
This business was sold on 28 December 2012 note 5.
The Chief Executive assesses the performance of the operating segments based on operating profit from continuing operations before exceptional items and intangibles amortisation, including impairment segment result.
Finance income and expenditure and associated interest-bearing liabilities and derivative financial instruments are not allocated to segments as all treasury activity is managed centrally by the Group treasury function.
The amounts provided to the Chief Executive with respect to assets and liabilities are measured in a manner consistent with that of the financial statements.
The assets are allocated based on the operations of the segment and the physical location of the asset.
The liabilities are allocated based on the operations of the segment.
Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.

In the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2012, the fair values of Seaboard and Weir International have been nalised resulting in adjustments to the provisional fair values attributed.
The following table summarises the adjustments made to the provisional fair values during the period.
The contribution of Novatech to revenue and to profit for the period from continuing operations after exceptional items and intangibles amortisation was not material and so has not been separately disclosed.
The combined revenue and profit for the period from continuing operations after exceptional items and intangibles amortisation of the Group, assuming that Novatech had been acquired at the start of 2012, would have been 2,544.9m and 313.9m respectively.
The revenue and operating profit of Gema have not been disclosed as they are deemed to be immaterial.
Acquisition costs in relation to Novatech of 0.3m have been included within operating profit.

Impairment testing of goodwill & intangible assets with indefinite lives Goodwill acquired through business combinations and intangible assets with indefinite lives have been allocated at acquisition to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The acquisition of Seaboard at the end of 2011 has been determined to be a separate CGU and Novatech, acquired in February 2012, has been included in Other.
The previous year acquisition of Weir International was included in Other.
The amounts included in Other are not considered significant in comparison to their respective total carrying amounts.
The carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives has been allocated as per the table below.
The Group tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that these might be impaired.
The basis of these impairment tests including key assumptions are set out in the table below.

The WACC is the weighted average of the pre-tax cost of debt nancing and the pre-tax cost of equity finance.
In the main there has been an increase in the WACC relative to 2011 in mature economies largely due to an increase in government bond yields.
Government bond yields in Italy have decreased signicantly as local credit risks have reduced, the reduction visible in the Weir Gabbioneta WACC.
The discount rates for emerging markets has broadly decreased, directly linked to movement in the yield on Government bonds.
2 Real growth Real growth beyond the five year forecast period of 1.2%, for all businesses except South Africa where a rate of 4.0% is used, reects the increasingly global nature of these businesses and the fact that they sell a significant proportion of their products to emerging markets which have long-term stronger growth prospects than their home markets.
3 EBIT margins EBIT margins have been forecast based on historic levels taking cognisance of the likely impact of changing economic environments and competitive landscapes on volumes and revenues and the impact of associated management actions on costs.
4 Weir Seaboard Weir Seaboard is a wellhead solutions provider focused on the growing North American unconventional oil and gas drilling and production markets.
Demand for Weir Seaboards products and services is closely related to the number of conventional and unconventional oil drilling rigs and gas well drilling rigs which is in turn dependent upon oil and natural gas prices and storage levels.
Independent forecasts of North American oil and gas well drilling activity, which take into account forecast oil and natural gas prices and storage levels, have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions.
These independent forecasts were prepared during the final quarter of 2012.
110 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 I II 5 Weir SPM III Weir SPM is a supplier of oil and gas well service pumps, associated ow control equipment and services to the oil and gas production industry.
A large proportion of the businesss revenues are generated in North America with demand being closely related to the number of conventional oil drilling rigs and gas well drilling rigs in operation which is in turn dependent upon oil and natural gas prices and storage levels.
Independent forecasts of North American oil and gas well drilling activity, which take into account forecast oil and natural gas prices IV and storage levels, have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions.
6 Warman companies The Warman companies supply pumps and associated equipment and services to all global markets.
The key drivers for revenues are i levels of mining capital expenditure which drives demand for original equipment and ii levels of actual mining activity which drives demand for spare parts and service.
Independent forecasts of mining capital expenditure and activity have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions.
7 Weir Gabbioneta Weir Gabbioneta is a supplier of heavy duty process applications to oil and gas renery, petro-chemical and power generation industries.
The key drivers for revenues are capital expenditure within oil renery and petro-chemical industries.
Independent forecasts of expenditure in these sectors have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions.
Sensitivity analysis Base case forecasts show significant headroom above carrying value for each of the CGUs.
Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken for each CGU to assess the impact of any reasonable possible change in key assumptions.
There is no reasonably possible change that would cause the carrying values to exceed recoverable amounts.

Provision is made immediately when it becomes apparent that expected costs will exceed the expected benets of the contract.
It is expected that the majority of these costs will be incurred within one year of the balance sheet date.
Employee related Employee related provisions arise from legal obligations and asbestosis claims and are based on managements best estimate of the likely costs.
It is expected that the costs will be incurred in the period up to 2025.

Deferred tax asset balances for unused tax losses of 4.5m 2011: 1.6m have not been recognised on the grounds that there is insufficient evidence that these assets will be recoverable.
These assets will be recovered when future tax charges are sufficient to absorb these tax benets.
Deferred tax asset balances for capital losses in the UK amounting to 9.8m 2011: 10.7m have not been recognised but would be available in the event of future capital gains being incurred by the Group.
Temporary differences associated with Group investments A deferred tax liability of 24.1m 2011: 27.1m has been recognised in respect of taxes on the unremitted earnings of the South American and Canadian subsidiaries.
As at 28 December 2012, this is the only recognised deferred tax liability in respect of taxes on unremitted earnings as the Group does not foresee a distribution of unremitted earnings from other subsidiaries or joint ventures which would result in a reversal of deferred tax.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised, aggregate to 1,367.0m 2011: 1,095.0m.
There are no income tax consequences attaching to the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders.
A number of changes to the UK Corporation tax system were announced in the June 2012 Budget and Autumn statement.
The Finance Act 2012 enacted legislation to reduce the UK corporate rate of taxation from 24% to 23% from 1 April 2013.
A further reduction in the UK rate has been announced reducing the corporation tax main rate to 21% from April 2014.
This further change has not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and therefore, is not reected in the consolidated results for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2012.
We expect that these reductions will not have a material effect on the effective tax rate or on the profit for the year in future periods.

The past service gain for 2011 of 19.0m arose as a result of a decision by the Trustees of The Weir Group Pension and Retirement Saving Scheme that, following the Governments change in legislation, certain elements of pension would increase in line with Consumer Prices Index CPI rather than the Retail Prices Index RPI.
This decision was announced to the members of the scheme in July 2011.
The past service gain was recognised last year as an exceptional item in the Consolidated Income Statement.

Legal claims The company and certain subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business.
On 6 February 2013, an Opinion and Order was led with the United States District Court, Southern District of New York dismissing the claim against the Company being one of many companies targeted relating to a civil action for damages arising from the UN Oil for Food programme which was raised in the US.
Subsequently the Iraqi Government led notice of appeal and at the time of writing there has been no ruling by the Court on this appeal.
We will continue to defend this action vigorously.
To the extent not already provided for, the directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.

126 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 I II 30.
Financial assets & liabilities III Financial risk management objectives & policies The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those relating to foreign currency, liquidity and credit risk.
Foreign currency transactional risk arises when operating subsidiaries enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies.
Translational risk arises on the translation of overseas earnings and investments into sterling for consolidated reporting purposes.
Credit risk IV is the risk that a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract and liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its liabilities as they fall due.
In addition, the Group is subject to a degree of interest rate risk on its borrowings.
The Group uses financial assets and liabilities, including derivatives, to hedge certain foreign exchange and interest rate risks as set out below.
Foreign exchange risk policy Foreign currency transactional and translational risk could result in volatility in reported consolidated earnings and net assets.
In respect of transactional foreign currency risk, the Group maintains a policy that all operating units eliminate exposures on material committed transactions, usually by undertaking forward foreign currency contracts through the Groups treasury function.
In addition, it is Group policy that those companies where the most significant concentration of foreign exchange risk has been identied also apply hedge accounting in accordance with IAS39.
Therefore, some of the Groups forward foreign currency contracts form part of an effective cash ow hedge.
Exchange rate uctuations in respect of the forward foreign currency contracts which form part of a cash ow hedge will have an impact on shareholders equity.
Exchange rate uctuations in respect of the other forward foreign currency contracts will have an impact on profit or loss.
It is Group policy not to engage in any speculative transaction of any kind.
In respect of translational risk, the Group has a policy to partially hedge United States dollar US$ net assets exposure.
This is achieved through designating an element of US dollar borrowings, forward foreign currency contracts and cross currency swaps as net investment hedges against the Groups US dollar investments.
The Group does not hedge the translational exposure arising from profit and loss items.
Liquidity risk policy Liquidity risk could impact negatively on the Groups reputation, borrowing costs or ultimately its ability to continue as a going concern.
Liquidity risk is managed by monitoring forecast and actual cash ows and ensuring that sufficient committed facilities are in place to meet possible downside scenarios.
The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and exibility through the use of bank overdrafts, bank loans and xed rate notes.
Further details of the Groups borrowing facilities are disclosed in note 20. Credit risk policy Credit risk could have a negative impact on reported earnings and cash and consequently the liquidity of the Group.
The Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its financial instruments.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables with risk spread over a large number of countries and customers, with no significant concentration of risk.
Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risk by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance.
Credit worthiness checks are also undertaken with external credit rating agencies before entering into contracts with new customers and credit limits are set as appropriate and adhered to.
As shown in note 17, the trade receivables presented in the balance sheet are net of allowance for doubtful debts.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identiable loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash ows.
The Groups exposure to the credit risk of financial institutions is limited by the adherence to counterparty limits and by only trading with counterparties that have a strong credit standing based upon ratings provided by the major agencies.
Interest rate risk policy The Groups borrowings are in a combination of xed and variable rates of interest.
Interest rate risk is regularly monitored to ensure that the mix of variable and xed rate borrowing is appropriate for the Group in the short to medium-term.
On 16 February 2012, the Group issued US$1bn of xed rate notes to the US private placement market with maturities of seven years US$210.0m, ten years US$590.0m and eleven years US$200.0m.
On receipt of these funds, the Group repaid the US$380.0m bridging loan and reduced the proportion of oating rate borrowings from 80% to 28% at 28 December 2012.
Net investment in foreign operations As at 28 December 2012, US dollar xed rate notes of US$1,088.2m 2011: US$160.0m and US dollar variable rate loans of US$252.0m 2011: US$926.5m, both included in interest-bearing loans and borrowings, cross currency swaps of US$89.4m 2011: US$254.0m and net forward foreign currency liability contracts of US$48.0m 2011: US$48.0m have been designated as a hedge of the Groups exposure to translational foreign exchange risk on its net investments in Weir SPM, Weir Warman, Seaboard and Novatech.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings and the fair value of the cross currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in these subsidiaries.

The derivative financial instruments are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs including spot and forward foreign exchange rates and interest rate curves.
The fair value of cross currency swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash ows based on spot foreign exchange rates.
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
At 28 December 2012 and 30 December 2011, the Group held all financial instruments at level 2 fair value measurement.
During the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2012 and the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2011, there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements and no transfers into or out of level 3 fair value measurements.
The fair value of cash and short-term deposits, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables approximates their carrying amount due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
The fair value of borrowings and obligations under finance leases is estimated by discounting future cash ows using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.

Interest on financial instruments classied as oating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year.
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax and equity through the impact on oating rate borrowings and cross currency swaps in respect of each currency to which the Group has a significant exposure to interest rate risk.

Financial assets & liabilities continued Effect of hedging & derivative financial instruments included in the income statement & equity The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge currency risk associated with expected future sales or purchases for which the Group has rm commitments.
The terms of the forward foreign currency contracts are negotiated to match the terms of the commitments.
During the period two subsidiaries within the Group applied cash ow hedge accounting to these transactions.
As at 28 December 2012 one of these subsidiaries, LGE Process Ltd, was disposed of and the hedge relationship discontinued with the existing hedge reserve balance of 0.2m charged to the income statement.
All other forward foreign currency contracts, while representing commercial hedges, are not subject to cash ow hedge accounting with all fair value movements being recognised in the income statement.
The net carrying amount, maturity dates and the amounts recognised for the period in profit or loss and equity for each derivative financial instrument are set out below.

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in these foreign currency exchange rates with all other variables held constant.
The sensitivity analysis shows the effect on profit or loss in respect of financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency, including payables, receivables, borrowings and forward foreign currency contracts but excluding all financial assets and IV liabilities qualied as either cash ow or net investment hedges.
The sensitivity analysis also shows the effect on equity in respect of financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency qualifying as either cash ow or net investment hedges including forward foreign currency contracts, borrowings and cross currency swaps.
The sensitivity analysis below has been presented to demonstrate the impact of a 25% strengthening of the relevant functional currency against the currencies shown below and therefore give an indication of the transactional foreign exposure that exists at a subsidiary level across the Group.
