Pensions and similar obligations For defined benefit plans, operating and finance costs are recognised separately in the income statement.
The amount charged to operating cost in the income statement is the cost of accruing pension benefits promised to employees over the year, plus the costs of individual events such as past service benefit enhancements, settlements and curtailments such events are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The amount charged or credited to finance costs includes a credit equivalent to the Groups expected return on the pension plans assets over the year, offset by a charge equal to the expected increase in the plans liabilities over the year due to the passage of time.
Any differences between the expected return on assets and the return actually achieved, and any changes in the liabilities over the year due to changes in assumptions or experience within the plans, are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
The defined benefit plan surplus or deficit on the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds.
All defined benefit plans are subject to regular actuarial review using the projected unit method, either by external consultants or by actuaries employed by Unilever.
The Group policy is that the most important plans, representing approximately 80% of the defined benefit liabilities, are formally valued every year.
Other principal plans, accounting for approximately a further 15% of liabilities, have their liabilities updated each year.
Group policy for the remaining plans requires a full actuarial valuation at least every three years.
Asset values for all plans are updated every year.
For defined contribution plans, the charges to the income statement are the company contributions payable, as the companys obligation is limited to contributions paid into the plans.
The assets and liabilities of such plans are not included in the balance sheet of the Group.
Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financial statements 95 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNILEVER GROUP continued 4B.
Pensions and similar obligations continued Description of plans In many countries the Group operates defined benefit pension plans based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
Themajority of these plans are externally funded.
The Group also provides other post-employment benefits, mainly postemployment healthcare plans in the United States.
These plans are predominantly unfunded.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution plans, the assets of which are held in external funds.
The majority of the Groups externally funded plans are established as trusts, foundations or similar entities.
The operation of these entities isgoverned by local regulations and practice in each country, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the trustees orequivalent and their composition.
Investment strategy The Groups investment strategy in respect of its funded pension plans is implemented within the framework of the various statutory requirements of the territories where the plans are based.
The Group has developed policy guidelines for the allocation of assets to different classes with the objective of controlling risk and maintaining the right balance between risk and long-term returns in order to limit the cost to the Group of the benefits provided.
To achieve this, investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
The plans continue to invest a good proportion of the assets in equities, which the Group believes offer the best returns over the long term commensurate with an acceptable level of risk.
For risk control, the pension funds also have significant investments in liability matching assets bonds as well as in property and other alternative assets.
The majority of assets are managed by a number of external fund managers with a small proportion managed in-house.
Unilever has a pooled investment vehicle Univest which it believes offers its pension plans around the world a simplified externally managed investment vehicle to implement their strategic asset allocation models, currently for bonds, equities and alternative assets.
The aim is to provide high quality, well diversified, cost effective, risk-controlled vehicles.
The pension plans investments are overseen by Unilevers internal investment company, the Univest Company.
Assumptions With the objective of presenting the assets and liabilities of the pensions and other post-employment benefit plans at their fair value on the balance sheet, assumptions under IAS 19 are set by reference to market conditions at the valuation date.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the benefit obligations vary according to the country in which the plan is situated.
The following table shows the assumptions, weighted by liabilities, used to value the principal defined benefit plans which cover approximately 95% of total pension liabilities and the plans providing other post-employment benefits, and in addition the expected long-term rates of return on assets, weighted by asset value.
31 December 2012 31 December 2011 Principal Other Principal Other defined benefit post-employment defined benefit post-employment pension plans benefit plans pension plans benefit plans Discount rate 3.9% 4.0% 4.6% 4.3% Inflation 2.3% n a 2.5% n a Rate of increase in salaries 3.2% 3.6% 3.4% 3.5% Rate of increase for pensions in payment where provided 2.1% n a 2.4% n a Rate of increase for pensions in deferment where provided 2.3% n a 2.6% n a Long-term medical cost inflation n a 5.0% n a 5.0% Expected long-term rates of return: Equities 6.9% 7.2% Bonds 3.0% 3.8% Property 4.4% 4.7% Others 4.9% 6.2% Weighted average asset return 5.0% 5.6% The valuations of other post-employment benefit plans generally assume a higher initial level of medical cost inflation, which falls from 7.0% tothe long-term rate within the next five years.
Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for healthcare plans.
A one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effect: million million 1% point increase 1% point decrease Effect on total of service and interest cost components 1 1 Effect on total benefit obligation 11 12 The expected rates of return on plan assets were determined, based on actuarial advice, by a process that takes the long-term rates of return on government bonds available at the balance sheet date and applies to these rates suitable risk premiums that take account of historic market returns and current market long-term expectations for each asset class.

These assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the pension plans.
The years of life expectancy for 2012 above have been translated from the following tables: UK: the year of use S1 series all pensioners S1AP tables have been adopted, which are based on the experience of UK pension schemes over the period 2000-2006.

The Netherlands: the Dutch Actuarial Societys AG Prognosetafel 2012-2062 table is used with correction factors to allow for the typically longer life expectancy of pension fund members relative to the general population.

United States: the table RP-2000 with generational mortality improvement using Scale BB.
Germany: fund specific tables are used which broadly equate to the Heubeck 2005 generational table projected to 2030.

Share-based compensation plans The fair value of the awards at the grant date is calculated using pricing models and recognised over the vesting period of the grantas aremuneration cost with a corresponding increase in equity.
The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of awards vesting, except where the failure to vest is as a result of not meeting a market condition.
Cancellations of equity instruments are treated as an acceleration of the vesting period and any outstanding charge is recognised in the income statement immediately.
As at 31 December 2012, the Group had share-based compensation plans in the form of performance shares, share options and other share awards.
The numbers in this note include those for Executive Directors shown in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 62 to 81 and those for key management personnel shown in note 4A on page 95.

For this reason the rate may vary from year to year according to the mix of profit and related tax rates.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method on taxable temporary differences between the tax base and the accounting base of items included in the balance sheet of the Group.
Certain temporary differences are not provided for as follows: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, at the year end.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

Deferred tax continued At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 1,582 million 2011: 1,568 million and tax credits amounting to 120million 2011: 39 million available for offset against future taxable profits.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of unused tax losses of 1,234 million 2011: 1,191 million and tax credits of 120 million 2011: 38 million, asit is not probable that there will be future taxable profits within the entities against which the losses can be utilised.
The majority of these tax losses and credits arise in tax jurisdictions where they do not expire with the exception of 516 million 2011: 512 million of state and federal tax losses in the US which expire between now and 2031.
Other deductible temporary differences of 39 million 2011: 58 million have not been recognised as a deferred tax asset.
There is no expiry date for these differences.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 1,449 million 2011: 1,443 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.

Goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill is initially recognised based on the accounting policy for business combinations see note 21.
Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less amounts provided for impairment.
The Groups cash generating units CGUs are based on the four product categories and the three geographical areas.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the Groups CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
These might not always be the same as the CGUs that include the assets and liabilities of the acquired business.
Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, and is not larger than an operating segment.
Intangible assets Separately purchased intangible assets are initially measured at cost.
On acquisition of new interests in group companies, Unilever recognises any specifically identifiable intangible assets separately from goodwill.
Intangible assets are initially measured at fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Finite-life intangible assets mainly comprise patented and non-patented technology, know-how and software.
These assets are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis in the income statement over the period of their expected useful lives, or the period of legal rights if shorter.
None of the amortisation periods exceeds ten years.
Indefinite-life intangibles mainly comprise trademarks and brands.
These assets are capitalised at cost but are not amortised.
They are subject to a review for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate this is necessary.
Any impairment is charged to the income statement as it arises.
Research and development Development expenditure is capitalised only if the costs can be reliably measured, future economic benefits are probable, the product is technically feasible and the Group has the intent and the resources to complete the project.
Research expenditure is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

Significant CGUs The goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets held in the three CGUs relating to Foods across the geographical areas are considered significant within the total carrying amounts of goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets at 31 December 2012 in terms of size, headroom and sensitivity to assumptions used.
Noother CGUs are considered significant in this respect.
The goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets held in the significant CGUs are: billion billion billion billion 2012 2012 2011 2011  life Goodwill intangibles Goodwill intangibles Foods Europe 5.8 1.6 5.7 1.6 Foods The Americas 3.9 1.4 4.1 1.5 Foods Asia AMET RUB 1.4 0.4 1.5 0.4 During 2012, the Group conducted an impairment review of the carrying value of these assets as part of its comprehensive annual review.
Value in use has been calculated as the present value of projected future cash flows.
A pre-tax discount rate of 7.4% was used.
For the significant CGUs, the following key assumptions were used in the discounted cash flow projections: Foods Foods Foods The Asia AMET Europe Americas RUB Longer-term sustainable growth rates 0.3% 1.6% 3.3% Average near-term nominal growth rates 0.8% 4.9% 10.5% Average operating margins 22-24% 17-20% 13-16% The growth rates and margins used to estimate future performance are based on past performance and our experience of growth rates and margins achievable in our key markets.
The projections covered a period of five years, as we believe this to be the most appropriate timescale over which to review and consider annual performances before applying a fixed terminal value multiple to the final year cash flows.
The growth rates used are consistent with our annual planning and strategic planning processes.
We have performed sensitivity analyses around the base assumptions and have concluded that no reasonable possible changes in key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of the significant CGUs to be less than the carrying value.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost including eligible borrowing costs less depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the expected average useful lives of the assets.
Residual values are reviewed at least annually.
Estimated useful lives by major class of assets are as follows: Freehold buildings no depreciation on freehold land 40 years Leasehold land and buildings 40 years or life of lease if less Plant and equipment 2-20 years Property, plant and equipment is subject to review for impairment if triggering events or circumstances indicate that this is necessary.
If an indication of impairment exists, the asset or cash generating unit recoverable amount is estimated and any impairment loss is charged to the income statement as it arises.

Other non-current assets Joint ventures are undertakings in which the Group has an interest and which are jointly controlled by the Group and one or more other parties.
Associates are undertakings where the Group has an investment in which it does not have control or joint control but can exercise significant influence.
Interests in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method and are stated in the consolidated balance sheet at cost, adjusted for the movement in the Groups share of their net assets and liabilities.
The Groups share of the profit or loss after tax of joint ventures and associates is included in the Groups consolidated profit before taxation.
Where the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in the equity accounted investee, the carrying amount of the investment is reduced to zero and the recognition of further losses is discontinued, except to the extent that the Group has an obligation to make payments on behalf ofthe investee.
Biological assets are measured at fair value less costs to sell with any changes recognised in the income statement.

Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct costs and, where appropriate, a proportion of attributable production overheads.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

In 2012, 71 million 2011:43million was utilised or released to the income statement from inventory provisions taken in earlier years.
Trade and other current receivables Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequently these assets are held at amortised cost, using the effective interest method and net of any impairment losses.
We do not consider the fair values of trade and other receivables to be significantly different from their carrying values.
Credit terms for customers are determined in individual territories.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited, due to the Groups customer base being large and diverse.
Our historical experience of collecting receivables, supported by the level of default, is that credit risk is low across territories and so trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial assets.
Balances are considered for impairment on an individual basis rather than by reference to the extent that they become overdue.

Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value, less any directly related transaction costs.
Certain bonds are designated as being part of a fair value hedge relationship.
In these cases, the bonds are carried at amortised cost, adjusted for the fair value of the risk being hedged, with changes in value shown in profit and loss.
Other financial liabilities, excluding derivatives, are subsequently carried at amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments The Groups use of, and accounting for, derivative instruments is explained in note 16 on page 116 and on page 120.

Capital and funding continued Unilever considers the following components of its balance sheet to be managed capital: total equity retained profit, other reserves, share capital, share premium, non-controlling interests note 15A and 15B : short-term debt current financial liabilities note 15C : and long-term debt non-current bank loans, bonds and other loans note 15C.
The Group manages its capital so as to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to optimise returns to our shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity.
The capital structure of the Group is based on managements judgement of the appropriate balance of key elements in order to meet its strategic and day-to-day needs.
We consider the amount of capital in proportion to risk and manage the capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
Our current long-term credit rating is A A1 and our short-term credit rating is A1 P1.
We aim to maintain a competitive balance sheet which we consider to be the equivalent of a credit rating of A A1 in the long term.
This provides us with: appropriate access to the debt and equity markets: sufficient flexibility for acquisitions: sufficient resilience against economic and financial uncertainty while ensuring ample liquidity: and optimal weighted average cost of capital, given the above constraints.
Unilever monitors the qualitative and quantitative factors utilised by the ratings agencies.
This information is publicly available and is updated by the credit rating agencies on a regular basis.
Unilever will take appropriate steps in order to maintain, or if necessary adjust, the capital structure.

Treasury risk management Derivatives and hedge accounting Derivatives are measured at fair value with any related transaction costs expensed as incurred.
The treatment of changes in the value of derivatives depends on their use as explained below.
i Fair value hedges Certain derivatives are held to hedge the risk of changes in value of a specific bond or other loan.
In these situations, the Group designates the liability and related derivative to be part of a fair value hedge relationship.
The carrying value of the bond is adjusted by the fair value of the risk being hedged, with changes going to the income statement.
Gains and losses on the corresponding derivative are also recognised in the income statement.
The amounts recognised are offset in the income statement to the extent that the hedge is effective.
When the relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the fair value hedge adjustment made to the bond is amortised to the income statement using the effective interest method.
ii Cash flow hedges Derivatives are also held to hedge the uncertainty in timing or amount of future forecast cash flows.
Such derivatives are classified as being part of cash flow hedge relationships.
For an effective hedge, gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in equity.
Any ineffective elements of the hedge are recognised in the income statement.
If the hedged cash flow relates to a non-financial asset, the amount accumulated in equity is subsequently included within the carrying value of that asset.
For other cash flow hedges, amounts deferred in equity are taken to the income statement at the same time as the related cash flow.
When a derivative no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss remains in equity until the related cash flow occurs.
When the cash flow takes place, the cumulative gain or loss is taken to the income statement.
If the hedged cash flow is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss is taken to the income statement immediately.
iii Net investment hedges Certain derivatives are designated as hedges of the currency risk on the Groups investment in foreign subsidiaries.
The accounting policy for these arrangements is set out in note 1. iv Derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied Derivatives not classified as hedges are held in order to hedge certain balance sheet items and commodity exposures.
No hedge accounting is applied to these derivatives, which are carried at fair value with changes being recognised in the income statement.
The Group is exposed to the following risks that arise from its use of financial instruments, the management of which is described in the following sections: liquidity risk see note 16A : market risk see note 16B : and credit risk see note 17B.
Management of liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will face difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities when due without incurring unacceptable losses.
In doing this, management considers both normal and stressed conditions.
A material and sustained shortfall in our cash flow could undermine the Groups credit rating, impair investor confidence and also restrict the Groups ability to raise funds.
Given continuing volatility in the financial markets, the Group has maintained a cautious funding strategy, running a positive cash balance throughout 2012.
This has been the result of a strong cash delivery from the business, coupled with the proceeds from bond issuances in 2012.
This cash has been invested conservatively with low risk counter-parties at maturities of less than six months.
Cash flow from operating activities provides the funds to service the financing of financial liabilities on a day-to-day basis.
The Group seeks to manage its liquidity requirements by maintaining access to global debt markets through short-term and long-term debt programmes.
In addition, Unilever has committed credit facilities for general corporate use.
Unilever had US $6,250 million of undrawn committed facilities on 31 December 2012 as follows: revolving 364-day bilateral credit facilities of in aggregate US $6,140 million 2011: US $5,950 million with a 364-day term-out: and 364-day bilateral money market commitments of in aggregate US $110 million 2011: US $200 million, under which the underwriting banks agree, subject to certain conditions, to subscribe for notes with maturities of up to three years.

Management of market risk Unilevers size and operations result in it being exposed to the following market risks that arise from its use of financial instruments: commodity price risk: currency risk: and interest rate risk.
The above risks may affect the Groups income and expenses, or the value of its financial instruments.
The objective of the Groups management of market risk is to maintain this risk within acceptable parameters, while optimising returns.
Generally, the Group applies hedge accounting to manage the volatility in profit and loss arising from market risk.
The Groups exposure to, and management of, these risks is explained below.
It often includes derivative financial instruments, the uses of which are described in note 16C.

This is done either through additional borrowings in the related currency, or through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.

Investment and return Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet include deposits, investments in money market funds and highly liquid investments.
To be classified as cash and cash equivalents, an asset must: be readily convertible into cash: have an insignificant risk of changes in value: and have a maturity period of three months or less at acquisition.
Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement also include bank overdrafts and are recorded at amortised cost.
Other financial assets Other financial assets are first recognised on the trade date.
At that point they are classified as: i held-to-maturity investments: ii loans and receivables: iii available-for-sale financial assets: or iv financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
i Held-to-maturity investments These are assets with set cash flows and fixed maturities which Unilever intends to hold to maturity.
They are held at cost plus interest using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
ii Loans and receivables These are assets with an established payment profile and which are not listed on a recognised stock exchange.
They are initially recognised at fair value, which is usually the original invoice amount plus any directly related transaction costs.
Afterwards loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost, less any impairment.
iii Available-for-sale financial assets Any financial assets not classified as either loans and receivables or financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are designated as available-for-sale.
They are initially recognised at fair value, usually the original invoice amount plus any directly related transaction costs.
Afterwards they are measured at fair value with changes being recognised in equity.
When the investment is sold or impaired, the accumulated gains and losses are moved from equity to the income statement.
Interest and dividends from these assets are recognised in the income statement.
iv Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss These are derivatives and assets that are held for trading.
Related transaction costs are expensed as incurred.
Unless they form part of a hedging relationship, these assets are held at fair value, with changes being recognised in the income statement.
Impairment of financial assets Each year the Group assesses whether there is evidence that financial assets are impaired.
A significant or prolonged fall in value below the cost of an asset generally indicates that an asset may be impaired.
If impaired, financial assets are written down to their estimated recoverable amount.
Impairment losses on assets classified as loans and receivables are recognised in profit and loss.
When a later event causes the impairment losses to decrease, the reduction in impairment loss is also recognised in profit and loss.
Impairment losses on assets classified as available-for-sale are recognised by moving the loss accumulated in equity to the income statement.
Any subsequent recovery in value of an available-for-sale debt security is recognised within profit and loss.
However, any subsequent recovery in value of an equity security is recognised within equity, and is recorded at amortised cost.

Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counter-party fails to meet its contractual obligations.
Additional information in relation to credit risk on trade receivables is given in note 13.
These risks are generally managed by local controllers.
Credit risk related to the use of treasury instruments is managed on a Group basis.
This risk arises from transactions with financial institutions involving cash and cash equivalents, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
To reduce this risk, Unilever has concentrated its main activities with a limited number of counter-parties which have secure credit ratings.
Individual risk limits are set for each counter-party based on financial position, credit rating and past experience.
Credit limits and concentration of exposures are actively monitored by the Groups treasury department.
Netting agreements are also put in place with Unilevers principal counterparties.
In the case of a default, these arrangements would allow Unilever to net assets and liabilities across transactions with that counter-party.
To further reduce the Groups creditexposures on derivative financial instruments, Unilever has collateral agreements with Unilevers principal counter-parties in relation to derivative financial instruments.
Under these arrangements, counter-parties are required to deposit securities and or cash as a collateral for their obligations in respect of derivative financial instruments.
At 31 December 2012 the collateral held by Unilever under such arrangements amounted to6 million 2011:88 million, of which 6 million 2011: 43 million was in cash, and nil 2011: 45 million was in the form of bond securities.
The non-cash collateral has not been recognised as an asset in the Groups balance sheet.
Further details in relation to the Groups exposure to credit risk are shown in note 13 and note 16A.

Fair value hierarchy The fair values shown above have been classified into three categories depending on the inputs used in the valuation technique.
The categories used are as follows: Level 1: quoted prices for identical instruments: Level 2: directly or indirectly observable market inputs, other than Level 1 inputs: and Level 3: inputs which are not based on observable market data.
For assets and liabilities which are carried at fair value, the classification of fair value calculations by category is summarised below: million million million million million million million million Total fair Total fair Level 1 Level 1 Level 2 Level 2 Level 3 Level 3 value value 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 Assets at fair value Other cash equivalents 17A 139 102 139 102 Available-for-sale financial assets 17A 16 236 185 482 486 2 687 720 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: Derivatives 16C 193 266 193 266 Other 17A 27 71 20 47 71 Liabilities at fair value Bonds and other loans 15C 1,556 2,330 1,556 2,330 Derivatives 16C 328 197 328 197 During the reporting period ending 31 December 2012, 275 million of financial assets were transferred from Level 1 to Level 3 2011: nil and 197 million of financial assets were transferred from Level 2 to Level 3 2011: nil following a review of the valuation inputs.

Financial instruments fair value risk continued Significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair values The only individually material asset valued using Level 3 techniques is a particular unlisted investment with a carrying value at year end of 197 million.
A change in one or more of the inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would not change fair value significantly.
Calculation of fair values The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are defined as being the amounts at which the instruments could be exchanged or liability settled in an arms length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties.
The following methods and assumptions have been used to estimate the fair values: Assets and liabilities carried at fair value The fair values of quoted investments falling into Level 1 are based on current bid prices.
The fair values of unquoted available-for-sale financial assets are based on recent trades in liquid markets, observable market rates, discounted cash flow analysis and statistical modelling techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.
Derivatives are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs.
The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counter-parties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying commodities.
For listed securities where the market is not liquid, and for unlisted securities, valuation techniques are used.
These include the use of recent arms length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same and discounted cash flow calculations.
Other financial assets and liabilities fair values for disclosure purposes only Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other current receivables, bank loans and overdrafts, trade payables and other current liabilities have fair values that approximate to their carrying amounts due to their short-term nature.
The fair values of preference shares and listed bonds are based on their market value.
Non-listed bonds, other loans, bank loans and non-current receivables and payables are based on the net present value of the anticipated future cash flows associated with these instruments using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.
Fair values for finance lease creditors have been assessed by reference to current market rates for comparable leasing arrangements.
Provisions Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation exists at the balance sheet date, as a result of a past event, where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated and where the outflow of economic benefit is probable.

The largest elements relate to disputes with Brazilian authorities.
Due to the nature of the disputes, the timing of provision utilisation and any cash outflows is uncertain.
The majority of disputed items attract an interest charge.
No individual items within the remaining provisions are significant.
Unilever expects that the issues relating to these restructuring, legal and other provisions will be substantively resolved within five years.

Commitments and contingent liabilities Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are initially recognised at the lower of fair value at the date of commencement of the lease and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Subsequent to initial recognition, these assets are accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy relating to that specific asset.
The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance costs in the income statement and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Lease payments under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Contingent liabilities are either possible obligations that will probably not require a transfer of economic benefits, or present obligations that may, but probably will not, require a transfer of economic benefits.
It is not appropriate to make provisions for contingent liabilities, but there isa chance that they will result in an obligation in the future.

Future minimum sublease payments of 50 million 2011: 58 million are expected to bereceived.
Other commitments principally comprise commitments under contracts to purchase materials and services.
They do not include commitments for capital expenditure, which are reported in note 10 on page 108.
Contingent liabilities arise in respect of litigation against group companies, investigations by competition, regulatory and fiscal authorities and obligations arising under environmental legislation.
The estimated total of such contingent liabilities at 31 December 2012 was 236 million 2011: 246 million.
The Group does not believe that any of these contingent liabilities will result in a material loss.
Legal proceedings The Group is involved from time to time in legal and arbitration proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.
Ongoing compliance with competition laws is of key importance to Unilever.
As the approach to enforcement of competition authorities globally continues to evolve, it is possible that our industry may on occasions be the focus of investigations.
It is Unilevers policy to co-operate fully with competition authorities whenever questions or issues arise.
In addition the Group continues to reinforce and enhance our internal competition law compliance programme on an ongoing basis.
Where specific issues arise provisions are made and contingent liabilities disclosed to the extent appropriate.
Details of the significant outstanding legal proceedings and ongoing regulatory investigations are as follows: Tax case in Brazil During 2004 in Brazil, and in common with many other businesses operating in that country, one of our Brazilian subsidiaries received a notice ofinfringement from the Federal Revenue Service.
The notice alleges that a 2001 reorganisation of our local corporate structure was undertaken without valid business purpose.
The dispute is in court and, if upheld, will result in a tax payment relating to years from 2001 to the present day.
The 2001 reorganisation was comparable with restructurings done by many companies in Brazil.
The Group believes that the likelihood of a successful challenge by the tax authorities is remote, however, there can be no guarantee of success in court.
Acquisitions and disposals Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method as at the acquisition date, which is the date at which control is transferred to the Group.
Goodwill is measured at the acquisition date as the fair value of consideration transferred, plus non-controlling interests and the fair value of any previously held equity interests less the net recognised amount which is generally fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed.
Consideration transferred does not include amounts related to settlement of pre-existing relationships.
Such amounts are generally recognised in net profit.
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, other than those incurred in relation to the issue of debt or equity securities.
Any contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration are recognised in net profit.
Changes in ownership that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as equity transactions and therefore do not have any impact on goodwill.
The difference between consideration and the non-controlling share of net assets acquired is recognised within equity.

Amsterdam, 5 March 2013  Accountants N. V. Auditors responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these company accounts based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing.
This R A J Swaak RA requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the company accounts are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the company accounts.
The procedures selected depend on the auditors judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the company accounts, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the companys preparation and fair presentation of the company accounts in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control.
An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the company accounts.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
