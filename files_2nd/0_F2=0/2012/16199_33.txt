Provision for environmental clean-up and remediation costs is based on current legal and constructive requirements, technology and price levels.
Recoverability of deferred tax assets note 22 : Deferred tax assets are recognised for used tax losses to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the losses can be utilised.
Judgement is required to determine the value of the deferred tax asset, based upon the timing and level of future taxable profits.
Capital gains tax due on Uganda farm-down note 9 : On the advice of leading counsel, the Group believes that it has a strong case under both international and Ugandan law and currently views the most probable outcome to be that any liability will be at a similar level to the amount already paid on account.
The amount of $142 million is included in the Groups tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2012.
Other tax provisions: and The Group is subject to various claims which arise in the ordinary course of its business, including tax claims from tax authorities in a number of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
The Group assesses all such claims in the context of the tax laws of the countries in which it operates and, where applicable, makes provision for any settlements which it considers are probable.
The Directors believe that the Group has recorded adequate provisions as of 31 December 2012 and 2011 for all such matters.

com 145 NOTES TO GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Year ended 31 December 2012 Note 6.
Taxation on profit on ordinary activities continued Following previous reductions in the main rate of UK corporation tax, on 26 March 2012 additional reductions from 26% to 24% effective from 1 April 2012 and from 24% to 23% from 1 April 2013 were substantively enacted.
Draft legislation has also been published for inclusion in the Finance Bill 2013 which further reduces the main tax rate to 21% effective from 1 April 2014.
As this change was not substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date, the rate reduction to 21% is not yet reflected in these financial statements.
The Groups profit before taxation will continue to arise in jurisdictions where the effective rate of taxation differs from that in the UK.
Furthermore, unsuccessful exploration expenditure is often incurred in jurisdictions where the Group has no taxable profits, such that no related tax benefit arises.
Accordingly, the Groups tax charge will continue to vary according to the jurisdictions in which pre-tax profits and exploration costs written off arise.
The Group has tax losses of $1,724.7 million 2011: $1,082.3 million that are available for offset against future taxable profits in the companies in which the losses arose.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group.
The Group has recognised $49.4 million in deferred tax assets in relation to taxable losses 2011: $117.5 million : this is disclosed net of a deferred tax liability in respect of capitalised interest.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of $30 million 2011: $253 million relating to unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Acquisitions and disposals Acquisitions of subsidiaries On 24 May 2011 Tullow announced that it had acquired 100% of Nuon Exploration & Production B. V. Nuon from the Vattenfall Group with an acquisition date of 30 June 2011.
The fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities were reassessed in the first few months of 2012 to reflect additional information which has become available concerning conditions that existed at the date of acquisition in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The final acquisition fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities are set out in the below table and the retrospective adjustments to the fair values previously reported are set out in note 33.
Provisional Adjustments to Final fair value fair values fair value $m $m $m Intangible exploration and appraisal assets 424.1 79.7 503.8 Property, plant and equipment 539.6 77.9 461.7 Trade and other receivables 19.8 19.8 Trade and other payables 20.0 1.0 21.0 Deferred tax liabilities 472.9 0.8 473.7 Provisions 86.6 86.6 Total consideration satisfied by cash 404.0 404.0 The purchase consideration equals the aggregate of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of Nuon and therefore no goodwill has been recorded on the acquisition.
Deferred tax has been recognised in respect of the fair value adjustments as applicable.
Transaction costs in respect of the Nuon acquisition of $1.1 million were recognised in the 2011 income statement.
In 2012 Nuon has contributed $142.3 million to Group revenues 2011: $67.6 million and $15.2 million to the profit of the Group 2011: $3.2 million.
Provisions represent the present value of decommissioning costs, which are expected to be incurred up to 2033.
There were no acquisitions involving business combinations in 2012.
Disposal of exploration and evaluation assets On 21 February 2012 the Group completed the farm-down of one-third of its Uganda interests to both Total and CNOOC the partners for a headline consideration of $2.9 billion.
The Ugandan assets are classified as intangible exploration and evaluation assets and therefore the Group has formed an accounting policy under IAS 8 to account for the farm-down, whereby a profit has been recognised on disposal as the difference between total consideration and the net book value of the disposal assets.
The following is a reconciliation of the consideration and the value of assets disposed: $m Headline consideration 2,933.3 Contingent consideration 341.3 Net book value of assets disposed 2,573.6 Profit on disposal 701.0 The contingent consideration represents the fair value of completion statement amounts due from the partners on issue of Final Investment Decision FID in Uganda.
The total cash consideration received was $2.6 billion, with capital gains tax of $142 million being paid directly out of this amount.
The $2.6 billion cash consideration received represents headline consideration of $2.9 billion less deposits received in 2011.
In anticipation of the farm-down of the Ugandan assets to CNOOC and Total, the Uganda Revenue Authority URA issued an assessment for $473 million in respect of capital gains tax on the transaction.
At completion, $142 million was paid to the URA, being 30% of the tax assessed as legally required for an appeal.
The assessment denies relief for costs incurred by the Group in the normal course of developing the assets, and excludes certain contractual and statutory reliefs from capital gains tax that the Group maintains are properly allowable.
The appeal is scheduled to be heard by the Tax Appeals Tribunal in Kampala later in 2013.
On the advice of leading counsel, the Group believes that it has a strong case under both international and Ugandan law and currently views the most probable outcome to be that any liability will be at a similar level to the amount already paid on account.
Further disposals of oil and gas assets and non-oil and gas assets generating a profit on disposal of $1.5 million were also completed in 2012 2011: $2.0 million.

The amounts for intangible exploration and evaluation assets represent active exploration projects.
These amounts will be written off to the income statement as exploration costs unless commercial reserves are established or the determination process is not completed and there are no indications of impairment.
The outcome of ongoing exploration, and therefore whether the carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets will ultimately be recovered, is inherently uncertain.
Included within 2012 additions is $67.2 million of capitalised interest 2011: $128.8 million.
The Group only capitalises interest in respect of intangible exploration and evaluation assets where it is considered that development is highly likely and advanced appraisal and development is ongoing.
Exploration costs written-off were $670.9 million 2011: $120.6 million, in accordance with the Groups successful efforts accounting policy.
This requires that all costs associated with unsuccessful exploration are written-off in the income statement.
Write-offs associated with unsuccessful exploration activities during 2012 in Guyana, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Cte dIvoire, Suriname, Tanzania, Uganda and new ventures activity and licence relinquishments totalled $300 million.
As a result of the Groups review of the exploration asset values on its balance sheet compared with expected near-term work programmes and the relative attractiveness of further investment in these assets an additional write-down of $371 million has been made.
The principal elements of these write-downs are: the Odum discovery in Ghana where acreage has been relinquished $37 million : carried costs for Kudu in Namibia where progress towards commercialisation continues to be delayed $160 million : undeveloped discoveries in Mauritania $93 million and exploration costs to date in Sierra Leone where interest remains, but a hub-class commercial discovery has yet to be made $50 million.

During the year, the TEN project in Ghana was transferred from contingent resources to commercial reserves following submission of the Plan of Development to the Government of Ghana.
As a result, the $599.9 million of costs associated with the project was transferred from intangible exploration and evaluation assets to oil and gas assets.
The remainder of the transfers from intangible exploration and evaluation assets relate to the sanction of the Katy project and drilling of the Ketch SW flank in the UK.
The 2012 impairment loss relates to the MBoundi field in Congo 2011: MBoundi.
The recoverable amount was determined by estimating its value in use.
In calculating this impairment, management used a production profile based on proven and probable reserves estimates and a range of assumptions, including an oil price assumption equal to the forward curve in 2013 and 2014 and $90 per barrel 2011: $80 per barrel thereafter and a post-tax discount rate assumption of 10% the MBoundi field operates in a Production Sharing Contract regime under which tax is deducted at source and included within the Governments share of profit oil.
Depletion and amortisation for oil and gas properties is calculated on a unit-of-production basis, using the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves at the end of the period plus production in the period, generally on a field-by-field basis.
Commercial reserves estimates are based on a number of underlying assumptions including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, which are inherently uncertain.
Commercial reserves estimates are based on a Group reserves report produced by an independent engineer.
However, the amount of reserves that will ultimately be recovered from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the fields life.

Assets classified as held for sale In March 2012, the Board resolved to dispose of the Groups Asia operations and negotiations with interested parties have subsequently taken place.
These operations, which are expected to be sold within 12 months, have been classified as a disposal group held for sale and presented separately on the balance sheet.
The proceeds of disposal are expected to exceed the book value of the related net assets and accordingly no impairment losses have been recognised on the classification of these operations as held for sale.
The Groups Asia operations are included in the Europe, South America and Asia segment.
The major classes of assets and liabilities comprising the operations classified as held for sale are as follows: 2012 $m Intangible exploration and appraisal assets 28.4 Property, plant and equipment 32.3 Trade and other receivables 4.7 Other current assets 33.0 Cash and cash equivalents 18.0 Total assets classified as held for sale 116.4 Trade and other payables 47.3 Provisions 1.6 Total liabilities associated with assets classified as held for sale 48.9 67.5 Net assets of disposal group Note 18.

Short-term borrowings, term loans and guarantees are secured by fixed and floating charges over the oil and gas assets of the Group.
Capital management The Group defines capital as the total equity of the Group.
Capital is managed in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits to stakeholders and to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
Tullow is not subject to any externally-imposed capital requirements.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may put in place new debt facilities, issue new shares for cash, repay debt, engage in active portfolio management, adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, or other such restructuring activities as appropriate.
No significant changes were made to the capital management objectives, policies or processes during the year ended 31 December 2012.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the net debt ratio, that is, the ratio of net debt to net debt plus equity.
Net debt is calculated as gross debt, as shown in the balance sheet, less cash and cash equivalents.
2012 2011 $m $m External borrowings 1,318.7 3,161.2 Less cash and cash equivalents note 16 330.2 307.1 Net debt 988.5 2,854.1 Equity 5,321.6 4,766.0 Net debt ratio 19% 60% The movement from 2011 is attributable to lower external borrowings during 2012, principally as a result of the proceeds from farm-down of the Groups Uganda interests and operating cash flows, partially offset by the Groups $1,849 million investment in development, appraisal and exploration activities.
Interest rate risk The interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities, excluding trade and other receivables and trade and other payables, at 31 December 2012 was as follows: US$ Euro Stg Other Total $m $m $m $m $m Cash at bank at floating interest rate 271.3 24.5 28.3 6.1 330.2 Fixed rate debt 50.0 50.0 Floating rate debt 1,097.1 171.6 1,268.7 875.8 24.5 143.3 6.1 988.5 www.

Financial liabilities continued The profile at 31 December 2011 for comparison purposes was as follows: US$ Euro Stg Other Total $m $m $m $m $m Cash at bank at floating interest rate 138.9 5.2 38.5 21.3 203.9 Cash at bank on which no interest is received 99.5 0.6 0.5 2.6 103.2 Fixed rate debt re-presented 300.0 300.0 Floating rate debt re-presented 2,697.4 163.8 2,861.2 2,759.0 5.8 124.8 23.9 2,854.1 Certain numbers shown above do not correspond to the 2011 financial statements as a result of representation to assist with comparability to 2012, whereby the amounts disclosed represent the Group external borrowing rather than the carrying value of the facilities.
Cash at bank at floating interest rate consisted of deposits which earn interest at rates set in advance for periods ranging from overnight to one month by reference to market rates.
Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance from overnight to three months at rates determined by US dollar LIBOR and Sterling LIBOR.
Fixed rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance for periods greater than three months or bank borrowings where the interest rate has been fixed through interest rate hedging.
The $3.5 billion Reserves Based Lending credit facility, which was refinanced in November 2012, incurs interest on outstanding debt at Sterling or US dollar LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
The outstanding debt is repayable in line with the amortisation of bank commitments over the period to the final maturity date of 7 November 2019, or such time as is determined by reference to the remaining reserves of the assets, whichever is earlier.
The $500 million Revolving credit facility is repayable in full on 31 December 2014.
The facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at US dollar LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
At the end of December 2012, the headroom under the two facilities amounted to $2,202 million: $1,702 million under the $3.5 billion Reserves Based Lending credit facility and $500 million under the Revolving credit facility.
At the end of December 2011, the headroom under the two facilities amounted to $826 million: $176 million under the $3.5 billion Reserves Based Lending credit facility and $650 million under the Revolving credit facility.
The increase in headroom is as a result of repayment of the Reserves Based Lending credit facility with proceeds from the Uganda farm-down.
The Group is exposed to floating rate interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at floating interest rates.
The Group hedges its floating rate interest exposure on an ongoing basis through the use of interest rate swaps.
The mark-to-market position of the Groups interest rate portfolio as at 31 December 2012 is a liability of $2.9 million 2011: $7.0 million liability.
Interest rate hedges are included in fixed rate debt in the above table.
Foreign currency risk Wherever possible, the Group conducts and manages its business in Sterling UK and US dollars all other countries, the operating currencies of the industry in the areas in which it operates.
The Groups borrowing facilities are also denominated in Sterling and US dollars, which further assists in foreign currency risk management.
From time to time the Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in other currencies.
These exposures are managed by executing foreign currency financial derivatives, typically to manage exposures arising on corporate transactions such as acquisitions and disposals.
There were no foreign currency financial derivatives in place at the 2012 year-end 2011: nil.
Cash balances are held in other currencies to meet immediate operating and administrative expenses or to comply with local currency regulations.
As at 31 December 2012, the only material monetary assets or liabilities of the Group that were not denominated in the functional currency of the respective subsidiaries involved were 106.0 million cash drawings under the Groups borrowing facilities 2011: 106.0 million.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are net liabilities of $143.3 million 2011: net liabilities of $124.8 million, re-presented net of cash.
Foreign currency sensitivity analyses The Group is mainly exposed to fluctuations in the US dollar.
The Group measures its market risk exposure by running various sensitivity analyses including assessing the impact of reasonably possible movements in key variables.
The sensitivity analyses include only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 20% change in foreign currency rates.
As at 31 December 2012, a 20% increase in foreign exchange rates against the functional currencies of entities in the Group would have resulted in a decrease in foreign currency denominated liabilities and equity of $28.5 million 2011: $27.3 million while a 20% decrease would have resulted in an increase in foreign currency denominated liabilities and equity of $34.3 million 2011: $32.8 million.
154 Tullow Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Accounts FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5 Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity requirements via the use of both short and long-term cash flow projections, supplemented by debt financing plans and active portfolio management.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has established an appropriate liquidity risk management framework covering the Groups short-, mediumand long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group closely monitors and manages its liquidity risk.
Cash forecasts are regularly produced and sensitivities run for different scenarios including, but not limited to, changes in commodity prices, different production rates from the Groups portfolio of producing fields and delays in development projects.
The following table details the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities with agreed repayment periods.

Financial instruments Financial risk management objectives The Group holds a portfolio of commodity derivative contracts, with various counterparties, covering its underlying oil and gas businesses.
In addition, the Group holds a small portfolio of interest rate derivatives.
The use of derivative financial instruments derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is monitored and reviewed internally on a regular basis.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivatives, for speculative purposes.
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The Group considers the carrying value of all its financial assets and liabilities to be materially the same as their fair value.
The Group has no material financial assets that are past due.
The Group predominantly sells to large oil and gas multinationals, no financial assets are impaired at the balance sheet date and all are considered to be fully recoverable.
Fair values of derivative instruments All derivatives are recognised at fair value on the balance sheet with valuation changes recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the derivatives have been designated as cash flow or fair value hedges.
Fair value is the amount for which the asset or liability could be exchanged in an arms length transaction at the relevant date.
Where available fair values are determined using quoted prices in active markets.
To the extent that market prices are not available, fair values are estimated by reference to market-based transactions, or using standard valuation techniques for the applicable instruments and commodities involved.
The Groups derivative carrying and fair values were as follows: Less than 1-3 Total 31 December 2012 1 year years 2012 $m $m $m Assets liabilities Cash flow hedges Oil derivatives 5.4 32.6 38.0 Gas derivatives 0.1 0.1 Interest rate derivatives 0.9 2.0 2.9 4.6 30.6 35.2 Deferred premium Oil derivatives 43.6 49.4 93.0 Gas derivatives 0.4 0.5 0.9 44.0 49.9 93.9 39.4 19.3 58.7 Total liabilities Less than 1-3 Total 31 December 2011 1 year years 2011 Assets liabilities $m $m $m Cash flow hedges Oil derivatives 10.0 33.1 43.1 Gas derivatives 0.4 1.1 1.5 Interest rate derivatives 4.0 3.0 7.0 5.6 29.0 34.6 Deferred premium Oil derivatives 47.7 32.9 80.6 Gas derivatives 0.3 0.3 0.6 48.0 33.2 81.2 Total liabilities 42.4 4.2 46.6 156 Tullow Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Accounts FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5 Derivatives maturity and the timing of their recycling into income or expense coincide.
The following provides an analysis of our financial instruments measured at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: All the Groups derivatives are Level 2 2011: Level 2.
Level 1: fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques which include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
There were no transfers between fair value levels during the year.
Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Oil and gas prices The Group uses a number of derivatives to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with its underlying oil and gas revenues.
Such commodity derivatives will tend to be priced using benchmarks, such as Brent Dated, D-1 Heren and M-1 Heren, which correlate as far as possible to the underlying oil and gas revenues respectively.
The Group hedges its estimated oil and gas revenues on a portfolio basis, aggregating its oil revenues from substantially all of its African oil interests and its gas revenues from substantially all of its UK gas interests.
At 31 December 2012, the Groups oil hedge position was summarised as follows: Oil hedges H1 2013 H2 2013 2014 2015 Volume bopd 35,000 35,000 24,500 11,500 Average price $ bbl 107.02 107.02 102.20 98.24 Average hedge prices are based on market prices as at 31 December 2012 and represent the current value of hedged volumes at that date.

As at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, all of the Groups oil and gas derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges.
The Groups oil and gas hedges have been assessed to be highly effective within the range prescribed under IAS 39 using regression analysis.
There is, however, the potential for a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Groups oil hedges arising from, among other factors, the discount on the Groups underlying African crude relative to Brent and the timing of oil liftings relative to the hedges.
There is also the potential for a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Groups gas hedges which arises from, among other factors, field production performance on any day.

Oil and gas sensitivity analysis The following analysis is intended to illustrate sensitivity to changes in market variables, being dated Brent oil prices and UK D-1 Heren and M-1 Heren natural gas prices.
The analysis, which is used internally by management to monitor derivatives, has been prepared using the following assumptions: The pricing adjustments relate only to the point forward mark-to-market MTM valuations: The price sensitivities assume there is no ineffectiveness related to the oil and gas hedges: and The sensitivities have been run only on the intrinsic element of the hedge as management consider this to be the material component of oil and gas hedge valuations.
As at 31 December 2012, a 10% increase in the dated Brent oil price curve would have decreased equity only adjusting the intrinsic value element by approximately $7.1 million 2011: $17.8 million : a 10% decrease would have increased equity by approximately $3.4 million 2011: $7.2 million.
As at 31 December 2012, a 10% increase in the UK D-1 Heren and M-1 Heren natural gas price curves would have decreased equity by approximately $1.0 million 2011: $3.3 million : a 10% decrease would have increased equity by approximately $1.3 million 2011: $2.0 million.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis As at 31 December 2012, the interest rate derivative position was a liability of $2.9 million 2011: $7.0 million : a 25bps increase in the underlying interest rate would increase equity by approximately $0.2 million 2011: $0.5 million.
Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will fail to perform, or fail to pay amounts due, resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The primary activities of the Group are oil and gas exploration and production.
The Group has a credit policy that governs the management of credit risk, including the establishment of counterparty credit limits and specific transaction approvals.
The Group limits credit risk by assessing creditworthiness of potential counterparties before entering into transactions with them and continuing to evaluate their creditworthiness after transactions have been initiated.
The Group attempts to mitigate credit risk by entering into contracts that permit netting and allow for termination of the contract upon the occurrence of certain events of default.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions undertaken is spread amongst approved counterparties.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics.
The maximum financial exposure due to credit risk on the Groups financial assets, representing the sum of cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivative assets, trade receivables and other current assets, as at 31 December 2012 was $1,769.7 million 2011: $1,254.2 million.

A review of all decommissioning estimates was undertaken by an independent specialist in 2010 which has been assessed and updated internally for the purposes of the 2012 financial statements.
Assumptions, based on the current economic environment, have been made which management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions.
However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time.
Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates.
This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.

No deferred tax has been provided on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, as the Group has no plans to remit these to the UK in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent it is considered probable that those assets will be recoverable.
This involves an assessment of when those deferred tax assets are likely to reverse, and a judgement as to whether or not there will be sufficient taxable profits available to offset the tax assets when they do reverse.
This requires assumptions regarding future profitability and is therefore inherently uncertain.
To the extent assumptions regarding future profitability change, there can be an increase or decrease in the level of deferred tax assets recognised which can result in a charge or credit in the period in which the change occurs.

Subsequent events Since the balance sheet date Tullow has continued to progress its exploration, development and business growth strategies.
In January 2013, Tullow has completed the farm-in announced in November 2012 to gain a 40% operated interest in the Hyperdynamics Corporations oil and gas exploration licence offshore Guinea.
On 11 December 2012 the Group announced the acquisition of 100% of Spring Energy Norway AS Spring, a Norwegian exploration company.
The acquisition of Spring added a portfolio of 28 offshore licences across Norways continental shelf in the North, Norwegian and Barents Seas.
The acquisition of Spring enables the Group rapidly to build a strong platform for future growth in Norway.
The transaction had an effective date of 1 September 2012 but completed on 22 January 2013 and this is therefore the acquisition date.
The headline purchase price of $372.3 million was adjusted for estimated completion statement adjustments of $46.8 million.
The transaction will be accounted for in 2013 as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
As at the date of authorisation for issue of these financial statements the initial accounting for the business combination is incomplete due to the proximity of the completion date to the date of authorisation of these financial statements.
As a result the Group is unable to disclose the provisional fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired or identify resulting goodwill or contingent liabilities.
Pension schemes The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes for staff and Executive Directors.
The contributions are payable to external funds which are administered by independent trustees.
Contributions during the year amounted to $13.1 million 2011: $10.1 million.
As at 31 December 2012, there was a liability of $0.8 million 2011: $0.3 million for contributions payable included in creditors.
