Financial accounts Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 1 Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRS The Groups financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 28February 2013 and the statement of financial position was signedon the Boards behalf by D C Lockwood and J C Silver.
LairdPLC is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled inEngland and Wales and its ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The Groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted for use in the European Union IFRS and the principal accounting policies adopted by the Group are set out in note 2.
2 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, that have been measured at fair value, and accounting for pensions.
Theconsolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest onehundred thousand unless otherwise indicated.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the directors to make judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported income and expense during the reporting periods.
Although these judgements and assumptions are based on the directors best knowledge of the amount, events or actions, actual results may differ from these estimates.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are the measurement and impairment of goodwill, the measurement of dened benefit pension assets and obligations and the measurement of income and deferred taxes.
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired on an annual basis and this requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which the intangible assets are allocated.
This involves estimation of future cash ows and choosing a suitable discount rate see note 17.
Measurement of dened benefit pension obligations requires estimation of future changes in salaries and ination, as well as mortality rates, the expected return on assets and the selection of a suitable discount rate see note 35.
The Group is subject to income taxes in a number of tax jurisdictions and judgements are applied in deciding the level of provisions for income taxes.
To the extent that the final outcome differs from the tax that has been provided, adjustments will be made to provisions held in the period the determination is made.
The accounting policies set out below have been used to prepare the financial information.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated Group comprises Laird PLC and its subsidiary undertakings the Group.
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared as of the same reporting date as the parent, using consistent accounting policies where appropriate.
Intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are included until the date on which theGroup ceases to control them.
All business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of a business combination is measured as the aggregate of the fair values, at the acquisition date, of any assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group.
For acquisitions before 1 January 2010, costs directly attributable to the combination were capitalised.
The identiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree are measured initially at fair value at the acquisition date.
The excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identiable assets, including those of an intangible and tangible nature and liabilities is recognised as goodwill.
74 Laird PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Business review Operating review Financial review Governance Financial accounts Additional information 2 Accounting policies continued Currency translation The financial statements for each of the Groups subsidiaries are prepared using its functional currency.
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates.
The presentation currency of the Group is sterling.
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
In the Group accounts the results and cash ows of overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling using weighted average rates of exchange for the period.
Net investments in overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising from retranslating opening net investments and the retained profits for the period of overseas subsidiaries, less exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against overseas investments, are shown as movements in equity.
All other exchange differences are dealt with in the income statement for the period.
Exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised as a separate component of shareholders equity.
On disposal of a foreign operation, any cumulative exchange differences held in shareholders equity that relate to the disposed operation are transferred to the income statement.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received and excludes intra-group sales and value-added taxes and represents net invoice value.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a third party, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the economic benets associated with the transaction will ow to theGroup.
Retirement benefit obligations Under IAS 19 the assets and liabilities of dened benefit pension plans are recognised at fair value in the statement of financial position and the operating and nancing costs of dened benefit pension plans are recognised in the income statement as operating costs and interest costs respectively.
Variations from expected costs, arising from the experience of the plans or changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
The cost of providing benets under the dened benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benets to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of dened benefit obligation and is based on actuarial advice.
The assets of dened benefit plans are recognised at fair value in the statement of financial position and the liabilities are recognised at present value using a high quality corporate bond rate.
The Group applies IFRIC 14, which allows the Group to recognise a surplus in schemes where an unconditional right to a refund or benefit available in the form of reduced contribution rates exists.
Contributions to dened contribution schemes are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they become payable.
Share based payments The fair value of Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, Medium Term Incentive Plan MTIP and Restricted Share Plan RSP shares awarded is estimated at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the LTIP, MTIP and RSP shares were awarded including market based performance conditions.
The fair value of share options granted is estimated at the date of grant using a binomial lattice method of calculation, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which share options were granted.
Non-market Company performance and service conditions are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.
No expense is recognised for grants that do not vest and charges previously made are reversed except that an expense is recognised for grants where vesting is conditional upon a market condition andthese are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided all the other vesting conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions, the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
75 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Laird PLC Financial accounts Notes to the financial statements continued for the year to 31 December 2012 2 Accounting policies continued Where the terms for an equity settled award are modied, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modied.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any modication, which increases the total fair value of the share based payment, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured atthe date of modication.
In circumstances where the equity settled grant is cancelled or settled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation or settlement, and any expense not yet recognised for the grant isrecognised immediately.
Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets, including patents, trade secrets, brand names and customer relationships, are recognised separately from goodwill and capitalised at fair value and amortised over their estimated useful economic lives.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis.
The estimated useful life of an intangible asset ranges between 3 and 20 years depending onits nature.
Research and development Research and development expenditure is expensed as it is incurred, except for certain development costs, which are capitalised as intangible assets when it is probable that the development project will be commercially viable, and certain criteria, including commercial and technological feasibility have been met.
Intangible assets arising in this manner are amortised over their useful economic lives, from the product launch date, which is typically less than 4 years.
Intangible assets relating to products in the development phase, both internally generated and externally acquired, are subject to an impairment review at each balance sheet date, or earlier should indication of impairment arise.
Any impairment losses are written off immediately to the incomestatement.
Goodwill On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to thenet assets acquired.
Goodwill arises where the fair value of theconsideration given for a business exceeds the fair value of such net assets.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill set off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Income taxes Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the followingexceptions: F where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: F in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and F deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates toitems that are credited or charged to equity.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement or statement of comprehensive income.
76 Laird PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Business review Operating review Financial review Governance Financial accounts Additional information 2 Accounting policies continued Dividends Dividends paid are charged to retained earnings on the earlier date of payment or the date on which they become a legal liability of theCompany.
Interest Interest is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost comprises the purchase price and directly attributable costs, for example, initial delivery and handling costs and installation and assemblycosts.
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated.
For all other property, plant, and equipment depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis to allocate cost less residual values of the assets over their useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years or less Leasehold buildings 50 years or the lease term if less Computer equipment 5 years or less Motor vehicles 4 years Other plant and machinery 13 years or less A proportion of one years depreciation is charged in the year the asset comes into service or is sold.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at least at each financial year end.
Impairment of assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cash-generating units fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
This is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
If the asset does not generate cash inows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs is determined.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the asset.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Leases Where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset subject to a lease, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
All other leases are treated as operating leases, and the related charges are expensed to the income statement evenly over the lease term.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and included in property, plant and equipment at fair value.
Each asset is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset.
The obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance charges in respect of future periods, are included as appropriate under current, or non-current, trade and other payables.
The interest element of the rental obligation is allocated to accounting periods during the lease term to reect a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the obligation for each accountingperiod.
Segment reporting Segments are identied on the basis of management information which is presented to the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker to assess the performance of each segment.
77 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Laird PLC Financial accounts Notes to the financial statements continued for the year to 31 December 2012 2 Accounting policies continued Exceptional items These items are presented within the relevant income statement category.
The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide a better indication of the Groups underlying business performance.
Events which may give rise to the classication of items as exceptional include the restructuring of businesses, the transaction costs of acquiring new businesses, the integration of new businesses, gains or losses on the disposal of businesses, and asset impairments.
Financial assets Financial assets include cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables.
Trade and other receivables are recognised on the trade date, being the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset and are measured at amortised cost less any provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice.
The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account.
Impaired debts are derecognised when they are assessed as irrecoverable.
Trade and other receivables are discounted when the time value of money is considered material.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired.
Derivative financial assets are classied as held for trading, unless they are designated as hedging instruments.
These assets are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses in value being recognised in the income statement.
A financial asset or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is derecognised where: F the rights to receive cash ows from the asset have expired: or F the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash ows from the asset and either a has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of theasset.
Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less, in the case of a liability not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Measurement after initial recognition is at amortised cost, with the changes in the carrying amount being taken through the income statement.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income and finance expense.
All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging The Group may use derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate uctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the income statement.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity proles.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
In accordance with the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7 these are Level 2 derivative financial instruments.
For those contracts designated as hedges the hedging relationship is documented at its inception.
This documentation identies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration.
Such hedges are tested, both at inception to ensure they are expected to be effective and periodically throughout their duration to assess continuing effectiveness.
78 Laird PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Business review Operating review Financial review Governance Financial accounts Additional information 2 Accounting policies continued Cash ow hedges These are used to hedge potential changes in cash ows of highly probable forecast transactions.
For cash ow hedges, the effective portion of the fair value movement on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs.
Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are transferred to the income statement or to the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above.
If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to profit or loss.
Net investment hedges These are used to hedge exposure to changes in the value of the Groups interests in the net assets of foreign operations.
Theportion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in shareholders equity, with any ineffective portion recognised in theincomestatement.
Treasury shares The Laird PLC shares held in the Laird 1990 Employee benefit Trust the Trust are classied in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash in the statement of financial position comprises cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity in three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash ow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as dened above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
For nished goods and work in progress, cost includes directly attributable costs and certain overhead expenses principally administration costs are excluded.
Net realisable value is determined as estimated selling price less all estimated costs ofcompletion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling anddistribution.
Provisions These comprise liabilities of uncertain timing or amount.
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outow of resources embodying economic benets will be required to settle theobligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted where the time value of moneyis material.

Capitalised development expenditure is amortised on a straight line basis.
All amortisation charges for the year have been charged against operating profits.
The total amount of research and development activity incurred during 2012 is 37.4m 2011, 40.2m of which 8.5m 2011, 9.1m was capitalised.
Goodwill Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed annually for assessment of impairment in accordance with IAS 36.
No impairment to goodwill was identied.
Goodwill was tested for impairment for the following cash generating units CGUs : F Performance Materials division F Wireless Systems division Performance Materials had a goodwill balance of 227.6m at the year end 2011, 223.9m.
Wireless Systems had a goodwill balance of 190.7m at the year end 2011, 190.2m.
The remaining goodwill in the Handset Antennae business was written off in 2011.
All of the recoverable amounts are based on value in use.
The key assumptions were: F A pre-tax discount rate of 11.6% 2011, 10.0%.
During the year some of the inputs used to calculate the discount rate were revised which drove the increase compared to 2011.
F Revenue growth rates for each CGU were based on relevant external market estimates and management knowledge.
The discount rate has been applied to cash ow forecasts for 2013 toperpetuity.
The forecast cash ows for 2013 are based on what has been approved internally by the Board for the 2013 budget.
Revenue estimates which underpin the forecasts for 20142017, have been based on external market estimates for PCs, tablets, smartphones, telematics and telecoms but after reecting Managements views of average selling prices, product penetration trends and their impact on the size of the addressable market.
Cash ows for 2017 onwards for both divisions have been increased by 3% per annum 2011, 3% per annum.
Downside sensitivities have been applied to the cash ow estimates to assess the impact upon the headroom over the carrying value of the assets and provide further comfort that no impairment is required.
Performance Materials has the greatest amount of headroom and Wireless Systems the least.
Revenues would have to be some 20% less than forecast for each period before some form of impairment would have to be considered.
Other acquired intangible assets Assets in this class are amortised over their estimated useful lives on astraight line basis.
The following useful lives have been determined for acquired intangible assets: Brand names 5 years Trade secrets 8 to 15 years Trade marks and names 5 to 15 years Patents the remaining duration of the 17 year legal right Licence the remaining duration of the 20 year legal right Customer relationships 10 to 20 years The expected life assigned to acquired customer relationships is an estimate and is not secured by any legal obligation on the customer to continue business with the Group for any nite period.
Other than goodwill, the Group does not hold any intangible assets with an indenitelife.

No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of temporary differences of 21.5m 2011, 33.2m relating to the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences at 31 December 2012 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by overseas tax jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.
99 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Laird PLC Financial accounts Notes to the financial statements continued for the year to 31 December 2012 25 Deferred taxes continued Factors affecting future tax charges The UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 23% effective 1 April 2013 and disclosure of deferred tax has been adjusted to reect the enactment of the revised rate but with no significant impact on these financial statements.
The December Autumn Statement also announced subsequent reductions in the UK corporation tax rate to 21% by 1 April 2014.
These changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are not included in these financial statements.
The Company expects the impact of these changes to the financial statements will be negligible.

The forward contracts have a principal value of 70.0m 2011, 44.0m and are mainly denominated in US dollar and Chinese Renminbi.
These contracts have not been designated as cash ow hedges and the increase in fair value during 2012 of 0.4m 2011, 0.2m decrease has been taken to the income statement.
102 Laird PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Business review Operating review Financial review Governance Financial accounts Additional information 28 Financial instruments continued Interest rate and currency prole The Groups policy is to maintain an appropriate balance between variable and xed interest rate borrowings.
Interest rate swaps and similar instruments are used to manage interest costs.
At 31 December 2012 approximately 49% of debt is at xed rate.
This position is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure it is still appropriate.
Interest rate risk The following table shows the sensitivity to a change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on oating rate borrowings.
There is no impact on the Groups equity.
The interest rates considered are sterling and USdollar, being the currencies in which the Group have historically issued debt and held investments.
The sensitivity analysis excludes all non-derivative xed rate nancialinstruments carried at amortised cost but includes those recognised at fair value as well as all non-derivative oating rate financial instruments.
Effect on profit before tax m 2012 50 basis points increase in US dollar interest rates 0.3 50 basis points increase in sterling interest rates A 50 basis point decrease in these interest rates would have an equal and opposite effect.
Effect on profit before tax m 2011 50 basis points increase in US dollar interest rates 0.4 50 basis points increase in sterling interest rates A 50 basis point decrease in these interest rates would have an equal and opposite effect.
Credit risk The Groups customer base is largely focused in the global electronics market where it has leading positions in its principal products with customers who themselves have significant market shares.
Inevitably this results in levels of business and trade receivables that are material in the overall Group context.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying amount of the financial assets.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to transactional currency exposures on sales and purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollar, Euro and Renminbi.
The Group policy is to match out the sales and purchases in these currencies wherever possible and then hedge out the residual exposures.
The following table shows the sensitivity to a possible change in US dollar, Euro and Renminbi exchange rates against sterling with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets, liabilities and forward currency contracts and the Groups equity due to changes in the fair value of forward currency hedges and net investment hedges.

103 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Laird PLC Financial accounts Notes to the financial statements continued for the year to 31 December 2012 28 Financial instruments continued Net investment hedging Included in borrowings are US $228m 140.2m and 33m 26.8m of debt which have been designated as a hedge of the net investments in the United States and Europe subsidiaries.
This is being used to hedge the Groups exposure to foreign exchange risk on these investments.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries.

Undrawn committed borrowing facilities The Groups financial policy is to maintain committed borrowing facilities, which provide substantial headroom over and above its day to day borrowing requirements.
The undrawn committed facilities available at 31 December were asfollows: 2012 2011 m m Expiring between three and four years 144.6 Expiring between four and five years 133.1 144.6 133.1 Loan covenants The principal covenants in the Groups committed loan facilities and loan note agreements that place restrictions on net borrowings are based on UK GAAP and are set out below: Interest cover The interest cover covenant is for earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax and amortisation EBITA to be not less than 3.0 times interest payable.
Net borrowings: EBITDA ratio Net borrowings must not exceed 3.5 times earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA.
The Group was in compliance with the covenants detailed above at 31 December 2012.
Fair value of financial instruments The US Private Placement loans with a book value of 86.1m 2011, 92.0m have an estimated fair value of 93.4m 2011, 100.6m which has been calculated by discounting cash ows at prevailing coupon rates as at 31 December 2012.
There are no material differences between fair value and book value on any of the other financial instruments.

Performance Conditions for awards made in 2010 under the LTIP and Option Plan The vesting requirements for the share options granted in 2010 are: Level of vesting in 2013 Applicable Performance Target: 2012 Earnings per share EPS Threshold 30% vesting 16.6 pence Full vesting 21.3 pence The extent to which awards granted under the LTIP in 2010 vest will be determined by reference to the Companys total shareholder return relative to FTSE 250 companies excluding investment trusts and the following targets will apply: Total Shareholder Return Amount of Award Vesting Performance Level % Upper Quartile Full vesting Median to Upper Quartile Pro-rata between 30% and full vesting Below Median Nil Performance conditions for awards made in 2011 under the LTIP and Option Plan Two measures were used to determine the extent to which awards made in 2011 would vest: achievement of a TSR target and an underlying EPS target.
For LTIP awards made in 2011, 75% is based on achievement of the TSR target and 25% is based on achievement of the EPS target.
For awards under the Option Plan, 75% is based on EPS and 25% on TSR.

31 employees 2011, 10 are members of four different dened benefit schemes and these schemes have approximately 1,600 2011, 1,600 deferred and current pensioners.
The employer contributions made to these schemes during the year were 0.3m 2011, 0.3m.
The total assessed value of the schemes assets at 31 December 2012, at their market value, is estimated at 102.7m 2011, 103.2m and the liabilities estimated at 100.5m 2011, 98.4m.
The Group has adopted IFRIC 14 which, depending on the rules of individual schemes, allows the Group to recognise pensions surpluses on the statement of financial position where there is an unconditional right to a refund or benefit available in the form of reduced contributions.
The resultant aggregate net pension liability under IAS 19 is 1.5m 2011, 1.0m asset.
The market value of the schemes assets, the present value of the schemes liabilities and the net pension assets and liability under IAS 19 at 31 December were as follows: Schemes in Schemes in surplus with a surplus with a right to Other right to Other a refund schemes Total a refund schemes Total 2012 2012 2012 2011 2011 2011 m m m m m m Annuities 7.3 1.8 9.1 8.3 1.0 9.3 Equities 23.7 23.7 26.3 26.3 Gilts and bonds 69.1 69.1 66.4 66.4 Other including cash 0.8 0.8 1.2 1.2 Total market value of assets 100.9 1.8 102.7 102.2 1.0 103.2 Present value of scheme liabilities 90.2 10.3 100.5 91.3 7.1 98.4 Funded status 10.7 8.5 2.2 10.9 6.1 4.8 Disallowed assets 3.7 3.7 3.8 3.8 Surplus deficit in the schemes 7.0 8.5 1.5 7.1 6.1 1.0 The expected long term rates of return on gilts and bonds are estimated at 3.3% per annum 2011, 3.3% and those for equities at 7.2% per annum 2011, 7.2%.
The returns on the annuities match the relevant liabilities.
Asset return assumptions have been derived by considering best estimates for the expected long-term real rates of return from the main asset classes.
For gilts and corporate bonds, a return in line with the returns available in the markets for these assets has been assumed.
For equities, a higher rate of return than for bond assets has been assumed, to reect the greater returns anticipated over the long term from a mixture of UK and overseas equities.

The directors are unable todetermine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income from the date of inception of the company schemes to 31December2003.
The Group estimates that the total value of contributions to dened benefit schemes will be 0.2m in 2013.
Within Sweden, the Group operates a scheme, included within amultiemployer plan, for its employees which is insured with Alecta.
This scheme is a dened benefit scheme, but Alecta is currently unable to provide sufficient information to report the Groups proportional share of the dened benefit commitments and the assets under management and expenses associated with the scheme.
Consequently, Alecta cannot provide the information regarding the Groups proportional share of the surplus or deficit in the scheme.
As a result the scheme is accounted for as if it were adened contribution scheme, although it is actually a dened benefit scheme.
