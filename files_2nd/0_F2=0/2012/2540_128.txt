Interest-bearing loans and borrowings continued 2010 Notes On 17 December 2010, Britvic plc issued US$163.0m and 7.5m of Senior Notes in the United States Private Placement market the 2010 Notes.
The 2010 Notes are additional borrowings to the 2007 and 2009 Notes.
Britvic plc makes semi-annual interest payments in US dollars and sterling under these notes.
The 2010 Notes are unsecured and rank pari passu in right of repayment with other senior unsecured indebtedness of the group.
In order to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and to ensure an appropriate mix of sterling and euro funding, the group has entered into a number of cross currency interest rate swaps.
The 2010 Notes were swapped into a mix of xed and oating rate sterling and xed euro liabilities through a series of US dollar to sterling and sterling to euro swap instruments.
These cross currency interest rate swap contracts have the same duration and other critical terms as the relevant borrowings they hedge and are designated as part of effective hedge relationships see note 26.
The amount, maturity and interest terms of the 2010 Notes are shown in the table below: Series Tranche Maturity date Amount Interest terms Swap interest A 7 year 17 December 2017 7.5m UK xed at 3.74% n a B 7 year 17 December 2017 US$25m US$ xed at 3.45% UK xed 3.85% US$25m US$ xed at 3.45% xed 3.34% C 10 year 17 December 2020 US$37m US$ xed at 4.04% UK LIBOR 1.24% US$23m US$ xed at 4.04% xed 3.85% US$10m US$ xed at 4.04% UK xed 4.49% D 12 year 17 December 2022 US$18m US$ xed at 4.14% UK LIBOR 1.18% US$25m US$ xed at 4.14% xed 3.97% The 2010 USPP cross currency swaps converted an amount of US dollar borrowings into a oating rate sterling liability.
To mitigate exposure to interest rates on a portion of this liability, 20m of 3-year interest rate swaps were transacted with an effective date of December 2011.
These interest rate swaps do not form part of an effective hedge relationship.
Covenants on all Notes include a term which states that Britvic plc must offer to repay the Notes should a change in control of the group occur which results in a downwards movement in the credit rating as dened in the Note purchase agreement.
Change of control waivers have been sought and received from the Companys bankers in relation to the Companys banking arrangements.
Pensions The group principal pension scheme for GB employees, the BPP BPP, has both a dened benefit and a dened contribution section.
The dened benefit section of the BPP was closed to new members on 1 August 2002, and following consultation with GB employees was closed to future accrual for active members with effect from 10 April 2011, with members moving into the dened contribution section for future service benets.
Contributions are paid into the Plan as determined by the Trustee, agreed by the Company and certied by an independent actuary in the Schedule of Contributions.
The latest formal actuarial valuation for contribution purposes was carried out as at 31 March 2010.
As a result of this valuation, a proposal was set out under which a monetary contribution or contributions will be made to enable the Trustee of the BPP to acquire an interest in a limited partnership.
This partnership interest is intended to provide the Trustee with an income of at least 5.0m per annum in each year over a 15 year period together with a final payment of up to a maximum of 105.0m to the extent required under funding conditions to be agreed to the satisfaction of the Trustee and the Company, at the end of the 15 year period.
As a result of the first tranche of the agreement, Britvic Scottish Limited Partnership Britvic SLP and Britvic Property Partnership Britvic Property were established by the group and properties were then transferred to Britvic Property at a value of 28.6m and leased back to Britvic Soft Drinks Limited.
Britvic SLP holds an investment in Britvic Property.
During the year, BPP entered into a second tranche of the pension funding partnership structure.
This tranche involved the sale and leaseback of certain group brands which were transferred to Britvic Brands LLP Britvic Brands at a value of 72.4m and licensed back to Britvic Soft Drinks Limited.
Britvic SLP holds an investment in Britvic Brands.
The BPP is a partner in Britvic SLP and is entitled to a share of the profits of the partnership over the next 15 years.
At the end of this period, the partnership capital allocated to the BPP will be changed to an amount equal to any funding deficit of the BPP at that time, up to a maximum value of 105.0m.
At that point the group may be required to transfer this amount in cash to the BPP.
Britvic SLP, Britvic Brands and Britvic Property are consolidated by the group.
The investment held by the BPP in Britvic SLP does not represent a plan asset for accounting purposes and is therefore not included in the fair value of plan assets.
The share of profits of Britvic SLP received by the BPP is accounted for by the group as contributions when paid.
The properties transferred to Britvic Property continue to be included within the groups property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet.
The group retains operational exibility over the transferred properties and brands, including the ability to substitute the properties and brands held by Britvic Property and Britvic Brands respectively.
In addition to the expected partnership income of at least 5.0m per annum, the group will make payments to the BPP of 7.5m by 31 December 2012 and 15.0m per annum by 31 December of each year from 2013 to 2017.
During the year 10.0m of additional contributions were paid to the BPP, of which 5.0m was paid by the group and 5.0m relates to income received from the pension funding partnership structure.

Pensions continued The amount recognised as an expense in relation to the BPP dened contribution scheme in the Consolidated Income Statement for 2012 was 10.3m 2011: 5.8m.
Britvics business in GB also has a secured unfunded unregistered retirement benefit scheme called The Britvic Executive Top Up Scheme BETUS which provides benets for members who have historically exceeded the Earnings Cap, or the Lifetime Allowance whilst members of the dened benefit section of the BPP.
BETUS closed to future accrual on 10 April 2011 which coincided with the closure of the dened benefit section of the BPP.
In Northern Ireland, the Britvic Northern Ireland Pension Plan BNIPP was closed to new members on 28 February 2006, and since this date new employees have been eligible to join a Stakeholder plan with Legal & General.
Employees of C&C Group transferred out of BNIPP on 30 June 2008 with the bulk transfer of assets for the C&C employees taking place in December 2009.
The latest formal actuarial valuation for contribution purposes was carried out as at 31 December 2008 and as a result shortfall correction additional contributions of 90,000 per month until 31 December 2010, and 125,000 per month from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2019 are being paid in accordance with the Recovery Plan dated December 2009.
In relation to the Britvic Ireland Pension Plan BIPP, during the year, the Trustee received approval from the Irish Pension Board for two significant changes to the BIPP, being the removal of the guaranteed annual 3% pension increase for pensions in payment and the introduction of a salary cap of 50k for future service accrual.
As part of the changes, Britvic agreed to pay the cost on pension levy plan assets introduced by the Irish government in 2011.
The removal of the guaranteed pension increase has resulted in the recognition of a curtailment gain of 25.2m 21.3m which has been recognised as an exceptional item.
The changes signicantly improve the funding position of the BIPP.
The amount recognised as an expense in relation to the Irish dened contribution schemes in the Consolidated Income Statement for 2012 was 0.3m 2011: 0.6m.
All group pension schemes are administered by trustees who are independent of the groups nances.
The assets and liabilities of the pension schemes were valued on an IAS 19 basis at 30 September 2012 by Towers Watson BPP, Invesco BIPP and Buck BNIPP.
Included within the pension liability on the consolidated balance sheet is an accrual of 1.8m 2011: 1.4m for retirement indemnities in respect of Britvic France.
This liability is considered to be immaterial and no further disclosure is included within this note.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate on assets assumption for the portfolio.
Demographic assumptions The most significant non-financial assumption is the assumed rate of longevity.
This is based on standard actuarial tables, which for the BPP are known as SAPS Series 1.
An allowance for future improvements in longevity has also been included.
The following life expectancy assumptions have been used: 2012 2012 2012 2011 2011 2011 years years years years years years ROI NI GB ROI NI GB Current pensioners at age 65 males 23.1 21.0 22.1 22.7 20.9 22.0 Current pensioners at age 65 females 24.7 23.8 24.7 24.4 23.7 24.5 Future pensioners currently aged 45 at age 65 males 25.8 22.8 24.3 25.6 22.7 24.2 Future pensioners currently aged 45 at age 65 females 26.9 25.3 27.0 26.7 25.2 26.9 The mortality assumptions used to calculate the GB pension obligation were revised in 2010 following a mortality analysis carried out as part of the actuarial valuation of the BPP at 31 March 2010.

Pensions continued Sensitivities The value of plan assets is sensitive to market conditions, particularly equity values.
Changes in assumptions used for determining retirement benefit costs and obligations may have a material impact on the Consolidated Income Statement and balance sheet.
The main assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of ination and the assumed mortality rate.
The following table provides an estimate of the potential impact of each of these variables on the principal pension plans.

The ROI curtailment gain in 2012 has been recognised under IAS19 Employee Benets arising from the removal of the guaranteed pension indexation.
The ROI curtailment gain in 2011 was triggered by the redundancies of employees resulting in a significant number of members moving from active to deferred status in the period, thereby no longer accruing future entitlement.
The GB curtailment gain in 2011 year arose due to the closure to future accrual of the dened benefit section of the GB plan.
