Overview Strategic review Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Notes to the consolidated financial statement 1.
General information G4S plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and entities its subsidiaries controlled by the company collectively comprising the group and the groups interest in associates and jointly controlled entities made up to 31 December each year.
The group operates throughout the world and in a wide range of functional currencies, the most significant being the euro, the US dollar and sterling.
The groups financial statements are presented in sterling, as the groups primary listing is in the UK.
The address of the registered office is given on page 150.
In preparing the financial statements this year the format and layout of certain disclosures have been revised in regard to the principles set out in the Financial Reporting Councils publication Cutting Clutter.
These revisions have been implemented to make the financial statements easier to follow and to provide readers with a clearer understanding of the financial performance of the group.
Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements of the group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted for use in the European Union adopted IFRSs.
The company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
These are presented on pages 132 to 141.
3. significant accounting policies a Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of the group have been prepared under the going concern basis and using the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain non-current assets and financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Judgements made by the directors in the application of these accounting policies which have a significant effect on the financial statements, and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment, are discussed in note 4.
The directors are confident that, after making enquiries and on the basis of current financial projections and available facilities, they have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Further information on the going concern assessment is given in note 33 on pages 116 to 119.
The comparative income statement for the year ended 31 December 2011 has been re-presented for operations qualifying as discontinued during the current year.
Revenue from continuing operations has been reduced by 556m and PBT has been decreased by 22m compared to the gures published previously.
Further details of discontinued operations are presented within note 7.
In addition, the comparative consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2011 has been restated to reect the completion during 2012 of the initial accounting in respect of acquisitions made during 2011.
Adjustments made to the provisional calculation of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired amount to 9m, with an equivalent increase in the reported value of goodwill.
The impact of these adjustments on the net assets acquired is presented in note 17.
The prior year statement of changes in equity has been restated to show the movements in the reserve for non-controlling interests.
The prior year cash ow statement has been restated to show own shares purchased within nancing activities, rather than investing activities.
b Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the group.
Control is achieved where the group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benets from its activities, determined either by the groups ownership percentage, or by the terms of any shareholder agreement.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired business are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
The cost of acquisition is measured as the acquisition date fair values of the assets transferred to the vendor and does not include transaction costs.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency in the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identiable net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the year ofacquisition.
The cost of acquisition includes the present value of deferred and contingent consideration payable, including that in respect of put options held by non-controlling shareholders, as estimated at the date of acquisition.
For acquisitions prior to 1 January 2010 subsequent changes to the present value of the estimate of contingent consideration and any difference upon final settlement of such a liability are recognised as adjustments to the cost of acquisition.
For acquisitions after 1 January 2010 such changes are recognised in the income statement with respect to contingent consideration and in other comprehensive income with respect to put options.
Non-controlling interests are stated at their proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
profits and losses are applied in the proportion of their respective ownership to the interest of the parent and to the non-controlling interest.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of control or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Joint ventures A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control, in that strategic, financial and operating decisions require the unanimous consent of the parties.
The groups interest in joint ventures is accounted for using the proportionate consolidation method, whereby the groups share of the results and assets and liabilities of a jointly-controlled entity is combined line by line with similar items in the groups consolidated financial statements.
G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 89 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3. significant accounting policies continued b Basis of consolidation continued Associates An associate is an entity over which the group is in a position to exercise significant inuence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the groups consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in associates are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the groups share of the net assets of the associates, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of the associates in excess of the groups interest in those associates are not recognised.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Where a group company transacts with a joint venture or associate of the group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the groups interest in the relevant joint venture or associate.
c Foreign currencies The financial statements of each of the groups businesses are prepared in the functional currency applicable to that business.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities which are denominated in other currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on that date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value which are denominated in other currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items measured at historical cost denominated in other currencies are not retranslated.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement for the period.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the groups overseas operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on their acquisition, are translated into sterling at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expenses are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for the period unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rate prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income, together with exchange differences arising on monetary items that are in substance a part of the groups net investment in foreign operations and on borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments where and to the extent that the hedges are deemed to be effective.
On disposal translation differences are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
d Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting In accordance with its treasury policy, the group only holds or issues derivative financial instruments to manage the groups exposure to financial risk, not for trading purposes.
Such financial risk includes the interest risk on the groups variable-rate borrowings, the fair value risk on the groups xedrate borrowings, commodity risk in relation to its diesel consumption and foreign exchange risk on transactions, on the translation of the groups results and on the translation of the groups net assets measured in foreign currencies.
The group manages these risks through a range of derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, xed rate agreements, commodity swaps, commodity options, forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position as financial assets or liabilities at fair value.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the derivatives qualify for hedge accounting.
Where derivatives do qualify for hedge accounting, the treatment of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged as described below.
Fair value hedge The change in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the related portion of the hedged item is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Cash ow and net investment hedges The change in the fair value of the portion of the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity and subsequently recycled to the income statement when the hedged cash ow or hedged net investment impacts the income statement.
The ineffective portion of the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the income statement.
90 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Strategic review Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 3. significant accounting policies continued e Intangible assets Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by the application of the acquisition method.
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the groups interest in the fair value of the identiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly-controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
No goodwill arises on the acquisition of an additional interest from a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary as this is accounted for as an equity transaction.
Goodwill is stated at cost, less any accumulated impairment losses, and is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that amounts may be impaired.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Acquisition-related intangible assets Intangible assets on acquisitions that are either separable or arising from contractual rights are recognised at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Such acquisition-related intangible assets include trademarks, technology, customer contracts and customer relationships.
The fair value of acquisitionrelated intangible assets is determined by reference to market prices of similar assets, where such information is available, or by the use of appropriate valuation techniques, including the royalty relief method and the excess earnings method.
Acquisition-related intangible assets are amortised by equal annual instalments over their expected economic life.
The directors review acquisitionrelated intangible assets on an ongoing basis and, where appropriate, provide for any impairment in value.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Trademarks and technology up to a maximum of five years Customer contracts and customer relationships up to a maximum of ten years Other intangible assets Development expenditure represents expenditure incurred in establishing new services and products of the group.
Such expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only if the following can be demonstrated: the expenditure creates an identiable asset, its cost can be measured reliably, it is probable that it will generate future economic benets, it is technically and commercially feasible and the group has sufficient resources to complete development.
In all other instances, the cost of such expenditure is taken directly to the income statement.
Capitalised development expenditure is amortised over the period during which the expenditure is expected to be revenue-producing, up to a maximum of ten years.
The directors review the capitalised development expenditure on an ongoing basis and, where appropriate, provide for any impairment in value.
Research expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
Capitalised computer software is stated at cost, net of amortisation and any provision for impairment.
Amortisation is charged on software so as to write off the cost of the assets to their estimated residual values by equal annual instalments over their expected useful economic lives up to a maximum of eight years.
f Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment other than freehold land.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of the assets to their estimated residual values by equal annual instalments over their expected useful economic lives as follows: Freehold and long leasehold buildings up to 50 years Short leasehold buildings under 50 years over the life of the lease Equipment and motor vehicles two to ten years Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of their expected useful economic lives or the term of the relevant lease.
Where significant, the residual values and the useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment are re-assessed annually.
g Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.
Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry interest and are stated initially at their fair value.
The carrying amount of trade receivables is reduced through the use of a bad debt allowance account.
The group provides for bad debts based upon an analysis of those that are past due in accordance with local conditions and past default experience.
Service concession assets Under the terms of a Private Finance Initiative PFI or similar project the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset remain largely with the purchaser of the associated services.
In such cases, the groups interest in the asset is classied as a financial asset and included at its discounted value within trade and other receivables, to the extent to which the group has an unconditional right to receive cash from the grantor of the concession for the construction of the asset.
To the extent that the group has the right to charge for the use of such an asset, conditional upon the extent of the use, the group recognises an intangible asset.
G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 91 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3. significant accounting policies continued g Financial instruments continued Current asset investments Current asset investments comprise investments in securities, which are classied as held-for-trading.
They are initially recognised at cost, including transaction costs, and subsequently measured at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash ow statement.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing bank overdrafts, loans and loan notes are recognised at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are recognised in the income statement on an accrual basis using the effective interest method.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated initially at fair value.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the group are recorded at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
h Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost represents expenditure incurred in the ordinary course of business in bringing inventories to their present condition and location and includes appropriate overheads.
Cost is calculated using either the weighted average or the first-in-first-out method.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion anddisposal.
i Impairment The carrying value of the groups assets, with the exception of inventories and deferred tax assets, is reviewed on an ongoing basis for any indication of impairment and, if any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying value of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of any other asset, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine its recoverable amount.
The amount of the reversal is limited such that the assets carrying amount does not exceed that which would have been determined after depreciation and amortisation if no impairment loss had been recognised.
j Employee benets Retirement benefit costs Payments to dened contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to dened contribution schemes where the groups obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a dened contribution retirement benets scheme.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the present value of the dened benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to unrecognised past service cost plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
The expected finance income on assets and the finance cost on liabilities are recognised in the income statement as components of finance income and finance cost respectively.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur and presented outside the income statement in the statement of comprehensive income.
Share-based payments The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
The fair value of share-based payments is determined at the date of grant and expensed, with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
The amount expensed is adjusted over the vesting period for changes in the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest, save for changes resulting from any market-related performance conditions.
k Provisions Provisions are recognised when a present legal or constructive obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Where the time value of money is material, provisions are stated at the present value of the expected expenditure using an appropriate discountrate.
92 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Strategic review Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 3. significant accounting policies continued l Revenue recognition Revenue Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business and is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Revenue for manned security and cash solutions products and for recurring services in security systems products is recognised to reect the period in which the service is provided.
Revenue on security systems installations is recognised either on completion in respect of product sales, or in accordance with the stage of completion method in respect of construction contracts.
Construction contracts Where significant, security system installations with a contract duration in excess of one month are accounted for as construction contracts.
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
This is measured either by the proportion that contract costs incurred for work to date bears to the estimated total contract costs or by the proportion that sales value of work completed to date bears to the total sales value.
Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that it is likely that they will be agreed with the customer.
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred that are deemed likely to be recoverable.
Contract costs are recognised as expenses as they are incurred.
Where it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense.
Construction contracts are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost plus profit recognised to date, less provision for foreseeable losses and less progress billings.
m Pre-contract costs Pre-contract costs in respect of major outsourcing contracts incurred after the point at which the group achieves preferred bidder status, at which point it is considered probable that the contract will be obtained, are capitalised and expensed over the life of the contract subject to recoverability criteria.
Costs incurred prior to this point are expensed as incurred.
Capitalised costs are expensed immediately in the event that the bidder status is not followed by the award of the contract.
n Interest Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
This is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial assets net carrying amount.
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the income statement.
o profit from operations profit from operations is stated after the share of results of associates but before finance income and finance costs.
Exceptional items of particular signicance by quantum or nature, including major restructuring costs and other one off items, are included within profit from operations but are disclosed separately.
p Income taxes Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Thegroups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of each deferred tax asset is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is measured based on the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 93 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3. significant accounting policies continued q Leasing Leases are classied as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
Allother leases are classied as operating leases.
This classication can be a matter of ne judgement.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised at the inception of the lease at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the consolidated statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments made or received are apportioned between finance charges or income and the reduction of the lease liability or asset so as to produce aconstant rate of interest on the outstanding balance of the liability or asset.
Rentals payable or receivable under operating leases are charged or credited to income on a straight-line basis over the lease term, as are incentives to enter into operating leases.
r Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets and disposal groups classied as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classied as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
The group must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classication.
A discontinued operation is a component of the groups business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale, that has been disposed of, has been abandoned or meets the criteria to be classied as held for sale.
s Dividend distribution Dividends are recognised as distributions to equity holders in the period in which they are paid or approved by the shareholders in general meeting.
t Adoption of new and revised accounting standards and interpretations A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations became effective for the year ended 31 December 2012, but none of these had a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the group.
The group has not adopted early any standard, amendment or interpretation.
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been announced but are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2012.
One of these amendments is to IAS19 Employee Benets.
The amendment makes changes to recognition, measurement and disclosure of dened benefit expense, in particular requiring that the return on investment assets recognised in the income statement be calculated at the same interest rate as that used for calculating the finance cost on the obligations, and to the disclosures of employee benets.
None of the new standards is expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the group.

Accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the groups accounting policies, which are described in note 3, with respect to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
These judgements, estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, including current and expected economic conditions, and in some cases, actuarial techniques.
Although these judgements, estimates and associated assumptions are based on managements best knowledge of current events and circumstances, the actual results may differ.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The judgements, estimates and assumptions which are of most signicance to the group are detailed below: Valuation of acquired businesses The initial accounting for an acquisition involves identifying and determining the fair values to be assigned to identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities as well as the acquisition cost.
In some instances, this initial accounting can only be determined provisionally by the end of the period in which the acquisition is effected because the fair values and or the cost is not known with full certainty.
In such an event, the initial accounting can be completed using provisional values with any adjustments to those provisional values being completed within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Additionally, in determining the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets, in the absence of market prices for similar assets, valuation techniques are applied.
These techniques use a variety of estimates including projected future results and expected future cash ows, discounted using the weighted average cost of capital relevant to the acquisition.
Furthermore, management make an assessment of the useful economic life of acquired intangible assets upon recognition.
Full details of the fair values of assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are presented in note 17.
Assessment of the recoverable amounts in respect of assets tested for impairment The group tests tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that amounts may be impaired.
The impairment analysis for such assets is based principally upon discounted estimated future cash ows from the use and eventual disposal of the assets.
Such an analysis includes estimation of future results, cash ows, any annual growth rates and judgement as to the appropriate discount rates.
The full methodology and results of the groups impairment testing is presented in note 19.
Valuation of retirement benefit obligations The valuation of dened retirement benefit schemes is arrived at using the advice of qualied independent actuaries who use the projected unit credit method for determining the groups obligations.
This methodology requires the use of a variety of assumptions and estimates, including the appropriate discount rate, the expected return on scheme assets, mortality assumptions, future service and earnings increases of employees and ination.
Full details of the groups retirement benefit obligations, including an analysis of the sensitivity of the calculations to the key assumptions are presented in note 34.
Revenue An analysis of the groups revenue, as dened by IAS18, is as follows: 2012 2011 Notes m m Continuing operations Sale of goods 154 218 Rendering of services 7,126 6,524 Revenue from construction contracts 221 224 Revenue from continuing operations as presented in the consolidated income statement 6 7,501 6,966 Discontinued operations Sale of goods 1 3 Rendering of services 535 676 Revenue from construction contracts 2 3 Revenue from discontinued operations 6, 7 538 682 Other operating income Interest income 12 18 Expected return on dened retirement benefit scheme assets 82 93 Total other operating income 94 111 Total revenue as dened by IAS18 8,133 7,759 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 95 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 6.
Operating segments The group operates in two core product areas: secure solutions and cash solutions which represent the groups reportable segments.
For each of the reportable segments, the groups CEO the chief operating decision maker reviews internal management reports on a regular basis.
The group operates on a worldwide basis and derives a substantial proportion of its revenue, PBITA and PBIT from each of the following geographical regions: Europe comprising the United Kingdom and Ireland, and Continental Europe, North America, and Developing markets comprising the Middle East and Gulf States, Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia Pacic.

Discontinued operations Operations qualifying as discontinued in 2012 comprise the cash and secure solutions businesses in Pakistan, which were disposed of in October 2012, the electronic monitoring justice business in North America, which was disposed of in April 2012, and the US government solutions business.
Following a strategic review, the group decided to divest its US government solutions business to a parent able to add or create more value than it is able to, being a foreign parent with limited control over the business strategy and restricted access to the data required to run the business successfully.
The sale is expected to complete during 2013.
Operations qualifying as discontinued in 2011 comprised the cash and secure solutions businesses in Poland, which were disposed of in September 2012: the cash solutions business in Sweden, which was disposed of in February 2012 and the secure solutions business in Russia.
The UK Risk Assessment business in Afghanistan was classied as held for sale in December 2011, however, upon the extension of a major contract, it has been reclassied as continuing as at 31 December 2012.

During 2012 the group undertook a detailed review of the overhead structure across all reporting levels and geographies in order to maximise efficiency and eliminate duplication.
Restructuring generated a headcount reduction of over 1,500 positions.
In February 2013, the group announced that it had agreed a financial settlement with the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in respect of the provision of the security workforce for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.
The terms of the settlement meant that the group incurred an overall loss on the contract of approximately 70m recorded in cost of sales, plus additional costs mainly relating to charitable donations and external fees of 11m, and further sponsorship and marketing costs of 7m, both of which are included within .
As explained in the financial review on page 43, the 45 million of restructuring costs and the Olympics contract which made an 88 million loss have both been treated as exceptional items and disclosed separately on the face of the income statement on the basis of their quantum and one off nature.
The group considers the entire Olympics contract, including all directly attributable costs, to be exceptional as the scale and complexity of the contract means it can be distinguished from the groups underlying operations.
For 2011 the revenue and PBITA relating to the Olympics contract is not sufficiently material to require separate disclosure.
Included within administration expenses in the prior year is 83m of amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets and a 13m goodwill impairment charge relating to the groups businesses in Greece, 2m of acquisition-related expenses and 55m of aborted acquisition and legal costs.
The aborted acquisition costs include debt finance underwriting fees, nancing and hedging costs that arose on the proposed acquisition of ISS A S which was terminated on 1 November 2011.

Acquisitions Current year acquisitions The group undertook a number of business combinations in the current period.
The principal acquisition in subsidiary undertakings was the purchase of a 100% interest in Vanguarda Segurana e Vigilncia Ltda Vanguarda, a security personnel, security systems and monitoring services provider in Brazil.
A summary of the provisional fair value of net assets acquired by geographical location is presented below: Developing Total Europe markets group m m m Provisional fair value of net assets acquired of subsidiary undertakings 10 7 17 Goodwill 175 76 Total purchase consideration 11 82 93 The following table sets out the provisional fair value to the group in respect of all acquisitions made in the year: Fair value m Intangible assets 31 Property, plant and equipment 1 Trade and other receivables 7 Cash and cash equivalents 17 Trade and other payables 22 Provisions 7 Borrowings 1 Deferred tax liabilities 9 Net assets acquired of subsidiary undertakings 17 Goodwill 76 Total purchase consideration paid in cash 93 Within trade and other receivables are gross contractual amounts receivable of 8m with 1m of the contractual cash ows from these receivables not expected to be collected.
Adjustments made to identiable assets and liabilities on acquisition are to reect their fair value.
These include the recognition of customer-related intangible assets amounting to 31m.
The fair values of net assets acquired are provisional and represent estimates following a preliminary valuation exercise.
These estimates may be adjusted to reect any development in the issues to which they relate.
The goodwill arising on acquisitions can be ascribed to the existence of a skilled, active workforce, developed expertise and processes, and the opportunities to obtain new contracts and develop the business.
None of these meet the criteria for recognition as intangible assets separable from goodwill.
No goodwill acquired in the year is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
From their respective dates of acquisition, the acquired businesses contributed 39m to revenues, 4m to PBITA and 1m to profit for the part year they were under the groups ownership.
If all acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2012, group revenue would have been 7,537m, PBITA would have been 518m and profit for the year would have been 72m.
Prior year acquisitions Principal acquisitions in subsidiary undertakings in the prior year included the purchase of a 100% interest in Interativa Service Ltda, a facilities management business in Brazil: Munt Centrale Holland B. V. a coin management service company based in the Netherlands, and The Cotswold Group Limited, the UKs market leader in surveillance, fraud, analytics, intelligence and investigations services.
The group also acquired the offender monitoring technology operations of Guidance Limited and customer contracts from Chubb Group Security Limited and completed the buyout ofits Turkish business during the year, which was accounted for in equity.

Acquisitions continued Prior year acquisitions continued At 31 December 2011, the fair value adjustments made against net assets acquired were provisional.
The initial accounting in respect of acquisitions made during 2011 has since been nalised.
The net assets acquired and goodwill arising in respect of all acquisitions made in the year are as follows: Fair value m Intangible assets 71 Property, plant and equipment 7 Inventories 2 Trade and other receivables 17 Cash and cash equivalents 13 Trade and other payables 36 Current tax liabilities 1 Provisions 4 Borrowings 5 Deferred tax liabilities 21 Net assets acquired of subsidiary undertakings 43 Goodwill 94 Total purchase consideration 137 satisfied by: Cash 130 Contingent consideration 7 Total purchase consideration 137 Adjustments made to identiable assets and liabilities on acquisition are to reect their fair value.
These include the recognition of customer-related intangible assets amounting to 70m.
On completion of the fair value exercise during 2012, adjustments made to the provisional calculation of identiable assets and liabilities amountedto9m, with an equivalent increase in the reported value of goodwill.
The comparative consolidated statement of financial position at31December 2011 has been restated accordingly.
In the year of acquisition, in aggregate, the acquired businesses contributed 28m to revenues, 4m to PBITA and 2m to profit for the part year they were under the groups ownership.
If all acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2011, group revenue would have been 7,038m, PBITA would have been 509m and profit for the year would have been 200m.
Post balance sheet acquisitions No significant acquisitions have been effected between the balance sheet date and the date that the financial statements were authorised for issue.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash-generating units CGUs which are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The most significant component of goodwill was generated by the merger of the security services businesses of Group 4 Falck and Securicor in 2004 which was accounted for as an acquisition of Securicor by Group 4 Falck.
G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 107 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 19.
Intangible assets continued The group tests tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that amounts may be impaired.
The annual impairment test is performed prior to the year end when the budgeting process is nalised and reviewed post year end.
The groups impairment test compares the carrying value of each CGU to its recoverable amount.
CGUs are identied on a country level basis including significant business units, as per the groups detailed management accounts.
Under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, an impairment is deemed to have occurred where the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying value.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined by its value in use which is derived from discounted cash ow calculations.
These calculations include forecast pre-tax cash ows for a period of five years.
The five-year cash ow forecasts are based on the budget for the following year yearone and the business plans for years two and three, the results of which are reviewed by the board, and projections for years four and five, all of which reect past experience as well as future expected market trends.
Budgeted and forecast cash ows are based on managements assessment of current contract portfolio, contract wins, contract retention and price increases.
Cash ows beyond year three are projected up to year five at the lower of the planned growth rate in year three and the forecast underlying economic growth rate for the economies in which the CGU operates.
Where the planned growth rate in year three exceeds the forecast underlying economic growth rate, the excess is reduced progressively in the projections for years four and five.
The table below shows the year three growth rates for the groups significant CGUs.
Into-perpetuity growth rates are derived from the expected year five growth rates taking into account the estimated long-term growth prospects of the relevant economic market that the CGU operates in and generally range between 0% and 5%.
Future cash ows are discounted at a pre-tax, weighted average cost of capital which for the businesses based in the UK is 7.1% 2011: 6.1%.
This UK rate is used as a base for calculating the rates across the group by adjusting for the different financial risks in each country in which the CGUs operate.
Pre-tax cash ows are discounted using pre-tax discount rates derived from calculating the net present value of the post-tax cash ows discounted at post-tax rates.
Risk-adjusted discount rates applicable to group entities range from 5.4% in Hong Kong to 71.1% in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
The discount rates for the groups significant CGUs are disclosed in the table below.
Within the UK, the most significant CGUs and their goodwill carrying values are UK Care and Justice 247m, UK Cash Solutions 205m and UKSecure Solutions 102m.
Within the US, the most significant CGU is US Commercial Security Solutions with goodwill of 283m.
The key assumptions used in the discounted cash ow calculations relate to the discount rates used.
The underlying economic growth rates do not have a material effect on the calculations of the discounted cash ow.
With all other variables being equal, a 1% increase applied to all group CGUs e. g. increasing the base UK discount rate from 7.1% to 8.1% would result in a goodwill impairment to the group of approximately 10m.
A significant increase of 3% applied to all group CGUs e. g. increasing the base UK discount rate from 7.1% to 10.1% would result in a group impairment of approximately 35m, ofwhich 20m relates to Brazil.
In applying the groups model in 2011, the group impaired the goodwill relating to its businesses in Greece by 13m.
The challenging economic circumstances in the country had resulted in a discount rate of 16% being applied to the relevant cash ows.
The remaining goodwill relating to Greece is 14m and given the ongoing economic and political uncertainty in the country there remains a risk of further impairment.
However, during the current year there has been no further deterioration in the countrys outlook and therefore no further impairment has been required.
No impairment has been identied and recognised in any of the groups other CGUs for the year ended 31 December 2012 or for the year ended 31 December 2011.
Management believe that there is currently no reasonably possible change in the underlying factors used in the impairment model for its CGUs, which would lead to a material impairment of goodwill.

Credit risk on trade receivables There is limited concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables, as the groups customers are both large in number and dispersed geographically in over 120 countries.
The groups largest customer is the UK Government which represents approximately 10% 2011: 5% of the total trade debtor balance as at 31 December 2012.
Group companies are required to follow the Group Finance Manual guidelines with respect to assessing the credit worthiness of potential customers.
These guidelines include processes such as obtaining approval for credit limits over a set amount, performing credit checks and assessments and obtaining additional security where required.
Credit terms vary across the group and can range from 0 to 90 days to reect the different risks within each country in which the group operates.
There is no group-wide rate of provision, and provision is made for debts that are past due according to local conditions and past default experience.
The movement in the allowance for doubtful debts is as follows: 2012 2011 m m At 1 January 67 73 Amounts written off during the year 28 13 Increase in allowance 7 7 At 31 December 46 67 The ageing of trade debtors, net of allowance for doubtful debt, is as follows: 2012 2011 m m Not yet due 881 846 130 days overdue 161 185 3060 days overdue 70 70 6090 days overdue 29 37 91180 days overdue 26 30 181365 days overdue 7 30 Over 365 days overdue 14 21 Net trade debtors 1,188 1,219 No provision has been made on the above amounts as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the group believes that the amounts are still recoverable.
The group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The proportion of trade debtors at 31 December 2012 that were overdue for payment was 31% 2011: 34%.
The group-wide average age of all trade debtors at year end was 60 days 2011: 59 days.
The groups monthly management accounts use the last three months sales of the year to calculate management trade debtor days.
Using this calculation the group-wide average age of trade debtors is 50 days 2011: 49 days at constant exchange rates.
The directors believe the fair value of trade and other receivables, being the present value of future cash ows, approximates to their book value.
Included within not yet due is 75m relating to the Olympics contract settlement.

Financial risk Capital management The group manages its capital structure through an appropriate mix of debt and equity that supports the development of the group through organic and acquisition growth, maximises shareholder returns and minimises the cost of capital whilst maintaining an investment grade credit rating so that it can benefit from good access to debt capital markets on attractive terms.
The group has had an investment grade credit rating since March 2009 when Standard & Poors assessed the group BBB stable.
Subsequent to the Olympics contract announcement on 13 July 2012 and the board review in September, Standard & Poors revised the rating to BBB stable in November.
The group will continue to manage its capital structure so that it retains its investment grade.
The groups policy is to maintain a net debt to EBITDA ratio of around 2 to 2.5 times.
At the end of 2012 the ratio was 2.66 times.
It is expected that the ratio will fall back into the target range next year.
The group is currently well nanced has a diverse range of finance providers and the maturity prole is long term.
Borrowings are principally in pounds sterling, US dollars and euros reecting the geographies of significant operational assets andprots.

Market risk Currency risk and forward foreign exchange contracts The group conducts business in many currencies.
Transaction risk is limited since, wherever possible, each business operates and conducts its nancing activities in local currency.
However, the group presents its consolidated financial statements in sterling and it is in consequence subject to foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the results and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The group hedges a substantial proportion of its exposure to uctuations in the translation into sterling of its overseas net assets by holding loans in foreign currencies.
Translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency loans are recognised in equity to match translation adjustments on foreign currency equity investments as they qualify as net investment hedges.
At 31 December 2012, the groups US dollar and euro net assets were approximately 85% and 60% respectively hedged by foreign currency loans 2011: US dollar 75%, euro 50%.
Cross-currency swaps with a nominal value of 134m were arranged to hedge the foreign currency risk on US$265m of the second US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008, effectively xing the sterling value of this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.9750.
Cross currency swaps with a nominal value of 266m were arranged to hedge the foreign currency risk on euro 325m of the euro public notes issued in May 2012, effectively xing the sterling value of this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.2217.
Cross currency swaps with a nominal value of 284m were arranged to hedge the foreign currency risk on euro 350m of the euro public notes issued in December 2012, effectively xing the sterling value of this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.2332.
Assuming a 1% appreciation of sterling against the US dollar and the euro, the fair value net gain on the cross currency swaps which hedge part ofthe currency loan notes would be expected to fall by 7m.

Financial risk continued Market risk continued Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps Borrowing at oating rates as described in note 29 exposes the group to cash ow interest rate risk, which the group manages within policy limits approved by the directors.
Interest rate swaps and, to a limited extent, forward rate agreements are utilised to x the interest rate on a proportion of borrowings on a reducing scale over forward periods up to a maximum of five years.
At 31 December 2012 the nominal value of such contracts was 98m in respect of US dollar 2011: 174m and 73m in respect of euro 2011: 121m, their weighted average interest rate was 1.3% US dollar 2011: 2.7% and 3.2% euro 2011: 3.6%, and their weighted average period to maturity was three years.
All the interest rate hedging instruments are designated and fully effective as cash ow hedges and movements in their fair value have been deferred in equity.
The US Private Placement market is predominantly a xed rate market, with investors looking for a xed rate return over the life of the loan notes.
At the time of the first issue in March 2007, the group was comfortable with the proportion of oating rate exposure not hedged by interest rate swaps and therefore rather than take on a higher proportion of xed rate debt arranged xed to oating swaps effectively converting the xed coupon on the Private Placement to a oating rate.
Following the swaps the resulting average coupon on the US Private Placement is Libor 60bps.
These swaps have been documented as fair value hedges of the US Private Placement xed interest loan notes, with the movements in their fair value posted to profit and loss at the same time as the movement in the fair value of the hedged item.
The interest on the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008, the GBP public notes issued in May 2009, 510m of the euro public notes issued in May 2012 and 380m of the euro public notes issued in December 2012 was kept at xed rate.
All three public notes have a coupon step up of 1.25% which is triggered should the credit rating of G4S plc fall below investment grade.
The core group borrowings are held in US dollar, euro and sterling.
Although the impact of rising interest rates is largely shielded by xed rate loans and interest rate swaps which x a portion of the exposure, some interest rate risk remains.
A 1% increase in interest rates across the yield curve in each of these currencies with the 31 December 2012 debt position constant throughout 2013, would lead to an expectation of an additional interest charge of 9m in the 2013 financial year.
Commodity risk and commodity swaps The groups principal commodity risk relates to the uctuating level of diesel prices, particularly affecting its cash solutions businesses.
Commodity swaps and commodity options are used to x synthetically part of the exposure and reduce the associated cost volatility.
Commodity swaps hedging 39 million litres of projected 2013 diesel consumption, 36 million litres of projected 2014 diesel consumption and 21 million litres of projected 2015 diesel consumption were in place at 31 December 2012.
Counterparty credit risk The groups strategy for credit risk management is to set minimum credit ratings for counterparties and monitor these on a regular basis.
For treasury-related transactions, the policy limits the aggregate credit risk assigned to a counterparty.
The utilisation of a credit limit is calculated by applying a weighting to the notional value of each transaction outstanding with each counterparty based on the type and duration of the transaction.
The total mark to market value outstanding with each counterparty is also closely monitored against policy limits assigned to each counterparty.
For short-term transactions under one year, at inception of the transaction, the financial counterparty must be investment grade rated by either the Standard & Poors or Moodys rating agencies.
For long-term transactions, at inception of the transaction, the financial counterparty must have aminimum rating of BBB Baa1 from Standard & Poors or Moodys.
Treasury transactions are dealt with the groups relationship banks, all of which have a strong investment grade rating.
At 31 December 2012 the largest two counterparty exposures related to treasury transactions were 38m and 31m and both were held with institutions with a long-term Standard & Poors credit rating of A and A respectively.
These exposures represent 36% and 29% of the carrying values of derivative financial instruments, with a fair value gain at the balance sheet date.
Both of these banks had significant loans commitments outstanding to G4S plc at 31December 2012.
The group operates a multi-currency notional pooling cash management system with a wholly-owned subsidiary of an A rated bank.
At year end credit balances of 360m were pooled with debit balances of 362.7m, resulting in a net pool balance of negative 2.7m.
There is legal right of set off under the pooling agreement and an overdraft facility of 3m.
At an operating level the minimum investment grade rating criteria applies.
Exceptionally, where required by local country circumstances, counterparties with no, or a non-investment grade, rating can be approved as counterparties for a period of up to 12 months.
Due to the groups global geographical footprint and exposure to multiple industries, there is minimal concentration risk.
Retirement benefit obligations The group operates a wide range of retirement benefit arrangements which are established in accordance with local conditions and practices within the countries concerned.
These include funded dened contribution and funded and unfunded dened benefit schemes.
Dened contribution arrangements The majority of the retirement benefit arrangements operated by the group are of a dened contribution structure, where the employer contribution and resulting income statement charge is xed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees pay.
Contributions made to dened contribution schemes and charged to the income statement totalled 107m 2011: 107m.
In the UK, following the closure of the dened benefit schemes to new entrants in 2004, the main scheme for new employees is a contracted-in dened contribution scheme.
G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 119 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 34.
Retirement benefit obligations continued Dened contribution arrangements continued G4S Government Solutions, Inc. is the administrator of several dened benefit schemes.
G4S Government Solutions, Inc. is responsible for making periodic cost-reimbursable deposits to the various dened benefit schemes as determined by independent actuaries.
In each instance, the US Department of Energy DOE acknowledged within the contract entered between the DOE and G4S Government Solutions, Inc. its responsibility for all unfunded pension and benefit liabilities.
Therefore, these schemes are accounted for as dened contribution schemes.
In the Netherlands, most employees are members of industry-wide dened benefit schemes which are not valued on an IAS 19 basis as it is not possible to identify separately the groups share of the schemes assets and liabilities.
As a result the schemes are accounted for as dened contribution schemes.
Contributions made to the schemes and charged to the income statement in 2012 totalled 8m 2011: 8m.
The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid to the schemes during the financial year commencing 1 January 2013 in respect of the ongoing accrual of benets is approximately 8m assuming consistent exchange rates.
Dened benefit arrangements The group operates a number of dened benefit retirement arrangements where the benets are based on employees length of service.
In most cases these are calculated on the basis of final pensionable pay, other than for the smallest of the three sections in the UK and one scheme in the Netherlands where they are based on career average pay.
Liabilities under these arrangements are stated at the discounted value of benets accrued to date, based upon actuarial advice.
Under unfunded arrangements, the group does not hold the related assets separate from the group.
The amount charged to the income statement in respect of these arrangements in 2012 totalled 4m 2011: 3m.
Under funded arrangements, the assets of dened benefit schemes are held inseparate trustee-administered funds.
The pension costs are assessed on the advice of qualied independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The group operates several funded dened retirement benefit schemes.
Whilst the groups primary scheme is in the UK, it also operates other material schemes, primarily in the Netherlands and Canada.
For dened benefit schemes, the cost of providing benets is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being updated to each balance sheet date.
The discount rate used is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the groups obligations.
The carrying values of retirement benefit obligations at the balance sheet date are presented below: 2012 2011 m m UK 412 285 Rest of World 24 10 Net liability on material funded dened retirement benefit schemes 436 295 Unfunded and other funded dened retirement benefit obligations 35 49 471 344 The dened benefit scheme in the UK accounts for 95% of the net balance sheet liability on material funded dened retirement benefit schemes.
It comprises three sections: the pension scheme demerged from the former Group 4 Falck A S with total membership of approximately 8,000: the Securicor scheme, responsibility for which the group assumed on 20 July 2004 with the acquisition of Securicor plc, with total membership ofapproximately 20,000: and the GSL scheme, responsibility for which the group assumed on 12 May 2008 with the acquisition of GSL, with total membership of approximately 2,000.
The UK scheme was formally actuarially assessed at 5 April 2009.
Pension obligations stated in the statement ofnancial position take account of future earnings increases, have been updated to 31 December 2012 and use the valuation methodologies specified in IAS 19 Employee Benets.
During the prior year the group closed the UK scheme to future accrual.
Existing members retained their link to final salary where appropriate and their benets accrued to-date.
Members have been offered the opportunity to move to a new dened contribution scheme for future pension benets.
There has been no curtailment gain or loss.
As at the latest actuarial valuation, the participants of the UK pension scheme sections can be analysed as follows: Group 4 Falck GSL Securicor At 5 April 2009 Scheme Scheme Scheme Total Active participants Number 618 1,311 1,409 3,338 Average age 53.2 50.8 51.9 51.7 Deferred participants Number 4,559 537 10,352 15,448 Average age 51.3 48.4 50.8 50.9 Pensioner participants Number 2,607 208 7,878 10,693 Average age 68.2 61.1 69.9 69.3 120 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Strategic review Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 34.

None of the pension scheme assets are held in the entitys own financial instruments or in any assets held or used by the entity.
For the UK, the expected return on assets is based on the return targeted under the investment strategy.
For the rest of the world, the expected rates of return on individual categories of scheme assets are determined with respect to bonds by reference to relevant indices, and with respect to other assets by reference to relevant indices of the historical return and economic forecasts of future returns relative to ination in respect of assets of a similar nature.
The overall expected rate of return is the weighted average of the rates on the individual asset categories.
The history of experience adjustments is as follows: 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 Experience adjustments on scheme liabilities Amount m 2 16 31 8 1 Percentage of scheme liabilities % 1 2 Experience adjustments on scheme assets Amount m 9 63 3 141 332 Percentage of scheme assets % 1 4 11 30 The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid to the schemes during the financial year commencing 1 January 2013 in respect oftheongoing accrual of benets should be approximately 10m and it is anticipated that these will remain at a similar level in the medium term subject to changes in financial conditions.
Additional contributions of approximately 38m will also be made in 2013 in respect of the deficit in theschemes.
IAS 19 species that pension liabilities should be discounted at appropriate high quality corporate bond rates.
The directors consider that itisappropriate to apply the average of the yields on those AA corporate bonds which most closely approximate to the timescale of theliability prole of the schemes and have therefore used such a rate, being 4.5%, in respect of the UK schemes at 31 December 2012 4.95%at31December 2011.
The effect of a 0.1% movement in the discount rate applicable in the UK is to alter reported liabilities beforeassociated deferred tax by approximately 32m.
Liability calculations are also impacted heavily by the mortality projections included in the actuarial assumptions.
The weighted average life expectancy of a male member of the UK schemes currently aged 65 has been assumed as 21 years.
The weighted average life expectancy at65of a male currently aged 52 has been assumed as 22 years.
The directors consider, on actuarial advice, these assumptions to be appropriate totheprole of the membership of the schemes.
The effect of a one-year change in this UK life expectancy assumption is to alter reported liabilities beforeassociated deferred tax by approximately 88m.
Pension obligations in respect of deferred members increase in line with ination.
Increases in salaries and increases in pensions-in-payment generally move in line with ination.
Ination is therefore an important assumption in the calculation of dened retirement benefit liabilities.
Theeffect of a 0.1% movement in the rate of ination assumption applicable in the UK is to alter reported liabilities before associated deferred tax byapproximately 15m.

The groups net obligation in respect of long-term service benets other than retirement benets represents the present value of the future benefit that employees have earned at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of scheme assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
Restructuring Restructuring provisions include amounts for redundancy payments, and the costs of closure of activities in acquired businesses and discontinued operations.
Settlement of restructuring provisions is highly probable.
The timing is uncertain but is generally likely to be short term.
Claims reserves The claims reserves are held by the wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries in Guernsey and the US which underwrite part of the groups cash solutions, general liability, workers compensation and auto liability policies.
The provisions are subject to regular actuarial review and are adjusted asappropriate.
Settlement of these provisions is highly probable but both the value of the final settlements and their timing is uncertain, dependent upon the outcome of ongoing processes to determine both liability and quantum in respect of a wide range of claims or possible claims.
Onerous contracts The onerous contract provision mainly comprises the provision against future liabilities for loss-making contracts, for all properties sublet atashortfall, for the cost of replacing assets where there is a present contractual requirement and for long-term idle, leased properties.
Theprovisionis based on the value of future net cash outows.
Whilst the likelihood of settlement of these obligations is considered probable, thereis uncertainty over their value and duration.

Nodeferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 379m 2011: 385m of gross losses due to the unpredictability of futureprot streams in the relevant jurisdictions and the fact that a significant proportion of such losses remains unaudited by the relevant tax authorities.
