This is particularly so where funding is raised by conduct of their operations.
In the circumstances and in order to, inter alia, ensure that the company and its subsidiaries and other related and interrelated companies and juristic persons continue to have access to financing for purposes of refinancing existing facilities and funding their corporate and working capital requirements, it is necessary to obtain the approval of the shareholders as set out in this special resolution.

Furthermore, it may be necessary for the company to provide financial assistance to any of its present or future subsidiaries, and or to any related or inter-related company or juristic person, and or to a member of a related or inter-related company or juristic person, to subscribe for options or securities of the company or another company related or inter-related to it.

388 Investec integrated annual report 2012 | Annual financial statements Special business: Investec plc To consider and if deemed fit, to pass, with or without modification, the following ordinary and special resolutions of Investec plc: 40.
Ordinary resolution: Directors authority to allot shares and other securities Resolved that: the authority conferred on the directors of Investec plc by paragraph 12.2 of Article 12 of Investec plcs Articles of Association be granted for the period ending on the date of the annual general meeting of Investec plc to be held in 2013 or, if earlier, 15 fifteen months after the passing of this ordinary resolution and for such period the section 551 Amount shall be the aggregate of: i 39 889 in respect of Investec plc ordinary shares of 0.0002 each ordinary shares ii 34 796 in respect of Investec plc special converting shares of 0.0002 each special converting shares iii 1 000 000 in respect of Investec plc non-redeemable, non-cumulative, non-participating preference shares of 0.01 each preference shares.

The issue of preference shares is non-dilutive to ordinary shareholders.
Preference shares may be issued with such rights or subject to such restrictions as the directors may determine.
This amount is higher than the one third of issued ordinary share capital limit normally adopted by UK companies at their annual general meetings only due to the inclusion of the special converting shares and preference shares as noted in Nos 2 and 3 above, neither of which are dilutive to ordinary shareholders.
While the authority to allot shares to the value shown is given in respect of all of the shares of Investec plc as required by the Companies Act 2006, the directors of Investec plc would ensure that the shares of each class listed in the above table allotted by them would not be in excess of the amount listed in the column entitled relative part of section 551 Amount for each such class of shares.

The authority will expire at the end of the next annual general meeting of Investec plc to be held in 2013 or, if earlier, 15 fifteen months after the passing of this special resolution No 6.

vi the equity securities which are the subject of the issue for cash must be of a class already in issue, or where this is not the case, must be limited to such securities or rights that are convertible into a class already in issue.

The directors of Investec plc consider it may, in certain circumstances, be in the best interests of shareholders generally for Investec plc to purchase its own ordinary shares.
Accordingly, the purpose and effect of special resolution No 7 is to grant a general authority, subject to the specified limits, to Investec plc to acquire ordinary shares of Investec plc.
As of 13 June 2012 the latest practicable date prior to publication of this notice, there were options outstanding over 45 790 444 forty five million seven hundred and ninety thousand four hundred and forty four ordinary shares, representing 7.7% seven point seven percent of Investec plcs issued ordinary share capital at that date.
If the authority to buy back shares under this special resolution No 7 was exercised in full, the total number of options to subscribe for ordinary shares would represent 8.5% eight point five percent of Investec plcs issued ordinary share capital.

If Investec plc were to purchase shares under the Companies Act 2006 they will be cancelled or, to the extent determined by the directors of Investec plc, held in treasury.
The authority will be exercised only if the directors of Investec plc believe that to do so would result in an increase of earnings per ordinary share and would be in the interests of shareholders generally or, in the case of the creation of treasury shares, that to do so would be in the best interests of shareholders generally.
In order for special resolution No 7 to be given effect, a 75% seventy five percent majority of the votes of all shareholders present or represented by proxy at the annual general meeting of Investec plc and Investec Limited must be cast in favour of special resolution No 7.
Special resolution No 8: Directors authority to purchase preference shares Resolved that: Investec plc be and is hereby unconditionally and generally authorised for the purpose of section 701 of the Companies Act 2006 to make market purchases as defined in section 693 of the Companies Act 2006 of preference shares in the capital of Investec plc provided that: i the maximum aggr egate number of preference shares which may be purchased is 1 735 709 one million seven hundred and thirty five thousand seven hundred and nine ii the minimum price which may be paid for each preference share is its nominal value of such share at the time of purchase iii the maximum price which may be paid for any preference share is an amount equal to 105% one hundred and five percent of the average of the middle market quotations of the preference shares of Investec plc as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the 5 five business days immediately preceding the day on which such share is contracted to be purchased iv this authority shall expire at the conclusion of the annual general meeting of Investec plc to be held in 2013, or if earlier, 15 fifteen months from the date on which this special resolution No 8 is passed except in relation to the purchase of preference shares, the contract for which was concluded before the expiry of such authority and which might be executed wholly or partly after such expiry unless such authority is renewed prior to that time.
The directors of Investec plc consider it may, in certain circumstances, be in the best interests of shareholders generally for Investec plc to purchase its own preference shares.
Accordingly, the purpose and effect of special resolution No 8 is to grant a general authority, subject to the specified limits, to Investec plc to acquire preference shares of Investec plc.
The Companies Act 2006 permits Investec plc to purchase its own preference shares to be held in treasury, with a view to possible resale at a future date.
The directors of Investec plc have no present intention of making any purchases, but believe that Investec plc should retain the flexibility to take further action if future purchases were considered desirable and in the best interest of shareholders.
If Investec plc were to purchase preference shares under the Companies Act 2006 they will be cancelled or, to the extent determined by the directors of Investec plc, held in treasury.

Ordinary resolution: Political donations Resolved that: in accordance with section 366 of the Companies Act 2006, Investec plc and any company which, at any time during the period for which this resolution has effect, is a subsidiary of Investec plc, be and are hereby authorised to: i make donations to political organisations not exceeding 25 000 twenty five thousand Pounds Sterling in total and ii incur political expenditure not exceeding 75 000 seventy five thousand Pounds Sterling in total.
In each case during the period commencing on the date of this resolution and ending on the date of the annual general meeting of Investec plc to be held in 2013, provided that the maximum amounts referred to in i and ii may consist of sums in any currency converted into Pounds Sterling at such rate as Investec plc may in its absolute discretion determine.
For the purposes of this resolution, the terms political donations, political organisations and political expenditure shall have the meanings given to them in sections 363 to 365 of the Companies Act 2006.
Investec integrated annual report 2012 | Annual financial statements 391 Notice of annual general meeting of Investec plc continued The reason for ordinary resolution No 44 is that the Companies Act 2006 requires companies to obtain shareholder approval before they can make donations to EU political organisations or incur EU political expenditure.
Investec plc does not give any money for political purposes in the UK nor does it make any donations to EU political organisations or incur EU political expenditure.
However, the definitions of political donations and political expenditure used in the Companies Act 2006 are very wide.
The authority is a precautionary measure to ensure that Investec plc does not inadvertently breach the relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The directors of Investec plc consider that the proposed resolutions in the notice of the annual general meeting are in the best interests of Investec plc and its shareholders and recommends that you vote in favour as the directors of Investec plc intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings.
