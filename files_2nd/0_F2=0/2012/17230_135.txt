102 Financial statements Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Notes to the Company financial statements continued 52 weeks ended 29 January 2012 41 Pensions a Defined benefit pension scheme The Company operates a pension scheme providing benefits defined on retirement based on age at date of retirement, years of service and a formula using either the employees compensation package or career average revalued earnings CARE.
The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out at 6 April 2010 and were updated for FRS 17 Retirement benefits purposes for the period to 29 January 2012 by a qualified independent actuary.
On 8 July 2010 the Government announced that the Consumer Price Index CPI rather than the Retail Price Index RPI will be used as the basis for inflationary increases to pensions in its next update of the statutory requirement.
Following this, the Accounting Standards Board has issued UITF 48 Accounting implications of the replacement of the retail prices index with the consumer prices index for retirement benefits clarifying the required accounting treatment and indicating the use of CPI rather than RPI where the scheme rules allow.
The Company has consulted with its advisers and based on review of certain clauses in the schemes trust deeds has concluded that this change is applicable to certain deferred members within the Companys defined benefit scheme.
The trust deeds state that, for those members affected, a statutory index should be used and therefore the actuarial assumptions applied within this financial report have been updated accordingly.
This resulted in a credit of 8m recognised in the STRGL within actuarial gains losses in the prior year.
The current best estimate of employer contributions to be paid for the year commencing 30 January 2012 is 18m 2011: 22m.
b Assumptions The major assumptions used in this valuation to determine the present value of the schemes defined benefit obligation are shown below.
i Financial 2012 2011 Rate of increases in salaries 4.55% 5.05% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.50% 3.30% 3.30% 3.80% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 4.75% 5.60% Inflation assumption 3.30% 3.80% ii Longevity The average life expectancy in years of a member who reaches normal retirement age of 65 and is currently aged 45 is as follows: 2012 2011 Male 24.4 24.2 Female 25.3 25.1 The average life expectancy in years of a member retiring at the age of 65 at balance sheet date is as follows: 2012 2011 Male 22.0 21.8 Female 23.0 22.8 Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on actuarial advice and in accordance with published statistics.
The longevity assumption considers how long a member will live when they reach the age of retirement.
Amongst the UK population there is a continuing trend for a generation to live longer than the preceding generation, and this has been reflected in the longevity assumption.
This means that a 45 year old today is assumed to live on average longer than a 65 year old today.
This particular adjustment, described in the mortality tables below, is known as long cohort and is in line with the latest advice from the Pension Regulator.
In calculating the present value of the liabilities the actuary selects the appropriate mortality table that reflects the longevity assumption.
The most up to date tables are used in each period.
The current mortality table used is S1PMA S1PFA-Heavy YOB 2011: S1PMA S1PFA-Heavy YOB.

c Valuations The fair value of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain, were as follows: 2012 2011 m m Equities 260 234 Bonds 178 172 Gilts 199 146 Cash 1 1 Total market value of assets 638 553 Present value of scheme liabilities 638 537 Surplus in the scheme pension asset 16 Related deferred tax liability 4 Net pension asset in the balance sheet 12 The movement in the fair value of the schemes assets over the year was as follows: 2012 2011 m m Fair value of scheme assets at start of period 553 490 Expected return on scheme assets 34 31 Actuarial gain 36 13 Employer contributions 18 22 Employee contributions 5 5 Benefits paid 8 8 Fair value of scheme assets at end of period 638 553 The above pension scheme assets do not include any investments in the Companys own shares or property occupied by any member of the Group.

Expected yields on fixed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields as at the balance sheet date.
Expected returns on equity and property investments reflect long term real rates of return experienced in the respective markets.
