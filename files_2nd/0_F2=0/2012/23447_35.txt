The rate used for these purposes was 9.9%.
19 Financial Instruments i Management of Risk As an investment trust, the Groups investment objective is to seek capital growth from a portfolio of securities drawn from markets both within the UK and worldwide.
The holding of these financial instruments to meet this objective results in certain risks.
The Groups financial instruments comprise: 1.
Securities in unquoted and quoted companies, partnership interests and liquidity funds.
A loan facility, issuance of Zero Dividend Preference shares and Convertible Bonds, the purpose of which is to finance tender offers, other share buy-backs and on-market purchases of shares, the financing of new investment and refinancing existing debt.
Interest rate Swap and Cap in order to manage the risk of interest rate fluctuation in interest payable on the new multi-currency loan facility.
The main risks arising from the Groups and Companys financial instruments are fluctuations in market price, interest rate, credit, liquidity, capital and foreign currency exchange rate risk.
The policies for managing each of these risks are summarised below.
These policies have remained constant throughout the year under review and the preceding year.
The financial risks of the Company are aligned to the Groups financial risks.
Market Price Risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Groups operations.
It represents the potential loss the Group might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements, mitigated by stock selection.
Electra Partners has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio in accordance with the Groups investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
42 Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2012 19 Financial Instruments continued The Group is exposed to the risk of the change in value of its fund investments, listed and unlisted equity and non-equity shares and fixed income securities.
For funds, listed investments and liquidity funds the market risk variable is deemed to be the price itself.
For unlisted equity and non-equity shares the market risk is deemed to be the price earnings ratio.
The impact on profit or loss after tax and on shareholders equity, in absolute and percentage terms of those figures, due to movements in these variables, is set out in part ii of this Note.
Credit Risk The Groups exposure to credit risk principally arises from its investment in liquidity funds and its cash deposits.
Only major banks are used when making cash deposits and the level of cash is reviewed on a regular basis.
A well diversified portfolio of liquidity funds is maintained with no more than 10% of gross assets held with any one institution.
The total invested in liquidity funds was 298,800,000 with associated accrued income of 169,000 2011: 230,136,000 with associated accrued income of 136,000.
Cash held was principally with two UK banks, with a credit rating of Aand totalled 78,387,000 2011: 39,434,000.
Interest Rate Risk The Group finances its operations through retained profits including both realised and unrealised capital profits.
In addition, financing is obtained through loan facilities.
During the year, a long-term multi-currency loan facility was in existence.
The loan has a floating rate of interest.
Interest rate swap and cap derivatives used to manage the risk of interest rate fluctuation in interest payable on the multi-currency facility were renegotiated during the year.
The cash balances held on deposit mitigate in part the interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk profiles for financial assets and liabilities and the impact of the profit or loss after tax and on shareholders equity of a 1.0% increase or decrease in interest rates, in absolute terms and as a percentage of those figures, are shown in part iv of this Note.
These profiles exclude short term receivables and payables.
Liquidity Risk The Groups assets comprise listed and unlisted equity and non-equity shares, fixed income securities and liquidity funds whilst the unlisted equity is intentionally illiquid.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the revolving loan facility, and liquidity funds which are relatively liquid and cash which is available on demand.
The maturity of the Groups existing borrowings are set out in part v of this Note.
Capital Risk Management The Groups capital at 30 September 2012 comprises: 30 Sept 2012 30 Sept 2011 000 000 Debt Borrowing under the credit facility 153,629 153,629 163,707 Zero Dividend Preference shares 56,743 56,743 53,034 Convertible Bond 78,295 78,295 75,310 288,667 288,667 292,051 Equity Equity share capital 8,835 8,835 8,835 Retained earnings and other reserves 907,469 907,469 812,657 916,304 916,304 821,492 Total capital 1,204,971 1,204,971 1,113,543 Debt as a percentage of total capital 24.0% 24.0% 26.2% Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2012 43 Further information Governance Financial statements Business review Overview 19 Financial Instruments continued The Groups objective in the management of capital risk is to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure.
In doing so the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders whilst remaining within the restrictions imposed by its investment trust status, return capital to shareholders, change level of borrowing in the 195,000,000 committed multi-currency revolving credit facility or issue new shares.
During the year the Group paid no dividend 2011: nil.
In order to be able to pay a dividend out of profits available for distribution the Company has to be able to meet one of the two capital restriction tests imposed on investment companies by company law.
The Group manages the levels of cash deposits held whilst maintaining sufficient liquidity for investments.
The Group has an existing authority to implement an on-market share buy-back programme to generate shareholder value.
During the year nil 2011: nil was utilised to repurchase shares for cancellation.
The 195,000,000 committed multi-currency revolving credit facility was drawn down such that a balance of 153,629,000 was outstanding at the year end 2011: 185,000,000 facility of which 163,707,000 was drawn down.

On 29 December 2010, Electra issued 100 million 5% Subordinated Convertible Bonds due on 29 December 2017 Note 18.
The level of outstanding borrowings is reviewed on an on-going basis taking into account the need to buy back shares, future levels of investment and any foreign currency hedging concerns.
Foreign Currency Risk The Companys total return and net assets are affected by foreign exchange translation movements as a significant proportion of the investments held are denominated in currencies other than sterling.
The foreign investments held are principally held in the USA, Continental Europe and the Far East.
During the year, the Company held loans denominated in US Dollars and Euros, which partially offset foreign currency risk on foreign currency investments.
The ratio of loans held in US Dollar and Euro is under regular review in order to partially hedge as efficiently as possible.
Foreign currency exposures and the impact on profit after tax on shareholders equity of 10% increases and decreases in the value of US Dollar and Euros, in absolute terms and as a percentage of those figures, are analysed in part iii of this Note.

vii Fair Value Hierarchy Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged or a liability settled between knowledgeable willing parties in an arms length transaction.
Fair value measurements are based on observable and unobservable inputs.
Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Groups view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information.
The Group utilises techniques that maximise the use of observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs.
The levels of fair value measurement bases are defined as follows: Level 1: fair values measured using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: fair values measured using valuation techniques for all inputs significant to the measurement other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: fair values measured using valuation techniques for any input for the asset or liability significant to the measurement that is not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The following table represents the Groups assets by IFRS 7 hierarchy levels: Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 As at 30 September 2012 000 000 000 000 Unlisted and listed investments 867,687 104,830 867,687 104,830 762,857 762,857 Other investments 298,969 298,969 298,969 298,969 Interest rate swaps 2,010 2,010 2,010 2,010 1,164,646 1,164,646 403,799 403,799 760,847 760,847 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 As at 30 September 2011 000 000 000 000 Unlisted and listed investments 883,175 94,810 788,365 Other investments 230,136 230,136 Interest rate swaps 358 358 1,112,953 324,946 788,007 Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2012 47 Further information Governance Financial statements Business review Overview
