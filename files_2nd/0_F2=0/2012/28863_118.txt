The statement sets out the framework for reviewing individual complaints.
It also requires firms to undertake root cause analysis: proactive contact exercises are required for certain categories of customer if systemic issues are identified.
The principal assumptions underlying the Groups provision in respect of PPI sales are: assessment of the total number of complaints that the Group will receive: the proportion of these that will result in redress: and the average cost of such redress.
The number of complaints has been estimated from an analysis of the Groups portfolio of PPI policies sold by vintage and by product.
Estimates of the percentage of policyholders that will lodge complaints the take up rate and of the number of these that will be upheld the uphold rate have been established based on recent experience, guidance in the FSA policy statements and expected rate of responses from proactive customer contact.
The average redress assumption is based on recent experience and the calculation rules in the FSA statement.
The table below shows the sensitivity of the provision to changes in the principal assumptions all other assumptions remaining the same.
Sensitivity Change in Consequential assumption change in provision Assumption % m Take up rate -5 -300 Uphold rate -5 -35 Average redress -5 -35 Interest that will be payable on successful complaints has been included in the provision as has the estimated cost to the Group of administering the redress process.
The Group expects the majority of the cash outflows associated with this provision to have occurred by the end of 2013.
There are uncertainties as to the eventual cost of redress which will depend on actual complaint volumes, take up and uphold rates and average redress costs.

On 31 January 2013, the FSA announced the results of pilot studies by the Group and other UK banks.
The FSA announcement also clarified the tests to be applied to determine whether a customer qualifies as sophisticated and created a set of redress principles.
The Group has estimated 700 million for its liability based on the FSAs guidance, an analysis of its portfolio of interest rate hedging products and the results of the pilot exercise.
The provision includes redress that will be paid to customers, interest payable on customer redress: the cost to the Group of exiting the hedging positions: and the cost of undertaking the review.
The principal assumptions that underlie the estimate are: the number of transactions that meet the criteria for redress: the nature of the redress: in particular whether a product is terminated or replaced with an alternative product and or a different profile: and the cost of the review.
Sensitivity Change in Consequential assumption change in provision Assumption % m Number of customer transactions qualifying for redress i -5 -29 Proportion of customer transactions qualifying for full redress i -5 -42 i Customers qualifying for an alternative product reduced increased pro rata.
As the redress and review exercise progresses it is likely that the level of the provision will change.
There remain significant uncertainties over the number of transactions that will qualify for redress and the nature and cost of that redress.
3 The Group has provided for customer redress in relation to certain other retail products.
None of these provisions is individually material.
4 On 6 February 2013, the Group reached agreement with the FSA, the US Department of Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in relation to the setting of LIBOR and other trading rates, including financial penalties of 381 million.
The Group continues to cooperate with other governmental and regulatory authorities and the probable outcome of these investigations is that the Group will incur additional financial penalties.
However, at this early stage, the Group is unable reliably to estimate their quantum.
5 The Group is subject to a number of investigations by regulatory and other authorities.
Details of these investigations and a discussion of the nature of the associated uncertainties are given in Note 32.
6 Arising out of its normal business operations, the Group is party to legal proceedings in the United Kingdom, the United States and other jurisdictions.
Litigation provisions at 31 December 2012 related to numerous proceedings: no individual provision is material.
Detailed descriptions of the Groups legal proceedings and discussion of the associated uncertainties are given in Note 32.
7 In June 2012, the Group experienced a technology incident that affected its transaction batch processing.
Provisions of 175 million were charged during 2012 to meet the waiver of fees and interest: redress for customers of the Group: and other costs principally staff costs.
These costs have been substantially settled and there is minimal uncertainty as to the final cost.
8 The property provisions principally comprise provisions for onerous lease contracts.
Provision is made for future rentals payable in respect of vacant leasehold property and for any shortfall where leased property is sub-let at a rental lower than the lease rentals payable by the Group.
