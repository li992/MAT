Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements 119 23.
Group pension schemes continued Projected components of pension expense for year to 31 December 2013 The significant volatility in investment markets means that it is difficult to project forward the IAS 19 figures for the next year with confidence.
The following projections should therefore be treated with caution.
Assumptions implicit in the following projections are: the return on assets from 31 December 2012 is 4.4 per cent per annum: contributions to the Scheme will continue throughout 2013 in accordance with the current schedule of contributions in place at the date of signing this report: and there will be no changes to the terms of the Scheme.
The amounts recognised in the components of pension expense are: 2013 $ million Current service cost 0.3 Interest cost 0.2 Expected return on Scheme assets Total 0.1 Unfunded pensions In Indonesia, the group operates a Service, Severance and Compensation pay scheme under a Collective Labour Agreement with the local workforce.
This is an unfunded post-employment defined benefit scheme in nature.
In addition, the group is paying an unfunded pension to a former director in the UK in regard to which annual increases and a reversionary spouses pension apply on the same basis as to pensions paid under the Scheme.
On the same actuarial basis as used to assess the Schemes pension costs, the present value as at 31 December 2012 of the future payments projected to be made in respect of UK unfunded pensions is US$0.9 million 2011: US$0.9 million.
Defined contribution benefit scheme The group operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
The only obligation of the group with respect to the retirement benefit scheme is to make specified contributions.
Payments to the defined contribution scheme are charged as an expense as they fall due.
