The equity component and liability portion of the new bonds has been calculated based on the last day market price of the old bonds and effective yield of a similar maturity corporate bond.
US$8.6 million difference between equity component of the old bonds and the new bonds have been assigned to the equity reserves and a US$1.9 million residual difference has been charged to income statement.
Issue costs were apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds based on their relative carrying amounts at the date of issue.
The portion relating to the equity component was charged directly against equity.

The non-cash accrual of interest will increase the liability component as the cash interest is only paid at 2.5 per cent to US$245.3 million at maturity.
There is no material difference between the carrying amount of the liability component of the convertible bonds and its fair value.
This fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at the market rate.
