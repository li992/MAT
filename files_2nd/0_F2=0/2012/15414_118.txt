Included in borrowings are other items in a hedging relationship which are held at amortised cost with a fair value adjustment applied, as they are in a fair value hedge.
Fair value hierarchy Set out below is how the Groups financial instruments measured at fair value, fit within the following fair value hierarchy: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 : inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly level 2 : inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data level 3.
The following tables illustrate the Groups financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value at 31 March 2012 and 31 March 2011: 31 March 2012 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Notes m m m m Assets at fair value Available-for-sale financial assets 18 23 23 Derivative financial instruments: currency swaps 20 16 16 interest rate swaps 20 61 61 forward foreign exchange contracts 20 2 2 commodity pricing contracts 20 23 13 22 58 Assets at fair value 23 92 45 160 Liabilities at fair value Derivative financial instruments: currency swaps 20 40 40 interest rate swaps 20 13 13 forward foreign exchange contracts 20 1 1 commodity pricing contracts 20 34 3 22 59 Borrowings 28 397 397 Liabilities at fair value 34 454 22 510 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 88 Financial Statements 19 Financial instruments by category continued 31 March 2011 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Notes m m m m Assets at fair value Available-for-sale financial assets 18 19 19 Derivative financial instruments: currency swaps 20 16 16 interest rate swaps 20 40 40 forward foreign exchange contracts 20 10 10 commodity pricing contracts 20 53 50 14 117 Assets at fair value 53 116 33 202 Liabilities at fair value Derivative financial instruments: currency swaps 20 46 46 interest rate swaps 20 14 14 forward foreign exchange contracts 20 10 10 commodity pricing contracts 20 21 77 14 112 Borrowings 28 378 378 Liabilities at fair value 21 525 14 560 Level 1 financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets commodity futures is based on quoted market prices at the statement of financial position date.
A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
Level 2 financial instruments The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, commodity pricing contracts and forward foreign exchange contracts are determined by using valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
The fair value of interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts is calculated as the present value of the future cash flows based on observable inputs drawn from interest yield curves sourced from a reputable third party source.
The amount shown within level 2 for borrowings only includes those borrowings which are designated as hedged items in fair value hedges with respect to interest rate risk and whose carrying amount is adjusted for the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
Level 3 financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments is based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity at the statement of financial position date.
These inputs generally reflect the entitys own assumptions about how a market participant would reasonably be expected to determine the price of a financial instrument.
For commodity pricing contracts, in evaluating the significance of fair value inputs, the Group generally classifies assets or liabilities as level 3 when their fair value is determined using unobservable inputs that individually, or when aggregated with other unobservable inputs represent more than 10% of the fair value of the observable inputs of the assets or liabilities.
Available-for-sale financial assets which are analysed at level 3 primarily represent investments in unlisted securities.
The fair values of the unlisted securities are principally approximated at cost.
Values are adjusted for permanent impairments and fair value movements as disclosed in Note 18.
For financial instruments in level 3, the Group does not consider that changes to inputs to reasonable alternatives would have a material impact on the income statement or equity.
