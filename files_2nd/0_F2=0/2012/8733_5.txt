The Board considers that its composition during the year had the necessary balance of Executive and Non-Executive Directors providing the desired blend of skills, experience and judgement appropriate for the needs of the Groups business and overall effectiveness of the Board.
None of the Directors have served for more than three years without having been re-elected by shareholders.
Colin Archer is the senior independent NonExecutive Director.
All three Non-Executive Directors are considered to be independent by the Board.
Colin Archer has served on the Board for more than ten years, having been appointed on 6 November 2001.
Chris Bird was appointed to the Board on 1 May 2003 and so will have served for more than nine years as at the date of the Companys forthcoming AGM.
The Board considers both Mr Archer and Mr Bird to be independent for the purposes of the Code as, in the Boards view, they continue to be independent in character and judgment notwithstanding their length of service.
Andrew Leslie was appointed to the Board in May 2010 and is considered to be independent by the Board for the purposes of the Code.
Mr Leslie was formerly an executive director of Pentland, the Companys largest shareholder.
Mr Leslie does not represent the interests of Pentland on the Board and retired from Pentland in 2008.

Segmental analysis IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires the Groups segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is considered to be the Executive Chairman of JD Sports Fashion Plc.
Information reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker is focused on the nature of the businesses within the Group.
A new reportable segment has been created in the current year on acquisition of the Blacks business see note 11 which signalled an entry into the outdoor retail segment for the Group.
The Groups reportable segments under IFRS 8 are therefore as follows: Sport retail - includes the results of the sport retail trading companies JD Sports Fashion Plc, John David Sports Fashion Ireland Limited, Chausport SA, Champion Sports Holdings, JD Sprinter Holdings 2010 SL and Duffer of St George Limited Fashion retail - includes the results of the fashion retail trading companies Bank Fashion Limited, RD Scott Limited and Premium Fashion Limited Outdoor retail - includes the results of the outdoor retail trading company Blacks Outdoor Retail Limited Distribution businesses - includes the results of the distribution companies Topgrade Sportswear Limited, Nicholas Deakins Limited, Canterbury Limited including global subsidiary companies, Kooga Rugby Limited, Nanny State Limited, Focus Brands Limited and Kukri Sports Limited including global subsidiary companies The Chief Operating Decision Maker receives and reviews segmental operating profit.
Certain central administrative costs including Group Directors salaries are included within the Groups core Sport retail result.
This is consistent with the results as reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
IFRS 8 requires disclosure of information regarding revenue from major products and customers.
The majority of the Group's revenue is derived from the retail of a wide range of apparel, footwear and accessories to the general public.
As such, the disclosure of revenues from major customers is not appropriate.
Disclosure of revenue from major product groups is not provided at this time due to the cost involved to develop a reliable product split on a same category basis across all companies in the Group.
Intersegment transactions are undertaken in the ordinary course of business on arms length terms.
The Board consider that certain items are cross divisional in nature and cannot be allocated between the segments on a meaningful basis.
The share of results of joint venture is presented as unallocated in the following tables, as this entity had trading relationships with companies in all of the Group's segments.
An asset of nil 2011: 3,458,000 for the equity accounted investment in joint venture is included within the unallocated segment.
The exceptional credits pertaining to the dividend received from joint venture 2,691,000 and gain on disposal of joint venture 871,000 see note 17 are included within the unallocated segment.
Net funding costs and taxation are treated as unallocated reflecting the nature of the Groups syndicated borrowing facilities and its tax group.
A deferred tax liability of 1,012,000 2011: asset of 125,000 and an income tax liability of 8,861,000 2011: 12,370,000 are included within the unallocated segment.
Each segment is shown net of intercompany transactions and balances within that segment.
The eliminations remove intercompany transactions and balances between different segments which primarily relate to the net down of long term loans and short term working capital funding provided by JD Sports Fashion Plc within Sport retail to other companies in the Group, and intercompany trading between companies in different segments.

The gross contractual amount for trade receivables due is 917,000 of which 7,000 is expected to be uncollectable.
The Board believes that the excess of consideration paid over net identifiable assets is best considered as goodwill on acquisition, representing employee expertise and anticipated future operating synergies.
Included in the 52 week period to 28 January 2012 is revenue of 26,442,000 and a profit before tax of 1,280,000 in respect of Focus Brands Limited.

This takes the Groups holding to 80%.
The Groups original share of 51% was acquired on 7 November 2007.

As the Group has maintained control of Canterbury International Australia Pty Limited, the decrease in Group ownership has been accounted for as an equity transaction.
Kooga Rugby Limited performance has not progressed sufficiently to carry on justifying the carrying value of the goodwill and brand name and so, accordingly, the Board believes that the balance of 1,877,000 should be impaired.
The fair value of the Cecil Gee fascia name acquired as part of the acquisition on 18 June 2011 of the trade and assets of 8 stores trading as Cecil Gee from Moss Bros Group Plc was 838,000.

The Board consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximate their fair value.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the majority of the Groups customer base being wide and unrelated.
Therefore, no further credit risk provision is required in excess of the normal provision for impairment losses, which has been calculated following individual assessments of credit quality based on historic default rates and knowledge of debtor insolvency or other credit risk.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 23.
Financial instruments Financial assets The Groups financial assets are all categorised as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise Trade and other receivables and Cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise short-term cash deposits with major United Kingdom and European clearing banks earning floating rates of interest based upon bank base rates or rates linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR.
The currency profile of cash and cash equivalents is shown below: GROUP COMPANY 2012 2011 2012 2011 000 000 000 000 Bank balances and cash floats 67,024 90,131 28,762 81,204 Sterling 31,846 74,031 21,706 69,831 Euros 29,117 7,126 4,701 4,881 US Dollars 3,591 6,984 2,265 6,492 Australian Dollars 1,075 1,040 90 - New Zealand Dollars 1,262 930 - - Other 133 20 - - 67,024 90,131 28,762 81,204 Included in trade and other receivables are the following foreign currency denominated receivables: GROUP COMPANY 2012 2011 2012 2011 000 000 000 000 Euros 6,574 1,350 4 240 US Dollars 816 802 - 12 Australian Dollars 2,564 1,845 - - New Zealand Dollars 1,726 1,179 - - Other 966 387 - - Financial liabilities The Groups financial liabilities are all categorised as other financial liabilities.

Financial instruments continued Risk management The Groups operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk and its liquidity position.
The Group manages these risks through the use of derivative instruments, which are reviewed on a regular basis.
Derivative instruments are not entered into for speculative purposes.
There are no concentrations of risk in the period to 28 January 2012.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations by a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
The Groups borrowings are at floating rates, partially hedged by floating rate interest on deposits, reflecting the seasonality of its cash flow.
Interest rate risk therefore arises from bank borrowings.
Interest rate hedging has not been put in place on the current facility.
The Directors continue to be mindful of the potential volatility in base rates, but at present do not consider a long term interest rate hedge to be necessary given the inherent short term nature of both the revolving credit facility and working capital facility.
This position is reviewed regularly, along with the level of facility required.
The Group has potential bank floating rate financial liabilities on the 75,000,000 committed bank facility, together with overdraft facilities in subsidiary companies see note 22.
At 28 January 2012 nil was drawdown from the committed bank facility 2011: nil.
When drawdowns are made, the Group is exposed to cash flow interest risk with interest paid at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.25% 2011 previous facility : 0.75%.
As at 28 January 2012 the Group has liabilities of 660,000 2011: nil, in respect of finance lease or similar hire purchase contracts.
A change of 1.0% in the average interest rates during the year, applied to the Group's floating interest rate loans and borrowings as at the reporting date, would change profit before tax by 37,000 2011: 24,000 and would change equity by 37,000 2011: 24,000.
This assumes that all other variables remain unchanged.
Calculations are performed on the same basis as the prior year.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than pound sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are the Euro and US Dollar with sales made in Euros and purchases made in both Euros and US Dollars principal exposure.
To protect its foreign currency position, the Group sets a buying rate in each country for the purchase of goods in US Dollars at the start of the buying season typically six to nine months before the product actually starts to appear in the stores and then enters into a number of local currency US Dollar contracts whereby the minimum exchange rate on the purchase of dollars is guaranteed.
As at 28 January 2012, options have been entered into to protect approximately 97% of the US Dollar requirement for the period to January 2013.
The balance of the US Dollar requirement for the period will be satisfied at spot rates.
Hedge accounting is not applied.
As at 28 January 2012, the fair value of these instruments was an asset of 30,000 2011: liability of 789,000 which has been included within current assets 2011: current liabilities.
A gain of 1,018,000 2011: loss of 1,394,000 has been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for the change in fair value of these instruments.
A 10.0% strengthening of sterling relative to the following currencies as at the reporting date would have reduced profit before tax and equity as follows: Profit before tax Equity 2012 2011 2012 2011 000 000 000 000 Euros 515 179 4,675 179 US Dollars 13 693 240 693 Australian Dollars 13 2 177 2 New Zealand Dollars 4 3 271 3 Other 61 23 100 23 458 896 4,429 896 A 10.0% weakening of sterling relative to the following currencies as at the reporting date would have increased profit before tax and equity as follows: Profit before tax Equity 2012 2011 2012 2011 000 000 000 000 630 5,714 Euros 219 219 US Dollars 4 848 293 848 Australian Dollars 16 2 216 2 New Zealand Dollars 1 3 332 3 Other 74 28 122 28 569 1,096 5,415 1,096 Calculations are performed on the same basis as the prior year and the method assumes that all other variables remain unchanged.
Financial instruments continued Credit risk Credit risk arises from the possibility of customers and counterparties failing to meet their obligations to the Group.
Investments of cash surpluses, borrowings and derivative instruments are made through major United Kingdom and European clearing banks, which must meet minimum credit ratings as required by the Board.
All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and provision is made for impairment where amounts are not thought to be recoverable see note 20.
At the reporting date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk and receivables which are not impaired are believed to be recoverable.
The Group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk to be equivalent to total trade and other receivables of 54,147,000 2011: 37,105,000, cash and cash equivalents of 67,024,000 2011: 90,131,000, deposits of 2,030,000 2011: 779,000 and key money of 9,517,000 2011: 8,419,000.
The Company has provided guarantees on banking facilities entered into by Chausport SA, Canterbury International Australia Pty Limited and Champion Sports Holdings totalling 5,000,000, AUD$3,000,000 and a maximum of 3,000,000 respectively.
The Company has also provided a guarantee on the finance lease facility in relation to the acquisition of Champion Sports Holdings up to a maximum of 2,500,000.
In addition, the syndicated committed 75,000,000 bank facility, which was in place as at 28 January 2012, encompassed cross guarantees between the Company, RD Scott Limited, Bank Fashion Limited, Topgrade Sportswear Limited, Nicholas Deakins Limited, Canterbury Limited, Canterbury of New Zealand Limited and Focus International Limited to the extent to which any of these companies were overdrawn.
As at 28 January 2012, these facilities were drawn down by nil 2011: nil.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its cash and borrowing requirement to minimise net interest expense, whilst ensuring that the Group has sufficient liquid resources to meet the operating needs of the business.
The forecast cash and borrowing profile of the Group is monitored on an ongoing basis, to ensure that adequate headroom remains under committed borrowing facilities.
The Board review 13 week and annual cash flow forecasts each month.
Information about the maturity of the Group's financial liabilities is disclosed in note 22.
As at 28 January 2012, there are committed facilities with a maturity profile as follows: 2012 2011 000 000 Expiring in less than one year - 70,000 Expiring in more than one year but no more than four years 75,000 - 75,000 70,000 The commitment fee on these facilities is 0.56% 2011: 0.34%.
