SECTION 4 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES Notes to the Group financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2012 1 Accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied in the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
The principal entities included in the financial statement are shown in note 37.
The financial information set out on pages 46 to 100 comprises the consolidated financial statements of Kesa Electricals plc for the year ended 30 April 2012 prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out below.
Kesa Electricals plc the Company is incorporated in Great Britain and registered in England and Wales.
Its registered ofce is 22-24 Ely Place, London EC1N 6TE.
Basis of preparation These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the European Union EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modied by the revaluation of available for sale financial assets, foreign currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts and also on a going concern basis.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associated undertakings.
All significant consolidated companies have a 30 April accounting year end.
Consolidation a Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all operations over which the Group has the power to control the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the settlement including assets, equity instruments and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred.
Identiable assets and liabilities acquired and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group.
For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity.
Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
b Associates and joint ventures Associates are all operations over which the Group has the ability to exercise significant inuence but not control.
Joint ventures are all operations over which the Group exercises joint control with partners.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method and are initially recognised at cost.
The Groups investment in associates and joint ventures includes goodwill net of any accumulated impairment loss identied on acquisition.
The Groups share of its associates and joint ventures post-acquisition profits or losses are recognised in the income statement, its share of post acquisition valuation movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment and its share of post acquisition movements in reserves are recognised in reserves.
When the Groups share of losses in an associate or a joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate or joint venture, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the associates and joint ventures.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of associates and joint ventures have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Kesa Electricals plc Annual report 2011 12 51 SECTION 4 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES Notes to the Group financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2012 1 Accounting policies continued Foreign currency translation a Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups undertakings are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the undertaking operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the majority of the subsidiaries functional currency and the Groups presentational currency.
b Transaction and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash ow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.
Translation differences on equities classied as available for sale are included in the available for sale reserve in equity.
c Group companies The results and financial position of all the Group operations that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: i Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: ii Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates: and iii Resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments are taken to shareholders funds.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.
When a foreign operation is sold, exchange differences are recycled to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Use of adjusted measures Kesa Electricals plc believes that retail profit, adjusted profit before tax and adjusted earnings per share provide additional useful information on underlying trends and business performance to shareholders.
Retail profit represents total operating profit before the share of joint venture and associates interest and taxation, movement in options and related charges over non-controlling interests, impairment of available for sale investments, exceptional costs and amortisation and impairment of acquisition related intangible assets and discontinued operations.
A reconciliation is shown in the Group income statement.
Adjusted profit before tax is retail profit less pre-exceptional net finance income so excludes the effects of movement in options and related charges over non-controlling interests, impairment of available for sale assets, exceptional costs, amortisation and impairment of acquisition related intangible assets, exceptional finance costs, tax effects of exceptional items and discontinued operations.
Adjusted earnings per share gures exclude the effects of movement in options and related charges over non-controlling interests, impairment of available for sale assets, exceptional costs, amortisation and impairment of acquisition related intangible assets, exceptional finance costs, tax effects of exceptional items and discontinued operations.
A reconciliation of this is shown in the earnings per share note.
These measures are used by the Group for internal performance analysis and incentive compensation arrangements for employees.
The term retail profit is not dened by IFRS and may therefore not be comparable with similarly titled profit measures reported by other companies.
It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measurements of profit.
Exceptional items The Group defines exceptional items as those non-recurring items which by their nature or size would distort the comparability of the Groups result from year to year.
Segmental information The Group bases its internal reporting systems on certain reportable segments.
These segments are used by the chief operating decision-maker, identied as the Group Chief Executive, for assessing performance and allocating resources.
52 Kesa Electricals plc Annual report 2011 12 SECTION 4 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES 1 Accounting policies continued The reportable segments are as follows: Darty France Other established businesses BCC, Vanden Borre, Datart Developing businesses Darty Spain, Darty Italy, Darty Turkey The aggregation within the Other established businesses and Developing businesses segments is consistent with the core principle of IFRS 8 as the businesses comprising these segments have similar economic characteristics.
Sales between segments are carried out at arms length.
Intangible assets a Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identiable assets of the acquired subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill on acquisitions of associates is included in the carrying value of investments in associates and is tested for impairment as part of the overall balance.
Separately recognised goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less impairment losses.
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an operation include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the operation sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing.
Each of those CGUs represents a separate autonomous unit within the Group, where the management of the unit has independent control and responsibility for managing the cash ow of that unit.
In practice these are deemed to be each retail chain of stores acquired.
b Other intangible assets i Software Costs that are directly associated with the development of identiable and unique software products controlled by the Group.
Where it is probable that they will generate economic benets exceeding costs beyond one year, they are recognised as intangible assets.
Other costs are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Direct costs include the software development, employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads.
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specic software.
These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives two to five years.
ii Leasehold rights Amounts paid in order to gain access to certain leasehold premises or a right to trade from a site are recognised as intangible assets.
The value in use of these items is calculated using growth rates and discount factors considered appropriate for the relevant CGUs.
These costs are amortised to their residual value value in use over their estimated useful lives 15 to 20 years.
If the value in use calculated is greater than carrying value no amortisation charge is recognised.
Property, plant and equipment tangible xed assets Land and buildings comprise mainly of retail outlets, warehouses and ofces.
Fixtures, ttings and equipment comprise of tenants xtures and improvements, computers and electronic equipment and motor cars and commercial vehicles.
All property, plant and equipment is stated at historic cost less depreciation.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Assets in the course of construction represent the cost of purchasing, constructing and installing property, plant and equipment ahead of their productive use.
They are not depreciated until they are transferred to an appropriate and permanent category of property, plant and equipment on completion of construction, unless there are circumstances indicating an impairment of the asset, where provision is made immediately.
Subsequent costs are included in an assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate.
These costs are included in the carrying amounts only when it is probable that future economic benets associated with an asset will ow to the Group, the cost of the asset can be measured reliably, the assets useful life exceeds one full accounting period and costs exceed 1,000 or equivalent.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost less estimated residual value over their estimated useful lives, and the depreciation periods of the principal categories are as follows: Freehold buildings 20 years to residual value Long leasehold buildings 20 years or remaining lease term if shorter Short leasehold buildings over the remaining period of the lease Tenants xtures and improvements between five and 20 years Computers and electronic equipment between two and four years Motor cars and commercial vehicles between two and five years Kesa Electricals plc Annual report 2011 12 53 SECTION 4 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES Notes to the Group financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2012 1 Accounting policies continued The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
When properties are sold the difference between the sale proceeds and net book value is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment of assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or that the assets use may not generate an economic benefit greater than their carrying value.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identiable cash ows as CGUs.
For property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill, the CGU is deemed to be each trading store.
The discount rate applied is based upon the Groups weighted average cost of capital with appropriate adjustments for the risks associated with the relevant business.
Any impairment charge is recognised in the income statement in the year in which it occurs.
Non-financial assets other than goodwill that have suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
Where an impairment loss, other than an impairment loss on goodwill, subsequently reverses due to a change in the original estimate, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount.
Financial instruments Financial assets The Group classies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, and available for sale.
The classication depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Management determines the classication of its financial assets at initial recognition.
a Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss held for trading: a financial asset is classied in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term.
Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges, and the hedge is effective for accounting purposes.
Assets in this category are classied as current assets.
Financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition: these include financial assets that are not held for trading purposes, which may be sold, managed and their performance evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with the Companys investment and risk strategy.
Realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets through the income statement are included in finance costs income in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
b Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date.
These are classied as non-current assets.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet.
They are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost.
c Available for sale financial assets Available for sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classied in any of the other categories.
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Changes in the fair value of monetary and non-monetary securities classied as available for sale are recognised in equity.
When securities classied as available for sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in equity are included in the income statement as impairment of available for sale financial assets.
54 Kesa Electricals plc Annual report 2011 12 SECTION 4 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES 1 Accounting policies continued The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
In the case of equity securities classied as available for sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered as an indicator that the securities are impaired.
If any such evidence exists for available for sale financial assets, the cumulative loss measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the income statement.
Financial liabilities a Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss held for trading: a financial liability is classied in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term.
Liabilities in this category are classied as current liabilities.
Financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition: these include financial liabilities that are not held for trading purposes, which may be sold, are managed and their performance evaluated on a fair basis in accordance with the Companys investment and risk strategy.
b Financial liabilities at amortised cost Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, net of attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Trade payables are non-interest-bearing and are stated at amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments All derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value at each balance sheet date.
All derivatives are categorised as investments held for trading a sub-category of financial assets at fair value through the income statement unless they are designated as cash ow hedges.
As such they are valued at each balance sheet date and variances in value are charged in full to the income statement.
Derivatives designated as cash ow hedges are tested for their hedge effectiveness on a periodic basis.
Should these derivatives fail the requirements of this test they are immediately reclassied as investments held for trading and treated accordingly.
To the extent that these derivatives are demonstrated to be an effective hedge, movements in value are accumulated in equity reserves net of deferred tax and are recycled against the benefit or charge made to the income statement when the hedged transaction is settled.
To the extent that these derivatives are ineffective as a hedge, any variance in value is charged directly to the income statement.
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction outline the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash ows of hedged items.
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets such as publicly traded derivatives and available for sale securities is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price: the appropriate quoted market price for financial liabilities is the current offer price.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example over the counter derivatives is determined using valuation techniques.
The Group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined using the weighted average method.
The value of inventory includes the purchase price and transport costs to warehouses and retail stores including trade discounts, rebates and other subsidies.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less costs estimated to realise the sale of relevant stock.
Cost of product sales represents the value of stock sold when recognised in revenue.
Kesa Electricals plc Annual report 2011 12 55 SECTION 4 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES Notes to the Group financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2012 1 Accounting policies continued Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
When a trade receivable is uncollectible it is written off to the income statement.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against selling expenses in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts for which a right of set off exists.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet, but included within cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash ow statement.
Share capital The Group only has one class of shares, ordinary shares, which are classied as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options, or for the acquisition of a business, are included in the cost of acquisition as part of the purchase consideration.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method where appropriate.
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers.
They are classied as current liabilities if payment is due within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
For liabilities at amortised cost, the carrying value approximates to fair value as the impact of discounting using market interest rates at the end of the reporting period is insignicant.
Borrowings are classied as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Current and deferred income tax Current income tax is the expected income tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date, and adjustments to income tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred income tax is provided in full using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Recognition of deferred income tax assets takes into account IAS 12 recognition criteria using the Groups judgement on the probability of future taxable profits being available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Employee benets a Retirement benefits The Group operates retirement benefit arrangements most notably in the UK and France, which are supplemental to contributions paid to mandatory state funded schemes.
Company sponsored schemes are generally funded through payments to insurance companies or trustee administered funds, as determined by periodic actuarial calculations or local legislation.
The Group has both dened benefit and dened contribution plans.
56 Kesa Electricals plc Annual report 2011 12 SECTION 4 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES 1 Accounting policies continued A dened contribution plan is a retirement benefit under which the Group pays xed contributions into a separate entity.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benets relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
A dened benefit plan is a retirement benefit that is not a dened contribution plan.
Typically dened benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and salary.
For dened benefit plans the liability recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the dened benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for past service costs which have not yet vested.
The dened benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the dened benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benets will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related retirement benefit liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement, unless changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past-service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
For dened contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
b Share based compensation The Group operates equity settled, share based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions for example, profitability and sales growth targets.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
c Termination benefits Termination benets are payable if employment is terminated before the normal retirement date or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benets.
The Group recognises termination benets when it is demonstrably committed either to terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan, without possibility of withdrawal, or providing termination benets as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
Benets falling due more than 12 months after the balance sheet date are discounted to present value.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are discounted where the time value of money is considered material.
If the Group has a contract that is onerous the present obligation under the contract is recognised and measured as a provision.
The provision is the lower of the cost of exiting the contract and the cost of fullling the obligation.
A warranty provision estimates the future costs of warranty repairs that will be carried out on products already sold.
This provision looks forward to periods over which the warranties will expire, and is calculated on a consistent basis year on year.
Restructuring provisions, comprising lease termination penalties and employee termination payments, are only recognised when plans are sufciently detailed and well advanced, and where appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken on or before the balance sheet date.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions for WEEE Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment fees incurred across the Group are recognised in compliance with each of the local territories adopted legislation in response to the WEEE Directive.
Kesa Electricals plc Annual report 2011 12 57 SECTION 4 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES Notes to the Group financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2012 1 Accounting policies continued Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value for the sale of goods and services, net of value added tax, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benets will ow to the entity and when specic criteria have been met for each of the Groups activities as described below.
The amount of revenue is not considered to be reliably measurable until all contingencies relating to the sale have been resolved.
The Group bases its estimates on historical results, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and the specics of each arrangement.
Revenues from the provision of sales of goods are recognised at the point of sale of a product to the customer or upon delivery to the customer, whichever is the later.
Retail sales are usually settled in cash or by credit or payment card.
Certain companies within the Group sell products with a right of return.
Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the value of such returns at the time of sale.
Revenues from services are recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered, by reference to completion of the specic transaction assessed on the basis of the actual service provided as a proportion of the total services to be provided.
The Group sells extended warranty and service contracts.
Where the Group has responsibility for fullling obligations under these contracts, the Group recognises the corresponding revenue over the period for which cover is provided, excluding any free period of manufacturers warranty.
Where the Group sells an extended warranty or service contract and a third-party insurance company has responsibility for contractual obligations, commission revenue for the insured warranty contract is recognised at the time of sale.
Where part of the obligation under these contracts is reinsured by the Group, the revenue relating to the reinsurance is recognised over the period for which reinsurance is provided, excluding any period of manufacturers warranty.
Royalty and franchise revenue is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreements, and is included within other income.
Finance income and costs Finance income and costs is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method.
Leases Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership is transferred to the Group or any of its subsidiaries are classied as finance leases.
Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of minimum lease payments.
Assets capitalised as property, plant and equipment are depreciated over the lower of their useful lives and the term of the lease.
Payments under such leases are charged against the recognised liability and interest costs are charged to the income statement over the full period of the finance lease on a systematic basis.
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classied as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases net of any financial incentives received from the lessor are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the full period of the lease.
Benets received and receivable as an incentive to enter into a lease are deferred and spread on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease unless another systematic basis is representative of the time pattern of the lessees benefit from the use of the leased asset.
Lease premiums payable are recorded as a prepayment in the balance sheet and amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease unless another systematic basis is representative of the time pattern of the lessees benefit from the use of the leased asset.
Charges made in respect of operating leases of property are adjusted from time to time to reect the impact of market rent reviews throughout the life of the lease.
Dividends Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised in the period they are paid.
58 Kesa Electricals plc Annual report 2011 12 SECTION 4 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES 1 Accounting policies continued Contingent assets and liabilities Contingent assets and liabilities arise from conditions or situations, the outcome of which depends on future events.
Assets held for sale and discontinued operations Assets and businesses are classied as held for sale, and stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, if their carrying amount will be recovered or settled principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business that represents a separate major line of business that has been disposed of, has been abandoned or meets the criteria to be classied as held for sale.
Events occurring after the balance sheet date The values of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are adjusted if there is evidence that subsequent adjusting events warrant a modication of these values.
These adjustments are made up to the date of approval of the accounts by the Board of Directors.
Other non-adjusting events are disclosed in the notes to the accounts where they are probable.
Effect of new standards, amendments and interpretations a Standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards effective in 2011 12 IAS 24 Revised.
Related party disclosures, issued in November 2009.
It supersedes IAS 24, Related party disclosures, issued in 2003.
The revised standard claries and simplies the denition of a related party.
The Group has applied IAS 24 Revised from 1 May 2011 and it is of minimal impact.
b New standards and interpretations that are not yet effective IFRS 9, Financial instruments, addresses the classication, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities.
The standard is not applicable until 1 January 2015 but is available for early adoption.
However, the standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU and as such, the Group has not yet adopted IFRS 9.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of certain critical estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.
i Estimated impairment of assets The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy stated in this note.
In addition, asset impairment reviews are carried out whenever performance or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may be required.
The recoverable amounts of CGUs have been determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations require the use of estimates which include cash ow forecasts for each CGU and discount rates based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital with appropriate adjustments for the risks associated with the relevant business.
Please refer to the intangible assets note and the property, plant and equipment note for details of the key assumptions used for impairment reviews.
ii Retirement benefits The Group operates retirement benefit arrangements most notably in the UK and France.
Any net deficit or surplus arising on dened benefit plans is shown on the balance sheet.
The amount recorded is the difference between plan assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Plan assets are based on market value at that date.
Plan liabilities are based on actuarial estimates of the present value of future pension or other benets that will be payable to members.
The most sensitive assumptions involved in calculating the expected liabilities are mortality rates, price ination and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the liabilities.
The main financial assumption is the real discount rate, being the excess of the discount rate over the rate of ination.
A half percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption used to determine the net liability at 30 April 2012 would have reduced profit before taxation by 0.2m and increased the net liability by 41.9m.
A half percentage point increase in the price ination assumptions would have reduced profit before taxation by 1.2m and would have increased the net liability by 35.5m.
For the UK scheme, the mortality tables used by the Group are S1PA tables, weighted by 106 per cent for males and 103 per cent for females with improvements in line with the medium cohort projections subject to a minimum increase of 1.0 per cent p. a. for males and 0.75 per cent for females.
For the France schemes, the mortality tables used by the Group are TGHF 2005 for pensioners and INSEE 2007 2009 H F for non-pensioners.
If assumed life expectancies had been one year greater, the charge to profit before taxation would have been increased by 0.5m and the net liability would have increased by approximately 10.4m.
Kesa Electricals plc Annual report 2011 12 59 SECTION 4 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES Notes to the Group financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2012 1 Accounting policies continued iii Taxation significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes.
There are many transactions and calculations on which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
iv Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of average cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct purchase cost and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition, both types of cost being measured using a weighted average cost formula.
Net realisable value includes, where necessary, provisions for slow moving and damaged inventory.
The provision represents the difference between the cost of stock and its estimated net realisable value, based on ageing.
Calculation of these provisions requires judgements to be made which include forecast consumer demand, the promotional, competitive and economic environment and inventory loss trends.

The Board establishes the Groups financial policies and the Chief Executive officer establishes objectives in line with these policies.
The Treasury Committee, under the supervision of the Finance Director, is then responsible for setting financial strategies, which are executed by the Central and Operating Company treasury teams.
Approved treasury policy defines and classies risks and also determines, by category of transaction, specic approval, limit and monitoring procedures.
In the course of its business the Group is exposed to financial market risks, credit risk and liquidity risk.
In accordance with the aforementioned policies the Group only enters into derivative transactions related to operating and or financial assets or liabilities or anticipated future transactions.
The Group does not enter into trading derivative transactions without underlying assets or liabilities.
Financial market risks are essentially caused by exposures to foreign currencies and interest rates.
Foreign currency transaction risk arises because afliated companies sometimes undertake transactions in foreign currencies such as the purchase of products.
Translation exposure arises from the consolidation of the Group financial statements into euros.
Interest rate risk comprises the fair value interest rate risk that results from borrowing at xed rates and the cash ow interest rate risk that results from borrowing at variable rates.
Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its obligations.
The Group is exposed to credit risks on financial instruments such as liquid assets, derivative assets and its trade receivable portfolios.
Credit risk is managed by investing in liquid assets and acquiring derivatives with high credit quality financial institutions in accordance with the Groups treasury policy.
The Group is not exposed to concentrations of credit risk on its liquid assets as these are spread over several financial institutions.
The Group does not expect any renancing issues as current loan agreements expire.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Groups customer base being large and unrelated.
Due to this, the Directors believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the provision for impairment of receivables.
Subsidiary companies lend their excess cash at bank to Group finance companies to be invested centrally.
The Treasury Committee reviews and decides the currency and interest rate framework of the Groups intragroup loans portfolio on a regular basis.
Group treasury manages liquidity and exposure to funding, interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks.
It uses a combination of derivative and conventional financial instruments to manage these underlying financial risks.
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of Boardapproved policies and guidelines which are recommended and monitored by the Treasury Committee.
These guidelines include bank exposure limits and hedge cover levels for each of the key areas of treasury risk.
The Board and Treasury Committee receive regular reports of the activities of Group treasury.
60 Kesa Electricals plc Annual report 2011 12 SECTION 4 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES 2 Financial risk management continued Capital management The principal sources of capital to fund the Groups operations are equity, bank borrowings and operating leases on properties.
Group policy is to borrow centrally to meet funding requirements: funds are then lent or contributed as equity to certain subsidiaries.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
In considering the balance of sources of finance, the Group seeks to maintain nancing from equity, debt and property leases relative to earnings and cash ows at levels consistent, over time, with similar companies rated investment grade by publicly recognised rating agencies.
Market risk 1 Foreign exchange risk The Group publishes its financial statements in euros and conducts business in several foreign currencies.
It is therefore subject to foreign currency exchange risk due to exchange movements affecting the Groups transaction costs and the translation of results and underlying net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The Group hedges a substantial proportion of its exposure to uctuations on the translation into euros of its foreign currency net assets by minimising the net assets held in non-euro currencies.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of net assets held in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The Group adopts a centralised approach to foreign exchange risk management.
Permission of Group treasury is required before a foreign exchange transaction may be undertaken.
Any foreign exchange transaction must be demonstrably linked to an underlying exposure and the hedge is monitored through the life of the transaction to ensure it remains effective and appropriate.
Following the disposal of Comet, there is no material Group revenue denominated in sterling compared to 31 per cent in the year to 30 April 2011.
Similarly, outside of some Kesa plc running costs, which represent less than 1 per cent of the Groups operating costs there is a negligible impact on Group retail profit 30 April 2011: 10 per cent.
Treasury policy requires that all transactional foreign exchange risk relating to committed transactions must be hedged.
The gain or loss on the hedge is recognised at the same time as the underlying transaction.
2 Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The treasury policy requires that at least 30 per cent, but no more than 70 per cent of Group borrowings must be xed, and this will be applied when there is a need for longer-term borrowings.
If interest rates on euro-denominated borrowings had been 10 basis points higher during the year with all other variables held constant, profit before tax to 30 April 2012 would have been 0.2m 30 April 2011: 0.1m lower.
If interest rates on euro-denominated borrowings had been 100 basis points higher during the year with all other variables held constant, profit before tax to 30 April 2012 would have been 2.3m 30 April 2011: 1.2m lower.
Credit risk Interest rate swap, foreign exchange and deposit transactions are only entered into with counterparties with a short-term credit rating of A1 or better.
Group treasury monitors the credit exposure of the Group to its counterparties and the credit ratings of those counterparties on a monthly basis.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
Exposures are managed through Group treasury policy which limits the value that can be placed with each approved counterparty to minimise the risk of loss.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by their carrying value as at the balance sheet date.
Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
The Group maintains committed bank facilities of sufficient maturity to ensure that it has sufficient available funds for operations and planned expenditure.

The Group has given certain covenants to lenders in connection with its bank loans.
The covenants are of a financial nature and relate mainly to maintaining a certain level of net debt and interest cover compared to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and maintaining a ratio of earnings before depreciation and rent to rent and interest.
During the year ending 30 April 2012, the Group is in compliance with its covenants.
62 Kesa Electricals plc Annual report 2011 12 SECTION 4 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES 2 Financial risk management continued Fair value estimation Financial instruments are measured in the balance sheet at fair value, this requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1.
Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices level 2.
Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price.
These instruments are included in level 1.
Equity instruments included in level 1 comprise primarily the Groups holding in Go Sport S. A. sports leisurewear and equipment retailer, a company listed and registered in France which is classied as available for sale.
During the year the marketability of this investment has proved to be more difficult and the Groups holding has been diluted by lower valuations and a rights issue in May 2012, resulting in a perceived prolonged reduction in value.
As a result, the full value of the investment has been impaired.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over the counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specic estimates.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.
Specic valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include: Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments, The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash ows based on observable yield curves, The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date, with the resulting value discounted back to present value, and Other techniques, such as discounted cash ow analysis, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
Options over shares in Group undertakings at FVTPL Put and call options held by Kesa Electricals plc over the non-controlling share capital of Kesa Turkey Limited and Datart Investments S. A. have been recognised at fair value through profit and loss, in accordance with IAS 39.

Further 1 per cent decreases in the tax rate are expected to be enacted in future Finance Bills until the tax rate reduces to 22 per cent by 1 April 2014.
These further changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not included in these financial statements.
The effect of the changes announced in the Finance Act 2011 and Finance Act 2012 will have no impact on the Groups deferred tax liability in the current year or in future years.
This is due to managements expectation that future UK taxable profits are unlikely, with a consequence that there are no deferred tax assets liabilities recognised in the UK tax group at the balance sheet date.
An interim dividend of 2.25 cents was paid to the ordinary shareholders of the Company on 1 April 2012.
In addition, the Board will also recommend, at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, the payment of a final dividend of 1.25 cents which will total 6.6m, payable on 5 October 2012 in relation to the year ended 30April2012.
The final dividend, once approved, will be paid to those persons on the Register of Members at the close of business on 14 September 2012.
10 Earnings losses per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to shareholders by 526.9m shares 30 April 2011, 527.9m, being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue.
There is no difference between diluted and basic earnings per share.

Costs relating to the reorganisation total 7.2m in Darty France and 0.6m in Kesa head ofce.
Certain costs and fees totalling 6.3m have been incurred as a result of preparing for and implementing plans to dispose of Darty Telecom.
In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, store impairment reviews have been undertaken by Darty Spain and Darty Italy.
Given the performance and economic uncertainty, based on the value in use calculations, Darty Spains property, plant and equipment assets have been impaired by 13.8m and Darty Italys assets have been impaired by 22.0m.
Darty Spains intangible assets have been impaired by 4.1m and Darty Italys intangible assets have been impaired by 4.3m.
Additionally, restructuring costs have been incurred and provisions made in Darty Italy 9.6m and Darty Spain 2.6m.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit can be realised through future taxable profits.
Management have concluded that future UK taxable profits are unlikely and have therefore written off the UK deferred income tax asset.
The deferred tax asset of 10.3m on the net pension liability has been written off through the Group statement of comprehensive income, as it was originally recognised in this way.
In the year ended 30 April 2011, the Continuing Group worked on reducing the cost to serve in all businesses.
In The Netherlands and Spain it implemented these plans via restructuring programmes which started in the second half of the year and resulted in exceptional costs totalling 11.0m.
The cash outow on exceptional items during the year for the Continuing Group was 10.9m 30 April 2011: 2.0m.

Goodwill Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and tested annually for impairment based on value in use.
Goodwill is tested more frequently if there are indications that it might be impaired.
Cash-generating units are independent sources of income and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes, which may be at a country, divisional, regional or store level.
The carrying amount of goodwill by business segments are as follows: Other established Developing Discontinued Darty France businesses businesses businesses Group m m m m m At 30 April 2012 1.7 19.3 21.0 At 30 April 2011 1.7 19.3 3.8 24.8 Goodwill impairment review The key assumptions used for the value in use calculations are the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and costs.
Management have estimated the discount rate with regard to the specic risks inherent within the Groups retail businesses.
Discount rates used are on a pre-tax basis.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and have been adjusted for expected changes in future conditions.
The calculations are based on future operating cash ows, over a five-year period, derived using managements latest medium-term forecasts.
Cash ows are extrapolated using estimated long-term growth rates.
Kesa Electricals plc Annual report 2011 12 75 SECTION 4 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES Notes to the Group financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2012 14 Intangible assets continued The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations for Darty France, Darty Italy, BCC and Vanden Borre are as follows: Long-term growth rate of between 0.5 per cent and 3.0 per cent Pre-tax discount rates of between 11.8 per cent and 17.2 per cent, being the Groups weighted average cost of capital with appropriate adjustments for the risks associated with the relevant business Based on the value in use calculations, Darty Italys goodwill has been fully impaired, incurring a charge of 3.7m.
Other intangibles Other intangibles include amounts paid in order to gain access to certain leasehold premises and acquired intangibles and favourable lease contracts.
The carrying amount of the other intangibles is analysed by business segment as follows: Other established Developing Discontinued Darty France businesses businesses operations Group m m m m m At 30 April 2012 10.0 0.4 0.6 11.0 At 30 April 2011 32.0 1.5 3.6 37.1 The value in use of amounts paid in order to gain access to leasehold premises has been calculated using growth rates and discount factors considered appropriate for the relevant cash-generating units.
In 2012 and 2011, the value in use has been calculated as greater than carrying value, therefore no impairment charge has been recognised.

For the purposes of impairment testing, each individual store is considered by management to be a cash-generating unit.
Impairment testing is based on value in use calculations incorporating discount rates derived from the Groups weighted average cost of capital with appropriate adjustments for the risks associated with the relevant business.
Asset impairment of 129.1m 2011: 6.8m was charged to the income statement during the year and 1.4m 2011: 4.0m of previously held provisions were reversed.

The key assumptions used in the impairment calculations for Darty Spain and Darty Italy are a long-term growth rate of 3.0 per cent and pre-tax discount rates of between 15.8 per cent and 17.2 per cent adjusted to reect the specic risks associated with each business assessment.
Market value of freehold property Based on a sample of valuations performed during the year, the Directors are of the opinion that the market value of the Groups freehold property portfolio signicantly exceeds the net book value.

Hedges Forward foreign currency contracts cash flow hedges The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge expected future purchases in US dollars for which the Group has rm commitments.
The contracts typically cover periods of less than six months.
The forward currency contracts are used to hedge the foreign currency risk of the rm commitments.
Where cash ow hedges on forward foreign currency contracts are assessed to be effective, the movement in the fair value is taken to the hedging reserve within equity.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated by marking the contracts to market using prevailing forward exchange rates.
At 30 April 2012, a net unrealised loss of 0.2m 30 April 2011: 1.1m loss with a related deferred tax asset was included within equity in respect of these contracts.

84 Kesa Electricals plc Annual report 2011 12 SECTION 4 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES 27 Deferred tax Deferred income tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using tax rates applicable to the country in which they originate.
Deferred income tax assets have been recognised in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences giving rise to deferred income tax assets, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Following a change in UK tax legislation applicable from 1 July 2009, dividends received in the UK are no longer subject to UK taxation, provided certain conditions are met.
Consequently, no deferred income tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associated undertakings.
The movements in deferred income tax assets and liabilities prior to the offsetting of balances within the same jurisdiction as permitted by IAS 12 during the period are shown below.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.

33 Retirement benets Summary of Group retirement benets and funding arrangements The Group operates retirement benefit arrangements most notably in the UK and France.
In the UK, the Group operates a dened benefit pension scheme The Comet Pension Scheme with assets held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The scheme was closed to new entrants on 1 April 2004 and future service accrual was ceased on 30 September 2007, with affected employees eligible to become members of the Group dened contribution scheme.
Following the disposal of Comet, Kesa Electricals plc assumed the liabilities associated with the Comet Pension Scheme.
Comet ceased to be the participating employer from the date of completion, 3 February 2012 with all member benets, including any link to future salary increases, ceasing from this date.
The scheme is valued by an qualied actuary every three years and a deficit recovery plan agreed with the trustees based on an agreed schedule of contributions.
The March 2010 triennial valuation was agreed with the trustees in June 2011 resulting in annual payments of 6.1m per annum aiming to make good the 49m deficit by March 2018.
As part of the scheme transfer from Comet to Kesa, it was agreed with the trustees to increase the annual deficit recovery payments to 10.0m per annum retrospectively from the last triennial valuation at 31 March 2010 so reducing the recovery plan period to March 2015.
Additional payments were made to facilitate this of 3.5m in February 2012 and 3.65m in May 2012.
As a result, Company contributions to be paid in 2012 13 total 13.65m.
In France, post-retirement benets are primarily provided by the state system though the Group has supplementary funded pension plans in place for certain senior executives.
At 30 April 2012, given funding to date of 11.6m, these pension plans had a surplus of 0.7m.
The Group has no further mortality risk post retirement.
In addition, the Group is required to pay lump sum retirement indemnities to employees when they retire from service.
The entitlement on retirement is secured through the purchase of an annuity from an insurance company tariff under terms prescribed by legislation.
No pre-funding is legally required, though at 30 April 2012, 8.5m of funding has been set aside for retirement indemnity plans.
94 Kesa Electricals plc Annual report 2011 12 SECTION 4 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES 33 Retirement benets continued Outside of the UK and France, the operating companies generally operate dened contribution pension schemes as summarised below: 2012 2011 UK France Other Group UK France Other Group m m m m m m m m Dened contribution schemes 6.4 3.6 10.0 9.4 3.1 12.5 Dened benefit schemes IAS 19 Accounting Valuations The Groups dened benefit schemes in the UK and France have been valued by a qualied and independent actuary at 30 April 2012 based on IAS 19.
No significant new legislation has impacted the IAS valuation for the year ended April 2012.
As announced in 2011, an increased retirement age is to be implemented in France and is being phased in to 2018.
This has reduced the assumed retirement period and has resulted in a 0.1m actuarial gain in 2011 12.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries were: 2012 2011 UK France UK France % % % % Discount rate 4.80 3.504.75 5.30 4.05.0 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries N A 2.5 3.40 2.5 Rate of pension increases 3.10 3.30 Price ination 2.0 2.0 RPI 3.20 3.40 CPI 2.20 2.70 Expected return on plan assets: Insurance policies N A 4.5 4.5 Equities 6.90 6.5 7.70 6.5 Gilts 3.10 4.00 Bonds 4.70 3.5 5.10 4.25 Cash 0.70 1.90 Dynamic asset allocation 6.10 7.00 Real estate N A 6.0 6.00 5.0 Other 3.30 2.0 4.20 2.0 The discount rate is based on the yield on an AA-rated corporate bond index with an adjustment to reect the longer duration of the scheme liabilities relative to the index where appropriate.
Expected returns on plan assets are based on market expectations at the beginning of the year for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligation.
Scheme administration expenses have been netted off against the expected return on plan assets.

The facts and circumstances relating to particular cases are evaluated to determine whether it is more likely than not that there will be a future outow of funds and, once established, whether a provision relating to a specic case is necessary or sufficient.
The outcome of any Litigation is difficult to predict, and significant management judgement is exercised when determining the value and risk a of a contingent liability.
The Group does not expect the ultimate resolution of the Litigation to which it is a party to have a significant adverse impact on the financial position of the Group.
The Company, in line with standard practice, has given some guarantees and indemnities most notably in relation to disposals of subsidiary undertakings and legacy tax matters.
The liabilities are, in the main, capped based on agreed terms and valuations and unwind over time.
At the end of April 2012, the risks relating to such contingent liabilities are deemed both unlikely and immaterial.
