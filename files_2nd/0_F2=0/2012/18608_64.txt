Barclays Bank plc and Lloyds TSB Bank plc have provided guarantees under performance bonds relating to the groups UK development division.
As at 30 September 2012 total guarantees amounted to 1.8m 2011: 2.1m.
In addition, the group has an obligation, under the sale and purchase agreement for the land at West Waterlooville, to pay further consideration should the site value exceed certain pre-agreed amounts.
It is not possible to determine the amount or timing of any such future payments due to the long-term nature of the sites development and the associated uncertainties.
However, it is unlikely that any future payments will fall due until at least 2015 and any payments made will be spread over a number of years.
As explained in more detail in note 21, there is uncertainty relating to the future of the site of Curzon Park in which the group has a 50% joint venture interest.
Should the value of the site, together with any compensation received, be insufficient to repay the bank loan in the joint venture entity, the group may incur charges in excess of those provided in these financial statements, in respect of obligations to the joint venture and the bank.
