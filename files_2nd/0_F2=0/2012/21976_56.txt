At 31 March 2012, other than as disclosed below, there were no contingent liabilities or guarantees other than those arising in the ordinary course of the groups business and on these no material losses are anticipated.
The group has insurance cover to certain limits for major risks on property and major claims in connection with legal liabilities arising in the course of its operations.
Otherwise, the group generally carries its own risks.
The group has provided guarantees relating to certain leases entered into by Telefonica UK Limited prior to its demerger with O2 on 19 November 2001. mmO2 plc has given BT a counter indemnity for these guarantees.
The maximum exposure was US$118m as at 31 March 2012 2011: US$128m, approximately 74m 2011: 80m, although this could increase by a further US$228m 2011: US$268m, approximately 143m 2011: 167m, in the event of credit default in respect of amounts used to defease future lease obligations.
The guarantee lasts until Telefonica UK Limited has discharged all its obligations, which is expected to be when the lease ends on 30 January 2017.
The group does not believe that there is any single current court action that would have a material adverse effect on the financial position or operations of the group.
During 2012 the aggregate volume and value of legal actions to which the group is party remained broadly the same as at the end of 2011.
