R olls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2012 Financial statements 117 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 21 Share-based payments continued Fair values of share-based payments The weighted average fair value per share of equity-settled share-based payment plans granted during the year, estimated at the date of grant, are as follows: 2012 2011 PSP 25% TSR uplift 885p 662p PSP 50% TSR uplift 985p 737p ShareSave 3 year grant n a 210p ShareSave 5 year grant n a 238p APRA 809p 612p In estimating these fair values, the following assumptions were used: PSP ShareSave 2012 2011 2011 Weighted average share price 809p 612p 691p Exercise price n a n a 525p Expected dividends 16.5p 15.4p 16.0p Expected volatility 31% 32% 30% Correlation 39% 36% n a Expected life PSP 3 years 3 years n a Expected life 3 year ShareSave n a n a 3.3 3.8 years Expected life 5 year ShareSave n a n a 5.3 5.8 years Risk free interest rate 0.6% 1.9% 1.9% Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the seven years prior to the grant or award date.
Expected dividends are based on the Companys payments to shareholders in respect of the previous year.
PSP The fair value of shares awarded under the PSP is calculated using a pricing model that takes account of the non-entitlement to dividends or equivalent during the vesting period and the market-based performance condition based on expectations about volatility and the correlation of share price returns in the group of FTSE 100 companies and which incorporates into the valuation the interdependency between share price performance and TSR vesting.
This adjustment increases the fair value of the award relative to the share price at the date of grant.
ShareSave The fair value of the options granted under the ShareSave plan is calculated using a binomial pricing model that assumes that participants will exercise their options at the beginning of the six-month window if the share price is greater than the exercise price.
Otherwise it assumes that options are held until the expiration of their contractual term.
This results in an expected life that falls somewhere between the start and end of the exercise window.
APRA The fair value of shares awarded under APRA is calculated as the share price on the date of the award, excluding expected dividends.
