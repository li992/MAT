DMS was formerly accounted for as a joint venture and following the acquisition of further shares it became a wholly owned subsidiary.
In accordance with IFRS 3 Revised 2008 Business Combinations, before accounting for the purchase of the remaining equity stake, the value of the previously held 50% shareholding was restated to fair value on the acquisition date.
This resulted in an exceptional gain of 51.1m being recognised in the income statement.
