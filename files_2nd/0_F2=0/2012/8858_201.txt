157 Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2012 27 Financial risk management continued 27b Interest rate risk The groups and parent companys interest rate risk arises from their fixed rate borrowings fair value risk and floating rate borrowings cash flow risk.
Their policy is to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings and equity.
They manage their risk by reviewing the profile of their debt regularly and by selectively using interest rate and cross currency swaps to maintain borrowings in appropriate currencies and at competitive rates.
The group and parent company have designated the US dollar fixed rate to US dollar floating rate swaps as fair value hedges as they hedge the changes in fair value of bonds attributable to changes in interest rates.
The gains on the interest rate swaps in the year ended 31st March 2012 were 5.6 million 2011 5.0 million and the losses on the bonds attributable to the hedged risk were 5.7 million 2011 5.0 million.
The group and parent company have designated the US dollar fixed interest rate to sterling fixed interest rate cross currency swap as a cash flow hedge as it hedges the movement in the cash flows of the hedged bond attributable to changes in the US dollar sterling exchange rate.
The cross currency swaps cash flows are expected to occur in 2015 when the bond which it hedges matures.
The interest element of the cash flow hedge is realised in the income statement each year and the exchange effect is expected to be realised in the income statement in 2015.
At 31st March 2012, 73% 2011 54% of the groups net debt and 62% 2011 44% of the parent companys net debt were at fixed rates with an average interest rate of 4.91% 2011 5.06%.
The remaining debt is funded on a floating rate basis.
Based on the groups net debt funded at floating rates, after taking into account the effect of the swaps, a 1% change in all interest rates would have a 1.2 million 2011 3.0 million impact on the groups profit before tax.
This is within the range the board regards as acceptable.
27c Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments is approximately equal to book value except for: 2012 2011 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair amount value amount value Group million million million million US Dollar Bonds 2013, 2015 and 2016 309.3 334.1 302.4 304.2 Euro Bonds 2021 83.3 93.6 88.4 89.7 Euro EIB loan 2013 104.2 108.4 110.7 115.4 Sterling Bonds 2013 40.0 41.1 40.0 42.0 2012 2011 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair amount value amount value Parent company million million million million Amounts receivable from subsidiaries 1,215.3 1,247.8 1,079.7 1,084.1 US Dollar Bonds 2013, 2015 and 2016 309.3 334.1 302.4 304.2 Euro Bonds 2021 83.3 93.6 88.4 89.7 Euro EIB loan 2013 104.2 108.4 110.7 115.4 Sterling Bonds 2013 40.0 41.1 40.0 42.0 The fair values are calculated by discounting future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market interest rates prevailing at the year end.
It is not possible to determine reliably the fair value of the groups unquoted available-for-sale investments which have a book value of 8.0 million 2011 8.0 million as there is no active market.
These are investments in a company that is in the start up phase and in an investment vehicle that invests in start up companies and so there is a wide range of possible values.
Given their size it would be overly onerous to provide additional detail.
27d Liquidity risk The groups and parent companys policy on funding capacity is to ensure that they always have sufficient long term funding and committed bank facilities in place to meet foreseeable peak borrowing requirements.
At 31st March 2012 the group and parent company had no borrowings under committed bank facilities 2011 146.7 million.
The group and parent company also have a number of uncommitted facilities, including metal leases, and overdraft lines at their disposal.
