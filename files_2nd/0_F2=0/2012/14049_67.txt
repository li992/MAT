Earnings per share Basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share EPS have been calculated in accordance with IAS 33 Earnings per Share.
EPS is shown both before and after amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition note 16 to assist in the understanding of the underlying performance of the business.
The calculation of the basic and diluted EPS is based on the following data: Number of shares 2012 2011 Millions Millions Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic EPS 491.2 490.5 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares: share options 11.7 8.6 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted EPS 502.9 499.1 Earnings per share Per share Per share Earnings amount Earnings amount 2012 2012 2011 2011 m Pence m Pence Earnings for the purpose of basic EPS being net profit attributable to the equity owners of the Company 245.3 49.94 175.1 35.70 Add back: Exceptional profit on disposal of subsidiaries, net of tax credit of 5.3m 2011: nil 10.9 2.22 Exceptional donation to Serco Foundation, net of tax of 1.2m 2011: nil 3.8 0.77 Exceptional gain on step acquisition, net of tax of nil 2011: nil 51.1 10.40 Amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition, net of tax of 5.4m 2011: 4.3m 18.7 3.81 15.7 3.20 Acquisition-related costs, net of tax of 0.5m 2011: 0.5m 3.2 0.65 3.4 0.69 Adjusted earnings 209.0 42.55 194.2 39.59 Earnings for the purpose of basic EPS 245.3 49.94 175.1 35.70 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares 1.16 0.62 Diluted EPS 245.3 48.78 175.1 35.08 At 31 December 2012 options over nil 2011: nil shares were excluded from the weighted average number of shares used for calculating diluted earnings per share because their exercise price was above the average share price for the year and they were, therefore, anti-dilutive.
