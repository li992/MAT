Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2012 60 Accounts Notes to the Accounts 1 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS The Board regularly reviews the Groups performance and balance sheet position for its entire operations, which are entirely based in its country of domicile, the UK, and receives financial information for the UK as a whole.
As a consequence the Group has one reportable segment which is UK housebuilding.
As there continues to be only one reportable segment whose revenue, profits, expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows are measured and reported on a basis consistent with the Group financial statements, no additional numerical disclosures are necessary.
Additional information on average selling prices and the unit sales split between north, south, private and social has been included in the Group Finance Directors Review on pages 22 to 25.
The Board does not, however, consider these categories to be separate reportable segments as they review the entire operations as a whole, which are based in the UK, when assessing performance and making decisions about the allocation of resources.

5 EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS Exceptional items are those which, in the opinion of the Board, are material by size or nature, non-recurring, and of such significance that they require separate disclosure on the face of the income statement.
A full review of inventories was performed at 31 July 2012 and the carrying value of land was compared to the net realisable value.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less all estimated costs of completion and attributable overheads.
Estimated selling prices were reviewed on a site by site basis and selling prices were amended based on local management and the Boards assessment of current market conditions.
No exceptional land write downs or land write backs were required as a result of this review.
There were no exceptional items in the year ended 31 July 2011.

The Chancellor has also proposed to further reduce the main rate of corporation tax to 22% by 1 April 2014, but this change was not substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and therefore is not included in the figures above.
The effective income tax charge is 24.7% of profit before tax 2011 25.3% and compares favourably to the Groups standard tax rate for the year of 25.3% 2011 27.3%.
The lower effective tax rate in the current year is principally due to finalisation of prior year corporation tax returns.

At the record date for the final dividend for the year ended 31 July 2011 shares were held by the Trust note 20 on which dividends had been waived.
Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2012 63 8 EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE Basic earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing earnings by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during theyear excluding the weighted average number of ordinary shares held by the employee share ownership plans which are treated ascancelled.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share uses the same earnings figure as the basic calculation except that the weighted average number of shares has been adjusted to reflect the dilutive effect of outstanding share options allocated under employee share schemes where the market value exceeds the option price.
It is assumed that all dilutive potential ordinary shares are converted at the beginning of the accounting period.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing earnings by the diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are outlined below: Earnings Weighted Earnings Earnings Weighted Earnings average per share average per share number of number of ordinary ordinary shares shares 2012 2012 2012 2011 2011 2011 000 Number p 000 Number p For basic earnings per ordinary share 79,258 121,036,846 65.5 50,144 120,705,397 41.5 Dilutive effect of options and awards 465,010 0.3 462,722 0.1 For diluted earnings per ordinary share 79,258 121,501,856 65.2 50,144 121,168,119 41.4 9 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Land and Plant, Total property fixtures and fittings 000 000 000 Group Cost At 1 August 2010 6,245 14,626 20,871 Additions 2,588 2,588 Disposals 1 2,153 2,154 At 1 August 2011 6,244 15,061 21,305 Additions 1,401 3,150 4,551 Disposals 1,706 1,706 Transfer to inventories 445 445 At 31 July 2012 7,200 16,505 23,705 Depreciation At 1 August 2010 1,097 11,558 12,655 Charge for year 140 1,552 1,692 On disposals 2,065 2,065 At 1 August 2011 1,237 11,045 12,282 Charge for year 145 1,651 1,796 On disposals 1,623 1,623 Transfer to inventories 157 157 At 31 July 2012 1,225 11,073 12,298 Net book value At 31 July 2012 5,975 5,432 11,407 At 31 July 2011 5,007 4,016 9,023 At 31 July 2010 5,148 3,068 8,216 Bellway p. l. c.

A formal internal valuation of investment properties was carried out at the end of the financial year.
The fair value of the investment properties was assessed at 10.615 million 2011 9.608 million.
The investment properties are primarily a proportion of the cost of residential units constructed by the Group, the units being sold under a shared ownership scheme.

In the ordinary course of business inventories have been written down by a net 14.7 million 2011 5.0 million in the year.
There has been no exceptional write down of inventories in the period 2011 nil as outlined in note 5.
Land with a carrying value of 56.4 million 2011 20.5 million was used as security for land payables note 17.
The directors consider all inventories to be essentially current in nature although the Groups operational cycle is such that aproportion of inventories will not be realised within twelve months.
It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this is subject to a number of issues including consumer demand and planning permission delays.
The Company has no inventory.
14 OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS 2012 2011 Group 000 000 At 1 August 33,491 32,664 Additions 2,559 6,305 Redemptions 857 904 Imputed interest 113 4,574 At 31 July 35,080 33,491 Other financial assets carried at fair value are categorised as level 3 within the hierarchical classification of IFRS 7 Revised as defined within the standard.
Other financial assets comprise loans, largely with non fixed repayment dates and variable repayment amounts, provided as part of sales transactions that are secured by way of a second legal charge on the related property.
The assets are recorded at fair value, being the estimated amount receivable by the Group, discounted to present day values.
The fair value of future anticipated cash receipts takes into account the directors view of future house price movements, the expected timing of receipts and the likelihood that a purchaser defaults on a repayment.
The directors revisit the future anticipated cash receipts from the assets at the end of each reporting period.
The difference between the anticipated future receipt and the initial fair value is charged over the estimated deferred term to cost of sales, with the financial asset increasing to its full expected cash settlement value on the anticipated receipt date.
The imputed interest charged to cost of sales for the year ended 31 July 2012 was 0.113 million 2011 4.574 million.
Credit risk, which the directors currently consider to be largely mitigated through holding a second legal charge over the assets, is accounted for in determining present values.
The directors review the financial assets for impairment at the end of each reporting period.
There were no indicators of impairment at 31 July 2012 2011 nil.
None of the other financial assets are past their due dates 2011 nil.
At initial recognition, the fair value of the assets is calculated using a discount rate, appropriate to the class of assets, which reflects market conditions at the date of entering into the transaction.
The directors consider at the end of each reporting period whether the initial market discount rate still reflects up to date market conditions.
If a revision is required, the fair value of the asset is re-measured at the present value of the revised future cash flows using this revised discount rate: the difference between this value and the carrying value of the asset is recorded against the carrying value of the asset and recognised directly in the statements of comprehensive income.
The directors considered that there was no material difference between the initial market discount rate and the market discount rate at 31July 2012 or 31 July 2011 and accordingly have not recognised any movements directly within the statements of comprehensive income todate.
The Company has no other financial assets.

18 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Groups financial instruments comprise cash, bank loans and overdrafts and various items such as trade receivables, other financial assets and trade payables that arise directly from its operations.
The main objective of the Groups policy towards financial instruments is to maximise returns on the Groups cash balances, manage the Groups working capital requirements and finance the Groups ongoing operations.
The Companys only financial instruments are cash and preference shares.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base to underpin the future development of the business in order to deliver value to shareholders.
The Group finances its operations through retained earnings, bank borrowings and the management of working capital.
From time to time, the trustees of the Bellway Employee Share Trust 1992 the Trust also purchase shares for the future satisfaction ofemployee share options.
Management of financial risk The main risks associated with the Groups financial instruments have been identified as credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk.
TheBoard is responsible for managing these risks and the policies adopted, which have remained largely unchanged during the year, areset out below.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk is limited by the fact that the Group generally receives cash at the point of legal completion of its sales.
There is no specific concentration of credit risk in respect of home sales as the exposure is spread over a number of customers.
Inrespect of trade receivables and other financial assets, the amounts presented in the balance sheet are stated after adjusting for any doubtful receivables, based on the judgement of the Groups management through using both previous experience and knowledge of the current position note 15.
In managing risk the Group assesses the credit risk of its counterparties before entering into atransaction.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period or subsequently and the Group does not anticipate any losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
In relation to land payables, certain payables are secured on the respective land asset held note 17.
No other security is held against any other financial assets of the Group.
The Board considers the Groups exposure to credit risk to be acceptable and normal for an entity of its size given the industry in which it operates.
Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2012 69 18 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Liquidity risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity comprising share capital, reserves and retained earnings and debt comprising bank overdraft facilities and borrowings.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by monitoring existing facilities and cash flows against forecast requirements based on a two year rolling cash forecast.
The Groups banking arrangements outlined below are considered to be adequate in terms of flexibility and liquidity for its medium-term cash flow needs therefore mitigating the Groups liquidity risk.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk reflects the Groups exposure to fluctuations in interest rates in the market.
The risk arises because the Groups overdraft and floating rate bank loans bear interest based on either LIBOR or the Bank of England base rate.
For the year ended 31 July 2012 it is estimated that an increase of 1% in interest rates applying for the full year would decrease the Groups profit before tax by 0.199 million 2011 0.057 million.
Housing market risk The Group is affected by movements in UK house prices.
These in turn are affected by factors such as credit availability, employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and supply of land with planning.
Whilst it is not possible for the Group to fully mitigate housing market risk on a national macroeconomic basis the Group does continually monitor its geographical spread within the UK, seeking to balance investment in areas offering the best immediate returns witha long-term spread of its operations throughout the UK to minimise the effect of local microeconomic fluctuations.
Land purchased on deferred terms The Group sometimes acquires land on deferred payment terms.
In accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, the deferred creditor is recorded at fairvalue being the price paid for the land discounted to present day.
The difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value is amortised over the deferred term to finance expenses, increasing the land creditor to its full cash settlement value on the payment date.
The maturity profile of the total contracted cash payments in respect of amounts due on land creditors at the balance sheet date isas follows: Balance at Total Within one 1-2 years 2-5 years More than 31 July contracted year or on 5 years cash payment demand 000 000 000 000 000 000 At 31 July 2012 120,591 126,783 90,088 20,538 14,862 1,295 At 31 July 2011 83,207 86,547 58,165 21,336 5,809 1,237 The maturity profile of the total contracted payments in respect of financial liabilities excluding amounts due on land creditors shown separately above is as follows: Balance at Total Within one 1-2 years 2-5 years More than 31 July contracted year or on 5 years cash payment demand 000 000 000 000 000 000 Bank loans floating rates 62,000 62,230 62,230 Preference shares 20,000 23,800 1,900 21,900 Trade and other payables 108,126 108,126 102,804 5,322 At 31 July 2012 190,126 194,156 166,934 21,900 5,322 Bank loans floating rates 80,000 82,441 15,990 25,780 40,671 Preference shares 20,000 25,700 1,900 1,900 21,900 Trade and other payables 114,752 114,752 109,970 4,782 At 31 July 2011 214,752 222,893 127,860 27,680 62,571 4,782 The interest rates on the preference shares apply to the whole term of the relevant instruments.
The imputed interest rate on land payables reflects market interest rates available to the Group on floating rate bank loans at the time of acquiring the land.
At the year end, the Group had 238.0 million 2011 210.0 million of undrawn bank facilities available.
The Companys only financial liabilities are preference shares as disclosed in the maturity profile above.

IFRS 2 has been applied to options granted after 7November 2002, which had not vested at 1 January 2005.
Awards under the LTIP have been made to executive directors and the Group Company Secretary, with awards under the annual bonus scheme also made to senior employees.
The awards take the form of ordinary shares in the Company.
Share options issued under the Bellway p. l. c. 1995 Employee Share Option Scheme 1995 ESOS have been granted to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors.
The last tranche of share options was awarded to directors in October 2003.
No further options may be granted under this scheme.
Options issued under the Bellway p. l. c. 1996 Employee Share Option Scheme 1996ESOS have been granted to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors.
The last tranche of share options was awarded to employees in May 2006.
The Bellway p. l. c. 2005 Employee Share Option Scheme 2005 ESOS replaces the 1995 ESOS.
Awards may be granted on a discretionary basis to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors and are subject to performance conditions.
The Bellway p. l. c. 2007 Employee Share Option Scheme 2007 ESOS replaces the 1996 ESOS.
It is an unapproved discretionary scheme which provides for the grant of options over ordinary shares to employees and executive directors.
It is, however, the current intention that no executive directors of the Company should be granted options under these schemes.
Awards will be available to vest after three years, subject to objective performance targets.
Options issued under the SRSOS are offered to all employees including the executive directors.
An outline of the performance conditions in relation to the LTIP is detailed under the long-term incentive scheme section on pages 41, 42 and 45 within the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration.
Various small share option awards were made for years 2003 through to 2007 to employees, mainly at divisional management level, under the term of the Deferred Bonus Plan DBP.
These shares are held in the Bellway Employee Share Trust 1992 normally for three years.
Theshares can then be transferred into the employees name.
Share-based payments have been valued by an external third party using various models detailed overleaf, based on publicly available market data at the time of the grant, which the directors consider to be the most appropriate method of determining their fair value.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 775.3p 2011 675.6p.
Valuation methodology For the LTIP options granted prior to 24 October 2011, a Monte Carlo simulation method was used which allows the Groups performance, in terms of TSR, to be measured againstits comparator companies.
Individual share price volatilities were calculated for each of the comparator companies.
A correlation assumption, appropriate to the building sector, was also used.
For options granted on 24 October 2011 half of the performance criteria isbased on TSR against comparator companies with the other half based on TSR measured against the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts and financial service companies.
A simplified Monte Carlo simulation method has been used to determine the Groups TSR performance against the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts and financial service companies.
In the case of the DBP, a simplified Black Scholes method is applied with an exercise price and dividend yield of zero.
This is because no performance conditions attach to the award and no dividends are credited to the individual.
The result is that the fair value equates to the face value of the award.
The Black Scholes method is used for the SRSOS due to the relatively short exercise window of six months.
Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2012 78 Accounts Notes to the Accounts continued 25 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS CONTINUED The fair value of services received in return for share options granted is measured by reference to the fair value of the share options granted.
