Provisions in respect of discontinued and disposed of businesses relate to estimated amounts payable in connection with onerous contracts and claims arising from disposals.
The final amount payable remains uncertain as, at the date of approval of these financial statements, there remains a further period during which claims may be received.
The timing of any settlement will depend upon the nature and extent of claims received.
Surplus provisions of nil 2011: 5 million were credited to the discontinued operations section of the income statement in the year.
Provisions for onerous contracts represent the liabilities in respect of short and long-term leases on unoccupied properties and other contracts lasting under five years.
Provisions for legal and other claims relate principally to provisions for the estimated cost of litigation and other sundry claims.
The timing of the settlement of these claims is uncertain.
Other provisions include environmental provisions.
These are in respect of potential liabilities relating to the Groups responsibility for maintaining its operating sites in accordance with statutory requirements and the Groups aim to have a low impact on the environment.
These provisions are expected to be utilised as operating sites are disposed of or as environmental matters are resolved.
Provisions for re-organisation include provision for redundancy costs.
Provisions are discounted to present value where the effect is material using the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
24 Post-employment benefit obligations Pension schemes operated The Group operates a number of pension arrangements throughout the world which have been developed in accordance with statutory requirements and local customs and practices.
The majority of schemes are self-administered and the schemes assets are held independently of the Groups assets.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
The Group makes employer contributions to the various schemes in existence within the range of 3% to 35% of pensionable salaries.
The contributions payable for defined contribution schemes of 77 million 2011: 58 million have been fully expensed against profits in the current year.
UK schemes Within the UK there are now two main arrangements following the merger of the two defined benefit arrangements: the Compass Group Pension Plan the Plan and the Compass Pension Scheme the Scheme, which took effect from 5 April 2011.
The combined arrangement continues to be known as the Plan.
The other continuing main arrangement is the Compass Retirement Income Savings Plan CRISP.
CRISP was launched on 1 February 2003.
This has been the main vehicle for pension provision for new joiners in the UK since that date but existing members of the Plan and the Scheme had continued to accrue benefits under those arrangements up until 5 April 2010.
CRISP is a contracted-in money purchase arrangement whereby the Group will match employee contributions up to 6% of pay minimum 3%.
Within CRISP a new defined contribution section was established from April 2006 known as the Compass Higher Income Plan CHIP.
Senior employees who contribute to CRISP will receive an additional employer-only contribution into CHIP.
The amount of contribution and eligibility for CHIP are decided annually at the Companys discretion.
The payment towards CHIP may be taken in part, or in whole, as a cash supplement instead of a pension contribution.
The Plan is a defined benefit arrangement.
It has been closed to new entrants since 2003 other than for transfers under public sector contracts where the Group is obliged to provide final salary benefits to transferring employees.
Such transferees enter into the GAD sections of the Plan GAD members.
On 5 April 2010, the Plan and Scheme closed to future accrual for all existing members, other than those within the special sections of the Plan and Scheme for GAD members.
The affected members were offered membership of CRISP from 6 April 2010.
Consolidated financial statements Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2012 107 I 24 Post-employment benefit obligations continued The Plan is operated on a pre-funded basis.
The funding policy is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as achieve a 100% funding level on a projected salary basis.
The actuarial assessments covering expenses and contributions are carried out by independent qualified actuaries.
A formal actuarial valuation of the Plan is carried out every three years.
The most recent valuations of the Plan and the Scheme were as at 5 April 2010.
The final results revealed a worsening in the funding positions since the previous valuations, although the effects of poor investment returns during the intervening period were lessened by the cautious investment strategy that has been set for these schemes.
Under the funding schedule agreed with the Plan and Scheme Trustees, the Group aimed to eliminate the 5 April 2010 deficit over the eight year period to 30 September 2018.
On the merger of the Plan and the Scheme an exceptional advance funding payment of 50 million was made by the Group to the Plan.
A revised funding schedule was agreed with the Plan Trustees whereby the previously agreed combined annual deficit recovery payments will remain unchanged until 30 September 2013.
The target remains to fully eliminate the 5 April 2010 deficit by 30 September 2018.
The next triennial valuation is due to be completed as at 5 April 2013.
The Plan is re-appraised annually by independent actuaries in accordance with IAS 19 Employee benefits requirements.
The Chairman, Tony Allen, is independent.
The other five Trustee Directors are UK-based employees of the Group, two of whom have been nominated by CRISP members.
A position for one further member nominated Trustee Director is vacant.
The Plan has a Corporate Trustee.
The Chairman, Peter Morriss and one other Trustee are independent.
There are a further five Trustee Directors who are UK-based employees or former employees of the Group, three of whom have been nominated by the Plan members.
The Company became subject to the Pensions Automatic Enrolment Regulations for its workforce in the UK on 1 November 2012 but in accordance with the Regulations has deferred its staging date for automatic enrolment of eligible employees to start from 2 January 2013 in order to ensure that adequate systems are in place and employees are not impacted over the Christmas period.
Both the Plan and CRISP are compliant arrangements under these Regulations and will be registered as such.
Employees who are not already in one of these registered compliant arrangements will be automatically enrolled into the National Employment Savings Trust NEST.
The decision to appoint NEST as the Companys partner for automatic enrolment was made following a comprehensive selection process and the Company considers that NEST will provide the right type of service, communication material and investment choice for our employees and that it has the capabilities to support a company as large and diverse as Compass.
Overseas schemes In the USA, the main plan is a defined benefit plan.
The funding policy, in accordance with government guidelines, is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as achieve a 100% funding level on a projected salary basis.
The Group made an exceptional advance funding payment of 10 million to this plan during the year to 30 September 2011.
In Canada, Norway and Switzerland the Group also participates in funded defined benefit arrangements.
In other countries, Group employees participate primarily in state arrangements to which the Group makes the appropriate contributions.
Other than where required by local regulation or statute, the defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants.
For these schemes the current service cost will increase under the projected unit credit method as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
In addition, the Group contributes to a number of multi-employer union sponsored pension plans, primarily in the USA.
These plans are accounted for as defined contribution plans, as the information provided by the plan administrators is insufficient for them to be accounted for as defined benefit plans.
The Group made total contributions of 9 million in the year 2011: 8 million to these arrangements.
All schemes Disclosures showing the assets and liabilities of the schemes are set out below.
108 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2012 I Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2012 24 Post-employment benefit obligations continued The mortality assumptions used to value the UK pension schemes are derived from the S1NA generational mortality tables with improvements in line with the projection model prepared by the Continuous Mortality Investigation of the UK actuarial profession, with no rating for males or females, with a long-term underpin of 1.25%.
These mortality assumptions take account of experience to date, and assumptions for further improvements in the life expectancy of scheme members.
Examples of the resulting life expectancies are as follows: 2012 2011 Life expectancy at 65 years Male Female Male Female Member aged 65 in 2012 2011 22.4 24.8 21.1 23.9 Member aged 65 in 2032 2031 24.1 26.8 23.0 25.8 Life expectancies disclosed in the 2011 Annual Report for UK members were based on the Compass-specific weighted average ages for non-pensioners and pensioners.
The other demographic assumptions have been set having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data.
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of pension schemes.
For the overseas schemes, regionally appropriate assumptions have been used where recommended by local actuaries.
For US schemes, examples of the resulting life expectancies are as follows: 2012 2011 Life expectancy at 65 years Male Female Male Female Member aged 65 in 2012 2011 19.1 21.0 19.0 20.9 Analysis of the fair value of plan assets and the expected rates of return The expected rates of return on individual categories of plan assets are determined after taking advice from external experts and using available market data, for example, by reference to relevant equity and bond indices published by stock exchanges.
The overall rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the respective investment portfolio of each plan.
