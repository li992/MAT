Unless otherwise stated references to Group should be considered toapply to the Company as well.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for risk management of the Group.
The Board has established the Risk Committee which has the delegated task of overseeing the Boards responsibility with respect to risk and internal control.
TheRisk Committee reports to the Audit Committee on a regular basis.
The Risk Committee is supported in this task by the Group Risk management function.
The Group Risk function performs anannual assessment of the risks faced by the Group.
This assessment is used to drive a risk focused programme of work aimed to improve business processes and increase internal control effectiveness.. BSLFU SJTL Market risk represents the potential for changes in foreign exchange prices and interest rates to affect the Groups profit and thevalue of its financial instruments.
It also incorporates the effect of the overall UK housing market on the Group.
The Groups objective in market risk management is to minimise its exposures to fluctuations within such variables whilst optimising returns.
The Group has previously entered into a number of hedge derivative arrangements to limit its exposure to these risks, particularly exchange risk.
TheGroup enters into such transactions only as part of periodic wider refinancing undertakings totake advantage of the mature private placement markets in other countries notably the USA and only with the approval ofthe Board of Directors.
The Group applied a hedge accounting to these arrangements in order to minimise income statement volatility.
Following the repayment of all private placement loan notes during 2011 see note 6 the Group no longer has any significant exposure to foreign exchange risk.
All hedge derivative arrangements were terminated on repayment of these loannotes.
$VSSFODZ SJTL The Group has in previous years issued loan notes denominated in US Dollars and Euros.
The currency risk of these instruments was offset by hedging arrangements entered into on issue of these loan notes, effectively swapping them intoSterling on issue.
All such loan notes were repaid during 2011 and the related hedges cancelled see note 6.
The Group also has investments in a number of Portuguese jointly controlled entities.
These interests are not hedged.
Theseinvestments are considered to be long term in nature.
The Group has no other significant currency exposures.

OUFSFTU SBUF SJTL The Group currently holds no fixed interest borrowings.
This reflects both the low borrowing requirements of the Group and the current low interest rates applicable to floating borrowings.
The Group has no formal target for a ratio of fixed to floating funding.
The responsibility for setting the level of fixed rate debt lies with the Board of Directors and is continually reviewed inthe light of economic data provided by a variety of sources.
The relative fixed floating balance of net debt, after consideration of hedging arrangements, is as follows: SPVQ $PNQBOZ bN bN bN bN 'JYFE SBUF o o o 'MPBUJOH SBUF FU DBTI EFCU 4FOTJUJWJUZ BOBMZTJT If in the year ended 31 December 2012 UK interest rates had been 0.5% higher lower then the Groups pre-tax profit would have increased decreased by 0.3m 2011: decreased increased by 0.3m.
The Groups post-tax profit would have increased decreased by 0.2m 2011:decreased increased by 0.2m.
These sensitivities have been prepared in respect of the direct impact of such an interest rate change on the net financing expense of financial instruments only, and do not attempt to estimate the indirect effect such a change may have on wider economic environment such as house pricing, mortgage availability and exchange rates.

These in turn are affected by factors such as credit availability, employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and supply of land with planning.
Whilst it is not possible for the Group to fully mitigate such risks on a national macroeconomic basis the Group does continually monitor its geographical spread within the UK, seeking to balance its investment in areas offering the best immediate returns with a long term spread of its operations throughout the UK to minimise the risk of local microeconomic fluctuations.
The Group has taken steps to control its speculative build, land acquisition activities and work in progress levels so as to manage the exposure of the Group to any further market disruption.
4FOTJUJWJUZ BOBMZTJT At 31 December 2012, if UK house prices had been 5% higher lower, and all other variables were held constant, the Groups house price linked financial instruments, which are solely available for sale financial assets, would increase decrease in value, excluding any effects of current or deferred tax, by 10.1m 2011: 8.2m.
-JRVJEJUZ SJTL Liquidity risk reflects the risk that the Group will have insufficient resources to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups strategy to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that the Group has sufficient liquid funds to meet all its potential liabilities as they fall due.
This is true not only of normal market conditions but also of negative projections against expected outcomes, so as to avoid any risk of incurring contractual penalties or damaging the Groups reputation, which would in turn reduce the Groups ability to borrow at optimal rates.
Therefore the Group remains confident of its continued compliance with financial covenants under the syndicated loan even in the event of further deterioration in market conditions.
The Group has entered into a number of deferred payment guarantees and performance bonds in the normal course of operations.
Theliabilities to which these guarantees relate are recognised and accounted for in accordance with our standard accounting policies.
Liquidity forecasts are produced on i a daily basis to ensure that utilisation of current facilities is optimised: ii a monthly basis to ensure that covenant compliance targets and medium term liquidity is maintained and iii a long term projection basis for the purpose of identifying long term strategic funding requirements.
The Directors also continually assess the balance of capital and debt funding of the Group.
They consider the security of capital funding against the potentially higher rates of return offered by debt financing in order to set an efficient but stable balance appropriate to the size oftheGroup.
The Group operates short term uncommitted overdraft facilities to meet day to day liquidity requirements.
These facilities arecancellable onrequest from the bank: however the Group generally maintains low levels of borrowing on these in favour ofmore cost efficient facilities.
These overdraft facilities are provided by five leading clearing banks to minimise exposure to any one lender.
The Group maintains a 300m revolving credit facility committed to March 2016.
These committed facilities are sufficient tomeet projected liquidity requirements to this date.
Undrawn committed facilities at the reporting date amount to 300m 2011:300m.
$BTI EFQPTJUT The Group has a policy of ensuring cash deposits are made with the primary objective of security of principal.
Accordingly deposits are made only with approved, respected, high credit rating financial institutions.
Deposits are spread across such institutions to minimise exposure to any single entity and are made on a short term basis only to preserve liquidity.

The Groups objective in managing capital is primarily to ensure the continued ability of theGroup to meet its liabilities as they fall due whilst alsomaintaining an appropriate balance of equity and borrowings and minimising costs of capital.
Close control of deployment of capital is maintained by detailed management review procedures for authorisation of significant capital commitments, such as land acquisition, capital targets for local management and asystem of internal interest recharges, ensuring capital cost impact is understood and considered by all management tiers.
Decisions regarding the balance of equity and borrowings, dividend policy and all major borrowing facilities are reserved for the Board.
The Group is currently pursuing a strategy of capital return to shareholders, whilst at the same time building a stronger, larger business, as announced on 28 February 2012.

In the majority of cases the full cash receipt for each sale occurs on legal completion, which is also the point of revenue recognition under the Groups accounting policies.
In certain specific circumstances the Group has entered into shared equity arrangements not applicable to the Company.
Thepressures of recent market conditions necessitated an increase in this form of sales structure from 2008 onwards.
In such cases the long term debt is secured upon the property concerned.
The Group does not recognise collateral rights as a separate asset, nor does it have rights to trade such collateral.
Reductions in property values leads to an increase in the credit risk oftheGroup in respect of such sales.
There was 0.5m requirement for a charge in relation to credit impairment in the year 2011: nil.
