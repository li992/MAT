Provisions continued  BP considers that it is not possible, at this time, to measure reliably any obligation in relation to Natural Resource Damages claims under OPA 90 other than the estimated costs of the assessment phase and the costs of early restoration agreements referred to above.
It is also not possible to measure reliably any obligation in relation to business economic loss claims under the PSC settlement not yet received or processed by the DHCSSP, or any other potential litigation including through excluded parties from the PSC settlement and any obligation in relation to other potential private or governmental litigation, fines, or penalties, other than as described above.
These items are therefore disclosed as contingent liabilities see Note 43 for further information.
The total amounts that will ultimately be paid by BP in relation to all obligations relating to the incident are subject to significant uncertainty and the ultimate exposure and cost to BP will be dependent on many factors.
Furthermore, significant uncertainty exists in relation to the amount of claims that will become payable by BP, the amount of fines that will ultimately be levied on BP including any determination of BPs culpability based on any findings of negligence, gross negligence or wilful misconduct, the outcome of litigation and arbitration proceedings, and any costs arising from any longer-term environmental consequences of the oil spill, which will also impact upon the ultimate cost for BP.
The amount and timing of any amounts payable could also be impacted by any further settlements which may or may not occur.
Although the provision recognized is the current best reliable estimate of expenditures required to settle certain present obligations at the end of the reporting period, there are future expenditures for which it is not possible to measure the obligation reliably described further in Note 43.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits Most group companies have pension plans, the forms and benefits of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benefits may be provided through defined contribution plans money purchase schemes or defined benefit plans final salary and other types of schemes with committed pension payments.
For defined contribution plans, retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee.
For defined benefit plans, retirement benefits are based on such factors as the employees pensionable salary and length of service.
Defined benefit plans may be externally funded or unfunded.
The assets of funded plans are generally held in separately administered trusts.
In particular, the primary pension arrangement in the UK is a funded final salary pension plan under which retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity.
With effect from 1 April 2010, BP closed its UK plan to new joiners other than some of those joining the North Sea business.
The plan remains open to ongoing accrual for those employees who had joined BP on or before 31 March 2010.
The majority of new joiners in the UK have the option to join a defined contribution plan.
In the US, a range of retirement arrangements is provided.
This includes a funded final salary pension plan for certain heritage employees and a cash balance arrangement for new hires.
Retired US employees typically take their pension benefit in the form of a lump sum payment.
US employees are also eligible to participate in a defined contribution 401k plan in which employee contributions are matched with company contributions.
The level of contributions to funded defined benefit plans is the amount needed to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due.
During 2012, contributions of $884 million 2011 $429 million and 2010 $411 million and $153 million 2011 $777 million and 2010 $694 million were made to the UK plans and US plans respectively.
In addition, contributions of $238 million 2011 $223 million and 2010 $188 million were made to other funded defined benefit plans.
The aggregate level of contributions in 2013 is expected to be approximately $1,250 million, and includes contributions in all countries that we expect to be required to make by law or under contractual agreements as well as an allowance for discretionary funding.
Certain group companies, principally in the US, provide post-retirement healthcare and life insurance benefits to their retired employees and dependants.
The entitlement to these benefits is usually based on the employee remaining in service until retirement age and completion of a minimum period of service.
The plans are funded to a limited extent.
The obligation and cost of providing pensions and other post-retirement benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method.
The date of the most recent actuarial review was 31 December 2012.
The groups principal plans are subject to a formal actuarial valuation every three years in the UK, with valuations being required more frequently in many other countries.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the UK pension plans was as at 31 December 2011.
The material financial assumptions used for estimating the benefit obligations of the various plans are set out below.
The assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year, and are used to evaluate accrued pension and other post-retirement benefits at 31 December.
The same assumptions are used to determine pension and other post-retirement benefit expense for the following year, that is, the assumptions at 31 December 2012 are used to determine the pension liabilities at that date and the pension expense for 2013.

The inflation rate assumptions for our UK and US plans are based on the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds.
In other countries we use either this approach, or the central bank inflation target, or advice from the local actuary depending on the information that is available to us.
The inflation assumptions are used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions where there is such an increase.
Financial statements 239 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2012 37.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued Our assumptions for the rate of increase in salaries are based on our inflation assumption plus an allowance for expected long-term real salary growth.
These include allowance for promotion-related salary growth, of between 0.3% and 1.0% depending on country.
In addition to the financial assumptions, we regularly review the demographic and mortality assumptions.
The mortality assumptions reflect best practice in the countries in which we provide pensions, and have been chosen with regard to the latest available published tables adjusted where appropriate to reflect the experience of the group and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future.
BPs most substantial pension liabilities are in the UK, the US and Germany where our mortality assumptions are as follows: Years Mortality assumptions UK US Germany 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2010 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 60 27.7 27.6 26.1 24.9 24.8 24.7 23.6 23.5 23.3 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 40 30.6 30.5 29.1 26.3 26.3 26.2 26.5 26.3 26.2 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 60 29.4 29.3 28.7 26.4 26.4 26.3 28.2 28.0 27.9 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 40 32.1 32.0 31.6 27.3 27.3 27.2 30.8 30.7 30.6 Our assumption for future US healthcare cost trend rate for the first year after the reporting date reflects the rate of actual cost increases seen in recent years.
The ultimate trend rate reflects our long-term expectations of the level at which cost inflation will stabilize based on past healthcare cost inflation seen over a longer period of time.
The assumed future US healthcare cost trend rate assumptions are as follows: % 2012 2011 2010 First years US healthcare cost trend rate 7.3 7.6 7.8 Ultimate US healthcare cost trend rate 5.0 5.0 5.0 Year in which ultimate trend rate is reached 2020 2020 2018 Pension plan assets are generally held in trusts.
The primary objective of the trusts is to accumulate pools of assets sufficient to meet the obligations of the various plans.
The assets of the trusts are invested in a manner consistent with fiduciary obligations and principles that reflect current practices in portfolio management.
A significant proportion of the assets are held in equities, owing to a higher expected level of return over the long term with an acceptable level of risk.
In order to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security has an unwarranted impact on the total portfolio, the investment portfolios are highly diversified.
The long-term asset allocation policy for the major plans is as follows: % Asset category UK US Other Total equity 73 70 17-62 Bonds cash 20 30 25-75 Property real estate 7 0-10 Some of the groups pension plans use derivative financial instruments as part of their asset mix and to manage the level of risk.
The groups main pension plans do not invest directly in either securities or property real estate of the company or of any subsidiary.
Return on asset assumptions reflect the groups expectations built up by asset class and by plan.
The groups expectation is derived from a combination of historical returns over the long term and the forecasts of market professionals.
Our assumption for return on equities is based on a long-term view, and the size of the resulting equity risk premium over government bond yields is reviewed each year for reasonableness.
Our assumption for return on bonds reflects the portfolio mix of government fixed-interest, index-linked and corporate bonds.
Return on asset assumptions at 31 December each year have been used to date in the determination of the pension expense for the following year.
However, with effect from 1 January 2013, the group will adopt an amended version of IAS 19 Employee Benefits, under which the amount credited to the income statement reflecting the return on pension assets will be calculated by applying the discount rate used to measure the obligation, and will therefore be based on a lower corporate bond rate see Note 1 under Impact of new International Financial Reporting Standards for further information.
Under the amended IAS 19, net finance income relating to pensions and other post-retirement benefits, and profit before taxation, would have been approximately $0.8 billion and $0.7 billion lower for 2012 and 2011 respectively, with corresponding pre-tax increases in other comprehensive income.
The impact on the groups 2013 profit before taxation is expected to be approximately $1.0 billion.
This change has no impact on the balance sheet and no impact on past or expected future cash flows.
The expected long-term rates of return at 31 December 2012 are therefore not presented in the table below.
Instead, the table presents the interest rate assumptions at 31 December 2012, which are equal to the discount rate assumptions for plan liabilities as noted above and which will be used in the determination of the pension expense for 2013.
For 2011 and 2010, the expected long-term rates of return and market values of the various categories of assets held by the defined benefit plans at 31 December are presented.
The market values include the effects of derivative financial instruments.
The amounts classified as equities include investments in companies listed on stock exchanges as well as unlisted investments.
Movements in the value of plan assets during the year are shown in detail in the table on page 242.
240 Financial statements BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2012 Financial statements 37.
The market value of private equity investments at 31 December 2012 was $4,354 million 2011 $4,099 million and 2010 $3,348 million.
The equity return assumption shown above for 2011 and 2010 is the weighted average of the assumed returns for listed and private equity assets in each fund.
The discount rate, inflation, US healthcare cost trend rate and the mortality assumptions all have a significant effect on the amounts reported.
A one-percentage point change in the following assumptions as at 31 December 2012 for the groups plans would have had the effects shown in the table below.
The effects shown for the expense in 2013 include current service cost and net finance income or expense.
