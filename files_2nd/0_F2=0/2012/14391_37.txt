8 Post-retirement benets The Company operates three dened benefit plans in the UK.
The largest of them is a funded scheme with assets held in a separate trusteeadministered fund.
The Company is the sole employer in that scheme and, accordingly, accounts for it as a dened benefit pension plan, in accordance with FRS 17.
The UK dened benefit pension schemes were closed with effect from 31 October 2009.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualied actuaries.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the funded scheme was performed using the Projected Unit Method as at 31 March 2009.
This valuation has been updated by independent qualied actuaries in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme as at 31 July 2012.
The triennial valuation of the scheme at 31 March 2012 is in progress.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values.
Contributions to the schemes are made on the advice of the actuaries.
The principal assumptions used in updating the valuations are set out below: 31 July 2012 31 July 2011 Rate of increase in salaries n a n a Rate of increase for active deferred members 3.7% 4.4% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.8% 3.5% Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.8% 3.5% Discount rate 4.1% 5.3% Ination rate 2.8% 3.5% Healthcare cost increases 5.0% 5.0% The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
The mortality assumptions used are based on the recent actual mortality experience of members.
The assumptions are based on the new SAPS All birth year tables with relevant scaling factors based on the experience of the schemes.
The assumption also allows for future improvements in life expectancy in line with the 2011 CMI projections blended to a long term rate of 1%.
The assumptions give the following: Expected further years of life UK Male Female Member who retires next year at age 65 23 25 Member, currently 45, when they retire in 20 years time 24 26 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2012 142 8 Post-retirement benets continued The assets in the scheme and the expected rates of return as at 31 July 2012 were: 31 July 2012 31 July 2011 Long-term Value Long-term Value rate of return m rate of return m Equities 7.2% 720.0 7.9% 732.9 Government bonds 2.5% 4.9 3.9% 16.7 Corporate bonds 4.1% 81.3 5.3% 173.5 Property 6.8% 176.7 7.5% 176.0 Other 2.9% 430.0 4.1% 339.8 Total market value 1,412.9 1,438.9 Present value of funded pension scheme liabilities 1,687.8 1,538.9 deficit 274.9 100.0 Unfunded pension plans 46.1 40.2 Post-retirement healthcare 9.2 8.5 Net retirement benefit liability 330.2 148.7 The scheme assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, nor other assets used by, the Group.
