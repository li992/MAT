A. UK SCHEMES The Group operates five main defined benefit pension schemes in the UK, namely the Inchcape Group UK Pension Scheme, the Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme, the Inchcape Cash Pension Scheme, the Inchcape Overseas Pension Scheme and the TKM Group Pension Scheme.
These schemes, further details of which are provided below, have assets held in trust in separately administered funds.
The Group also has some minor unfunded arrangements relating to post-retirement health and medical plans in respect of past employees.
There are no material defined contribution schemes in the UK.
During the year, the Group commenced a consultation process with members and trustees of the Inchcape Group UK Pension Scheme and the Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme on a proposal that both schemes be closed to future accrual with effect from 31 December 2012.
The proposal was confirmed by the Group on 21 December 2012 and active members ceased to accrue benefits under the schemes with effect from 31 December 2012.
This change gave rise to an exceptional item in the Groups income statement for the year ended 31 December 2012 see note 2.
At the same time, the Group introduced a new defined benefit pension scheme in the UK under which members accrue a percentage of their earnings each year, a sum which then grows to provide a lump sum payment on retirement.
Members accrue benefits under this scheme with effect from 1 January 2013.
During the year, amendments were also made to certain scheme rules which clarified the Groups right to any surplus.
This resulted in a previously unrecognised surplus of 72.9m being recognised in the year.
INCHCAPE GROUP UK PENSION SCHEME CLOSED SCHEME The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2012 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit method.
The scheme was closed to future accrual with effect from 31 December 2012.
The investment strategy is to hold a broadly balanced portfolio of diversified growth funds and bonds.
INCHCAPE MOTORS PENSION SCHEME CLOSED SCHEME The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2012 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit method.
The investment strategy is to hold a broadly balanced portfolio of equities, diversified growth funds and bonds.
INCHCAPE CASH PENSION SCHEME This scheme is a new defined benefit scheme under which members accrue benefits with effect from 1 January 2013.
INCHCAPE OVERSEAS PENSION SCHEME This scheme is managed from Guernsey and is therefore reported under the United Kingdom in this note.
The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2012 and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit method.
A significant majority of the schemes members are pensioners and deferred pensioners.
Investments are held in a balanced portfolio of equities and bonds.
TKM GROUP PENSION SCHEME CLOSED SCHEME The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this closed scheme was carried out at 5 April 2010 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit method.
The scheme has a prudent investment strategy and the majority of the assets are invested in bonds, cash or gilts.
Approximately half the members are pensioners and half are deferred pensioners and as such no further pension accrual arises.
OVERSEAS SCHEMES There are a number of smaller defined benefit schemes overseas, the most significant being the Inchcape Motors Limited Retirement Scheme in Hong Kong.
In general these schemes offer a lump sum on retirement with no further obligation to the employee and assets held in trust in separately administered funds.
These schemes are typically subject to triennial valuations.
The overseas defined contribution schemes are principally linked to local statutory arrangements.
C. DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement is 4.8m 2011 5.0m.
There are no outstanding contributions to the defined contribution schemes at the year end 2011 nil.
D. DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS As the Groups principal defined benefit schemes are in the UK, these have been reported separately to the overseas schemes.
For the purposes of reporting, actuarial updates have been obtained for the Groups material schemes and these updates are reflected in the amounts reported in the following tables.

Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on published statistics and experience.
For the UK schemes, the average life expectancy of a pensioner retiring at age 65 is 23.0 years 2011 22.9 years for current pensioners and 25.4 years 2011 25.3 years for current non pensioners.
Most of the overseas schemes only offer a lump sum on retirement and therefore mortality assumptions are not applicable.
The expected return on plan assets is based on the weighted average expected return on each type of asset principally equities, bonds and diversified growth funds.
The overall expected return on plan assets is determined based on the expected real rates of return on equities, expected yields on bonds and expected returns on the diversified growth funds applicable to the period over which the obligation is to be settled.

com 99 Notes to the accounts continued 11 INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED A.
GOODWILL Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
These are independent sources of income streams and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes.
This may be at country, regional or brand level.
Following the acquisition of the non-controlling interest in the Musa Motors group in 2011, the Inchcape Olimp and Musa Motors businesses have been integrated under a single management structure.
As a consequence, the lowest level at which goodwill is now monitored for management purposes is at the total Russia level.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to the following operating segments: 2012 2011 m m United Kingdom 262.1 262.3 Russia and Emerging Markets 217.6 210.0 South Asia 20.5 20.2 Australasia 9.5 9.8 509.7 502.3 Goodwill is subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently where there are indications that the goodwill may be impaired.
Impairment tests were performed for all CGUs during the year ended 31 December 2012.
The recoverable amounts of all CGUs were determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on five year financial forecasts prepared by management.
The key assumptions for these forecasts are those relating to revenue growth decline, operating margins and the level of working capital required to support trading, which have been based on past experience, recent trading and expectations of future changes in the relevant markets.
They also reflect expectations about continuing relationships with key brand partners.
Cash flows after the five year period are extrapolated at an estimated average long-term growth rate for each market.
These growth rates reflect the long-term growth prospects of the markets in which the CGUs operate.
The growth rates used vary between 2% and 5% and are consistent with appropriate external sources for the relevant markets.
Cash flows are discounted back to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate.
The discount rate assumptions are based on an estimate of the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for a risk premium attributable to the relevant CGU.
The pre-tax discount rates used vary between 10% and 13%, and reflect long-term country risk.
100 Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 11 INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED The assumptions used with regards to pre-tax discount rates and long-term growth rates in those segments with material goodwill balances were as follows: Long-term Discount rate growth rate United Kingdom 10% 2% Russia and Emerging Markets 11% to 13% 5% South Asia 10% 2% Australasia 12% 2% IMPAIRMENT An impairment charge of 0.2m has been recognised in the year ended 31 December 2012 2011 nil relating to sites that are to be sold or closed.
SENSITIVITIES The Groups value in use calculations are sensitive to a change in the key assumptions used, most notably the discount rates and the long-term growth rates.
With the exception of the Groups businesses in Russia and Lithuania, a reasonably possible change in a key assumption will not cause a material impairment of goodwill in any of the other CGUs.
The Groups goodwill in the Russia and Emerging Markets segment at 31 December 2012 is allocated as follows: Impairment Net book Cost provision value m m m Russia 194.1 194.1 Latvia 43.2 43.2 Lithuania 21.0 21.0 Other 2.7 0.2 2.5 At 31 December 2012 261.0 43.4 217.6 The value in use calculations for the Groups business in Russia currently exceed the carrying value by approximately 20%.
A 0.5% increase in the discount rate or a 0.5% reduction in the long-term growth rate would reduce the headroom available to approximately 10% of the carrying value.
The value in use calculations for the Groups business in Lithuania currently exceed the carrying value by approximately 10%.
A 0.5% increase in the discount rate or a 0.5% reduction in the long-term growth rate would reduce the headroom available to approximately 5% of the carrying value.

No deferred tax is recognised on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures.
The vast majority of overseas reserves can now be repatriated to the UK with no tax cost.
There are a small number of territories that do not qualify for this treatment but the annual profits for these territories are self assessed for UK current tax each year and hence no deferred tax accrues.
If all overseas earnings were repatriated with immediate effect, no tax charge 2011 nil would be payable.
The 13.1m 2011 12.7m deferred tax liability for provisions and other timing differences consists of a 31.1m 2011 32.0m liability in respect of the net book value of property, plant and equipment that do not qualify for tax allowances and property revaluations, and a 18.0m 2011 19.3m deferred tax asset in respect of provisions and other temporary differences between the accounts base and the tax base.

MARKET RISK AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being primarily UK interest rates and the Australian Dollar to Japanese Yen exchange rate.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges from movements in interest rates are assumed to be recorded fully in equity: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges from movements in interest rates have an immaterial effect on the consolidated income statement and equity due to compensating adjustments in the carrying value of debt: changes in the carrying value of financial instruments designated as net investment hedges from movements in the US Dollar to Sterling exchange rate are recorded directly in equity: changes in the carrying value of financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the consolidated income statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the consolidated income statement.
C. INTEREST RATE RISK AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The Groups interest rate policy has the objective of minimising net interest expense, and protecting the Group from material adverse movements in interest rates.
Throughout 2012 the Group has borrowed at floating rates only after taking into account existing interest rate hedging activities.
This approach maximises the Groups exposure to the current low interest rate environment.
If hedging is deemed appropriate by management in the future, the Board has approved the fixing of up to 30% of gross borrowings.
Instruments approved for this purpose include interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options.
The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates arises primarily from the floating rate interest payable on the Groups 10 and 12 year loan notes, bank borrowings, supplier related finance and the returns available on surplus cash.
INTEREST RATE RISK TABLE The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact of floating rate borrowings.
Increase Effect on profit in basis before tax points m 2012 Sterling 75 3.1 Euro 50 0.1 Russian Ruble 50 0.2 Australian Dollar 100 1.2 2011 Sterling 75 3.9 Euro 50 0.1 Russian Ruble 50 0.1 Australian Dollar 100 1.1 112 Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 23 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED D. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Group publishes its consolidated Financial Statements in Sterling and faces currency risk on the translation of its earnings and net assets, a significant proportion of which are in currencies other than Sterling.
TRANSACTION EXPOSURE HEDGING The Group has transactional currency exposures, where sales or purchases by an operating unit are in currencies other than that units reporting currency.
For a significant proportion of the Group these exposures are removed as trading is denominated in the relevant local currency.
In particular, local billing arrangements are in place for many of our businesses with our brand partners.
The principal exception is for our business in Australia which purchases vehicles in Japanese Yen.
In this instance, the Group seeks to hedge forecast transactional foreign exchange rate risk using forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income to the extent it is effective and recycled into the consolidated income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the consolidated income statement.
Under IAS 39 hedges are documented and tested for hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis.
HEDGE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY DEBT The Group uses cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the forward foreign currency risk associated with the US$436m Private Placement.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the consolidated income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the consolidated income statement.
NET INVESTMENT HEDGING Consideration is given to the currency mix of debt with the primary objective that interest on such borrowings acts as a hedge on foreign currency earnings.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK TABLE The following table shows the Group sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates on its Japanese Yen financial instruments.
In this table, financial instruments are only considered sensitive to foreign exchange rates when they are not in the functional currency of the entity that holds them.

com 113 Notes to the accounts continued 23 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED E. CREDIT RISK The amount due from counterparties arising from cash deposits and the use of financial instruments creates credit risk.
The Group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties via their credit ratings where applicable and through its policy of limiting its exposure to any one party to ensure that they are within Board approved limits and that there are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Group policy is to deposit cash and use financial instruments with counterparties with a long-term credit rating of A or better, where available.
The notional amounts of financial instruments used in interest rate and foreign exchange management do not represent the credit risk arising through the use of these instruments.
The immediate credit risk of these instruments is generally estimated by the fair value of contracts with a positive value.
Credit limits are reviewed regularly.
The table below analyses the Groups short-term deposits and derivative assets by credit exposure excluding bank balances and cash in hand: 2012 2011 Derivative Short-term Derivative Short-term assets deposits assets deposits 1 m m m m Credit rating of counterparty AAA 68.4 AA- 0.1 54.6 2.7 72.9 A 59.4 47.3 73.8 21.6 A 55.6 35.9 38.0 A- 1.0 41.2 63.2 14.9 2 BBB 8.5 2 CCC 0.2 9.0 3 No rating 17.4 16.9 116.1 273.5 139.7 173.3 1 Standard & Poors equivalent rating shown as a reference for the lowest credit rating of the counterparty from either Standard & Poors or Moodys.
2 Exposure to a counterparty approved as an exception to Group policy.
3 Counterparties in certain markets in which the Group operates do not have a credit rating.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period and management does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for cash at bank, receivables and other financial assets is represented by their carrying amount.
Total cash at bank of 324.4m 2011 385.6m includes cash in the Groups regional pooling arrangements which are offset against borrowings for interest purposes.
Netting of cash and overdraft balances in the consolidated statement of financial position only occurs to the extent that there is the legal ability and intention to settle net.
As such, overdrafts are presented in current liabilities to the extent that there is no intention to offset with the cash balance.
Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is very limited due to the Groups broad customer base.
Trade receivables include amounts due from a number of finance houses in respect of vehicles sold to customers on finance arranged through the Group.
An independent credit rating agency is used to assess the credit standing of each finance house.
Limits for the maximum outstanding with each finance house are set accordingly.
Title to the vehicles sold on finance resides with the Group until cleared funds are received from the finance house in respect of a given vehicle.
114 Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 23 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED F. LIQUIDITY RISK Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.

com 115 Notes to the accounts continued 23 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED G. HEDGING ACTIVITIES In accordance with IFRS 7 disclosure is required for financial instruments that are measured in the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value.
This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level for the following fair value measurement hierarchy: quoted prices in active markets level 1 : inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly level 2 : or inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data level 3.
The following table presents the Groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value: 2012 2011 Level 1 Level 2 Total Level 1 Level 2 Total m m m m m m Assets Derivatives used for hedging 116.1 116.1 139.7 139.7 Available for sale financial assets 6.7 6.7 6.1 6.1 6.7 116.1 122.8 6.1 139.7 145.8 Liabilities Derivatives used for hedging 62.6 62.6 7.4 7.4 Level 1 represents the fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets and is based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market level 2 is determined by using valuation techniques which include the present value of estimated future cash flows.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at their fair values.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps represents the difference between the value of the outstanding contracts at their contracted rates and a valuation calculated using the spot rates of exchange prevailing at 31 December 2012.
The Groups derivative financial instruments comprise the following: Assets Liabilities 2012 2011 2012 2011 m m m m Cross currency interest rate swap 111.8 125.1 Forward foreign exchange contracts 4.3 14.6 62.6 7.4 116.1 139.7 62.6 7.4 The ineffective portion recognised in the consolidated income statement that arises from fair value hedges amounts to a gain of 4.8m 2011 loss of 2.4m.
The ineffective portion recognised in the consolidated income statement that arises from cash flow hedges amounts to a gain of nil 2011 nil.
116 Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 23 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED CASH FLOW HEDGES The Group principally uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge purchases in a non-functional currency against movements in exchange rates.
The cash flows relating to these contracts are generally expected to occur within 15 months of the end of the reporting period 2011 12 months.
The nominal principal amounts of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts relating to transactional exposures at 31 December 2012 was 955.9m 2011 520.1m.
Net fair value gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in shareholders equity see note 25 on forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2012 are expected to be released to the consolidated income statement within 15 months of the end of the reporting period 2011 12 months.
FAIR VALUE HEDGE At 31 December 2012, the Group had in place five cross currency interest rate swaps.
Four of these total US$475m which hedge changes in the fair value of the Groups 10 and 12 year loan notes.
Under these swaps the Group receives fixed rate US Dollar interest of 5.94% on US$275m and 6.04% on US$200m and pays LIBOR 85bps and LIBOR 90bps for the 10 and 12 year notes respectively.
An additional US$39.2m cross currency interest rate swap was put in place after debt reduction in 2009 to offset the non-required portion of the original US$475m swaps.
Under this swap the Group pays US Dollar interest of 6.04% on US$39.2m and receives LIBOR 214bps for the 12 year notes only.
The loan notes and cross currency interest rate swaps have the same critical terms.
H. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The Groups capital structure consists of equity and debt.
Equity represents funds raised from shareholders and debt represents funds raised from banks and other financial institutions.
The primary objective of the Groups management of debt and equity is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to finance the Groups activities, both now and in the future, and to maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Directors consider the Groups capital structure and dividend policy at least twice a year prior to the announcement of results, taking into account the Groups ability to continue as a going concern and the requirements of its business plan.
The committed bank facilities and Private Placement borrowings are subject to the same interest cover covenant based on an adjusted EBITA measure to interest on consolidated borrowings.
The Group is required to maintain a ratio of not less than three to one and was compliant with this covenant throughout the year.
The Group monitors group leverage by reference to three tests: Adjusted EBITA interest cover, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and the ratio of net debt to market capitalisation.
2012 2011 Adjusted EBITA interest cover times 116.0 227.2 Net debt to EBITDA times n a n a Net debt market capitalisation percentage n a n a Calculated as Adjusted EBITA interest on consolidated borrowings.
Calculated as net debt earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
Calculated as net debt market capitalisation as at 31 December.

TRANSLATION RESERVE The translation reserve is used to record foreign exchange rate changes relating to the translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries arising after 1 January 2004.
It is also used to record foreign exchange differences arising on long-term foreign currency borrowings used to finance or hedge foreign currency investments.
HEDGING RESERVE For cash flow hedges that meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gains or losses on the hedging instrument that are determined to be an effective hedge are recognised directly in shareholders equity.
When the hedged firm commitment results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in shareholders equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.

ACQUISITIONS On 21 November 2012, the Group acquired the remaining 49% interest which it did not already own in the Inchcape Independence group, a retail business in Moscow, from Independence Holdings Limited for a cash consideration of US$27m.
Prior to this date, the Group owned a 51% share in Inchcape Independence but did not have overall control and had therefore equity accounted for its interest in the Inchcape Independence group.
The acquisition took the Groups interest in the Inchcape Independence group to 100% and the acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination following the change in control.
Details of the provisional fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities as at the date of acquisition are set out below: 2012 m Assets and liabilities acquired, at fair value Intangible assets note 11 0.1 Property, plant and equipment note 12 22.2 Tax assets 0.2 Inventory 5.1 Trade and other receivables 2.2 Cash and cash equivalents 1.5 Trade and other payables 3.1 Tax liabilities 1.4 Net assets acquired 26.8 Provisional goodwill note 11 8.3 Consideration 35.1 Satisfied by Cash paid 17.3 Fair value of existing interest in the Inchcape Independence group 17.8 Total purchase consideration 35.1 The provisional values of assets and liabilities recognised on acquisition are their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.
The Group is in the process of finalising its review of the fair value of assets and liabilities recognised at the date of acquisition and such reviews may include third party valuations where appropriate.
Accounting standards permit up to 12 months for provisional accounting to be finalised following the acquisition date if any subsequent information provides better evidence of the items fair value at the acquisition date.
Goodwill of 8.3m represents, amongst other things, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets yet to be recognised separately from goodwill as the fair value valuations are still in progress.
The Group has recognised a loss of 1.2m as a result of measuring at fair value its 51% equity interest in the Inchcape Independence group held before the business combination.
The loss is included within Other operating expenses in the Groups consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2012 and has been reported as an exceptional item see note 2.
In 2011, the Group completed the purchase of the Musa Motors group.
Under the terms of the original acquisition agreement, contingent deferred consideration dependent on 2010 EBITA was due in respect of 24.9% of the group.
In the first half of 2011, the amount of the deferred consideration was determined and a payment of US$32m 19.6m was made to the vendor.
B. DISPOSALS During the year, the Group disposed of its interest in a dealership in Russia at book value, generating disposal proceeds of 2.9m.
