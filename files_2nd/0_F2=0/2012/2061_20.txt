Financial statements 93 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 1 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS AND RESULTS PRESENTATION BG Groups reportable segments are those used by the Groups Board and management the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined in IFRS 8 Operating Segments to run the business and are based on differences in the Groups products and services.
Segment information is presented onthe same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
At the end of 2012, BG announced its decision to reorganise its reporting segments following the sale or agreement to sell the majority of its T&D businesses.
As a result, BG Group now hastwo principal operating and reporting segments which comprise Upstream and LNG Shipping & Marketing.
Upstream comprises exploration, development, production, liquefaction and marketing of hydrocarbons with a focus on natural gas.
LNG Shipping & Marketing combines the development and use of LNG import facilities with the purchase, shipping and sale of LNG and regasified natural gas.
Following the disposal of themajority of the Groups T&D businesses, the T&D segment has been treated as discontinued.
The T&D businesses that remain with BG Group have been allocated to the Other business segment.
Other activities also include costs relating to business development expenditure and certain corporate activities.
Comparative information has been restated to reflect the presentation of discontinued operations as a separate line item.
Seenote 7, page 102, for further details.
Intra-Group and inter-segment sales are settled at market prices and are generally based on the same prices as those charged to third parties armslength principle.
Group revenue, profit for the year, depreciation, amortisation and impairment and capital investment attributable to BGGroup activities are shown on pages 93 to 96, analysed by operating segment.
The presentation of BG Groups results under IFRS separately identifies the effect of the re-measurement of certain financial instruments, profits and losses on the disposal and impairment of non-current assets and certain other exceptional items when material.
Results excluding discontinued operations and disposals, certain re-measurements, certain other exceptional items and impairments Business performance are used by management and are presented in order to provide readers with a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying operating performance of the Groups ongoing business.
Further information on Business performance is given on page 140.
The disposals, re-measurements and impairments column includes unrealised gains and losses in respect of certain long-term gas sales contracts classified as derivatives under IAS 39, commodity instruments that represent economic hedges but do not qualify for hedge accounting, and financial instruments used to manage foreign exchange and interest rate exposure.
Where these instruments represent economic hedges but cannot be designated as hedges under IAS 39, unrealised movements in fair value, together with foreign exchange movements associated with the underlying borrowings and foreign exchange movements on monetary items that form part of the Groups net investment in foreign operations, are recorded in the income statement and disclosed separately as disposals, re-measurements and impairments.
The separate presentation of these items best reflects the underlying performance of the business since it distinguishes between the temporary timing differences associated with re-measurements under IAS 39 rules and actual realised gains and losses.
Under IFRS the results from jointly controlled entities joint ventures and associates are presented net of tax and finance costs on the face of the income statement.
BG Group also presents the operating profit of the Group including results of joint ventures and associates before interest and tax, as this approach provides additional information on the source of the Groups operating profits.
The following tables provide a reconciliation between the overall results and Business performance, and operating profit including and excluding the results of joint ventures and associates.
The geographical information provided for external revenue is based on destination.
External revenue attributable to non-UK countries is $15 881m 2011: $13 562m and includes $3 944m attributable to Japan representing 21% of Group revenue 2011: $2 089m, 12%.
b External revenue in respect of a single external customer amounted to $2 402m 2011: $3 267m, recognised in the Upstream segment.

Awards are in the form of shares 2012: 1.8m shares: 2011: 1.6m shares or nil-cost options 2012: 1.8m options: 2011: 1.8m options.
The costs in respect of these awards are charged to theincome statement over the vesting period, based on the fair value of the shares and options at the award date.
Dividend equivalents accrue onthe award during the vesting period.
Accordingly, the fair value of the shares and options awarded is based on the market value of the shares onthe award date, which was 12.56 per share in 2012 2011: 12.79 per share.
Performance Share Awards Details of Performance Share Awards under the Groups LTIP are given on page 62 and 63.
Awards are in the form of shares 2012: 0.5m shares: 2011: 0.5m shares ornil-cost options 2012: 2.5m options: 2011: 2.6m options.
The costs in respect of these awards are charged to the income statement over the vesting period, based on the fair value of the shares and options at the award date, adjusted for the probability of market-related performance conditions being achieved.
The fair value of shares and options awarded during the year in respect of Performance Share Awards is estimated using aMonte Carlo projection model with the following assumptions: weighted average share price of 12.71 2011: 12.76, exercise price of nil 2011: nil, arisk-free rate of0.36% 2011: 0.41% and a vesting period of three years 2011: three years.
The model also contains assumptions for both the Group and each member of the industry peer group set out on page 70 in respect of volatility, average share price growth and share price correlation.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the share price over the previous three-year period.
Share price correlation was determined by calculating the historical correlation of the share price over the previous three-year period.
Average share price growth was determined from historical growth over the previous year.
Dividend equivalents accrue on the award during the vesting period.
The fair value reflects the probability of market performance conditions being achieved.
The fair value of shares and options awarded during the year was 5.02per share 2011: 7.12 per share.

The Deferred Bonus Plan operates in conjunction with the Annual Incentive Scheme and is described on page 62 and 63.
In 2012, awards of 0.2m shares were made under this plan 2011: 0.2m shares.
The charge to the income statement in respect of these awards was $4m in 2012 2011: $5m and is based on the market value of the shares at the award date, which was 15.38 in 2012 2011: 14.99.
Details of the Sharesave Plan are given on page 71.
The charge to the income statement in respect of this Plan is based on the fair value of the shareoptions at the grant date and the likelihood of allocations vesting under the scheme.
The fair value ofthe share options granted is determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and was 2.99 in 2012 2011: 3.90.
Details of the Share Incentive Plan are given on page 71.
In 2012, awards of 0.2m shares 2011: 0.2m shares were made in conjunction with theGroups UK Flexible Benefits Plan.

Cash-Settled Share-Based Payments Cash-settled share-based payments arise when the Group incurs a liability to transfer cash amounts that are based on the price or value of the Companys shares.
Most of the charge in respect of cash-settled share-based payments relates to social security costs on share awards which have not vested or, in the case of share options, have not been exercised.
The charge to the income statement is based on the fair value of the awards outstanding at the balance sheet date, multiplied by the current employers social security rate.

As part of its business operations, the Group uses derivative financial instruments derivatives in order to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates.
The Group enters into interest rate derivatives to manage the fixed and floating composition of its debt.
The Group enters into currency exchange rate derivatives tohedge certain currency cash flows and to adjust the currency composition of its assets and liabilities.
Certain agreements are combined currency andinterest swap transactions, described as cross-currency interest rate derivatives.
The Groups policy is to enter into interest or currency exchange rate derivatives only where these are matched by an underlying asset, liability or transaction.
Further information on treasury risks is contained in the Principal risks and uncertainties section, pages 32 to 37.
COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS Within the ordinary course of business the Group routinely enters into sale and purchase transactions for commodities.
The majority of these transactions take the form of contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of the commodity inaccordance with the Groups expected sale, purchase or usage requirements.
Such contracts are not within the scope of IAS 39.
Certain gas sales contracts fall within the scope of IAS 39.
These contracts include pricing terms that are based on a variety of commodities andindices.
They are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value with movements in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Certain short-term market traded contracts for the purchase and subsequent resale of third-party commodities are within the scope of IAS 39 andare recognised in the balance sheet at fair value with movements in fair value recognised in the income statement.
The Group uses various commodity-based derivative instruments to manage some of the risks arising from fluctuations in commodity prices.
Such contracts include physical and net-settled forwards, futures, swaps and options.
Where these derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges of underlying commodity price exposures, certain gains and losses attributable to these instruments are deferred in other comprehensive income and subsequently recognised in the income statement when the underlying hedged transaction crystallises.
Commodity derivatives that are not part of a hedging relationship are recognised in the balance sheet within Other commodity derivatives at fair value, with movements in fair value recognised in theincome statement.
Further information on commodity price exposure is contained in the Principal risks and uncertainties section, pages 32 to 37.

The amounts in respect of other commodity derivatives represent the gross combination of notional principals relating to all purchase and sale contracts and accordingly do not show the extent to which these contracts may offset.
These notional principal amounts give an indication of the scale of derivatives held, but do not reflect the risks that theGroup is exposed to from their use.
VALUATION All financial instruments that are initially recognised and subsequently re-measured at fair value have been classified in accordance with the hierarchy described in IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
Fair value measurement hierarchy The fair value hierarchy, described below, reflects the significance of the inputs used to determine the valuation of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived directly from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those including inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset orliability directly or indirectly.
The fair value of the Groups interest rate and currency exchange rate derivatives and the majority of the Groups commodity derivatives are calculated from relevant market prices and yield curves at the balance sheet date and are therefore based solely on observable price information.
These instruments are not directly quoted in active markets and are accordingly classified as Level 2 in the fair valuehierarchy.
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include significant inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Where observable market valuations of commodity contracts are unavailable, the fair value on initial recognition is the transaction price and is subsequently determined using the Groups forward planning assumptions for the price of gas, other commodities and indices.
Due to the assumptions underlying their fair value, certain gas contracts are categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
One of the assumptions used for their valuation isthat observable commodity prices are liquid for four years 2011: four years.
Beyond this period a $101 per barrel 2011: $103 per barrel Brent oil price, subject to annual inflation of 3.0% 2011: 3.0%, has been used.
The fair values of the long-term commodity contracts are then calculated usingthe market yield curve at the balance sheet date.
As at 31 December 2012, the potential pre-tax change in the fair value of gas contracts, assuming a $10 per barrel change in the Brent price assumption, was$4m 2011: $19m.

Further information can be found in the Principal risks and uncertainties section, pages 32 to 37.
Fair value hedges As at 31 December 2012, the Group held a number of interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as hedges of the fairvalue risk associated with the Groups fixed rate debt.
The Group also held a number of commodity derivatives designated as hedges of the fairvalue risk associated with fixed price firm sales commitments.
The hedged items and the related derivatives have the same critical terms to ensure that they are an effective hedge under IAS 39.
The fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges outstanding as at 31December 2012 is $72m 2011: $128m.
During 2012, adjustments of $ 12 m 2011: $ 290 m have been made to hedged items in respect of the risksbeing hedged.
Cash flow hedges The Group has forward commodity contracts, currency exchange rate derivatives and interest rate derivatives designated as hedges of highly probable forecast purchases and sales, and of interest flows and currency exposure on Group debt.
As at 31 December 2012, an unrealised pre-tax lossof $228m 2011: $777m was deferred in other comprehensive income in respect of effective cash flow hedges.
The hedged transactions are expected to occur within 25 years 2011: 26 years and the associated gains and losses deferred in other comprehensive income will be released totheincome statement as the underlying transaction crystallises.
As at 31 December 2012, deferred pre-tax losses of $96m 2011: $605m are expected tobereleased to the income statement within one year.
The fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges outstanding asat31 December 2012 is $ 210 m 2011: $ 801 m. During 2012, certain forecast commodity sales for which cash flow hedge accounting was used werenolonger expected to occur.
This resulted in the transfer of a pre-tax gain of $47m 2011: $29m from other comprehensive income totheincome statement.
Page 88 identifies the amounts that have been transferred from other comprehensive income in respect of transactions completed during theyear.
These items are reported within the income statement or non-current assets to match against the underlying transaction.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations As at 31 December 2012, certain borrowings and currency derivatives have been designated as hedges of the currency risk associated with net investments in foreign operations.
The portion of gains or losses on the hedging instruments determined to be an effective hedge are transferred toother comprehensive income to offset the gains or losses arising on the retranslation of net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
The pre-tax gainon effective hedging instruments deferred within other comprehensive income as at 31 December 2012 is $331m 2011: $296m loss.
The fair value of financial instruments designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations outstanding as at 31 December 2012 is $ 4 885 m 2011:$ 4 838 m. FINANCIAL ASSETS EXCLUDING NON-INTEREST BEARING SHORT-TERM RECEIVABLES The Groups financial assets consist of cash and cash equivalents of $4 434m 2011: $3 601m, loans made to joint ventures and associates of $715m 2011: $1 467m, a finance lease receivable of $195m 2011: $193m, available-for-sale assets of $58m 2011: $47m, other long-term investments of$nil 2011: $1m, receivables due within one year of $813m 2011: $215m and receivables due after more than one year of $599m 2011: $443m.

Periodic interest rate determinations in respect of floating rate loans to joint ventures and associates generally comprise London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus or minus an agreed margin.
As at 31 December 2012, floating rate receivables and loans to joint ventures and associates had an effective interest rate of between 1.46%and 4.11% 2011: between 0.84% and 4.12% and are expected to expire between 2015 and 2020 2011: between 2012 and 2023.
The maturity profile of non-interest bearing loans to joint ventures and associates cannot be practicably estimated as repayments are based on the performance ofthe individual joint venture or associate.
As at 31 December 2012, fixed rate assets include a finance lease receivable associated with an onshore Liquefied Petroleum Gas LPG plant in Tunisia of $195m 2011: $193m which expires in 2016 2011: expires in 2016 and has an effective interest rate of 14.2% 2011: 14.5% and other fixed ratereceivables of $59m 2011: $52m which are expected to expire in 2022 2011: expire in 2022 and have effective interest rates of 6% 2011: 6%.

The fair values of fixed rate borrowings and joint venture andassociate loans have been estimated based on quoted market prices where available, or by discounting all future cash flows by the relevant market yield curve at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of floating rate borrowings and joint venture and associate loans approximate book value as interest rates on these instruments reset on a frequent basis.
Fair values have not been obtained for the non-interest bearing loans to jointventuresand associates as repayment of these loans is linked to the performance of the individual joint venture or associate and other considerations and it is therefore not practicable to assign fair values.
THE COMPANY The Companys financial instruments are all denominated in Pounds Sterling and consist of short-term receivables of $3 750m 2011: $4 381m, short-term payables of $40m 2011: $55m and cash and cash equivalents of $2m 2011: $2m.
Short-term receivables comprise amounts owed byGroup undertakings, of which $3 746m 2011: $4 376m earns interest at LIBOR minus an agreed margin.
The remaining short-term receivables of$4m 2011: $5m were non-interest bearing.
Short-term payables are contractually payable within one year and are non-interest bearing.
The fair valueof the financial instruments approximates book value.
FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS The principal financial risks arising from financial instruments are commodity price risk, exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and credit and liquidity risk.
A description of these principal risks is outlined in the Principal risks and uncertainties section, pages 32 to 37.
Additional quantitative information and market sensitivities in relation to certain principal market risks are included in the following sections.

com Notes to the accounts continued 19 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS CONTINUED Liquidity risk The Group limits the amount of borrowings maturing within any specific period and the Groups financial assets are primarily held as short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash.
These measures reduce liquidity risk.
The Group proposes tomeet its financing commitments from the operating cash flows of the business, existing cash and cash equivalent investments, funding from ongoing portfolio rationalisation plus borrowings from a range of sources which are expected to include money and debt capital markets, government lending agencies and existing committed lines of credit.
The undiscounted contractual cash flows receivable payable under financial instruments as at the balance sheet date are as follows: The Group Between Between as at 31 December 2012 Within one and two and After one year two years five years five years Total $m $m $m $m $m Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings 1 686 667 3 890 27 501 33 744 Short-term payables 1 599 1 599 Other financial liabilities 2 2 3 285 667 3 890 27 503 35 345 Outflows from derivative financial instruments Currency and interest rate derivatives 2 013 449 196 690 3 348 Gross-settled commodity derivatives 1 185 197 306 1 688 Net-settled commodity derivatives 149 30 8 187 3 347 676 510 690 5 223 Non-derivative financial assets and inflows from derivative financial instruments 11 202 1 708 1 160 1 629 15 699 Total as at 31 December 2012 4 570 365 3 240 26 564 24 869 The Group Between Between as at 31 December 2011 Within one and two and After one year two years five years five years Total $m $m $m $m $m Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings 1 759 1 878 3 099 15 655 22 391 Short-term payables 1 754 1 754 Other financial liabilities 62 62 3 513 1 878 3 099 15 717 24 207 Outflows from derivative financial instruments Currency and interest rate derivatives 2 885 1 935 637 1 611 7 068 Gross-settled commodity derivatives 1 124 230 20 1 374 Net-settled commodity derivatives 532 15 1 548 4 541 2 180 658 1 611 8 990 Non-derivative financial assets and inflows from derivative financial instruments 12 205 3 564 2 154 3 128 21 051 Total as at 31 December 2011 4 151 494 1 603 14 200 12 146 Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk in financial instruments arises from cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments, as well as credit exposures of commercial counterparties including exposures in respect of outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum long-term credit rating of A are normally accepted as a counterparty and credit limits are established based primarily on the credit ratings, although other credit assessment factors that determine credit quality including the external environment are taken into account when considering the awarding of or maintenance of a limit.
Similarly if a commercial counterparty is independently credit rated, the rating is primarily used to determine credit quality and limits with other relevant assessment factors also considered.
If there is no independent credit rating, credit quality is assessed in accordance with credit policies which take account of the counterpartys financial position and other similar factors.
Exposures are monitored by the relevant Group businesses and at a Group level.
As at 31 December 2012, the Groups maximum credit risk exposure after the impact of any netting arrangements under interest rate related derivatives was $78m 2011: $84m, currency derivatives $295m 2011: $66m and commodity related derivatives $43m 2011: $209m.
The Groups credit risk exposure under receivables and other financial assets is represented by the book values.
The Group considers its portfolio for credit related concentration risks where risks may result from strategic investments, commercial relationships or sales of product in a variety of locations.
Mitigation may be considered where appropriate to diversify or reduce risk profile.
Following an agreement signed with Egypt General Petroleum Corporation EGPC in 2011, the repayment of the Groups receivable balance in respect of domestic gas sales is partly linked to production levels, inparticular the volume of gas allocated for export as LNG.
As at 31 December 2012, this receivable balance was $1.3bn, of which $0.6bn was overdue.
Under repayment terms recently negotiated with EGPC, and based upon post-investment forecast production levels, the existing $1.3bn receivable balance is expected to be fully recovered by the end of 2015, and all future receivables would be current by 2017.
Financial statements Notes to the accounts continued 117 19 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS CONTINUED However, the recoverability of the receivable balances within these timeframes depends on the business environment in Egypt, together with the outcome of negotiations with EGPC, reservoir performance, the Groups continued investment plans and the successful operational delivery of those plans.
Market risk Financial instruments used by the Group that are affected by market risks primarily comprise cash and cash equivalents, borrowings and derivative contracts.
The principal market variables that affect the value of these financial instruments are UK and US interest rates, US Dollar to Pound Sterling exchange rates, UK and US gas prices, and Japan Custom-cleared Crude JCC and Brent oil prices.
The table below illustrates the indicative post-tax effects on the income statement and other comprehensive income of applying reasonably foreseeable market movements to the Groups financial instruments at the balance sheet date.

A brief description of each provision together with estimates of the timing of expenditure is given below: DECOMMISSIONING COSTS The estimated cost of decommissioning at the end of the producing lives of fields is reviewed at least annually and engineering estimates and reports are updated periodically.
Provision is made for the estimated cost of decommissioning at the balance sheet date, to the extent that current circumstances indicate BG Group will ultimately bear this cost.
The payment dates of total expected future decommissioning costs are uncertain, but are currently anticipated to be between 2013 and 2060.
OTHER The balance as at 31 December 2012 includes provisions for onerous contracts of $149m 2011: $165m, field-related payments of $53m 2011: $70m, insurance costs of $52m 2011: $53m and costs associated with acquisitions, disposals and restructuring of $122m 2011: $106m.
The payment dates are uncertain, but are expected to be between 2013 and 2018.
A provision for onerous contracts was recognised in 2007 in respect of capacity contracts in the Interconnector pipeline, retained following disposal of the Groups 25% equity in Interconnector UK Limited.
The obligation associated with these contracts extends to 2018.

The deferred taxliability of $4 636m 2011: $3 961m is shown after the offset of certain deferred tax assets relating to the same fiscal authority: the liability priorto such offset is $8 515m 2011: $7 610m.
The net amount expected to be settled after more than 12 months is $4 551m 2011: $3 943m.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised, is approximately $5.9bn 2011: $5.0bn.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences either because no liability is expected to arise on distribution under applicable tax legislation or because the Group is in a position to controlthe timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductable temporary differences, unutilised tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable income is probable.
To determine the future taxable income, reference is made to the latest available profit forecasts.
This requires assumptions regarding future profitability and is therefore inherently uncertain.
The Group has unrecognised deductible temporary differences of $896m 2011: $1 004m and unrecognised tax losses of $2 802m 2011: $1 380m tocarry forward against future taxable income.
To the extent unutilised, $283m of these losses will expire by 2017.
In addition, the Group has unrecognised capital losses of $183m 2011:$162m : these tax losses can only be offset against specific types of future capital gains.
The Group alsohasunrecognised overseas tax creditsof $393m 2011: $521m.
As at 31 December 2012, the Company had a deferred tax asset of $12m 2011: $9m.

The amounts of future costs associated with these contingent liabilities could be significant.
The Group has obtained indemnities and or letters of credit against the estimated amount of certain of these potential liabilities.
C FUTURE EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS As at 31 December 2012, certain petroleum licences and contractual agreements in which BG Group has an interest contained outstanding obligations to incur exploration and development expenditure, some of which were firm commitments and others contingent.

E LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Italian criminal charges were brought in 2008 against certain current and former employees and consultants of BG Group in connection with allegations of improper conduct associated with the authorisation process for the planned Brindisi LNG S. p. A. Brindisi LNG regasification terminal.
BG Italia S. p. A. BG Italia, a wholly owned subsidiary of BG Group, was also charged in relation to some of these allegations under Italian Legislative Decree No.
231 2001, an Italian anti-corruption statute which imposes liability on corporate entities under certain circumstances in the event certain criminal acts are committed by management or employees of the company.
Charges were also brought against certain former directors of Brindisi LNG, a wholly owned subsidiary of BG Italia, who were alleged to have unlawfully permitted the occupation and alteration of public land, namely the port area in Brindisi where the regasification terminal is due to be constructed, as a result of improperly authorised permits.
The charges in relation to this offence against some of these former directors were extinguished via an Oblazione granted by the Brindisi court.
This decision was challenged by the Supreme Court, who remitted the matter back to the Brindisi Court.
In May 2012, the Brindisi Court declared these charges to be time-barred.
The Brindisi Court also issued its verdict in relation to the other criminal charges.
The charges against BG Italia were declared time-barred.
A former BG director was convicted of abusive land occupation and sentenced to five months imprisonment although the sentence is suspended subject to appeal.
The project site has been confiscated although it remains seized subject to appeal.
BG Italia submitted an appeal in October 2012 as did the public prosecutor.
The Municipality of Brindisi, Province of Brindisi and Region of Puglia and three groups of environmentalists separately commenced civil claims seeking damages against the accused individuals and against BG Italia.
These claims were brought within the framework of the criminal case and were rejected by the Brindisi court in April 2012.
BG Group is aware that the Region of Puglia has filed an appeal but is not aware of any other civil claimant having filed an appeal.
To date, no date for an appeal has been fixed.
In October 2007, BG Group received formal notification from the Ministry of Economic Development that the original Article 8 authorisation for theconstruction and operation of Brindisi LNG had been suspended pending the submission by BG Group of a full Environmental Impact Assessment EIA and confirmation from the Italian authorities as to the validity of the Article 8 authorisation.
The Article 8 authorisation remains suspended.
In 2008, BG Group submitted an EIA.
The EIA was re-published in 2009.
On 1 July 2010, a positive EIA decree was issued, subject to certain conditions.
Several parties have challenged this EIA approval and the hearing required as a result has been postponed to an unconfirmed date.
There are various other proceedings relating to the Brindisi LNG regasification terminal, for example relating to consents necessary for the construction work and environmental procedures.
The impact of these proceedings cannot yet be quantified but the Board of BG Group has in any event decided not to pursue the Brindisi LNG regasification terminal project.
BG Karachaganak Ltd, as one of the Karachaganak Contracting Companies KCC, and the Republic of Kazakhstan ROK had been involved in various arbitration proceedings concerning certain taxes, fines and penalties paid by KCC and Karachaganak Petroleum Operating B. V. as well as certain unresolved items of expenditure incurred by the KCC.
These arbitration proceedings have now been settled by entering into a Settlement Agreement dated 14 December 2011 and completed 28 June 2012.
BG Groups interest in the project reduced from 32.5% to 29.25% as a result.
Two separate tax deficiency notices have been issued against Petrobras in December 2009 based on alleged irregularities in connection with the import of equipment and rigs on behalf of the BM-S-9 consortium Petrobras 45% Operator, BG E&P Brasil 30% and Repsol YPF Brasil 25%.
BGGroups potential liability arises from indemnity provisions in favour of Petrobras, as set out in the Joint Operating Agreement.
The first tax deficiency notice was issued due to the So Paulo State Tax Authoritys allegation that Petrobras cannot enjoy lower tax rates in the importation of the Stena Drillmax rig because the rig was not disembarked and cleared in a So Paulo state port.
Petrobras challenged this decision through the administrative courts but the appeal was rejected.
Petrobras filed a lawsuit before the judicial branch and, on 25 October 2011, the court declared that the So Paulo State Tax Authority was not competent to decide unilaterally where customs clearance takes place or to consider if the Consortium would be entitled to the special tax treatment.
This ruling, the first in the Judicial Courts, was a positive decision for the Consortium.
Asexpected, the So Paulo State Tax Authority has appealed the judicial decision and a response is awaited within the next three years.
The second tax deficiency notice was issued by the So Paulo Tax Authority reflecting their view that Petrobras should have recorded transfers of goods to and from a rig by issuing invoices for the purposes of allowing authorities to monitor taxable transactions as if the offshore rig and the onshore base were two distinct branches of Petrobras.
As such, the authorities claim that transfers of goods to and from the Petrobras-affiliated branches should attract a transfer tax equivalent to VAT.
Petrobras challenged this deficiency notice before the administrative courts and, on 23 March 2010, an unfavourable decision was issued.
This decision has been appealed by Petrobras, the outcome of which may be received later in 2013.
If the appeal by Petrobras is rejected, it is anticipated that judicial proceedings will be brought in a manner similar to the first tax deficiency notice referred to above.
It is expected that this matter may also takeup to five years to be resolved.

The Company and its subsidiaries are, or may from time to time be, in connection with current or past operations, involved in a number of legal orarbitration proceedings, including, for example, claims, suits, actions, investigations and or inquiries relating to commercial, tax, environmental or other matters, with third parties or governmental or regulatory authorities.
While the outcome of some of these matters cannot readily be foreseen, it is currently considered that they will be resolved without material effect on the net asset position as set out in these Financial Statements.

Financial statements Notes to the accounts continued 123 26 PENSIONS AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS A number of the Groups UK employees participate in the BG Pension Scheme BGPS, a defined benefit registered pension plan established undertrust.
The Trustee is BG Group Pension Trustees Limited.
The BGPS is funded to cover future pension liabilities in respect of service up to the balance sheet date.
It is subject to an independent valuation at least every three years, on the basis of which the independent qualified actuary certifies the rate of employers contributions that, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees and returns on the BGPSsassets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable.
For the year ended 31 December 2012, the employers contribution rate in respect of most BGPS members was effectively 35.2% of pensionable pay excluding plan expenses which were met directly by the Company.
In addition, 3% of pensionable pay was contributed by most members either directly or by their employer via a salary sacrifice arrangement.
The Group has been consulting BGPS employee members about a proposal to close the BGPS to future accrual of benefits on 30 November 2013.
The consultation period ended on 18 March 2013.
A full independent actuarial valuation of the BGPS for funding purposes as at 31 March 2011 is currently underway.
The previous actuarial valuation, asat 31 March 2008, showed that the aggregate market value of the plan assets at 31 March 2008 was 577m, representing some 83% of the accrued liabilities.
The Group made payments of 27m in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 and, under the current schedule of contributions, is due to make two further payments of 27m in 2013 and 2014 in order to reduce the plans deficit.
Based upon the contributions currently agreed between the Trustee and the Company following the 2008 actuarial valuation, aggregate Company contributions for the year ending 31 December 2013 including the 27m deficit reduction contribution are expected to be 63m.
The BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme BGSBS provides benefits broadly in excess of the lifetime allowance.
This defined benefit plan is an unfunded, non-registered arrangement.
If the proposed closure of the BGPS goes ahead, benefit accrual in the BGSBS will also cease on the same date.
The Group also had an unfunded defined benefit post-retirement employee benefit plan for healthcare inrespect of employees of Comgs until November 2012 when it completed the sale of its entire holding in the business.
With effect from 2 April 2007, new UK employees have been offered membership of a defined contribution stakeholder pension plan, the BG Group Retirement Benefits Plan BGRBP.
Life assurance and income protection benefits are also provided under separate plans: these benefits are fully insured.
Members may choose the rate at which they contribute to the BGRBP, either directly or via salary sacrifice, and the additional employers contribution is currently determined by the rate that the member selects.
A wide range of funds is available from which members may choose howthe contributions will be invested.
The cost of the BGRBP and the related life assurance and income protection benefits has been included inthe amounts recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The Group also has a number of smaller defined contribution and defined benefit plans outside the UK which are not material in Group terms.
Valuations of plan assets and expected liabilities as at 31 December 2012 were carried out by independent actuaries in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19.
In calculating the charge to the income statement including any recognised actuarial gains and losses, a 10% corridor wasapplied.
This means that a portion of actuarial gains and losses is recognised as income or expense only if it exceeds the greater of: a.
10% of the present value of the defined benefit obligation before deducting plan assets : and b.
10% of the fair value of any plan assets.
These limits are calculated and applied separately for each defined benefit plan at each balance sheet date and the portion of actuarial gains andlosses to be recognised in future years for each plan is the excess of actuarial gains and losses over and above the 10% limits divided by the expected average remaining working lives of the employees participating in that plan.
The fair value of plan assets, the present value of plan liabilities and the net balance sheet liability were as follows: as at 31 December 2012 2011 $m $m Fair value of plan assets 1 598 1 289 Present value of liabilities 1 886 1 725 Deficit in plans 288 436 Unrecognised net loss 189 222 Net balance sheet liability 99 214 124 Financial statements Annual Report and Accounts 2012 www.

The valuations as at 31 December were based on the following assumptions: 2012 2011 2011 BGPS BGPS Comgs and and healthcare a BGSBS BGSBS plan % % % b Rate of price inflation and benefit increases 3.0 3.1 4.5 Future increases in earnings 4.0 4.1 n a Discount rate 4.6 5.0 10.3 Healthcare cost trend rate n a n a 7.7 a The Group disposed of its entire interest in Comgs in November 2012. b Rate of increase of deferred pensions and pensions in payment in excess of any Guaranteed Minimum Pension element.
The assumptions set out in the table above are those applicable to the currency in which the liabilities of each plan are denominated.
In the case ofthe BGPS and BGSBS this is Pounds Sterling and in the case of the Comgs healthcare plan this is Brazilian Reais.
If the discount rate used for the valuation of the BGPS and BGSBS was reduced by 0.1% to 4.5%, the defined benefit obligation would increase by$38m and the service cost for 2013 would increase by $2m.
In determining the defined benefit obligation as at 31 December 2012 for the BGPS and BGSBS, mortality assumptions are based on the Self Administered Pension Schemes SAPS S1 series light tables with a 105% multiplier issued by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, appropriate to each members year of birth, with an allowance for projected longevity improvements in line with the CMIs core projection model 2010 version, with a long-term rate of improvement of the projected mortality rates of 1% per annum.
Based on these assumptions, the life expectancies of pensioners on the measurement date and also of pensioners in 10 years time are as follows: as at 31 December Life expectancy of pensioners years 2012 2022 Male age 60 28.2 29.0 Male age 65 23.5 24.2 Female age 60 29.3 30.1 Female age 65 24.6 25.3 If the life expectancy of a member currently age 60 was increased by one year, with consistent changes for members at other ages, the defined benefit obligation in respect of the BGPS and BGSBS would increase by $42m and the service cost for 2013 would increase by $2m.
