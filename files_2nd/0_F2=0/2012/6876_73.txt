The exceptional credit represents the ensuing reduction in the net pension liability.
Gosforth bakery During 2011 the Group created an onerous lease provision for, and wrote off the value of the assets of, our old Gosforth bakery prior to relocation to a new site in early 2012.
During 2012 the Group successfully disposed of the old site with all leases being surrendered with no further recourse.
The resulting release of the onerous lease provision and the profit on the sale of the site have been treated as exceptional items in 2012.
