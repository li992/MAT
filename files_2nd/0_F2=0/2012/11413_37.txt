5 Exceptional items In the current period the Group incurred costs relating to the set-up of CFC2 and its new non-food business.
As part of the set-up of CFC2, land, buildings and plant and machinery with a net book value of 0.9 million were impaired due to it being superseded by assets from CFC2.
This impairment charge is included in the charge as disclosed in Note 3.2.

Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
Current taxation Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.
It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Recognition, therefore, involves judgement regarding the prudent forecasting of future taxable profits of the business and in applying an appropriate risk adjustment factor.
The final outcome of some of these items may give rise to material profit and loss and or cash ow variances.
At the balance sheet date management has forecast that the Group would generate future taxable profits against which existing tax losses could be relieved.
As a result, the Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of 7.9 million with respect to available tax losses.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current taxation assets against current taxation liabilities and it is the intention to settle these on a net basis.

Accordingly, the effective rate for the period is 24.67%.
The Budget also announced further reductions in the standard rate of corporation tax from 24% to 22% phased in over two years at 1% per annum from April 2012.
The change from 24% to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013 was enacted in the Finance Act 2012 and so deferred tax has been provided at 23% as the asset is expected to be realised on or after 1 April 2013.
A deferred tax charge of 0.7 million 2011: 0.5 million has been recognised in the current period in respect of this.
Further changes have not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are therefore not included in these financial statements.
The proposed reduction to 22% from 1 April 2014 is not expected to be substantively enacted until a future Finance Bill is approved.
The overall effect of the further changes from 23% to 22%, if applied to the deferred tax balance at the balance sheet date, would be to reduce the deferred tax asset by 0.4 million in 2014 2011: 0.8 million.
