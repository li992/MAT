23 Contingent liabilities In connection with the sale of its products the Group will, on some occasions, provide financing support for its customers.
The Groups contingent liabilities relating to financing arrangements are spread over many years and relate to a number of customers and a broad product portfolio.
Contingent liabilities are disclosed on a discounted basis.
As the directors consider the likelihood of these contingent liabilities crystallising to be remote, this amount does not represent a value that is expected to crystallise.
However, the amounts are discounted at the Groups borrowing rate to reflect better the time span over which these exposures could arise.
The contingent liabilities are denominated in US dollars.
As the Group does not generally adopt cash flow hedge accounting for forecast foreign exchange transactions, this amount is reported, together with the sterling equivalent at the reporting date spot rate.
The discounted values of contingent liabilities relating to delivered aircraft and other arrangements where financing is in place, less insurance arrangements and relevant provisions, were: 2012 2011 m $m m $m Gross contingent liabilities 569 925 612 951 1 Contingent liabilities net of relevant security 70 114 124 192 2 Contingent liabilities net of relevant security reduced by 20% 133 216 201 312 1 Security includes unrestricted cash collateral of: 64 104 67 104 2 Although sensitivity calculations are complex, the reduction of relevant security by 20 per cent illustrates the sensitivity of the contingent liability to changes in this assumption.
There are also net contingent liabilities in respect of undelivered aircraft, but it is not considered practicable to estimate these as deliveries can be many years in the future, and the relevant financing will only be put in place at the appropriate time.
R olls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2012 Financial statements 119 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 23 Contingent liabilities continued Following a request for information from the Serious Fraud Office SFO about allegations of malpractice in Indonesia and China, investigations by Rolls-Royce have identified matters of concern in these, and in other overseas markets.
The Group has passed information to the SFO relating to these concerns and is cooperating fully.
The consequence of these disclosures will be decided by the regulatory authorities.
It is too early to predict the outcomes, but these could include the prosecution of individuals and of the Company.
Accordingly, the potential for fines or other penalties cannot currently be assessed.
As the investigation is ongoing it is not possible to identify the timescale in which these issues might be resolved.
Contingent liabilities exist in respect of guarantees provided by the Group in the ordinary course of business for product delivery, performance and reliability.
The Group has, in the normal course of business, entered into arrangements in respect of export finance, performance bonds, countertrade obligations and minor miscellaneous items.
Various Group undertakings are parties to legal actions and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which are for substantial amounts.
As a consequence of the insolvency of an insurer as previously reported, the Group is no longer fully insured against known and potential claims from employees who worked for certain of the Groups UK-based businesses for a period prior to the acquisition of those businesses by the Group.
While the outcome of some of these matters cannot precisely be foreseen, the directors do not expect any of these arrangements, legal actions or claims, after allowing for provisions already made, to result in significant loss to the Group.
The Groups share of equity accounted entities contingent liabilities is 48m 2011 68m.
