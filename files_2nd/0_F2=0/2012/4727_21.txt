56 Dialight plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Header Notes to the consolidated financial statements Underhead For the year ended 31 December 2012 1.
Reporting entity Dialight plc is a company domiciled in England.
The address of the Companys registered ofce is Exning Road, Newmarket, Suffolk CB8 0AX.
Theconsolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2012 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries togetherreferred to as the Group.
Basis of preparation a Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRSs.
The Company has elected to present its parent company financial statements inaccordance with UKGAAP.
During the year the Board deemed it was more appropriate to reclassify the 2011 consolidated income statement for the results ofdiscontinued operations.
b Consolidated basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments which are carried at fair value.
TheGroups business activities, together with the factors that are likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in theOverview and Performance review on pages 1 to 25.
The financial position of the Company, its cash ows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities aredescribed in the Financial review on pages 20 to 23.
Thenancial statements include the statements covering the Groups objectives, policies andprocesses for managing its capital: management of its financial risk objectives: details of its financial instruments: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources and, as a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed tomanage its business risks successfully.
The Directors therefore have a reasonable expectation that the Company has sufficient resources to continue in existence forthe foreseeable future.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual nancialstatements.
c Use of estimates, judgements and assumptions In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, management has made a number of judgements.
The process of preparing the Groups financial statements inevitably requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions concerning the future and the resulting accounting estimates will, by denition, seldom equal the related actual results.
The estimates and judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts included in these consolidated financial statements are as follows: Goodwill see note 12 Each year the Group reviews the carrying values of its goodwill balances by carrying out impairment tests.
These tests require estimates and judgements to be made of the value in use of its cash generating units CGUs which are dependent on key assumptions such asfuture cash owsand future growth rates of the CGUs, and discount rates.
Uncertainties associated with the current economic environment could impact key assumptions made as part of this review, although sensitivity analysis has been performed on the carrying of goodwill.
Fair value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination see note 13 On the acquisition of a business it is necessary to attribute fair values to any intangible asset acquired provided it meets the criteria tobe recognised.
Thefair values of any intangible assets are dependent on estimates and judgements of attributable future revenues, profitability and cash ows.
Development costs and deferred costs see note 12 The Group capitalises development costs and deferred costs provided they meet certain criteria as set out in the respective accounting policy.
Costs are only capitalised where management are satisfied as to the ultimate commercial viability of the projects concerned based on available information.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets see note 12 The impairment analysis of goodwill and intangible assets is based upon the estimate of future discounted cash ows.
Factorssuch as lower than anticipated sales and resulting decreases of net cash ows and changes in discount rates could lead to impairments.
Dened benefit pension plans see note 19 The valuation of the dened benefit pension plans are based upon actuarial assumptions related to the measurement of pension liabilities and assets.
Ifthe relevant factors developed materially differ from the assumptions used this could have asignicant impact onour dened benefit obligation.
Themain assumptions made in accounting for the Groups pension plans relate to the expected rate ofreturn on investments within the plans, the rate of increase in pensionable salaries, the rate of increase in the retail price index and consumer price index, the mortality rate of plan members and the discount rate applied in discounting liabilities.
For each of these assumptions there is a range ofpossible values.
Small changes in these assumptions can have a significant impact on the size of the deficit calculated under IAS 19. www.

Basis of preparation continued c Use of estimates, judgements and assumptions continued Warranty see note 20 The warranty provision is estimated requiring management to make estimates and assumptions with respect to values and conditions which cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared.
Estimates are evaluated based on historical results and experience together with any known factors at the time of estimate.
If the relevant rate of product returns differed materially from the estimates this may have a material impact on the level of provision required.
Tax see note 8 Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferredtax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extentthat it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probablethat sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered.
Significant accounting policies The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements and have been applied consistently by Group entities.
a Basis of consolidation Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control istransferred tothe Group.
Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benets from itsactivities.
In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable.
Acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010 For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: - the fair value of the consideration transferred: plus - the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquire: less - the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with abusiness combination are expensed as incurred.
Acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 1 January 2010 For acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 1 January 2010, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Groups interest inthe recognised amount generally fair value of the identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurred in connection with business combinations were capitalised as part of the acquisition.
Acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004 date of transition to IFRSs As part of its transition to IFRSs, the Group elected to restate only those business combinations that occurred on or after 1 January 2003.
In respect ofacquisitions prior to 1 January 2003, goodwill represents the amount recognised under the Groups previous accounting framework, UK GAAP.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from thedate that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Intra-group balances, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

Significant accounting policies continued b Foreign currency translation For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation are translated using exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items of overseas operations are translated at average exchange rates for the period.
Since the transition date, resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity within the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of.
Foreign currency transactions are accounted for at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
c Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are recorded initially at cost and are re-measured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The fair value of derivatives at31December 2012 is nil 2011: nil.
d Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
e Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group and have nite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
f Depreciation and amortisation Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant andequipment.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Buildings 1650 years Plant, equipment and vehicles 310 years Amortisation Amortisation is recognised in profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other than goodwill, fromthedate that they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Patents and trademarks 14 years Development costs 35 years Order book 12 years Customer relationships 17 years Technology 7 years g Goodwill Goodwill that arises upon acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
For the measurement of goodwill at initial recognition, see note 3 a.
Subsequent measurement After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses until disposal or termination of the previously acquired business when the profit or loss on disposal or termination will be calculated after charging the gross amount atcurrent exchange rates of any suchgoodwill through the income statement.
Goodwill is allocated to the CGUs andistested at least annually for impairment.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
com Financials Dialight plc Annual report and accounts 2012 59 Header Underhead 3.
Significant accounting policies continued h Research and development costs Expenditure on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding isrecognised inthe income statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete the development.
The expenditure capitalised includes direct cost of material, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Other development expenditure is recognised inthe income statement as an expense as incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated atcost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
i Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at eachreporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists then the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each reporting date.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
ACGU is the smallest identiable asset group that generates cash ows that largely are independent from other assets and groups.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit and loss.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then toreduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit group of units onapro-rata basis.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the asset.
Any impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed ateach reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change inthe estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does notexceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
A financial asset, in particular the carrying value of trade receivables, is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash ows of that asset.
Any impairment losses are recognised through the income statement.
j Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion andother costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their location and condition at the balance sheet date.
Items are valued using the first in, first out method.
When inventories are used, the carrying amount of those inventories is recognised as an expense in the period in which the related revenue isrecognised.
Provision for write-down to net realisable value and losses of inventories are recognised as an expense in the period in which the write-down or loss occurs.
k Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash ow statement.
l Share capital i Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by members.
ii When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased by the ESOT, the amount of the consideration paid is recognised asadeduction from equity.
iii Under the terms of the PSP and deferred bonus scheme, dividends accrue on shares not yet vested, however if in the event that the shares lapse or are forfeited then the dividends will not be paid and the accrual is reversed.
m Employee benets i Dened contribution pension plans Obligations for contributions to dened contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement when they are due.
com 60 Dialight plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Header Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Underhead For the year ended 31 December 2012 3.
Significant accounting policies continued m Employee benets continued ii Dened benefit pension plans The Groups net obligation in respect of dened benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount offuture benetthat employees have earned for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value and any unrecognised past service costs and the fair value of any plan assets arededucted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating tothe Groups obligations.
The calculation isperformed by an independent qualied actuary using the projected unit method.
When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the net totalof any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
When the benets of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period until benets become vested.
Tothe extent that the benets vest immediately, the expenses are recognised immediately in the income statement.
All actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the period they occur directly into equity through the statement of comprehensive income.
iii Share-based payment and deferred bonus transactions The PSP allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Company.
The fair value of the award granted is recognised as an employee expense with acorresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at the grant date and spread over the performance period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled tothe award.
The fair value of the grants is measured using the Monte Carlo model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the grants were made.
The amount recognised as an expense is only adjusted to reect forfeitures resulting from failures to meet non-market conditions.
The share-based payments are equity settled.
Key Group employees are awarded shares in the Company under the Annual Performance Bonus Plan.
The fair value of the award granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at the grant date andspread over the performance period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled tothe award.
n Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and itisprobable that an outow of economic benets will be required to settle the obligation.
Warranties A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products are sold.
The provision is based on historical warranty data, aweighting ofpossible outcomes against their associated probabilities, and the expected costs of honouring warranty claims.
o Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are initially recorded at fair value and then subsequently stated at their amortised cost less any impairment losses.
Thecarrying amounts of the Groupsassets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
Ifanysuchindication exists the assets recoverable amounts are estimated being the greater of their net selling price and value in use.
Inassessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessmentof the time value of the money and risks specic to the asset.
Receivables with ashortduration are not discounted.
An impairment loss in respect of trade and other receivables is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used todetermine the recoverableamount.
p Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are initially recorded at fair value and then subsequently stated at amortised cost.
q Revenue recognition Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns and allowances, trade discounts, volume rebates and product returns.
Revenue represents the invoiced value of goods supplied and is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the external customers in line with contractual arrangements and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and it is probable that the economic benefit associated with the transaction will ow to the Group.
r Expenses i Operating lease payments Payments under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
ii Net nancing costs Net nancing costs comprise interest receivable, interest payable, borrowings, interest on pension assets and liabilities, foreign exchange gains andlosses, gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement and unwinding on discount.
com Financials Dialight plc Annual report and accounts 2012 61 Header Underhead 3.
Significant accounting policies continued s Income tax expense Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax expense is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that itrelates to items recognised directly in equity.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements andthe corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged orcredited toprot and loss, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assetsand liabilities on a net basis.
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay therelated dividend isrecognised.
t Segment reporting An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Groups other components.
All operating segments operating results are reviewed regularly by the Groups Chief Executive to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and for which discrete financial information is available.
Segment results that are reported to the Groups Chief Executive include items directly attributable to a segment as well asthose that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Unallocated items comprise mainly corporate assets primarily the Companys headquarters, head ofce expenses and income tax assets and liabilities.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the year to acquire property, plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding goodwill, order book and customer relationships.
u New endorsed standards and interpretations not adopted A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2013 and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
Except as stated below, none of these are expected to have significant effect onthe consolidated financial statements of the Group.
IAS 19 2011 changes the denition of short-term and other long-term employee benets to clarify the distinction between the two.
For dened benefit plans, removal of the accounting policy choice for recognition of actuarial gains and losses is not expected to have any impact on the Group, since it already recognises them immediately in other comprehensive income.
The principal impact is expected to be that the return on plan assets recognised in the income statement will in future be calculated by applying the rate used to discount the plans liabilities, rather than their long-term expected rate of return.
This is expected to decrease the profit from operating activities for 2012 and decrease the dened benefit plan remeasurement loss recognised in other comprehensive income.
The Group does not expect the impact of the revised measurement principles to be material.
IAS 19 2011 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 with early adoption permitted.
v Determination of fair values A number of the Groups accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.
Fair values have been determined for measurement and or disclosure purposes based onthe following methods.
Where applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specic to that asset or liability.
Plant and equipment The fair value of plant and equipment recognised as a result of a business combination is based on market values.
The market value ofitems of plant, equipment, xtures and ttings is based on the quoted market prices for similar items.
Intangible assets The fair value of patents, customer relationships and trademarks acquired in business combinations is based on the discounted cash ows expected to be derived from the use or eventual sale of the assets.
The fair value of technology is based on estimated replacement cost.
com 62 Dialight plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Header Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Underhead For the year ended 31 December 2012 3.
Significant accounting policies continued v Determination of fair values continued Inventory The fair value of inventory acquired in a business combination is based on its estimated selling price in the ordinary course ofbusiness less the estimated costs of completion and sale and a reasonable profit margin based on the effort required to complete and sell the inventory.
Trade and other receivables and payables The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash ows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
For receivables and payables with a life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reect the fair value.
Share-based payments transactions The fair value of employee stock options is measured using the Monte Carlo model.
The fair value is measured at the grant date and spread over the performance period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the award.
TheMonte Carlo model takes into account the terms and conditions upon which the grants were made.
Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are either marked to market using listed market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price anddeducting the current spot rate.
Where discounted cash ow techniques are used, estimated future cash ows are based on managements best estimates and the discount rate is a market related rate for a similar instrument at the balance sheet date.
Whereother pricing models are used, inputs are based on market related data at the balance sheet date.
Cash and cash equivalents The carrying amount reported in the balance sheet approximates to fair value.
Operating segments Following the disposal of the major part of the Electromagnetic Component segment, the Group now has three reportable segments, as described below, which are the Groups strategic business units.
The strategic units offer different products.
They require different technology and marketing strategies.
For each of the units the CEO reviews internal monthly reports.
The following summary describes the operations in each of the Groups reportable segments.
The Group comprises the following business segments: - Signals, which addresses the increasing demands for Energy efficient signalling solutions through the use of high brightness LEDs and utilisation ofanumber of associated technologies.
Areas of business include Trafc Signals, Obstruction Signals: - Lighting, which addresses the increasing demands for Energy efficient Lighting solutions through the use of high-brightness LEDs and utilisation of anumber of associated technologies.
Areas of business is Solid State Lighting products for Hazardous and Non-Hazardous Industrial application: and - Components, whose sales are primarily to Electronics OEMs for status indication and residual disconnect components for automotive and niche industrial applications.
There is no inter-segment revenue.
2011 has been reclassied to take into account the new reportable segments.
All revenue relates to the sale of goods.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that canbe allocated on a reasonable basis.
Unallocated expenses comprise corporate costs including share-based payments.
Unallocated assets and liabilities comprise an element of cash, borrowings, taxation and pension fund liabilities where it has not been possible to allocate to a specic segment.
There are no individual customers representing more than 10% of revenue.

A reduction in the rate from 26% to 25% effective from 1 April 2012 was substantively enacted on 5 July 2011, and further reductions to 24% effective from 1 April 2012 and 23% effective from 1 April 2013 were substantively enacted on 26 March 2012 and 3 July 2012 respectively.
This will reduce the companys future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax asset at balance sheet date has been calculated based ontherate of 23% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further 2% rate reduction, although this will further reduce thecompanys future current tax charge and reduce the companys deferred tax asset accordingly.

Intangible assets continued The Group tests goodwill at the CGU level annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Therecoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in usecalculations are those regarding the discount rates and growth rates.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reect current market assessments of a number of factors that impact onthe time valueof money and any risk specic to the CGU.
The rate includes managements assessment of a normal level of debt toequity ratio within similar companies in its sector.
The Group prepares cash ow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management covering ave-year period.
Management has arrived at the five-year plan based upon certain assumptions derived from research carried out by external consultants who specialise in areas of the Groups business and their knowledge of the business.
The key assumptions within the five-year forecasts are revenue growth which varies depending on the CGUs product groups and the markets addressed and contribution margin, which is based on managements best estimate of material, labour and production cost trends and manufacturing efficiencies.
Cashows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates of between 0% and 1%.
Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions Impairment testing is dependent on managements estimates and judgements, particularly as they relate to the forecasting of future cashows, thediscount rates selected, and expected long-term growth rates.
Any adverse change in these assumptions could reduce the recoverable amount below carrying amount.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash ow for the CGUs is 8.2% 2011: range of 8.0% to 10.4%.
The growth rates management has applied in the value in use calculations for each of the CGUs over the five-year period vary due to the nature of the products, industries and countries in which the CGU operates.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis signicantly reducing the growth rates.
Even at this level no impairment would be required to be recorded.
The Directors do not believe that a significant change to the assumptions is probable.

Employee benefits continued Expense recognised in the income statement For its UK pension arrangements the Group has, for the purpose of calculating its liabilities as at 31 December 2012, used SAPS mortality tables based on year of birth as is published by the Institute of Actuaries.
The UK mortality tables are based on the latest mortality investigations and reect an industry-wide recognition that life expectations have improved.
The average life expectancy of anindividual currently aged 45 years and retiring atage 65 years is 24.10 years for males and 26.7 years for females.
For individuals currently aged 65 years the average life expectancy is 22.3 years for males and 24.7 years for females.
The expected long-term rate of return for investments is based on the portfolio as a whole and not on individual asset categories.
Thereturn is based exclusively on historical returns, without adjustments which are crossed checked against market expectations fromexternal sources.
The Group expects that contributions to the UK dened benefit plans in 2013 will be at a similar level to contributions paid in2012.
Share-based payments PSP In September 2005 the shareholders approved the PSP.
During the year an award under the PSP was made to the Executive Directors and senior managers, details of which are set out below: Number Number Number Number of awards of awards of awards of awards Number at the granted vested forfeited of awards Fair value beginning during during during at the pence per Vesting Maturity Date of award of year the year the year the year year end share period date April 2009 342,491 341,620 871 56 3 years April 2012 April 2010 208,993 3,091 205,902 186 3 years May 2013 September 2010 37,822 37,822 322 3 years Sept 2013 February 2011 140,078 14,500 125,578 411 3 years Feb 2014 April 2012 79,927 14,402 65,525 684 3 years April 2015 729,384 79,927 341,620 32,864 434,827 Further details of the PSP are included in the Directors remuneration report on pages 42 to 49.

Financial risk management The Group has exposure to credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk from its use of financial instruments.
This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes formeasuring and managing risk.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
TheGroups risk policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies andprocedures and reviews theadequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
Credit risk Trade and other receivables Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer fails to meet its contractual obligations by not paying the receivables due.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is inuenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
Operationally the Group has no significant concentration of credit risk.
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Each new customer isanalysed individually for creditworthiness before the Groups standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered.
The Groups review includes external ratings when available and in some cases bank references.
Purchase limits are set for customers.
Customers that do not meet the benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Group only on a pre-payment basis.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade andotherreceivables.
Impairment losses are determined having taken into account special customer circumstances and financial position, together with Group information about general payment trends.

Other non-trade receivables of 773,000 2011: 265,000 are not past due and have no impairment.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates which affect the Groups income.
Theobjective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.
Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to manage exposure to interest rate risk setting a proportion of any borrowings to a xed rate basis.
Historically interest rate swaps have been considered and entered into.
Currently the Group has no borrowings.
Foreign currency risk Exposure to currency risk arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than each subsidiaries functional currency.
The currencies giving rise to risk are primarily Euro and US Dollars.
Where possible the Group uses natural hedging within the Group to hedge the majority of its foreign currency risk.
Natural hedging is the mechanism whereby the cash inows in a particular currency are matched to the cash outows in that currency atthe same business or different group company.
Foreign exchange contracts may be taken out to manage exposures that are not mitigated through natural hedging.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities held in currencies other than UK Sterling, the Group ensures that the net exposure iskept toanacceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates where necessary to address short-term imbalances.

The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
Exposure to liquidity risk For non-derivative financial liabilities the Groups exposure relates principally to trade and other payables.
Trade and other payables arise in the normal course of business and there are no unusual or onerous terms and conditions.
The following are contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments and excluding the impact ofnettingagreements: 31 December 2012 Carrying Contractual 2 months or 212 000 amount cash ow less months 12 years Non-derivative financial liabilities Trade and other payables 22,417 22,417 22,417 22,417 22,417 22,417 31 December 2011 Carrying Contractual 2 months or 212 000 amount cash ows less months 12 years Non-derivative financial liabilities Trade and other payables 19,136 19,136 17,876 1,260 19,136 19,136 17,876 1,260 www.

Financial risk management continued Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development ofthe business.
The Board considers consolidated total equity as capital.
Our target is to generate a return on capital in excess of 25% excluding cash holdings.
Inaddition, thetarget in respect of EPS is 15% growth per annum.
In respect of dividend, the Board was progressive dividend policy and aims for three times cover.
The Board monitors TSR compared to FTSE SmallCap Index and FTSE Electronics Electrical Index to ensure that Dialights performance is in line with peer companies.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term uctuations on the Groups earnings.
Overthe longer term, however, permanent changes, in particular in foreign exchange rates, would have an impact onequity value andconsolidation earnings.
At 31 December 2012 it is estimated that a general increase of 1% in the value of the Euro and US Dollar against UK Sterling would have reduced the Groups profit before tax by approximately 197,000 for the year ended 31December 2012 2011: 169,000, and would have reduced the Groups equity by approximately 145,000 for the year ended 31 December 2012 2011: 76,000.
