Directors report: Directors report: Overview Financials Business review Governance 59 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 12 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2012 01 General information KCOM Group PLC is a public limited company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The address of the registered office is 37 Carr Lane, Hull HU1 3RE.
The nature of the Groups operations is described within the Business Review on page 10.
02 Accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of accounting The consolidated and Parent company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRS as adopted by the EU, IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Theconsolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through reserves.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in note 3.
Except as described below, the accounting policies applied are consistent with those of the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2011 as described in those annual financial statements.
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 April 2011, but are not currently relevant for the Group: IFRIC 19 'Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments'.
This clarifies the requirements of IFRSs when an entity renegotiates theterms of a financial liability with its creditor and the creditor agrees to accept the entity's shares or other equity instruments to settle thefinancial liability fully or partially.
The interpretation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2010.
Amendment to IFRS 1 'First-time adoption of IFRS - Limited exemption from comparative IFRS 7 disclosures for first-time adopters'.
Theamendment is required to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2010.
IAS 24 revised 'Related party disclosures', issued in November 2009.
It supersedes IAS 24, 'Related party disclosures', issued in 2003.
Therevised IAS 24 is required to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011.
'P repayments of a minimum funding requirement' Amendments to IFRIC 14, issued in November 2009.
The amendments correct an unintended consequence of IFRIC 14, 'IAS 19' - The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction'.
Without the amendments, entities are not permitted to recognise as an asset some voluntary prepayments for minimum funding contributions.
This was not intended when IFRIC 14 was issued, and the amendments correct the problem.
The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2011.
The following improvements to standards are applicable for the financial year beginning 1 April 2011 but do not have a significant impact on the Group: IFRS 1 'First-time adoption', on accounting policies changes: IFRS 7 'Financial instruments': IAS 1 'Presentation of financial statements': IAS 27 'Consolidated and separate financial statements': IAS 34 'Interim financial reporting': and IFRIC 13 'Customer loyalty programmes'.
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not effective for the financial year beginning 1 April 2011 and have not been early adopted: IFRS 1 amendment, 'First-time adoption', on fixed dates and hyperinflation: IFRS 7 amendment, 'Financial instruments: Disclosures' on derecognition: IFRS 9 'Financial instruments': IAS 12 amendment, 'Income taxes' on deferred tax: IAS 19 amendment, 'Employee benefits': IFRS 10 'Consolidated financial statements': IFRS 11 'Joint arrangements': IFRS 12 'Disclosures of interests in other entities': IFRS 13 'Fair value measurement': IAS 27 revised, 'Separate financial statements': IAS 28 revised, 'Associates and joint ventures': and IAS 1 amendment, 'Presentation of financial statements', regarding other comprehensive income.
The amendment to IAS 19 will impact the Group by replacing the interest cost and expected return on assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability.
The Group is yet to assess the full impact of the amendment.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of the other standards and interpretations on the effective date will not have a significant impact ontheGroups financial results.
60 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 12 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2012 02 Accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial andoperating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable orconvertible are taken into account.
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its undertakings made up to 31 March 2012.
The results of new subsidiary undertakings are included from the dates of acquisition using the purchase method of consolidation.
Where a company has ceased to be a subsidiary undertaking during the year, its results are included to the date of cessation.
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess ofthe cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used bythe Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and50% of the voting rights.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost.
The Groups share of its associates profits or losses is recognised in the income statement.
The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment.
Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker CODM.
The CODM, whoisresponsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the KCOM Group PLC Board of Directors.
As described in note 4, the Board assessed that Kcom, Smart421 and Eclipse brands are aggregated together and reported as the 'Kcom' segment.
The remaining brands of KC and the PLC function are reported respectively in the 'KC' segment and 'PLC' segment.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods supplied, stated net of discounts, returns and value added taxes.
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Group's activities, as described below.
The Group bases its estimate of return on historical results, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and the specifics of each arrangement.
Revenue from calls is recognised in the Consolidated income statement at the time the call is made over the Groups network.
Revenue from rentals is recognised evenly over the rental period.
Revenue from product sales is recognised at the point of effective transfer of risk and reward.
Revenue from production of directories is recognised at the point when the directory is published.
Revenue from the long-term network build contract is recognised based on the percentage of completion method.
The stage of completion is estimated using an appropriate measure according to thenature of the contract, being installation or in-life.
For large long-term annuity and multiple element customer contracts the Group is able to distinguish between the installation and the in-life service phases of a contract.
Revenue is allocated based on the fair value of the consideration which represents the market value of such services, or amounts per contracts, and will be recognised on the following basis for each phase: Installation Within this phase revenue relating to people and services is accounted for on a stage of completion basis where revenue is recognised with reference to the proportion of total costs incurred to date.
Revenue related to equipment is accounted for based on the point ofeffective transfer of risks and rewards shipment : and In-life service revenue for this phase is recognised in line with the obligation to provide service as dictated by customer contracts.
Pre-contract costs, such as bid costs, on key contract wins are expensed as and when incurred.
Revenue arising from the provision of other services, including maintenance contracts, is recognised in the accounting period in which services are rendered, by reference to stage of completion of the specific transaction and assessed on the basis of the actual service provided as a proportion ofthe total services to be provided.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide further understanding of the financial performance of the Group.
They are material items of income or expense that have been shown separately due to the significance of their nature or amount.
In particular costs associated with organisational restructuring, costs and provisions associated with onerous contracts, profits or losses on the sale of an operation and pension related curtailment gains are treated as exceptional items.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and is the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses and is tested annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment.
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Directors report: Directors report: Overview Financials Business review Governance 61 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 12 02 Accounting policies continued Intangible assets continued Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing.
The allocation is made to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Development costs An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Groups internal development activities is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met: an asset is created that can be identified such as software and new processes : it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: and the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally generated intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Research costs are expensed to the income statement as and when they are incurred.
Customer and supplier relationships Contractual customer and supplier relationships acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
The contractual customer and supplier relations have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over the expected life of the relationship.
These intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
Technology and brand Technology and brand acquired through business combinations are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Assumptions are used in estimating the fair values of acquired intangible assets and include managements estimates of revenue and profits to be generated by the acquired businesses.
Software Software comprises computer software purchased from third parties and also the cost of internally developed software.
Computer software purchased from third parties and internally developed software is initially recorded at cost.
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group arerecognised as intangible assets when the criteria detailed above is met.
Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs previously recognised asan expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Amortisation Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each intangible asset.
Intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Customer and supplier relationships up to 8 years Technology and brand up to 10 years Software up to 5 years Development costs 1 year Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Network infrastructure and related equipment is recorded at cost including labour costs directly attributable to the cost of the network construction.
Depreciation is provided soas to write off the cost of assets to residual values on a straight-line basis over the assets useful estimated lives as follows: Freehold buildings 40 years Leasehold buildings and improvements period of lease Exchange equipment 10 years External plant 10 to 20 years Vehicles, other apparatus and equipment 3 to 10 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
The residual value, if not insignificant, is reassessed annually.
Depreciation of network infrastructure and related equipment is provided for from the date the network comes into operation.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
62 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 12 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2012 02 Accounting policies continued Fixed asset investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
They are reviewed at each reporting date for possible reversal ofthe impairment.
Impairment of non-financial assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life for example, goodwill are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less selling costs and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised inthe income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Cost is determined using the first in, first out FIFO method.
Costs include raw materials and, where appropriate, direct overhead expenses.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs ofcompletion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items whereappropriate.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and measured subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivablesis established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original termsof the receivables.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, short-term deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities ofthreemonths or less and bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet, unless arightofoffset exists.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax payable is currently based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and or items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised generally for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced or increased to the extent that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly to equity.
In this case the deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
Deferred tax is not discounted.
Financial instruments and hedge accounting Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its Treasury Policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Directors report: Directors report: Overview Financials Business review Governance 63 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 12 02 Accounting policies continued Foreign currency translation Derivative financial instruments are initially and subsequently recognised at fair value.
Any gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of the resultant gain orlossdepends on the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly inother comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised inthe income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred totheincome statement in the period.
These financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated inforeign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Leasing and hire purchase commitments Leases where the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet at their fair value or, if lower, the present value of the future minimum lease payments and are depreciated over their useful economic lives.
The capital elements of future obligations under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged to the income statement over the periods of the leases and hire purchase contracts.
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Bank borrowings and issue costs Bank borrowings are stated at the amount of proceeds after deduction of issue costs, which are amortised over the period of the loan.
Finance charges, including direct issue costs are accounted for in the income statement on an accruals basis and are added to the carrying amount of theinstrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Borrowings are carried subsequently at amortised cost and any differences between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Pensions Defined contribution Obligations for contributions to the defined contribution money purchase scheme are charged to the income statement in the period they fall due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
Defined benefit For defined benefit retirement schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using a building block approach, with actuarial valuations beingcarried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur and are recognised in equity and presented in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The current and past service costs of the scheme the increase in the present value of employees future benefits attributable to the current or priorperiods are charged to the income statement in the period.
The cost or benefit of committed settlements and curtailments is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The interest cost of the scheme the expected return on scheme assets, less interest on scheme liabilities isrecognised in the income statement in the period to which it relates.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Employee share schemes and share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 April 2005.
The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity settled employee schemes, including employee share options and discretionary long-term incentive schemes, provide employees with the option to acquire shares of the Company.
Employee share options and long-term incentive schemes are generally subject to performance or service conditions.
64 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 12 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2012 02 Accounting policies continued Employee share schemes and share-based payments continued The fair value of equity settled share-based payments is measured at the date of grant and charged to the income statement over the period during which performance or service conditions are required to be met, or immediately where no performance or service criteria exist.
The fair value of equity settled share-based payments granted is measured using either the Black Scholes or Monte Carlo model, depending on the terms under which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of employee share options that vest, except where forfeiture is only due to market-based performance criteria not being met.
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The Group also operates a Share Incentive Plan SIP under which employees have the option to purchase shares in the Company each month and offers employees free matching and partnership shares on a sliding scale of between 1:3 to 2:1.
The Group recognises the free shares as an expense over the period of any applicable service condition, or immediately when no service condition exists.
Dividends Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders or, in the case of interim dividends, paid.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present, legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and itisprobable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined bydiscounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, whereappropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
03 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty Impairment of non-current assets Determining whether a non-current asset is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use and or the estimated recoverable amount of the asset derived from the business, or part of the business, CGU, to which the non-current asset has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires an estimate of the present value of future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU, by applying an appropriate discount rate to the timing and amount of future cash flows.
The Directors are required to make judgements regarding the timing and amount of future cash flows applicable to the CGU, based on current budgets and forecasts, and extrapolated for an appropriate period taking into account growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and operating costs.
The Directors estimate the appropriate discount rate using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the individual CGU.
Intangible assets arising on acquisition In determining the fair value of intangible assets arising on acquisition the Directors are required to make judgements regarding the timing andamount of future cash flows applicable to the businesses being acquired, discounted using an appropriate discount rate.
Such judgements are based on current budgets and forecasts, extrapolated for an appropriate period taking into account growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and operating costs.
The Directors estimate the appropriate discount rate using pre-tax rates that reflect currentmarket assessments of the time, value of money and the risks specific to the businesses being acquired.
Post-employment benefits The Group operates two defined benefit schemes.
All post-employment benefits associated with these schemes have been accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 Employee benefits.
As detailed within the accounting policies note, in accordance with IAS 19, all actuarial gains andlosses have been recognised immediately through the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
For all defined benefit pension schemes, pension valuations have been performed using specialist advice obtained from independent qualified actuaries.
In performing these valuations, judgements, assumptions and estimates have been made.
These assumptions have been disclosed within note 30.
Share-based payments The Company provides share-based payments under five separate schemes.
In accordance with IFRS 2, share options are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined is then expensed in the Consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in equity.
The valuation of these share-based payments requires several judgements to be made in respect of the number of options that are expected tobeexercised.
Details of the assumptions made in respect of each of the share-based payment schemes are disclosed in note 13.
Provisions Using information available at the balance sheet date, the Directors make judgements, based on experience, on the level of provision required tosatisfy all onerous lease and dilapidation commitments, to account for potential uncollectable receivables, to account for the potential forunsaleable inventories and to account for known restructuring costs and known restructuring costs relating to employees.
Deferred taxation The amount of the deferred tax asset included in the balance sheet of the Group is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
In estimating the amount of the deferred tax asset that may be recognised the Directors make judgements, based on current budgets and forecasts, about the amount of future taxable profits and the timing of when these will be realised.
The asset is unwinding as there are taxable profits against which the asset is utilised.
04 Segmental analysis Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the KCOM Group PLC Board that are used to make strategic decisions.
The chief operating decision maker of the Group is the KCOM Group PLC Board.
The Board considers the performance of the four brands and the PLC function in assessing the performance of the Group and making decisions about the allocation of resources.
These are the Groups operating segments.
Directors report: Directors report: Overview Financials Business review Governance 65 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 12 04 Segmental analysis continued The KC brand addresses the needs of our Hull and East Yorkshire customers and the Eclipse, Kcom and Smart421 brands serve enterprise, public sector organisations and small business markets across the UK.
The Board assessed that the Kcom, Smart421 and Eclipse brands have similar profiles offering similar products and services, similar production and distribution processes and are operating in a consistent regulatory environment.
In line with IFRS 8, the Kcom, Smart421 and Eclipse brands are aggregated together and reported as the Kcom segment for the year ended 31 March 2012.
The remaining brands of KC and the PLC function arereported respectively in the KC segment and PLC segment.
This reporting is also consistent with the reporting to the KCOM Group PLC Board.
For the year ended 31 March 2011, the Group considered the brands KC and Eclipse and the brands Kcom and Smart421 as two reporting segments presented as KC & Eclipse and Kcom & Smart421.
In the year ended 31 March 2012, the Eclipse brand has become increasingly focused on the national SME business market and has increased its level of cross-over with the customer bases of the Kcom brand.
Segmental disclosures for 31 March 2011 have been restated to reflect the change in the allocation of the Eclipse brand from the 'KC' segment into the 'Kcom' segment.
PLC includes Public Company central and share scheme expenses, inter-segment eliminations and the costs, excluding current and past service costs, associated with the Groups defined benefit pension schemes and the related assets and liabilities.

None of the revenue, operating profit or net operating assets arising outside the United Kingdom are material to the Group.
The Group is not dependent upon a single or small number of external customers.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates and growth rates.
The Directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the individual CGU.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts using the current operating budget approved by the Directors which covers a five-year period and an appropriate extrapolation of cash flows beyond this.
The carrying amount of goodwill of 85,272,000 2011: 85,272,000 has been allocated across multiple CGUs as follows: CGUs 000 Eclipse 7,862 Kcom 72,324 Smart421 5,086 At 31 March 2012 85,272 An impairment review was undertaken at the year end in accordance with IAS 36 and no impairment was required.
Furthermore, this review indicates that a reasonable possible change in a key assumption would not remove any remaining headroom in the impairment calculation.

All of the Groups receivables are due within one year in both 2012 and 2011.
An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods and services of 3,013,000 2011: 4,670,000.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximate to their fair value.
Movements on the Group provision for impairment of trade receivables are as follows: 2012 000 At 1 April 2011 4,670 Written off in the year 1,019 Unused amounts reversed 784 Amounts provided for in the year 146 At 31 March 2012 3,013 The majority of the Groups trade and other receivables are denominated in Sterling.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash balances and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is attributable primarily to its trade receivables for which an allowance has been made for the estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivable mentioned above.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
The individually impaired receivables mainly relate to customers who are in unexpectedly difficult economic situations.
It was assessed that a portion of the impaired balance is expected to be recovered.
These relate to a number of independent customers of whom there is no recent history of default.
The ageing analysis of these trade receivables is as follows: 2012 2011 000 000 0 3 months 4,211 5,573 3 6 months 1,512 2,269 6 months 5,723 7,842 76 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 12 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2012 20 Trade and other payables Consolidated Parent company 2012 2011 2012 2011 Notes 000 000 000 000 Current Obligations under finance leases and hire purchase contracts 23 136 392 Trade payables 50,418 42,673 Other taxes and social security costs 5,627 6,640 Other payables 5,482 4,833 Accruals 47,867 48,025 Deferred income 34,604 40,465 Total 144,134 143,028 Non-current Other payables 388 Finance leases 135 Amounts due to subsidiary undertakings 423 Total 388 135 423 Trade payables and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of current liabilities approximates to their fair value.

The bank borrowings are fully repayable in July 2015 and attract an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin dependent on specific covenants.
Forfurther information on interest rate swaps see note 28.
The Directors consider that the carrying value of bank borrowings approximates fair value as the interest rates on the borrowing are linked to the UK bank base rate.

The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Groups operations, to manage the interest rate risk arising from its sources of finance and to minimise the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on future cash flows.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as short-term receivables and payables which arise directly from its operations.
The Group regularly reviews its exposure to interest, liquidity and foreign currency risk.
Where appropriate the Group will take action, in accordance with a Board approved Treasury Policy, to minimise the impact on the business of movements in interest rates and currency rates.
The Group only enters into derivative instruments with members of the banking group to ensure appropriate counterparty credit quality.
Liquidity risk The Group keeps its short, medium and long-term funding requirements under constant review.
Its policy is to have sufficient committed funds available to meet medium-term requirements, with flexibility and headroom to make minor acquisitions for cash if the opportunity should arise.
The Groups bank facilities comprise a multi-currency revolving credit facility of 200.0 million, provided by a group of six core relationship banks.
The facility matures in July 2015.
The Group considers that this facility will provide sufficient funding to meet the organic investment needs of the business.
In addition, short-term flexibility of funding is available under the 10.0 million overdraft facility provided by the Groups clearing bankers.
The net debt position of 82.0 million at the beginning of the financial year has decreased during the year to net debt of 75.3 million.
The Group generated positive cash flow from its operating activities after capital expenditure of 34.8 million for the year 2011: 54.1 million.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
Notional interest is included for the period from the year end uptothecontractual maturity date of the debt, calculated on the amount of debt drawn down at the year end.

The weighted average fixed interest rate payable was 4.90% 2011: 5.5%.
The weighted average rate of current interest rate swaps in place at the year end was 2.71%, based on new interest rate hedging arrangements from 5 January 2012, on 60.0 million of debt.
Maturity dates of the current interest rate swaps are all July 2015 and reflect the forecast profile of net debt over the period.
The weighted average period over which the interest rates are fixed is 3.3 years 2011: 0.8 years.
Interest rate exposures will continue to be hedged in accordance with the Treasury Policy.
The impact of an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points is shown in the following table: 2012 2011 000 000 Reduction in profit before tax 154 9 Increase in fair value of derivatives taken to equity 2 9 The sensitivity of profit before tax is calculated based on floating rate borrowings at the balance sheet date, after deducting floating rate financial assets and amounts hedged into fixed rates by interest rate swaps.
Foreign currency risk Cash flow exposure The Groups only major foreign currency risk arises due to the purchase of equipment invoiced in US Dollars.
Whenever possible the Group resells this equipment in US Dollars.
The remaining exposure is managed principally through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts in order to minimise the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on future cash flows and gross margin.
The Group has also some Euro cash flows but these are not material on a net basis and are not hedged.
Net asset exposure The Dollar denominated trading described above results in a balance sheet exposure since debtor days are longer than creditor days.
It is the Groups policy not to hedge this exposure.
If Sterling strengthened by 5% against both the US Dollar and the Euro this would reduce net assets atthe balance sheet date by 134,179 2011: reduced by Nil.
Credit risk Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments, as well as credit exposures to business and retail customers.
Credit ratings of institutions which hold the Groups financial assets are regularly monitored to ensure they meet the minimum credit criteria set bythe Board through the Group Treasury Policy.
At the year end all the institutions holding the Groups financial assets were rated AAor higher by Standard and Poors.
The credit quality of customers is assessed by taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors.
Individual risk limits areset and the utilisation of credit limits monitored regularly.
Currency and interest rate risk profile of financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets The Group had financial assets of 8.3 million at the year end 2011: 6.5 million, comprising cash on overnight money market deposits and cash at bank.
This attracts floating rates of interest.
The currency profile of the Groups financial assets at 31 March 2012 and 31 March 2011 was: 2012 2011 000 000 Currency Sterling 6,706 5,660 US Dollar 1,357 660 Euro 270 215 Total 8,333 6,535 Foreign currency cash balances are held on a short-term basis to fund cash flow requirements in these currencies.
At the year end 1.3 million 2011: 1.3 million of cash collateral was held by Barclays in respect of a bank guarantee given under OFCOMs Funds for Liabilities regulations.
Financial liabilities The currency and interest rate risk profile of the Groups financial borrowings at 31 March 2012 and 31 March 2011 was: 2012 2011 Floating Fixed Total Floating Fixed Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Sterling 23,464 60,136 83,600 8,004 80,527 88,531 Undrawn committed borrowing facilities at the year end were 115.0 million 2011: 110.0 million.
Interest on amounts drawn under the committed borrowing facility is based on the relevant LIBOR plus margin.
82 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 12 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2012 28 Financial instruments and risk management continued Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The mark to market value of the interest rate swaps and forward contracts at 31 March 2012 was a liability of 3.8 million 2011: liability of 3.7million.
Interest rate swaps are accounted for by adjusting the interest cost on the floating debt return.
The fair value of financial assets andfinancial liabilities is obtained from third party sources.
The movement in mark to market value is reflected in reserves and is shown below: 000 Hedging reserve 31 March 2011 2,883 Movement in the year 62 31 March 2012 2,945 The effectiveness of the interest rate swaps was tested quarterly throughout the period, and at the year end, and all are considered to be effective cash flow hedges.
There are no other significant differences between the fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities and their book value.
IFRS 7 requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 : inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices level 2 : and inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.
All of the Groups financial instruments fall into hierarchy level 2.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, support the growth ofthebusiness and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of its gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including current and non-current borrowings as shown in the Consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.
Total capital is shown in the table below and is calculated as equity as shown in the Consolidated balance sheet plus net debt.
2012 2011 000 000 Net debt 75,267 81,996 Total equity 73,457 73,194 Total capital 148,724 155,190 Under the Groups 200 million revolving credit facility the Group is required to comply annually with certain financial and non-financial covenants.
The Group is required to maintain a minimum interest cover ratio and a maximum net debt: EBITDA ratio.
Both financial covenants were tested and complied with throughout the year and at the year end.
The Board monitors both covenant compliance and net debt performance on a regular basis.

There are also no restrictions imposed by the Groups lease arrangements.
30 Retirement benefit obligation consolidated Defined contribution schemes The Company operates defined contribution schemes, which are open to all eligible employees.
Contributions charged to the income statement inrespect of defined contribution schemes amounted to 3.5 million 2011: 2.9 million.
Defined benefit schemes The principal defined benefit scheme at 31 March 2012 was the Kingston Communications Pension Scheme, which is a funded scheme and provides defined benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from the assets of the Group in trustee administered funds.
The Company operates also a second funded defined benefit scheme, the Kingston Communications Data Pension Scheme.
Both schemes are closed to both new members and future accrual.
Parent company At 31 March 2011, the Parent company ceased to be the principal employer of both of the Groups defined benefit schemes, with KCH Holdings Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent, becoming responsible for all obligations and liabilities of the schemes.
As a result of this, the outstanding liability to the schemes at that date was released to the profit and loss account of the Parent company.
An equivalent liability has beenprovided in the accounts of KCH Holdings Limited.
At the same time as ceasing to be the principal employer, the Parent company provided a guarantee to both defined benefit schemes, whereby ifKCH Holdings Limited is unable to meet its obligations to the schemes, such obligations would be met by the Parent company.
No liability has been recognised in respect of the guarantee at 31 March 2012 2011: Nil.

Shortly before the current financial year end the Group made an accelerated payment of 10.0 million to the Group's defined benefit pension schemes.
This comprised a 6.9 million advance payment of previously committed deficit contributions in respect of the financial year ended 31 March 2013 and an additional one-off contribution of 3.1 million.

Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the scheme as at 31 March 2012.
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables, which allow for future improvements in life expectancy.
The effect of these tables are that: a future pensioner aged 65 at retirement will live on average to age 88.9 2011: 88.7 if they are male and on average to age 90.8 2011: 90.4 ifthey are female: and a current pensioner aged 65 will live on average to age 87.1 2011: 86.8 if they are male and on average to age 89.0 2011: 88.6 if they are female.
The defined benefit obligation reflects the assumption that 20% 2011: 20% of deferred members will transfer out of the scheme over its life.
Wheresuch transfers take place, the value of such transfers are assumed to be 0% 2011: 0% above the current IAS 19 value for individual members.

During the year ended 31 March 2011, the curtailment and settlement gain arose from the closure of the Groups two defined benefit schemes to future accrual and breaking the salary link.
