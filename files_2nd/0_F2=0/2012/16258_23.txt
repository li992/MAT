These changes have been made to make UBMs financial statements less complex and more relevant to shareholders.
Notes are grouped under eight sections: Basis of preparation, Segment information, Operating profit and tax, Financial position, Capital structure and financial policy, Acquisitions and disposals, Employee benefits and Other notes.
Each section sets out the accounting policies applied in producing these notes together with any key judgments and estimates used.
The purpose of these changes is to provide readers with a clearer understanding of what drives the financial performance of the Group.
Text in boxes provides further explanatory information on each section where necessary.
