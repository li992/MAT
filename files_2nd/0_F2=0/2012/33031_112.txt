Taxation continued $ million Analysis of movements during the year in the net deferred tax liability 2012 2011 At 1 January 14,467 10,380 Exchange adjustments 33 55 Charge for the year on profit 109 5,149 Credit for the year in other comprehensive income 448 1,649 Charge credit for the year in equity 4 7 Acquisitions 11 692 Reclassified as assets liabilities held for sale 48 140 Deletions 32 13 At 31 December 14,190 14,467 Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized.
At 31 December 2012, the group had approximately $6.8 billion 2011 $4.6 billion of carry-forward tax losses that would be available to offset against future taxable profit.
A deferred tax asset has been recognized in respect of $6.0 billion of these losses 2011 $3.8 billion.

In 2012 no current tax benefit arose relating to losses utilized on which a deferred tax asset had not previously been recognized 2011 $0.1 billion.
Substantially all the tax losses have no fixed expiry date.
At 31 December 2012, the group had approximately $19.0 billion of unused tax credits, predominantly in the UK and US 2011 $18.2 billion.
At 31 December 2012, a deferred tax asset of $0.7 billion has been recognized in respect of unused tax credits 2011 $2.5 billion.

The UK tax credits, arising in overseas branches of UK entities, with no associated deferred tax asset, amount to $16.0 billion 2011 $13.0 billion and have no fixed expiry date.
These credits arise in branches predominantly based in high tax rate jurisdictions so are unlikely to have value in the future as UK taxes on these overseas branches are largely mitigated by the double tax relief on the overseas tax.
The US tax credits with no associated deferred tax asset, amounting to $2.3 billion 2011 $2.7 billion, expire 10 years after generation and will all expire in the period 2014-2021.
The group had other unrecognized deferred tax assets at 31 December 2012 of $1.8 billion 2011 $1.1 billion, of which $1.3 billion arose in the UK 2011 $0.9 billion, which have not been recognized due to uncertainty over future recovery.
The group recognized significant costs in 2010 in relation to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and in 2011 recognized certain recoveries relating to the incident as well as further costs.
In 2012, the group has recognized further costs, including costs relating to the settlement of all criminal and securities claims with the US government which are not tax deductible.
Tax has been calculated on the expenditures that are expected to qualify for tax relief, and on the recoveries, at the US statutory tax rate.
A deferred tax asset has been recognized in respect of provisions for future expenditure that are expected to qualify for tax relief, included under the heading decommissioning, environmental and other provisions in the table above.
The other major components of temporary differences at the end of 2012 relate to tax depreciation, provisions, US inventory holding gains classifiedas other taxable temporary differences and pension and other post-retirement benefit plan deficits.
During 2012, our method of accounting, for tax purposes, for oil and gas inventory in the US has changed from the last-in first-out LIFO basis to the firstin first-out FIFO basis.
This has accelerated the taxation of inventory holding gains and reduced the taxable temporary difference in respect of this item.
At 31 December 2012, the group had $0.5 billion 2011 $0.1 billion of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and equity-accounted entities for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized on the basis that the group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is not probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.
In 2012, legislation to restrict relief for UK decommissioning expenditure in the North Sea from 62% to 50% was enacted and increased the deferred tax charge in the income statement by $289 million, of which $256 million relates to the revaluation of the deferred tax balance at 1 January 2012.
In 2011, the enactment of a 12% increase in the UK supplementary charge on oil and gas production activities in the North Sea raised the overall corporation tax rate applicable to North Sea activities to 62%.
This rate change increased the deferred tax charge in the 2011 income statement by $713 million, of which $683 million related to the revaluation of the deferred tax balance at 1 January 2011.
Also in 2012, the enactment of a further 2% reduction in the rate of UK corporation tax to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013 on profits arising from activities outside the North Sea reduced the deferred tax charge in the income statement by $165 million.
