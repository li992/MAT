The shares currently held in the Groups Employee Benefit Trust and in treasury are excluded from both net assets and the number of shares.
Adjusted net assets per share include the effect of those shares issuable under employee share option schemes and the effect of alternative valuation methodology assumptions see note 14.
It has also been adjusted for the Groups estimate of capital goods scheme repayments due to it following the proposed introduction of VAT on self storage from 1 October 2012.
As described in note 14, the investment property valuations have been adjusted to reflect the impact of VAT being introduced, and the Board considers it appropriate to reflect the estimated amounts due back to the Group from HMRC following the introduction of VAT in the calculation of adjusted net assets per share.
This amount, which is subject to agreement with HMRC, cannot be recognised as an asset at the balance sheet date as the legislation to introduce VAT had not been substantially enacted at 31 March 2012.
