OVERVIEW OUR PERFORMANCE OUR IMPACT ON SOCIETY GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Section 6 Financial statements 127 11.
Intangible assets continued Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill continued The recoverable amount of each CGU is based on value in use calculations.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually.
Other than goodwill there are no intangible assets with indefinite lives.
The goodwill is generally denominated in the currency of the relevant cash flows and therefore the impairment review is not materially sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations.
In 2011, following a reorganisation within the International Education business the CGUs were re-analysed into Emerging Markets, UK and Rest Of World to align with the management and reporting structure.
The goodwill was reallocated accordingly using a relative value approach except where goodwill is directly attributable to one of the new CGUs, in which case the goodwill was specifically allocated to the relevant CGU.
Key assumptions The value in use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period.
The key assumptions used by management in the value in use calculations were: Discount rate The discount rate is based on the risk-free rate for government bonds, adjusted for a risk premium to reflect the increased risk in investing in equities.
The risk premium adjustment is assessed for each specific CGU.
The average pre-tax discount rates used are in the range of 9.8% to 12.7% for the Pearson Education businesses 2011: 10.7% to 13.3% and 11.5% to 18.4% for the FT Group businesses 2011: 11.6% to 17.9%.
Perpetuity growth rates A perpetuity growth rate of 2.0% was used for cash flows subsequent to the approved budget period for all CGUs in 2012 2011: 2.0%.
This perpetuity growth rate is a conservative rate and is considered to be lower than the long-term historic growth rates of the underlying territories in which the CGU operates and the long-term growth rate prospects of the sectors in which the CGU operates.
Cash flow growth rates The cash flow growth rates are derived from managements latest forecast of sales taking into consideration experience of operating margins achieved in the CGU.
Historically, such forecasts have been reasonably accurate.
Sensitivities The Groups impairment review is sensitive to a change in assumptions used, most notably the discount rates, the perpetuity growth rates and expected future cash flows.
Based on the Groups sensitivity analysis, a reasonably possible change in any of these assumptions is unlikely to cause an impairment in any of the CGUs.
