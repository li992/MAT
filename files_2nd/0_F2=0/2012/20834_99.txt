Long-term employee incentive schemes continued The assets, liabilities, income and costs of the ESOT are incorporated into the consolidated financial statements.
The ESOT waives the right to dividends on ordinary shares in excess of 0.01 pence per each share ranking for an interim or final dividend.
v Fair value of options and awards At 31 December 2012, the weighted average fair values of options and awards granted during the year were 58.14 pence per option and 131.94 pence per award respectively 2011: 29.49 pence and 163.22 pence.
The Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used to determine the fair value of the option grants and share awards listed above.
The assumptions used in the model are as follows: 2012 2011 Weighted average share price on grant pence 361.83 346.66 Weighted average exercise price pence 281.79 271.86 Expected volatility 30.00% 30.00% Expected life years 3.00 5.25 3.00 7.50 Risk free rate of return 1.00% 5.00% 1.50% 5.00% Expected dividend yield 4.50% 7.00% 2.00% 7.00% Volatility The volatility of Amlin plcs share price is calculated as a normalised standard deviation of the log of the daily return on the share price.
In estimating 30% volatility, the volatility of return for six months, one year and three year intervals are considered.
As a guide to the reasonableness of the volatility estimate similar calculations are performed on a selection of Amlins peer group.
Interest rate The risk free interest rate is consistent with government bond yields.
Dividend yield The assumptions are consistent with the information given in the report and accounts for each relevant valuation year.
Staff turnover The option pricing calculations are split by staffing grades as staff turnover is higher for more junior grades.
Furthermore, historical evidence suggests that senior employees tend to hold their options for longer whereas more junior levels within the organisation appear to exercise earlier.
In addition, senior employees hold a larger proportion of the options but represent a smaller group of individuals.
Market conditions The Group issues options that include targets for the Groups performance against a number of market and non-market conditions.
Failure to meet these targets can reduce the number of options exercisable.
In some circumstances no options may be exercised.
Assumptions are made about the likelihood of meeting the market and non-market conditions based on the outlook at the time of each option grant.
b Capital Builder Plan The Group rewards senior underwriters through payments under the Capital Builder Plan the Plan if they achieve performance below the target loss ratio for their class es of business or business area over the five year period of each award under the Plan.
Under the scheme rules, the Group has the option to settle the awarded bonus in the shares of the Company or as a cash payment.
Provision for payments of an award under the Plan is calculated every year where actual profits exceed the target profit on a cumulative basis over the performance period to date under the Plan.
The rate of accrual for each five year performance period is determined at the start of the period reflecting the share of the excess return payable and committed under the terms of the Plan.
Under this approach, the services received and the related liability are recognised as the services are rendered, in that the liability at any point in time for the Plan reflects the level of actual performance by underwriters in relation to the target.
The carrying amount of the liability under the Plan at 31 December 2012 is 4.1 million 2011: 3.4 million and is recorded in other payables.
